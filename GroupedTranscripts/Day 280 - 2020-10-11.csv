CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.      Are you ready?    Yes let us start.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    What is the page?    I see there is a handwritten pagination as well as a red pagination with the right numbers.    Oh 715 I have got.  Yes.    Well I must just say also that that    Has a context.    And the context is that I think on the same day if I am not mistaken but at some stage early this year when there was appearance for Mr Zuma his counsel argued that previously it had been said that dates – he would appear – that is Mr Zuma on dates to be arranged and they had construed that to mean it would be days that would be agreed with them.    I made it clear on that occasion when they were they appearing that that is not what was meant.    What was meant was the dates would be arranged within the commission and that I – I decide dates.    I have occasion to look at the transcript of that – of that date and counsel for Mr Zuma accepted and understood that explanation and had no problem with it.    He just said that previously they had understood it differently. So the question of this commission not agreeing dates with the lawyers and witnesses was dealt with at that time.  And it was accepted that the commission will fix dates and obviously if Mr Zuma has a problem with the particular dates that have been fixed he could bring an application and show that he has got good reasons not to be available and then if I am satisfied obviously I would change the dates.  So that is the context.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Yes I think – I think it is important for you to read that section that gives me that power.    For the benefit of everybody.    Yes.    On – on the wording of that section it seems quite clear that as long as a summons – as long as there is a summons is issued for the purposes – for the purpose of ascertaining a matter relating to the subject of the commission’s investigations.  That is enough.    That is the only requirement.    For example it does not have to be shown that the person who is being summoned does not cooperate or cooperates.  It is enough if…    There is a matter that the commission seeks to ascertain that relates to a subject of its investigation.  Obviously if a person is not cooperating there is even stronger ground.    For that.  But it seems that even without knowing whether somebody will cooperate or will not cooperate if the commission is satisfied that that person has information that relates to a matter that is the subject of its investigations the commission may summon that person.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Of course if one says, is there a matter that this commission seeks to ascertain from Mr Zuma that relates to the subject of its investigation we have got to deal with that as well.   Because – to show whether this requirement of the statute is complied with – is present.  And one way of doing so I guess would be to go to the Terms of Reference.    Ja okay.    Ja.    I think – I think we should – we should do that – you should do that at least those that may appear relevant.    Well of course the passage that you read relates to the observance of the Audi Alteram Partum Rule.    Now one should not take that part too far because the Audi Alteram Partum Rule is there for the benefit to – for the benefit of the person who may be adversely affected by my decision.  He has a right to wave that right to say well I do not want to be heard.  That he has a right to do and I cannot force him for purposes of observing that right but where I can force him as I understand the law is where I believe that he has information that may assist the commission in its investigation but then in that case I am forcing him not for purposes of hearing his side of the story I am forcing him in order to do my work to investigate the issues that I am supposed to investigate.  So as I understand the position  1. I need to observe the Audi Alteram Partum Rule until such time that I am satisfied that he is not interested in being afforded that opportunity.  But the fact that he is not interested in being afforded that opportunity does not preclude me from saying come I want to know certain issues that you are appear to have knowledge about.    And it is in regard to that certain part it seems to me where he cannot say leave me alone I am not interested in being heard by you.    I mean there can be no doubt that if on information available to me or evidence submitted to the commission by other witnesses there can be no doubt that if I form a view that a particular person may have knowledge or does have knowledge of matters that are relevant to what I am investigating I must take steps to get that person to come and testify.    If I do not do that I would be failing in my duty.    It seems to me that the position is if Mr Zuma or anybody who is said to be implicated by a witness, a certain witness is served by the commission with a Rule 3.3. Notice to say here is a statement from a witness who seems to implicate you in wrongdoing that the commission is investigating.  I mean that notice in terms of the Rules of the Commission advises the recipient of a Rule 3.3 Notice that you have a right to apply to the commission for Leave to Cross-examine this witness.  You have a right to apply to the commission for Leave to give evidence yourself and contradict whatever the witness is saying.  You have a right to apply to the commission for Leave to call witnesses who can corroborate what you say – your story.   It explains all of those things.  But you are not forced to make those applications.    You are free to say I am not going to make that application – those applications.  Those people can implicate me as much as they want, that is fine.  But once the commission says we are aware that you do not think you are implicated; we are aware that you have chosen not to apply for Leave to Cross-examine these witnesses but nevertheless we want you to come and answer questions provided the commission has grounds to believe that you may have knowledge of matters that are – that it is investigating you cannot refuse lawfully.    Obviously if there is a specific reason why you cannot appear on a specific date that is different then you put your case before the commission to say, on that date – on that date I have to see a doctor. I am not well bla, bla, bla.  If the commission is satisfied that it is a genuine reason it will give another date.   But of course with reference to the recent correspondence from Mr Zuma’s attorneys one of the reasons that have been given recently why Mr Zuma was not prepared to come to the commission on the 21 to    25 September is this one.  It appears in he – the letter of his attorneys dated Tuesday September 1  paragraph 5. “Further we wish to point out that President Zuma is preparing for his much anticipated criminal trial the importance of which cannot be over emphasised.  It is rather unfair to expect President Zuma to simultaneously consider evidence and affidavits of more than 30 witnesses in order to make himself ready to appear before the commission on 21 to 25 September 2020.” And then later on in – in the same letter at    Well on the information…    Provided – on the information provided this is not a case where he was saying the dates that you have given me on which to appear before the commission fall – are the same dates when I must – I am supposed to appear in the High Court for my criminal trial.  That would be different.  That would be different.   But that is not what the letter was saying.  It was simply saying he is busy preparing for his criminal trial.  It does not say when the criminal trial is going to happen.  But in the end even if the criminal trial was going to happen soon he would have to appear before the Commission and then     I am now asking for you to give me more time in order to prepare for the trial     Not to say    Ja.  And you see, as I see it, that particular statement in the letter means that that is a belief that he holds that because he is preparing for this criminal trial, he does not have to come to the Commission.   And if that is so, if he has that believe, how can he come before the Commission at any stage before his trial happens?   Because the closer the... as he approaches the trial dates of the criminal matter, the more time he would want to spend preparing for that criminal trial.     So the question is.  Can that person ever come before the Commission voluntarily before his criminal trial happens?     Yes.     H’m, h’m.  Yes.     Well, I am going to... I was going to go straight to the Terms of the Reference.     Yes.  Well, you could read the relevant parts that refer to him.       Okay.     I think if you go back to... or maybe I can just have a look.  One point one, among others, that is of the     Brics Bank, I think.  But the job never happened.  And I have heard evidence from somebody from the bank who said that is not how the bank... that bank operates.  It has got policies and procedures and Mr Zuma had no say, had no power to force the bank to take Mr Jonas.   Mr Jonas himself said the... his position as Minister of Finance was higher than the position that Mr Zuma was talking about in the bank. And Mr Nene said, actually, the... Mr Zuma’s reason for dropping him, that he was to go to that job, was a fabrication.  That is what Mr Nene said before me under oath here. So the question is.  How come somebody from the Gupta family knew in advanced that Mr Nene was going to be fired?      And Mr Jonas says, at that meeting, the Gupta brother also told him that there are people that they work with and he says one of them is Mr Brian Molefe, another one is Ms Lynne Brown, Minister of Public Enterprise at that time. And when Mr Gordhan gave evidence before the Commission he said he heard that when he was fired in 2017 by Mr Zuma, Mr Zuma told the Top Six of the ANC that he wanted to replace him with Mr Brian Molefe.  And the Commission subsequently asked some members of the Top Six, Mr Gwede Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize and Ms    And Mr Zuma must enlighten the Commission on all of these matters.     H’m.  I mean, I am hearing evidence these days relating to Eskom.  And hearing evidence from Mr Tsotsi and from Mr Nick Linnell.  It is to the effect that, Ms Dudu Myeni called Mr Linnell to Pretoria and said you... I need you to come and meet with the president.  He came.   The president did not meet them then but then he was     And the acting DG at the time says, when the President called her because he said he could not find the minister or deputy minister.       I cannot ignore these things when I asked     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     Ja, is replete.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I mean, there was evidence by some of the people who were senior officials within the Intelligence community that their departments had... or units had conducted certain investigations of criminal nature.   And the minister serving under Mr Zuma or State Security, Dr Cwele called one of them to a meeting at the airport where he told them, according to the evidence placed before me that President Zuma had said that the investigation should be stopped.  I need to look to all of those things.     How can I ignore those things?     How can I ignore all of those things?  And all I am doing, I am doing my job to establish exactly what happened.     So that I can prepare reports that is based on evidence that has been presented by cross-section of people.  And if he is implicated, I am giving him an opportunity to come here and clear his name.   But I want to know what he has to say about those things.  He might he does not want to clear his name.  That is fine.   But I want to know what he knows about the things that have been said.       Well, in terms of the agreement that was reached on the 19t h of July, when he was before the Commission, you were... the legal team of the Commission were required to furnish his lawyers within, I think, two weeks with a document that would indicate the areas of interest in the various affidavits that he had to focus on and responding.  And the agreement was that, as far as I can recall, once you had furnished his lawyers with such a document, which you did around, I think, on the 30t h of July.     Oh.     Or first week, ja.     Yes.  Once you had done that...     Yes, I think it was.     Ja, I think a lot of ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Once you had done that, you and Mr Zuma’s counsel were supposed to agree a date by when they would file his affidavit or affidavits.   And if the two of you did not agree, the arrangement was that you would then bring that issue to me and I will decide the timeframe.   Now from what I read, one, they did not file affidavits.  Two, they did not... they do not seem to have reached any agreement with you.   And they promised at some stage, I think from what I read in the correspondence exchanged between yourself and them, that Mr Zuma’s affidavit or affidavits would be filed on the 13t h of September, last year.  That did not happen.   Subsequently, they kept on promising that they would be filed.  They have never been filed.   And no condonation application has been filed and no explanation, as far as I recall, has been proffered to say what is the difficulty to the extent that he may be saying in his affidavit, at a certain stage he fell ill and that impacted the preparation.   It seems that that was long after the deadline had happened.  And there was simply nothing coming from them.     H’m.     Yes.     Of course, Mr Zuma’s might not be here today but they had filed his affidavit opposing this application.  One of the issues that arises is this, when I invited Mr Zuma last year to appear before the Commission from the 15 to the 19 July, they criticised me for inviting him saying that that is not provided any rule saying in terms of what rule are you inviting our client, you know?  And when it was – you know, it was just a courtesy, you know, to say let us not issue a summons because he has promised to cooperate with the Commission, they seemed to have an objection to say why are you not acting in terms of the rules …[intervenes]     Now the legal time has now applied that I should authorise a summons, then they oppose that and say you make it as if he is not cooperating.  So when you act and show courtesy and say come and appear before the Commission without issuing a summons, you are criticised.  When you say okay, let us issue a summons, then you are criticised.     I mean, there are many people who have been requested by the Commission to appear before the Commission and they have never had any hesitation.  We have told, you know, Mr Zuma’s attorneys before – I was looking at the correspondence here, that I told the President, current President that before the Commission finishes its work it would be important that he comes and gives evidence before the Commission because the matters that the Commissioner is looking at, state capture, happened at a time when he was Mr Zuma’s deputy.  The current President had no hesitation, he said you are right, I am going to come.  You tell me when I must come and I will come and I said the ANC must also come and I was told the ANC has no hesitation to come.  The Commission has approached other leaders of the ANC, Mr Mantashe, and asked them to file affidavits without compelling them and they responded by filing affidavits.  Mr Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize, Ms Jessie Duarte, the President himself was asked, without being compelled, to file an affidavit about whether had had any interactions with the Guptas.  He filed his affidavit, he did not have to be compelled.     He did not complain that there was no rule for making such a request.     Ja, I mean, all it seems is I am not supposed to ask him to come, I am not supposed to authorise a summons to be issues to compel him to come, so …[intervenes]     So I guess I am supposed to just fold my hands and not do anything.     I think the one question that I think you will need to deal with is to the – it is two questions, one is whether when the point Section 3.1 says that the Commission has got power to summon witnesses, we know that this Act is a 1947 Act, it is very old, at that time there was only one way of summoning that could happen.  One question is whether that summoning in this day and age would include summoning a witness to appear and give evidence by video link or in any other way that may be done with technology.  I raise that because you will remember that in his attorney’s letters one of the things they say is that because of his age and Covid-19 his doctors have advised him to limit his movement. So the normal way of – when a summons is issued in any court to be served on somebody to appear before that court, it means that that person must physically come to the court. Now the question of Covid-19 may well be something that needs to be looked at.  I do not have a problem if – I will not have a problem if he were to say for Covid-19 reasons I would prefer to give evidence via video link.  As long as he does so within the borders of the Republic and not from outside, I would not have a problem, I have indeed authorised the giving of evidence by some witnesses via video link.  I think one of them was Mr Mkhwanazi who asked when – I do not know which level, at level we were in, said for Covid-19 reasons he was reluctant to travel and he asked if he could give evidence via video link, I authorised that, it happened.  So I could do the same with Mr Zuma if he has a legitimate reason that because of his age.     So – but the question is whether summon witnesses as used in Section 3.1 is wide enough to encompass that meaning.       Of course maybe if it does not, if it not wide enough to encompass that meaning, it may be that the summons might include something to which we will say if he wishes to give evidence via video link and he advises the Commission timeously on those dates then his appearance, via video link, will be deemed to be compliance with the summons.  I am not sure.  What do you say about that issue?     Oh.     No, it is important.     Well, maybe I should adjourn while they are attending to it.     Yes.  We will adjourn for a few minutes.  Hopefully they can sort out the sound quickly.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I understand the sound is back.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius, I just wanted to say – I just wanted to say that the regulations of this Commission, which were promulgated by Mr Zuma when he was President include Regulation 10[6] and Regulation     Yes, yes.       Yes, the one approach may be to take the summoning to be wide enough to include a video link, another approach might be what I said earlier on to have the summoning as it would be in a summons but to have something that says either maybe in the summons that says if the witness, if Mr Zuma through arrangements with the Commission appears via video link on the days that are specified that will be deemed to be compliance with the summons.     Yes, because then it gives him an opportunity that if he has no problem giving evidence but he has a problem because of his age and Covid 19 then that is taken care of, it can’t be advance as a reason for not appearing whereas if that is not done he might say the Covid situation is a good enough reason for me not to appear so but if one – if that is dealt with that way then he can’t advance that, that reason.     Well one of those, I forget which one, was I signed the regulation 10.6 directive, I think on the 28 t h of August.  That may have been the one relating to the affidavit of Mr Tsotsi and so on, or it may have been the one relating to Mr Popo Molefe’s affidavit in evidence about PRASA issues and subsequently I signed another directive requiring Mr Zuma to file affidavits.   So this is different, in the past there was a request in 2018, that request has never been complied with, there was an undertaking that the he would file an affidavit dealing with responding to General Maseku’s evidence and Ms Mentoor ’s evidence.  That has never been filed. Then last year when he appeared before the Commission there was an agreement, you referred to it ...[intervenes]  ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, and agreement that was concluded with him through his lawyers, and which I announced publically and I remember after announcing the terms of that agreement I called upon you and his counsel to confirm that I had correctly recorded the terms and both of you confirmed and he had agreed through his lawyers to file an affidavit, or affidavits responding to various affidavits of witnesses who ...[intervenes]      Yes, that affidavit, those affidavits have never been furnished, so whether you request him to file an affidavit you request him nicely, you don’t get an affidavit.  Whether there is an agreement with his lawyers or an affidavit he will file affidavits, you don’t get those affidavits and now when you issue a directive, because ...[intervenes]      Sorry?     Yes, now the last time I heard was that the directive that I issued on the 28 t h of August compelling him to file an affidavit I cannot remember whether it was in regard to the Eskom matter and the Durban meeting or whether it was in regard to PRASA, but the deadline which had been given the last time I had it had come and gone and he had not filed any affidavit and in regard to another one I suspect that the deadline has come and gone, but I don’t – I haven’t been told whether he has filed an affidavit. So whether you make a request nicely he won’t file an affidavit.  Whether you reach an agreement with him and he undertakes to file an affidavit he won’t file it.  When I issue a directive in terms of the regulations, at least in regard to one he did not file an affidavit within the time that was given and to my knowledge he did not file an application to request an extension of time and in terms of the regulations as amended failure to comply with a directive issued by the Chairperson in terms of Regulation [6] failing to comply with it without sufficient cause is a criminal offence.     It was never done.     Yes, yes.  That is the order I am making.     Yes, you are excused.  We will take a short adjournment and once the witness here for today is ready then I will be called. We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Thank you.  I see Mr Tsotsi is back.    Welcome back Mr Tsotsi.    Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you; you may be seated.    Yes I got it.    Yes I thought you need to …    Get him to explain for the public.    Just because Mr Tsotsi has been here I think he is coming to testify for the commission for the third time now – if not fourth time.  So you have called him especially to deal with certain matters relating to Eskom that he might not have dealt with sufficiently; previously or that you might not have covered or that may have arisen from other witnesses in the meantime.    And you want to put to him some of the things that other witnesses say about him.    Or about some of the matters that he has covered.  I think that is the purpose Mr Tsotsi.    Why you are back.    oh okay.    Hm.    Oh I missed that did – did Ms Daniels say that?    Oh I missed that.  How could I miss that?  Is it in another bundle?    I would like to see that.    Ja have I got it here?  I would like to see it.      What bundle?    Okay.    There is a lot to read and sometimes you miss something.    What paragraph.     “As we were chatting a gentleman walked into the board room and introduced himself as Salim Essa advisor to Minister Brown.” I had missed that.  But apart from the significance that you may attach to it for purposes of these – there is another significance that you might not be aware of that – but that I am aware of that is that if I recall correctly when Minister Mosebenzi Zwane went to Switzerland and met with the CEO of I think Glencore Mines in order when Tegeta wanted to – wanted to preclude some agreement with Glencore it is said that Mr Salim Essa attended that meeting and Mr Ephraim who gave evidence before the commission last year said that he had been told that Mr Salim Essa had intro – or rather that Mr Salim Essa was introduced to the CEO of Glencore as an advisor to Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.   Mr Ephraim’s evidence or affidavit it was not clear whether it was Mr Mosebenzi Zwane who said to the CEO of Glencore this is my advisor or whether it was Mr Salim Essa who said I am the Minister’s advisor.  We have pursued that and obtained an affidavit from the CEO of Glencore in Switzerland who has provided an affidavit to confirm that Ms Salim Essa was introduced to him in that meeting as Minister Mosebenzi Zwane’s advisor.   Although it is not clear I think whether it was Mr Mosebenzi Zwane who said this is my advisor Salim Essa who said this is – I am the Minister’s advisor.  But there is that piece of evidence.  I think that Mr Mosebenzi Zwane has been asked to comment on it.  So that is – that is interesting.  Ja.    Of course I think Mr Salim Essa officially was – I am not aware that he was – he had been appointed as advisor to Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.    But maybe the public does not know but he had been appointed so we will see.    Yes.    Ja well I am sorry.  The Durban is quite clear as far as I am concerned.    On the three executives I mentioned.    Ja.  So I think leave the Durban meeting.  Nobody has talked about a fourth director to be suspended.    Yes and asked you to talk to the board.    Yes.    Hm.    Well I think the – what Mr Seleka picked up is quite important about Mr Essa introducing himself as advisor to the Minister.  But it is also quite important that Ms Daniels says Ms Essa told her about four executives to be suspended and that included the Financial Director.  Because what it means is that on the evidence that has been presented to me so far about the – this issue of the inquiry into the affairs of Eskom and the suspension of executives it is that the first time that anybody seems to have added the Financial Director as one of the executives to be suspended is Mr Essa when he spoke to – he had a meeting with Ms Daniels and Mr Koko.   And the point you make Mr Tsotsi is also quite important that at the end of the Durban meeting the agree – the position was that only three executives were talked about and that the President said Mr Koko – Mr Tsotsi please test this idea with the board and I will talk to the Minister.  Talking to the Minister would have meant that he would have told the Minister about the discussions at the Durban meeting namely that there should be an inquiry at Eskom and that there should be a suspension of three executives.   And you gave evidence previously and said the President even – the former President asked you Mr Tsotsi do you know who the executives are that are to be suspended?   And you confirmed because you said Ms Dudu Myeni had told you. So there was clarity at the Durban meeting that there were three executives to be suspended.  There was clarity who they were and they did not include the Financial Director.  And the former President undertook to convey that to the Minister and then you have the 9t h.  On the 9t h the board had a meeting.  Nobody at that meeting mentioned anything about the fourth director.   Some witnesses I think may have said there was not mention even of suspensions on that meeting because it was short.  But then now – so according to Ms Daniels on the 10t h before the meeting of the 11t h Mr Salim Essa tells her it is four executives to be suspended.  And indeed ultimately four executives are suspended.   It goes back to an issue I raised yesterday with Ms Klein that it looks like certain people were outside of Eskom were making decisions relating to Eskom matters and were making decisions that the board was required to rubber stamp and it would seem that at least in some cases it did rubber stamp some of those decisions.   And it may well be that the persons who were outside of Eskom who were making these decisions were not in government.  But they were deciding who is to be suspended at Eskom; who is going to stay.  I mean you were at the Durban meeting; you met with the former President and there were three executives to be suspended.  Now it may well be that even the former President did not know about this addition of the fourth – fourth director.  Maybe he only heard after.   It may well be that he never knew about the fourth director until the suspension had happened.  You do not know.  We do not know.  Because one could have expected that since in the Durban meeting which you attended with the former President the agreement was that three executives would be suspended.   One would expect that if the President subsequently was subsequently persuaded that there should be a fourth director to be suspended one would have thought that he would have wanted to convey that to you so that you would know that the addition of this other director is with his knowledge.    And he never told you about the fourth director.    No.  Yes Mr Seleka.    I am sorry Mr Seleka.  I just want to mention something Mr Tsotsi.    You may comment on it; you might not comment on it if you want.  It is interesting that how the Financial Director was added to the list of executives to be suspended.  It seems like a mystery even among the board members you know.   But also I mentioned yesterday how Mr Brian Molefe was – was seconded to Eskom is dealt with in a certain way in Doctor Ngubane’s affidavit.  But interestingly he says he does not know how Mr Anoj Singh got added to be seconded to Eskom too as CFO.  So there are lots of things that you do not understand how they would happen.  Ja anyway.     So was the minister the first person to include Finance in the list of areas that were to be investigated?     Nobody else before that had included that portfolio?     Yes, okay.  and in the areas that were discussed at the Durban meeting, Finance was not one of them?     Yes.     The finance portfolio.     But it seems that irrespective of what Ms Daniels says Mr Essa told her on the 10t h of March.  It seems on your evidence that the inclusion of, as far as you know, the inclusion of the financial director in the list of executives to be suspended, is linked to the minister at two levels.   One, because – and you must say if that is not your recollection in terms of what happened – one, because when the minister spoke to the board on the 11t h, she mentioned four areas to be investigated and included Finance which had not been included at the Durban meeting.   And she spoke on the basis that the executives leading those portfolios, those areas, the board should consider suspending them.  That is what at one level.   She is the one who included the Finance portfolio amongst the portfolios to be investigated.  And then two.  Dr Ngubane, on your evidence, told you that it was the minister who wanted the FD to be included.   And you called the minister to verify this and she did not     Yes.  Okay.       Who is speaking there?     Yes, okay.     Oh, okay.     Yes, the milestone achieved.     Ja, the milestone ...[intervenes]      ...that he had achieved.     More than 20-years before.     Yes, about 20-years.     So how do you suspend somebody like that when you say he has done nothing wrong but you suspend him, nevertheless?     It just difficult to understand.     [laughing]     Your voice went down so I could not hear you but now I have a good idea of what you have just done.  [laughing]     You have just done to Mr Tsotsi what you did to Mr Klein yesterday.  [laughing]     DG.     H’m.     Yes, proceed but I do not want to forget this.     It might be something in your plan to the extent that we might not have covered previously with Mr Tsotsi the allegations being made against him by Mr Koko about somebody that Mr Koko says had been suspended and ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Tsotsi wanted the suspension to believe that as well as the allegations of interference in certain tenders or some operational matters.  I think we may have covered them.     But I just want to make sure that if they are not covered, we must make sure that they are covered so that he deals with them.     Ja.     You can do that later.     Just wanted not to forget it.     Ja.  You can carry on with your plan in terms of the questions that you are asking.     To follow the law.     Well, what we will see what ultimately, when all the evidence is in, what will emerge from that evidence.     But at this stage it seems that it is important to note that subject to what Mr Matjila might see if and when he might give evidence here, it seems that he, as Acting CEO of Eskom prior to Mr Matona coming in was amenable to bringing in Regiments to Eskom and seemed to have had some relationship with Mr Salim Essa.  Then comes in Mr Matona in October 2014 succeeding Mr Matjila.  I do not know whether we will hear any evidence about whether Mr – what Mr Matona’s attitude was to Mr Salim Essa and Gupta associates, but he gets removed as Group CEO and a month after he has been removed, the board of Eskom brings in Mr Brian Molefe as Group CEO of Eskom.     Ja.     In terms of the – in terms of the proposed agreement?     With the Guptas, h’m.     Mr Seleka, please do not forget your line of thought and Mr Tsotsi, do not forget the issue but I just want to interpose and say now that Mr Seleka has reminded us of the interaction between – or the interaction involving Ms Molefe, the Financial Director, with Mr Koko as well as Mr Salim Essa and Regiments and Ms Molefe refusing to sign that agreement.     Mr Matjila, no, I am sorry, ja, ja, not - you know, one is Mr Matjila, the other one is Matshela Koko, is it not?     So, sorry, so you can – no, I mean Mr Matjila, not Mr Koko.       Mr Matjila.  It seems to me that there is a possibility that that – her conduct, Ms Molefe’s conduct,  in refusing to sign that agreement and to cooperate with regard to what Mr Salim Essa wanted and what Mr Matjila wanted and what Mr Eric Wood wanted in terms of Regiments may well be the reason why Mr Salim Essa included her in the list of executives to be suspended to the extent that Ms Daniels is correct when she says at the meeting that she had with Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa at Melrose Arch on the 10 March 2015, Mr Salim Essa included the Financial Director, Ms Molefe, among those to be suspended. So it is possible that he may have had something to do with the inclusion of her name because of that experience that Ms Molefe had not cooperated when Mr Matjila wanted her to sign that agreement.     Yes.       Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     She had to be included.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, because to the extent that they had an agenda to loot some money from Eskom, the FD was critical.     Because if the FD does not authorise payments, does not sign, then you will not get money and they may have remembered that the current FD is the type of person who will not agree to the things that we want, therefore she cannot be allowed to remain.     She must be added and then they may have shared that with the Minister of Public Enterprises hence when she speaks to the board she is the first person to include the finance portfolio as one of the areas to be investigated and she articulates the principle according to one or more of the witnesses who have given evidence here.  Although she says she cannot direct the board or instruct the board to suspend these executives, she speaks in support of a principle that says the executives who lead the portfolios that will be investigated, the board should consider suspending them.   I cannot tell you to suspend them, but I will be around.  I will be around, that is what we understand she is says.     And then when – if you then accept the principle that she introduces namely the executives who lead the areas that are going to be investigated, you should consider suspending them, board.     Of course, if finance is going to be investigated as well, the FD must also be suspended.     And that is how it seems the FD comes in.     But on what one hears here, the first person to mention the inclusion of the FD is Mr Salim Essa, somebody who is not at Eskom, somebody who is not in government.     And according to Ms Daniels he presents himself to Ms Daniels as adviser to the Minister of Public Enterprises.  So then the Minister comes to the board with this inclusion of finance as one of the areas to be investigated and therefore the FD must also be suspended.     Then she gets suspended.  When she has left – when the delegation of the board meets with Ms Molefe during her suspension she gave evidence here and said Mr Romeo Kumalo representing the board started off my saying something to the effect that they understood that she had written to the board wanting to discuss a separation package and then she said here under oath she immediately told Mr Kumalo, that is not what I wrote about, my letters did not say that.  I wrote to find out the reasons for this and that and that and that, that is what I wrote about.  I did not write to want to talk about a separation.     Then interestingly on her evidence, Mr Kumalo, despite hearing that she did not write to invite discussions on separation, says to her, according to her, no, you know what, maybe we should talk about separation because this investigation could still take a long time and that is how they end up talking about separation.   Ms Klein, who was here yesterday, said to her knowledge, the board wanted to keep these executives, wanted them to return after the investigation.  So I asked her, when you heard Mr Kumalo saying this to Ms Molefe, who clearly was not talking about leaving and you see your colleague wanting to talk about her leaving, why did you not say what are you talking about?     She could not remember why she did not say that.  So they end up talking about that.  She ultimately after some numerous meetings and exchanges she leaves and then, of course, we know that about two months later or so, Mr Anoj Singh from Transnet gets brought to take her position.     Do you recall a meeting where you and Ms Molefe were not in agreement that it should be held, which was ultimately held without you because she spoke to board members and said it is urgent because that is what she – that is the evidence she gave.  She said you did not want the meeting to be held and you – on that day you – I think you had initially agreed – ja, you had initially agreed that the meeting be held – I think it was going to be held on a Sunday.     If I am not mistaken.  And but at a certain stage on Sunday, which is when the meeting was to take place you – well, either on Sunday or Saturday, maybe the day before, you said no – you called her to say no, the meeting should not continue and she disagreed.  You said you were having a lot of pressure from outside.  I think she did not say that you explained what you meant.     So she did not know what you meant but she ultimately had to talk to other members of the board and the meeting was held without you.  Do you not recall anything like that?     That is because of...?     Yes.     Yes, ja.     Well, of course you did cancel the one for the 26 February.     Because of outside pressure.     No, what I am …[intervenes]     Yes, what I am saying is that to the extent that Ms Molefe says based on her discussion with you, you wanted to cancel the meeting because of outside pressure, there could be an argument that with regard to the meeting of the 26 February you did cancel a board meeting because of outside pressure.     Yes.  Yes, that is the only point I was making.     Ja, ja, ja.  But you say your recollection as far as the other meeting, the meeting that Ms Molefe was talking about, your recollection is that the reason why you wanted to cancel the meeting was because you wanted that the venue be swept first.     To make sure that there will be no leaks.  That was the reason.     Is that so?     Okay, okay.     She did say that you subsequently – the meeting had to be held again because there was an argument that the meeting that they had held, the one you did not attend, was unlawful and she says the one that they held – I do not know whether it was on Tuesday or Monday, but one or two days after the one you did not attend, she said you did attend that one.     And one may expect that maybe in the minutes of that meeting, the one you attended, that there may be something that may have been said about why you were against …[intervenes]     You wanted to cancel this one, those minutes should be sought because I think it would be surprising if at the beginning of that meeting there was no discussion of why that meeting was being held in circumstances where it had been held a day or two before it had to be held, so if those minutes are found one might find that there is something said there.     Ja, okay.     Page 10, red or black numbers?     Okay.       Yes, we did.       Ja.      Yes, carry on what is your estimate of time that you need Mr Tsotsi to be here?      Sorry?     Oh okay.       Now he wants to spoil your plans.      And what are your plans with regard to the other witness?      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.       We might have to release her if you are going to take as long as I think you will with Mr…[intervene]      Tsotsi because we will not be able to sit up to normal time today but was she here yesterday as well?     Yes.      It is just that my recollection was that because I think was it not that Mr Tsotsi meant to be next week, was he meant to be today?      Yes.      Oh today.       Together with her.      It was the two witnesses?     Okay I know that she is not supposed to be long, is it?    Ja, okay no that is alright I think…[intervene]     Yes.       Ja, no, no obviously she would be welcome to stay and listen but I think we will not be able to get to her because we will not sit the whole day.       Ja, we can attend to that at lunchtime.      We will have to arrange another day when she can come.  What is your estimate of how many hours we need with her?     Your morning is how many hours?     Yes, so what we can do I mean if she is one hour it is easy to fit her into a morning before the witness of that day like we could start at nine if it is one hour.  If it is two hours we could bring her in the late afternoon after the witness for the day has finished and she could come in at four or half past four or five then we could sit until six, until seven to try and finish with her.  So I think during lunchtime you can attend to that.        Ja, okay let us continue we will take the lunch adjournment at one and then I would like us to – after lunch you said you might need how much time with Mr Tsotsi?      If you can do 30 minutes that would be much better.      So we finish about half past two.     But we will not be able to go beyond three.      Ja, okay alright, okay let us continue in the meantime.  Mr Tsotsi I do not know about your lunch at home.        Maybe he should buy you a lunch, yes please continue.       And she says it is not true that she called you and asked you to go and attend the Durban meeting to meet with the President.  She says in effect you have been pestering her with calls seeking advice from her on Eskom matters and she says if I am not mistaken Mr Seleka she says there is a third party that you were also using.  She does not disclose the identity of the third party but Mr Seleka is right she says the meeting in Durban was about you and she says Mr Zuma did not attend that meeting.  What do you say to all of these things?            She says that the reason she brought Mr Linnell to the Durban meeting is because the assistance you needed from her was of a legal nature.  You needed a lawyer to deal with the problems relating to you at Eskom particularly that your board wanted to remove you.  At that stage had there been any indication from any board member or from anybody that the board wanted to remove you as far as you know.                 Yes.      And of course Mr Linnell also made it quite clear when he gave evidence here that he was disputing Ms Myeni’s version that the Durban meeting was about you.  He also said that is not true.       Yes, but that is the version that emerges from Ms Myeni’s statement that she seems to have submitted to parliament.  Yes, Mr Seleka.       I am sorry Mr Seleka I missed something what did – is it a statement by Mr Linnell which included something along the lines that the board wanted to remove Mr Tsotsi.           Well okay no that is fine.  I know that even in your removal your being charged later in March seems something very strange to me but it would be even stranger if before the first meeting of the new board if we leave out the induction if before the first meeting of the new board new members wanted to remove the Chairperson who had been part of the previous board.  It would really show that there is really something very strange that was going on.  I mean even before the first meeting of the board they are talking about removing the Chairperson who had been part of the previous board but maybe there were those plans already in place but it would be strange if the former President knew about those rumours or rather it would be strange if the reason why the former President wanted that meeting cancelled because of he had heard about those rumours it would be strange that he would not tell you.          And one would have thought that he would rather have left that issue to the board and to you how you handle it and not interfere.  If the Minister knew anything about it, it would be strange if even after she never said anything and when one reads the affidavit of the acting DG who called you about the cancellation of the meeting her evidence and her affidavit suggest that you were very opposed to the cancellation you wanted reasons why and she says she could not give you reasons and she did not want to tell you that it was the President who wanted the meeting cancelled but ultimately she had to say that that is what she says in her affidavit.   Now if you were aware that the meeting was going to be used by the board or some board members to seek to remove you one would have thought that you would not have been so opposed to a cancelation of that meeting particularly if maybe you were concerned that they could succeed but the way she says you were insisting wanting reasons that is not consistent with somebody who knew anything along the lines that if that meeting was not cancelled there would be a vote of no confidence in you.           Ja, okay.      Yes, no I think you were doing the right thing to put these things to him.      Ja.      Well I think your evidence last time is consistent with what you are saying in the sense that you never said that at the meeting in Durban you were instructed to go and do anything, yes.  Indeed, you actually said towards the end the President, the former President said you go and test this idea with the board.         And he said he would talk to the Minister that you made clear that the evidence of Mr Linnell also does not reflect that there was an instruction that was given to you whether by Mr Zuma or Ms Myeni.  What one gets the picture that emerges is that Ms Myeni and probably Mr Zuma had an idea that there should be in enquiry into the affairs of Eskom and that certain executives should be suspended. Whether that idea emanated from one of them or both or whether it was an idea that originated from somebody else we do not know but that is the idea that was the subject of the Durban meeting and in that Durban meeting they put these proposals these ideas and they were discussed.  You said that you were not opposed to the idea of an enquiry because independently of them you had thought that an enquiry might be a good idea but you said you were opposed initially at least you opposed to the suspension of executives and I think Mr Linnell confirmed that at the Durban meeting you were certainly initially opposed to the idea of the suspension of the executives.  But certainly the evidence does not suggest that you were instructed but you agreed to take these ideas to the board.  Is that right?             Ja.      Okay.       Yes, but what you are also doing is testing his own evidence.      When he denies Ms Myeni’s version you are testing his own evidence because in the end I want to see who is telling the truth.        And it is right that you should test his evidence just as you will test Ms Myeni’s evidence…[intervene]     When she comes here…[intervene]     Or you or somebody else from the legal team but I think we must take the lunch adjournment now.      We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at five past two.      We adjourn.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.    You are not the culprit Mr Tsotsi.  You are not the culprit somebody else is the culprit.      Actually I think there are many people who believe that the failures that we see in a number of SOE’s are precisely because government or politicians continue to interfere in how those SOE’s are run.    If the politicians were to leave the boards and managers of SOE’s to do their job properly and if they were to make sure that that people who are appointed to the boards and the people who are appointed to senior positions in the SOE’s are people who have the expertise and the independence with integrity and leave them alone to run these as businesses as they would run a business.  There – a lot of these SOE’s would perform very well.    Ja well you know I think you may have been one of the witnesses but there have been other witnesses who made it quite clear that in the first years of our democracy and for quite some time after that Eskom was the envy of other similar entities worldwide.  It was held in high regard that is no more.    And – and a lot of people will say it is because politicians interfere in the affairs of these SOE’s and largely they do not allow the managers and the boards to run the businesses of the SOE’s the way they consider appropriate and of course getting the people with the right skills, right experience, integrity and independence is critical you know.  And they are all – so many of the SOE’s are all on the verge of going under.    You know you talk of SAA, you talk of Eskom, you talk of PRASA, you talk of Denel it is – I mean even Denel I heard evidence that once upon a time Denel was also highly regarded internationally.  Ja.  Mr Seleka.    It is maybe Mr Seleka you started too far back because Mr Tsotsi did testify about Mr Maswanganyi last time.  He said he knows him quite well but he said he did not remember him as having been present at the Durban meeting and he said he thought he would have remember if Mr Maswanganyi had been in that meeting.  That was your evidence.  Is that correct?    Yes so – so I am just saying you started too far back.  You should start somewhere else.    Ja.    Yes.    Oh.    But did he admit that he was at the meeting?    In the passages or what?    Well you know Mr Linnell said something which you did not say not necessarily because you – you would have sought to conciliate but it is something that I was going to ask you.  Mr Linnell said in effect there were two meeting in Durban.  He said the first meeting did not involve the former President.  He said it was himself, Ms Dudu Myeni, yourself and he said and Mr Maswanganyi.  And he said he indicated what Mr Maswanganyi’s contribution was mainly with documents and so on at that meeting.  But he said later on you were asked to move to another meeting which is the room where the President joined you.  And he said you must have waited for about five minutes in that other room and then the former President came in.  I asked him whether everybody who had been in the earlier meeting moved to the other room and I think he said yes.  I do not know if he makes – he – Ja I remember I asked him whether Ms Myeni’s son Thalente had also moved and he said yes if I recall correctly.    And I think we asked him about Mr Maswanganhi as well and I think he said yes.    So  1. I want to check with you whether you remember the position as having been that you – there were like two meetings or not?    Okay.    Another room ja.    Okay so I just – I just wanted to…    Indicate that but also to say that according to Mr Linnell everybody who had been in the first meeting moved into the second meeting ja.  Ja. But you are right it is funny that you would not remember.    Having seen somebody that you know so well.    But he denies having taken part in the meeting.    Oh he denied participating in the meeting where the President was sitting?    But the other meeting…    Oh he admits that he was there?    Oh okay.      Well it may well be that Mr Linnell might not have been emphatic about his presence in the second meeting I am not sure.  But at least if Mr Maswanganyi admits that he was – he took part in the first meeting.    That resolves quite something.    Ja.    Actually it might not matter whether he was…    In the second meeting or not.    Yes I think you are right.    Ja.    Yes. But in the end it..    Whether he spoke or he did not speak or I think what is important is that he admits having been in the first meeting.    That resolves quite a large portion.    Sorry.    Ja.    Yes, ja Mr Linnell said that.  He said – he said you seemed an unwilling participant in the meeting.    Ja.  But of course according to Ms Myeni one would not have expected you to look like an unwilling participant because this was a meeting that you had wanted.      Have you got anything to say about Ms Myeni’s version that there was no meeting with the President?    Okay.    And your reason – the reasons you gave in regard to each one and I think at least the first three.  The reasons you gave related to allegations of misconduct.    Well you see that is an important issue that you need to deal with.  Because it starts off with I think both Doctor – with Doctor Ngubane and maybe Ms Klein as well saying that actually you were pushing for the suspension of the executives.  I hope I am not misrepresenting anything.  But I am – that is my recollection certainly from Doctor Ngubane’s evidence.    That they – they were questioning you.  I do not know whether it is on his version that is what happened on the 9t h or but at a certain stage either on the 9t h or the 11t h I think he portrays you as somebody who was pushing for the suspensions and my impression was that bringing in these allegations of misconduct against them may have been misunderstood by them as your way of pushing for their suspension.  Now that is strange when one has regard to the fact that you said when you gave evidence here at the Durban meeting when this idea of the suspension of executives was raised you were opposed to it at least initially.  You were opposed to it.  And Mr Linnell has confirmed that you were opposed to it – the idea of the suspension of the executives.  So – so that is 1.  But then secondly I would say it would be as strange as to why Mr Linnell would go and seek to dig allegations of misconduct against these executives in circumstances where he knew that at the Durban meeting everybody was agreed that it – the suspensions were not going to be based on allegations of misconduct.   Even if he did that for a reason that you – we do not know it seems to me that it would be – that is strange if you even entertained them whatever they are particularly coming from him.  He is not an Eskom person.      He is being brought from outside.  He was at the Durban meeting where it was made quite clear that wrongdoing is not the basis of the suspension of these executives.    So why – why is he going digging up things?  I would have expected your attitude when he – if he told you about such to say, but that has got nothing to do with the suspensions you know that so why are you bringing them in?  What is the relevance?    You see.    So now if he told you about them and you go – you went ahead and entertained them and shared these allegations with the board that seems strange to me to say, why are you doing that because you know that the suspensions are not based on allegations of wrongdoing so what is the relevance of these allega – of telling the board about these allegations?     Suspensions.    Ja.  May – I think I am – I think some witnesses have or maybe – I think Mr Linnell might have …    Oh is that so.    Okay.  Ja.    Oh ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I think last time you did testify about them if I am not mistaken.  Mr Koko, I know what the allegations – or was it another witness?     Oh.     Oh, no, no.  Ja ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Oh, or talking to ...[intervenes]      Or talking to service providers.     Something like that.   Well, she has testified that you investigated that.     She asked that it be investigated.  You investigated and you came back to her and said that the allegations were baseless and ...[intervenes]      But Dr Ngubane, I think said, mentioned that that was the allegation against her ...[intervenes]      ...as mentioned at the meeting.   Well, Mr Seleka you might have ...[intervenes]      ...refresh our memory of our Dr Ngubane said.  But I seem to think that he said it was... Mr Tsotsi was pushing for the suspensions.     And I got the impression that he was saying, some of the board members were not happy with that.  I think that part, at least where which he says was on the 9t h.  I think, certainly, on the 9t h, he says Mr Tsotsi was pushing for the suspensions and the board members were against this.     Yes.     Yes, but what you have said is the audio ...[intervenes]      ...recordings of the meeting of the 9t h ...[intervenes]      ...does not support what Dr Ngubane say.     Okay and so you put that to him when he comes back?     H’m.     But I thought that, I may be mistaken, but I thought that when I read the transcript of the meetings of the 11t h, I thought I did also come across parts which seemed...  You know, sometimes you cannot be sure who is talking but I thought I came across parts which seemed to reflect that the chairperson, who I thought would have been you, was talking to these... talking about these allegations of misdemeanours and so on.  Mr Seleka, is my memory...?     Yes.  So your recollection is.  Mr Tsotsi does not get involved in talking about the allegations of misconduct during the meetings of the 11t h?     To the extent that anybody might have mentioned, then it would not have been him on your recollection?     Okay.  No, that is fine.  So I may be mistaken here.     Okay.     Then it maybe it might have been Mr Linnell in one or other meeting because I do know that there is somewhere where somebody mentioned and talks about that.     Or unless I am... I think I am talking about what was in the transcripts but actually it was in the memoranda.     Or correspondence that Mr Linnell prepared.     Which was... which had that was... that part, also I remember, his correspondence whether it was a memo.     Or he raises a document ...[intervenes]      A document where he goes to town about these allegations.     Ja, ja.     But also, it is just that one, you know, a witness comes and goes. You remember afterwards ...[intervenes]      ...what you probably should have asked.     Because one should have asked where he was getting it from.     Ja.     But also it is strange.  Why would you want to take those allegations and bring them to the board meeting, bring them to Mr Tsotsi when he knew that the meetings had nothing to do with allegations of wrongdoing and the suspensions had nothing to do with them?  Why was he doing that?     Okay.     H’m, h’m, h’m.  Okay so maybe he sought to rely on those to say these people have a propensity to misconduct themselves.  So there is a good chance they will interfere with the investigation.  [laughing]     Okay alright.     To say    [laughing]     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, the memorandum.  Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja, okay.     We are ten to three.     [laughing]     Ja, because both the way in which the board acted towards you to remove you and the way in which it seemed to have acted towards him to remove him, is strange.  It is... there is a level of intolerance that is unlike unheard of.   You have just begun to work with everybody because you are new.  Let us assume that the chairperson has made some mistake but to then really say let us charge him.   And of course, would want and look at charges that were used, remove him.  Then here is another board member.  Something has happened and suddenly he must be removed.  He gets removed.   It is all very suspicious to say the least.  It is not the way you would expect board members to behave.       Yes.     H’m.     It is all very strange.  All very, very strange.  It is not the way you would expect a board to act.  I think that is not even the way you would expect a political party to act, politicians to act.  The speed with which they sought to remove the chairperson.  The speed with which they sought to remove Mr Baloyi.     It is very strange.  It calls for some     The letter?     H’m.     He knew about the meeting having taken place?     Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Okay.     Did you establish whether he was there himself?     Oh.     Okay.     H’m.       Okay.  I am sorry, we will have to stop here.     I know you have not finished.  Mr Tsotsi, I apologise that we are not able to finish with your evidence when you have come back for the third time.  I apologise.  We will have to ask you to come back again.   I hope it will be for the last time.  But that will be arranged.  So I apologise.  We have to stop.  Now I had hoped we would stop at half-past two but the issues that need to be covered are important and they are not few.  So arrangements will be made.  I apologise.       Yes.     Sorry?     [laughing]  I thought that you would have sent you invoice to the evidence leader.     [laughing]       I do not know how long you were going to still be but I think we have to stop.  You will have to continue on some other day.  But it should be... there is no reason why it should not be one of the mornings or one of the afternoons in the next two weeks.     There is no reason why there cannot be a day where... because probably you will not need more than an hour or two.     Ja, shorter than that.     Ja.  [laughing]     No, but sometimes we...     ...finding myself and ...[intervenes]      Ja.  So but we certainly should not need more than hour.      So we could start at nine o’clock.  By ten his is done.     Or we could ask him to come at four.  By five he is done.     Or come at five.  By six he is done.  So you can explore that with him.     And then we can take it from there.     Okay.  Is that fine Mr Tsotsi?     That should be fine?     Okay.  Alright.  Let us stop here then.  On Monday, we the Commission will start at two and not at ten and I will hear evidence.  We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.    Yes we are Chair.    Set down for this morning Chair is an application to authorise the issue of summons in respect of the former President Mr Zuma.    Long heads have been prepared and they have been delivered to you.     We have prepared a note for oral argument which summarises the major points to be made and if I could take a few minutes to put those before you?    Notice of this application was given by email to Mr Zuma’s attorneys on Friday 18 September .  That appears at page 781 of the bundle that you have.  The application its time and date was also announced publicly on the 21 September 2020 that appears at page 790 of the bundle. In response to those notices Mr Zuma’s attorneys addressed a letter to the Chair giving notice of application for the Chair ’s recusal.  That is at page 791 of the bundle. Paragraph 12 of that letter at page 794 says the    715.    Yes we looking at the red numbers today Chair.    Where you stated as follows from line 10. “The commission’s legal team will deliver a replying affidavit on or before close of business Friday 24 January.  That is 1. With regard to what is going to happen in regard to this application that is the application for a summons in January 2020 Chair and the further appearance before the commission of the former President what has been agreed in the discussion involving myself and counsel on both sides is that this application is to be adjourned to a date to be arranged and I hasten to say arranged does not mean agreed.”   So by your directive Chair you recorded an agreement between the legal representatives of both parties that the application for a summons would be adjourned to a date to be arranged and this is the date so arranged.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair and that – that position is confirmed in the Rules of the Commission.    Where the rules and the consistent practice I might add is that you as Chair determine the dates, the order of appearance and in fact who will or will not give evidence.    So Chair the rules, the record as well as the consistent practice are all confirmed by the arrangement now that you determine the dates.    Chair the power of the commission lest there be any doubt certainly in the public mind to issue summons is set out in Section 31 of the Commission’s Act which states very clearly that you as the commission have the power of a court of law to compel attendance by way of summons.  So that is a statutory power that you have and it is a power equivalent to that of the High Court.  That section is quoted in the long heads before you Chair at Footnote 2. Chair insofar as there may be any dispute as to whether this application for the authorisation for the issue of summons can and should be granted it can be resolved by reference to legal principle and by reference to what are incontrovertible facts. There are in our submission grounds to issue the summons.    Yes Chair.    Section 3 of the Commission’s Act deals with the commission’s powers as to witnesses.      “A commission shall in the union now the republic have the powers which a Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa has within its Province to summons – to summon witnesses. To cause an oath or affirmation to be administered to them.  To examine them and to call for the production of books, documents and objects.”    That is the qualifying…    Requirement yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    If there is any issue to be raised.    Or if on a particular date which the summons authorises for the appearance a person who is subject to such a summons has every right.    To deal with those matters.    Either before you or in a court of law.    So there is no question of any legal infringement of anybody’s rights here.    Quite simply Chair you exercise your discretion on the qualifying requirements.    And that then authorises the lawful issue of a summons.    And in fact it is a necessary mechanism for this commission to do its work.    Yes.    Yes we will do that Chair.    The – we can read the Terms of Reference if you wish.    We have them here.    Yes.  There are two points there Chair.  The first is that insofar as Mr Zuma’s evidence is subject to the investigation of the commission one could have reference to the Terms of Reference themselves but also to the witnesses who have come before the commission.  34 witnesses have implicated Mr Zuma. Now over and above the requirement of the Section 3.1 and the requirements of the Terms of Reference which delineates the mandate on your Chair for your investigation there is a duty at common law and it is being emphasised in a number of recent judgments that obliges the commission to call Mr Zuma to answer those allegations. If I may just read one passage of a judgment in the matter of Msiza versus Advocate Motau and the Prudential Authority of the South African Reserve Bank.  Paragraph 55    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair the – that in our view is accurate subject to one qualification which I will come to in a moment.   Of course there is distinction between the duty on the commission to give every opportunity to an implicated person who states his or her side of the case.  And the implicated person then has an election whether to exercise that right to speak or not to speak. The duty of the Chair to investigate arising out of the Terms of Reference and that is a duty in respect of which the Chair has no discretion.  You must investigate and we will come to the grounds upon which we submit Chair and you have said that there is a duty on this commission to explore those to investigate those issues where the former President has evidence or can give evidence to inform your findings.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  Chair in correspondence and this is the qualification I have to the propositions that have been put now.   The former President has asserted that he is exercising a right not to participate in the matters of the commission and by exercising that right he is in fact participating. There is no right not to respond to a 3.3 Notice implicating a witness.  That witness has an election. He may say or she may say, I am not going to respond or I am going to respond.  But there is no right not to deal at all with the matters which are the subject of the commission’s Terms of Reference if the commission determines that a person must come. So insofar as there is alleged by Mr Zuma’s legal representatives to be a right not to respond that is incorrect.  It is not a right not to come to the commission. There is no such right. There is an election not to answer a Rule 3.3 Notice to put a version or to cross-examine a witness.  But there is no right to say I am not coming to the commission at all.    Correct.    Correct.  Correct.    25.    Well in our submission no because the – the point about that – that paragraph in that letter is that is a situation that will prevail for the life of the commission.   And the commission must conclude its evidence by September and one of the reasons procedural reasons for the issue of summons is to enable the commission to consider the former President’s evidence before the commission ends which is in December.  Certainly the evidence must end by December to enable you Chair to write your report by March next year.   So in the circumstances – particular circumstances of this case our submission is that it is not a good enough reason to – to refuse to appear.  But if the former President does believe it is you Chair will exercise your discretion in terms of your mandate and you will exercise your discretion in terms of the directives that govern your chairing of the commission.  If he believes there are grounds not to appear on a particular date he is free to – to raise those with you.    But not in those general terms.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  Quite frankly, Chair.  The Commission has a job to do.  It is obliged to do it.  The fact that there are other mattes that the former president must attend to may or may not be relevant, but it is certainly no basis for a blanket refusal to come on those grounds at all and frankly on any date.     Correct, Chair.     Not on what is contained in that letter.     So whilst the requirement to appear in another forum may be a reason to ask for particular dates to be changed, certainly not as it appears there, grounds for a blanket refusal to come before the Commission.     Chair, the issues that we have covered in our written submissions, therefore covered two principle contentions.   The first is to say that Mr Zuma’s evidence is both necessary and desirable for the work of the Commission.  That we will establish and have dealt with in detail in the written submissions. The second is why it is necessary that summons be issued to secure Mr Zuma’s appearance at the Commission to give evidence. Now Chair, that is an added reason but it is not a necessary reason.  In regard to the first issue, if I may refer to paragraph 12.1 of the written submissions. In summary Chair, Mr Zuma’s evidence is a necessary part of the Commission’s work for at least the following reasons.   Firstly, much if not most of the corruptions, an act which might constitute State Capture occurred during his term of office as President of the Republic. Secondly, the Commission’s Terms of Reference refers to Mr Zuma directly in a number of paragraphs.  If I may just ask you, Chair, to look at page 808 of the bundle.     Yes, they are there.     I will do that.  The Terms of Reference are... they are included in the bundle.     Paragraph 1.2 reads    Brics Bank.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes, Chair.  Chair, there are, apart from those Terms of Reference, there are other Terms of Reference where Mr Zuma’s evidence would be necessary for the Commission to complete its investigations adequately.   The 1.6 which talks about government advertising in the New Age Newspaper and other undue benefits to the Gupta family.   There has been evidence directly implicating the former President.  Mr Sundaram’s evidence, for example, where you have asked for information from the former President which has not been forthcoming.   So there are a number of... there is the evidence, for example, of the exchange and the study of the former President at his residence in Pretoria, Chair.  Where the Gupta’s demanded “favours” from the then Minister Shabangu in relation to mining licenses.   All those issues are issues that need to be addressed.  And the evidence to date is replete with such examples where it is necessary for you Chair to investigate these matters as a matter of your Terms of Reference.     Yes.     Correct.     H’m, h’m.  And you have been cautious to say that no findings have been made.     But you have evidence before you ...[intervenes]      ...which requires investigation.     And as night follows day, evidence implicating the former President must be examined, including through the evidence of the former President himself.       There are other examples.  Chair, the record is ...[intervenes]      ...replete of such evidence.     Direct interference in the activities of law enforcement agencies.     Appointments and dismissals.     The meeting with Gavin Watson ...[intervenes]      ...in relation to the BOSASA prosecution.     Those sorts of issues ...[intervenes]      ...need to be dealt with.     Correct.     Yes, Chair.     Correct.     Yes.  Chair, in summary then.  In evidence before you and to date, and I stress to date, because there is more to come.   Mr Zuma has been or may be implicated by the evidence of at least 34 witnesses.  That perhaps is enough to qualify, certainly under Section 3(1) of the act.   Chair, in relation to the second issue that is why there is an added reason that it is necessary and desirable for a summons to be issued.  The Commission, quite apart from its mandate, the law, but as a practical consideration, requires certainty in regard to the fact of Mr Zuma’s appearance and the dates of his appearance. We are simply so close to the end of the Commission’s hearings that the proper and efficient functioning of the Commission would be rendered impossible unless we have that certainty and you are entitled to take that into account in the exercise of your discretion. The history of Mr Zuma’s cooperation or lack thereof with the Commission, is set out in the written submissions.  Paragraphs 18 and 19, Chair, you during 2018, requested Mr Zuma through his legal representatives to provide a response to the evidence of Ms Mentor and Mr Maseko.  That has not been forthcoming. You will recall the well-known areas of interest undertaken.  There have been and this... the paragraphs of the heads and perhaps, I should just mention one or two. The most recent undertaken.  Just to put that in its context.  At the last appearance of the former President where he seized to answer questions, to put it at its lightest. An arrangement was made and an agreement was reached that the legal team would provide a document containing areas of interest. There was an agreement and repeated promises that that areas of interest document would be responded to.  It has not been responded to.   In his opposing affidavit dated the 13t h of January 2020, that is the opposing affidavit to this application, Mr Zuma     It was slightly later.     It was in the first week.     Of the following month.     I am told it was the 30 t h, Chair.     But there were some administrative hiccup.     In any event, it was delivered.     Well, Chair there were repeated undertakings.       On 12t h September 2019, Mr Zuma’s attorneys confirmed that he would provide his answers to the areas of interest document previously provided to him.  And then Chair, on the 30t h of September, Mr Zuma’s attorneys requested a “indulgence” to provide the Commission with the answers to the areas of interest by 20 October 2019 and simply after that nothing has been forthcoming.   Even in January this year, in opposition to the application it said the document is ready, I just cannot finalise it.  Ten months later we still do not have the document here.       So the import, let alone the implications of that are clear.     Of which led to summons.     Then you not being polite.     Yes.     Yes.  Chair, I must stress that the application by the legal team has not been prompted by the notion, which is a preposterous notion, frankly, that you are not allowed to issue polite invitations because the law does not expressly say, you know, you may do so.  There are good legal and factual grounds quite apart from that.  But the proposition that you are not entitled by law to issue a polite invitation to witnesses to come before the Commission to give evidence voluntarily cannot stand.     But when you do…     Yes, Chair.  The test, of course, is you have a duty, you have a discretion, you have a mandate and you have the power and that must be exercised reasonably in terms of discretion and all the facts that are incontrovertible, Chair, and I will deal with some more now and make it certainly beyond, in our submission, any doubt that that discretion would be reasonably exercised.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  The section has a timeless element to it because it says you, as a Commissioner, have the powers that the High Court has and that power has been interpreted and applied over time.  In fact the legal team has done an opinion on this which we can let you have, obviously, but I do think it is somewhere in your own archives as well, the many files that you have.   I am told that there is no sound, Chair.     Perhaps it is important that there should be sound.     Purely coincidental, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes thank you Chair.  Chair we were dealing with the import and meaning in today’s technological age of the provisions of Section 31 of 1947 Commission’s Act.  The powers of the Court ...[intervenes]      Yes Chair and those regulations have been promulgated under the amended 1947 Act, which says that the President may issue regulations to expand the powers of the Commission.     Chair the 1947 Act, which gives powers to the Commission which are equivalent to the powers of the High Court is instructed, because the powers of the High Court have been developed over time through the application of the summons provisions and the giving of evidence provisions to take account of technology.  There is the judgment of Satchwell, J, the technology of the video link is now accepted both in other jurisdictions and South Africa as an efficient and effective way of providing oral evidence both in chief and in cross-examination and that this is simply another tool for securing effective access to justice.    We have the example of children giving evidence via video link, we have the example of in camera witnesses, or witnesses who don’t give evidence directly but over video and sound links, so there is no reason why a person whose immunity is threatened by Covid conditions shouldn’t also be catered for under the expanded technological rubric of the giving of evidence. Of course you make the qualification which is important that the witness must be within the jurisdiction of the Court, so that the evidence that is given can be accounted for in terms of the law within the borders of the country.       Yes Chair.  In fact I think that has been provided for in other cases specifically in camera witnesses.     Okay, yes.   And the powers that you have are based in statute as well as in regulations which have been empowered by statute expressly, as well as the general power that during the charge of the procedures, and this is essentially given the authority is a procedural matter. Chair if I may just finish the list of issues where the former President has been requested to assist you in your investigations.   You requested the President to respond to the application made by Ms Reddy Tlabe that was an application made by her to give evidence and to cross-examine the former President, arising out of his own evidence and in that respect a request was made and there has been no response to that.  You have issued at least two 10.6 directives, the provision to which you have just referred Chair, requiring him to respond, and this is more than an invitation Chair, this is an exercise of the compulsory power, to respond to the evidence of Messrs Tsotsi, Linnell and Matona and to respond to the evidence of Mr Popo Molefe in the Eskom and in the PRASA matters respectively.  Those have not been complied with.     The areas of interest documents?     Which came as a criminal sanction.     The directive now carries a criminal sanction.     Correct.  Chair there were two further invites of a less formal nature to respond to Mr Human’s affidavit dealing with the evidence of Mr Sunderam and an invitation to respond to the affidavits of Mr Megwe and Ms Pillay also dealing with the evidence of Mr Sunderam, those have not been complied with either. Importantly for the question of an appearance Chair you have set aside at least five separate weeks in the calendar of the Commission for the appearance of Mr Zuma, which have not been adhered to and what you directed Chair was that if he wasn’t to appear or had good reason not to appear he should make formal application, that hasn’t been received either.     There has never been a formal application, we have always had to deal with allegations and correspondence, and of course that is more than just a formal requirement because if Mr Zuma’s legal representatives were to come before you to make an application not to appear in any one of those five weeks you would have the opportunity of interrogating that.   If it is just simply sent to you in a letter you don’t have that opportunity at all, so it is more than just a procedural requirement it is a substantive requirement.  So Chair in summary then, unless there is any further issue you want to raise the two questions really before you are would it be a reasonable exercise of the power that you have to issue summons in these circumstances, given the terms of reference, given your duties, given the provisions of Section 31, given the provisions of Section 10[6] that must be answered in the affirmative.  There are the added considerations that we have just outlined that make it practically necessary for summons to be issued and we therefore ask for an order in terms of the amended Notice of Application. ORDER Having read the affidavits placed before me and having listened to submissions made by counsel representing the  Commission’s legal team I am satisfied that this is a matter in which I should grant the application.    I am satisfied that a proper case has been made out for an order authorising that the Secretary of the Commission should sign and issue a summons against Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, former President of the Republic of South Africa to appear before the Commission at ten o’clock on the 16 t h to the 20 t h of November 2020 in this venue on each one of those days, therefore I am going to     No Chair that is – we will assist the Secretary in the drafting of the summons in accordance with your order.     Thank you Chair.   May we be excused. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chair.    We are ready indeed Chairperson.    Indeed Chairperson the first witness is Mr Tsotsi this morning.    Mr Tsotsi may be sworn in Chairperson.    Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    Thank you Chair.  Chairperson the main bundle we will be using this morning for Mr Tsotsi is Eskom Bundle 07[A].    Mr Tsotsi – thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi you will have it also there in front of you.    That bundle will contain Mr Tsotsi your affidavit on the first – okay we will use the pagination on the left hand side top corner – the black pagination instead of the red.  Okay.  Ja.   Mr Tsotsi yesterday we ended on a note and I want to continue on that note.  We ended on that note with a different witness before us a former member of the board.  And the main issue with which I want to start is the apparent uncertainty about how the Financial Director got onto the list of the suspended executives.    By the way for the purposes of background we will be dealing Chairperson with Mr Tsotsi with the end of the suspension issues.    Explain that.    That is right.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes.  Now Mr Tsotsi has been informed Chairperson accordingly.    So – so that – that will not take him by surprise.    Mr Tsotsi I want to start with the apparent uncertainty and it may not be an uncertainty from the evidence we saw yesterday.  The inclusion of the Financial Director Ms Tsholofelo Molefe on the list of those who were to be suspended.   Now as you have testified the – you went to a meeting in Durban on the 8 March 2015.    That is a Sunday afternoon.  You meet there with Ms Dudu Myeni, Mr Linnell, the President joins you later.  There is Dudu – Ms Dudu Myeni’s son as well and Mr Nick Linnell recalls that there was a gentleman called Jabu Maswanganyi.  You had followed that explanation?  You follow the – the narrative explanation?    I will not go into the details but in that meeting the request to you was that three executives should be suspended.  Correct?    Those three executives did not include Ms Tsholofelo Molefe.    But we understand from another witness Ms Suzanne Daniels that she has a meeting – she is called to a meeting by Mr Matshela Koko on the 10 March two days after your meeting.  The 10 March 2015 at Melrose Arch and that there she is made to meet with a gentleman called Mr Salim Essa.  You would have heard that from her testimony at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee and her affidavit before this commission.    The meeting at Melrose Arch 10 March 15 has a commonality with your meeting in respect of the three executives.  Correct?    But they add one more.  They add the Financial Director.  But what is interesting Mr Tsotsi is how Mr Salim Essa according to Ms Daniels introduces himself to Ms Daniels.  He according to Ms Daniels he says I am the Minister’s advisor.      Yes Chair.    It is in…    Yes, no correct Chair.  It is in Ms Daniels’ bundle.  I will open the page to it.    Chair I – I used a different file – let us see.  Oh here is my file.  Because mine is marked and I can easily get the page which I want.  That is on page – that is page 9 Chairperson.    That is bundle – Eskom Bundle 08.    Eskom Bundle 08.  It helps to re-read these things Chairperson and you see these things.    Yes.  Paragraph.    Paragraph 22 Chairperson.    Indeed Chair.  So Mr Tsotsi …    Ja.    Yes, no – neither do I know whether there was an official appointment Chair.  Mr Tsotsi do you know?    Whether Mr Salim Essa was the advisor to Minister Brown.    We are talking here 10 March 2015.  You are the Chairperson of the board.  Did you know who is the advisor to Minister Brown?    Was it Salim Essa?    No that is alright.  This is what happens Mr Tsotsi.  You come from a meeting with the President; you come out of there with three names; do the enquiry and these other three names of the executives that should step aside or be suspended.   The Melrose Arch meeting has identified four names by a man who says I am the advisor to Minister Brown.  You come to the board on the 9t h the day after your meeting and you need to explain to the Chairperson because from the memorandum and your proposal whether it is yours or – as drafted by Mr Nick Linnell at the very least one is unable to determine whether the suspension of the executives is explicitly – well that is mentioned or referred to we have determined it is not explicitly mentioned.   So we do not know from the memorandum and the proposal who is going to be suspended.  But we know from you – you have testified before the commission that these are the executives you said to the board should be suspended or step aside.  And in your words you said it was the three executives.  We have looked at the transcript    But then the board goes into a meeting with the Minister.  In the meeting with the Minister the board discusses amongst others the inquiry and we will see from the affidavit of Ms Nkolo it discusses the executives.   Doctor Ngubane writes to the Chairperson in the affidavit that the Minster raised concerns about four executives.  The four executives are the ones who get to be suspended.  And she expressed the view that the executives if present their presence will hinder the inquiry.  Could that be a coincidence that the Minister and you had different understandings of who exactly should be suspended?    Thank you Chair.  Chairperson indeed Mr Tsotsi in your affidavit and I will read it to you that is page 17 Chairperson paragraph 12.6.  It is explicit. “We immediately began a discussion of what was going to be presented to the President.  This discussion was led by Dudu Myeni.  She explained that the situation of Eskom’s financial stress and poor technical performance warranted that an enquiry into the company be instituted.  She further elaborated that in the course of the said enquiry three executives” Page 17 paragraph 12.6 “Three executives namely Chief Executive Tshediso Matona, Group Executive for Commercial Matshela Koko and Group Executive for Capital Dan Marokane are to be suspended.” So it cannot be any clearer than that.    You see that?    Doctor Ngubane tells us in his affidavit    Sorry he says that   Okay Chair.    So on – on his version Doctor Ngubane who would later replace you as the chairperson of the board he says in his affidavit.  “Although the Minister did not direct the board to suspend the four executives.” Now there you hear the four executives.  Not the three.   “She raised concerns of her own against them and in the end the Minister felt that the presence of the four executives might hinder the investigation.” You hear that?    And Ms Nkolo says   And where did the Minister go?  Where did she hang around?    Within the building?    So she is waiting for you – the board to make those decisions?    So there the four gets introduced.  So let us see from the transcript of your meeting because Ms Mabude says which we read yesterday Chairperson. “Thanks Chair I think the Minister has indicated a whole lot of issues that needs to be looked at.”   And in her speech if you noted what she is – what she was saying it is the basis for the Terms of Reference.  So if we can use that speech as a way of putting the Terms of Reference and from that speech it was indicated to me indicating the critical sections that sections that needs to be looked at.  We do not have that speech.  Was it in writing; was it verbal?    Yes.  Mr Tsotsi are you able to confirm that? No let me not ask you that question because the answer to it is ja.  So the areas are indicated according to Ms Mabude by the Minister in her speech.  Needs to be     Now ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.  And in fact, Mr Tsotsi.  In the P&G meeting, when you introduced Mr Linnell, you do     Because you have met with the minister.     And Dr Ngubane says, after your meeting with the minister, it was then clear that the shareholder wants this to be done.       Say again?     Thank you, Chair.  What I wanted to read Mr Tsotsi whilst you were addressing or rather explaining to the Chairperson about Dr Ngubane, is that statement he     That is Dr Ngubane, Chair.     In his affidavit.     Yes.  But look at the contrast because you introduced Mr Nick Linnell with your knowledge of the Durban meeting, what was conveyed to you by the... back in Durban.   You have mentioned because after the meeting with the minister, you know there is now four areas.  But Nick has to address you.  But Nick only knows three.       Because your briefing... that is the Durban briefing.     The FD was not included.  But certainly on the other three, maybe you want to take the committee through that and also the processes that need to come into play for this to be effected which include them and so on.       You confirm that?     And the question is.  Why is the FD included?  Now the FD came and testified here Mr Tsotsi.  And just before I go there.  Chairperson, yesterday in your summary, you could not recollect... you could not recall whether at Ms Daniels’ meeting at Melrose Arch the names     October.  One thing we have overlooked about Mr Dan Marokane is that he was even appointed in this position he occupied, Group Executive.  What was it?     Commercial?     Oh.     Group Capital?     That appointment was in fact made in November 2014.     So he is even fewer months in this position than Mr Matona himself.  So he would be four months about in this position.  Correct?     And the board, in the minutes, he... we went through the minute with him when he was here.  How he -and you will help me with the correct terminology - in regard to the Medupi Power Plant.  What was the milestone achieved or ...[intervenes]      Oh, yes.     Yes.     Almost 27-years, Chairperson.     About 27-years.     Yes.     Yes, it is.  But... are you done, Mr Tsotsi?     Of course, it puzzles... it boggles the mind why you do that.  And we went through the evidence with Ms Klein.  Her testimony yesterday to the Chairperson was that, she personally had no confidence in Mr Matona.  But Mr Matona...  The Chairperson put to her, she did not give him a chance.  He is hardly six months there or even short of five months.   He is called for suspensions when he had presented a turnaround strategy to the board.  Do you know that?     Chair, let me just correct.  The 27-years     [laughing]     [laughing]     [laughing]  Okay the evidence of Ms Molefe which you will be aware of because it involves you in some part.  She is appointed into this position as Financial Director in January 2014.  You would know because you had been the chairperson of the board since 2011?     And shortly after her appointment, she says the CEO, Brian Dan has resigned.       And there is an acting CEO, Mr Collin Matjila.       And I will come to him in a moment Mr Tsotsi so that we can see how you feature in that regard  But Ms Molefe has explained to the Chairperson, giving her testimony that shortly after her appointment, she is called to the office of the Chief of Staff of the Minister of the DPE.   Mr Msomi calls her to a meeting in his office,     What was your response to her?     Yes.  So here is the important part.  Should I proceed, Chair?     Okay.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, we did ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, there is an important aspect here in the testimony and evidence of Ms Molefe.  And this is where it is.  She says consistently with what you have just said.  She is now in the office of Mr     Did he tell you with whom?     With Mr Salim Essa.     And she explained to the Chairperson, the meeting with Mr Msomi at the Baron the filling station because she was washing to catch a flight, going to the airport and it was a brief meeting where the details were exchanged and Mr Salim Essa was meeting her for the first time.     And that is where Mr Msomi was following up whether you are doing what you are doing.  And I want to surmise to you Mr Tsotsi, and you may come into this.  When she failed to do what was requested, it became a red flag.       But it does not end there.  Then comes Colin Matjila.  She testified about her having to develop a financial sustainability plan.  So there you were told Mr Tsotsi that...  That is then Chairperson...  This is in April 2014.  She has just been appointed, January 2014.  We are in April 2014.  The financial plan has to be developed and there is a meeting and where she has to present it to the board.       Do you recall that?     Do you know what happened thereafter?      You do not recall that?     Yes, tell the Chairperson.     Was that at the end of June 2014?     Yes.     But in the light of what I want you to tell the Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, you want to carry on?     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  There is an important detail, Mr Tsotsi, in regard to that issue of the corporate plan and get external service providers to assist because Ms Tsholofelo Molefe says verbally here and in her affidavit that Mr Matjila arranges a meeting with her at Monte Casino and they talk about a service provider that has the skills, can help, can do the what - cash, unlocking at Eskom.     Yes.     Say again?     Optimisation, yes.  And they were soon joined by a gentleman whom she recognised but the gentlemen appeared not to recognise her and that is again,     Yes.  And she was refusing to sign that agreement because Mr Matjila was saying you will sign that agreement.  She said no, I will not.       And that is another red flat on her.     So Mr Salim Essa knows this.     She has met with – I mean, he has met with her, now is the second time.  Mr Eric Wood has been introduced, Regiments, the email came from Mr Eric Wood with the proposal which is an agreement and she has refused to sign.   It is interesting what she says Mr Matjila tells her, she says – Mr Matjila now is reprimanding her. “We met the following mornings at Tintswalo, Waterfall Equestrian Estate. At the meeting he expressed concern that I was not supporting him, stating that he had no aspirations of becoming the CEO of Eskom but that he had a mandate from the shareholder to fulfil certain urgent matters within three months and that we do not have time to be following our longwinded procurement processes.  He stated that he would do no such thing, which is follow a process, as he had a mandate from the shareholder.”     That is exactly what Mr Molefe is saying.     He must have been what?     Yes.  Thank you, Mr Tsotsi, because the TNA is also one of the issues, signed for R43 million.  Ms Molefe raised that and said in fact that Mr Matjila did not even have the authority to sign that agreement and Mr Matjila again reprimanded her, according to Ms Tsholofelo     We are in 2014.  I think you wrote that in your affidavit, Mr Tsotsi.  This is about TNA.     Do you recall this?     You meant to say Mr Matjila, Chairperson.     H’m.     Yes, Chair.     This meeting, Mr Tsotsi, let me give you more information on it.  The Gobodo Forensics has flagged the TNA.     Matjila has no authority and there are     But here is what we need to get to, Mr Tsotsi.     Her saying that you say you want to cancel because you are receiving pressure from outside to cancel the meeting.  We had been thinking that this related to the meeting to the 26 February, that it was pressure from the President.  When you were here you said she would have been polite, you said to the Chairperson.  What I said to her is that I am receiving pressure from the President. Then it was explained by her, no, no, no, that is not the meeting.     It was about this TNA matter.     Of the pouresness of the board.     That information was leaking out of the boardroom.     And the only time to have them swept would have been a weekend or at night.  That, Chairman, is what I remember.  I could not have said I was getting pressure because I was not getting pressure from anybody outside.  No, I certainly do not – I did not get any pressure from outside.  I would not have cancelled the meeting in any case irrespective of that.  Not for that reason, no.     Yes thank you Chair, indeed Ms Tsholofelo Molefe says Mr Tsotsi that they went to meet with the Minister, herself and Mr Matona, and you sent her a text message saying I am with the Minister, when in fact she was with the Minister together with Mr Matona.     They were going to complain to the Minister that you cancelled the meeting, the meeting which is so important the financials have to be approved and it was the Minister who said go and have that meeting the next day and so they laughed off your SMS which says you were with the Minister when in fact you were not.      But here is the point we want to come to Mr Tsotsi we understand that Mr Howa was the CEO of TNA.      Ms Molefe and the Chairperson stopped her from signing this and I will not say it but I am going to go to your affidavit.  That she heard through the grapevine much later what the pressure came from.       That was brought to bear on you - let us go to your affidavit page 10.      Yes because it was interesting when you were saying if we talk about people outside of government and you contrasted that to people inside of government when the Chairperson was talking about pressure.  So I wondered why you will be saying that so page 10 you relate the…[intervene]     The black numbers Chairperson.     I am sticking to the black numbers.      Ja, from page 9 you talk about your     “During that the impulse of the TNA contract when the award of the contract by acting CEO Colin Matjila was under scrutiny for irregularity I was requested by Tony Gupta to make this problem go away.  I responded that this I could not do as there were processes in place that must take their course but for the first time in my encounter with him he showed visible signs of anger and frustration as he kept insisting that I was not interested in assisting him.” Another red flag from you.       Could the pressure has come from this, Ms Tsholofelo Molefe said through the grapevine she understood this to be the position.  So we said we will wait for you to confirm it Mr Tsotsi.       But he asked you to take away the problem.     Now explain to the Chairperson Mr Tsotsi because the Gobodo Forensics had flagged that issue as a reportable irregularity.        So the board in approving the financials would have had to include that in their approval.       Yes, so when he is saying to you make this problem go away he does not want it to be in the books as a reportable irregularity.      I am only pointing out for a different reason there are red flags but I am going to explain why people are moved from their positions.      You are also flagged.       Yes.      Yes because that is a subsequent encounter.      That we have placed you in this position.      You are not assisting us and we can remove you.      Should I carry on Chair?     When I get to putting the versions of other witnesses to Mr Tsotsi I think we should go faster once we have the grand picture of the reasons leading to that.  If we adjourn at, if by one and I think I will not be finish by 1 o’clock and we start with Mr Tsotsi at two I should be able Mr Tsotsi on my side Chair I think personally I will need about 45 minutes.       Ms Mokholo is here.     She is here Chairperson.     Oh no we should be able to finish today.     Is that the Chairpersons question.      Tsotsi.      No she was not here, yesterday it was the company’s secretary.      Should we…[intervene]     Mr Tsotsi?     Yes, today.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.      It was the two witnesses.      Yes, Chairperson.      But she might have interesting information for you Chair.      She might have interesting information for you.     Should we attend to it at lunchtime Chair?     Yes.      If we do it in the morning Chairperson I think you need her for the morning.      Ja, it can be short from ten to – one hour to 1 o’clock.      Yes, Chair.      About 45 minutes but can I expedite that Chair?     Okay.     Yes.     Okay Chair.     Thank you Chairperson.  So Mr Tsotsi those are in our observations in indicators of what happens the underlying reasons for the removal of this executives but you are also removed Mr Tsotsi in circumstances where the board had agreed with you to do the suspensions.   Coming to you Mr Tsotsi you testified under re- examination something that was new to the Commission when your lawyer the attorney re-examined you, you mentioned to the Chairperson that you had had a meeting with the President Mr Zuma during that conversation or at the end of it he told you that if you need to speak to me go through Ms Myeni.  Do you recall that?      Yes, and Ms Myeni has provided this Commission with a statement ah she did not provide the Commission we obtained a statement which she submitted at the parliamentary portfolio committee which the Commission has shared with you.  In her statement she says what you are saying is not true.  You were the one contacting her and I am linking this to what you say the President told you.  You are the one contacting her because you were concerned that the board was about to pass a motion of no confidence in you if you did not suspend the executives and you needed her advice.   It was all about you the meeting in Durban was all about you the President was not involved.  Why would the President be involved and not give a written direction to either the Minister or to yourself as a Chairman of the board, and that is her version.      Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi on this vote of no confidence against you, you say you know of no one who knows of that but remember you asked Mr Linnell to give you or your lawyers a statement or affidavit which he did when you were charged by the board.      You would have seen that statement then and now it speculates at the end of it that he learned through rumours and I am asking you this because you are here you can clarify to the Chairperson that the board – when the meeting of the 26 t h of February was cancelled by the Minister it was because the board apparently wanted to discuss your removal.       It is a statement he submitted at the time when Mr Tsotsi was subjected to this disciplinary charges but he speculates it on the end of that statement Chair.  Due to time constraints we never got to it.  He said he heard after, through rumours that the meeting of the 26 t h of February 2015 was cancelled because the board wanted to have Mr Tsotsi, to vote on Mr Tsotsi’s no confidence, to pass a vote of no confidence.      Yes, thank you Chair I thought I would put that very question to Mr Tsotsi.      Yes.     Because I saw Mr Linnell said it was a rumour he heard after the fact.  Mr Tsotsi this is what Ms     But her comment may still be valid or questions may still be valid in the context of the meeting you actually had.       Do you agree you had a meeting with the President and Ms Myeni they told you go suspend the three executives.  Go start an enquiry.  It was not in writing, why were you naive, why were you misled, why did you accept such instructions as a Chairperson of the board.       Chair I might also say that Mr Linnell did say that the President said go do it, well go do it but that is Mr Linnell who said that.      Yes, Mr Tsotsi I am putting this to you so that Ms Myeni does not say but they did not tell him about my statement.  Do you understand?      Yes, so I am not necessarily saying that I agree with what she is saying I am just saying you have a chance to respond to it.         Correct.     Correct Chair, yes.     Thank you Chair.     So you understand.     Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi I read from Ms Myeni’s statement just before the adjournment and having had a look again at what she is saying it seems to me that she is essentially saying to the Chairperson about the – meaning you – I am now referring to you the Chairperson at the time that the Chairperson did not understand his fiduciary duties.    Yes.  In the meeting of the 9 t h Mr Tsotsi     “I have been summoned by the President.” And you say three times. “And the most recently was yesterday.” Now this is the 9t h you are referring yesterday being the 8t h March. “Where he has finally made up his mind about what he wants to do about the situation of Eskom.  Both Minister and I have been summoned by the President separately on several occasions where he has expressed his view about the situation that finds – that he finds at Eskom.” These are the min – the transcript of the audio recording of 9 March 2015.    And I was intrigued by summoned three times.  You and the Minister summoned separately the President because we did not see – we do not see that in your affidavit.  Are you able to explain to the Chairperson why?    No why [00   So is your explanation to the Chairperson that in respect of this particular issue the enquiry and the stepping aside of the executives the summoning of you by the President happened three times.    Did you know that he had in fact spoken to the Minster separately about the situation at Eskom?    Sorry just repeat that.  You did…    But let us confine ourselves to the issue here.    Because you say the last of the three occasions was last night.    I am sure you would have met with the President many other times not only three times at the time you were the Chairperson of the board.    But it seems to me that the statement is specific to the issue you are bringing to the board.  I am bringing this before you.    He is now made up his mind about what he wants to do.  That is what you added.    So was this raised with you on three different occasions and you say the Minister has also been summoned separately by the President.  You are referring to this enquiry.    Hm.    So is that an acknowledgement that it happened here when we talk about the enquiry, the suspension of the executives.    Bringing its muscles to bear on you.    And SOE?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi a little bit on that meeting and I am moving on.  There is Mr Jabu Maswanganyi Mr Linnell has touched on and on an aspect which we were not aware of before.  That he amongst other things he assisted in drafted the letter that you wrote to the Minister saying dissolve this board.   He and you know actively in that meeting according to Mr Linnell participated actively providing documentation to Mr Linnell in regard to issues at Eskom.  But all Mr Linnell says unverified, unidentified sources.  But he is actively involved.  According to Mr Linnell Jabu Maswanganyi may have been the one who told him and I am giving you all distinctive view in not – in no particular order.  But I want to show you the level of his involvement that he is not a once off figure according to Mr Linnell. He might be the person who told Mr Linnell when Mr Linnell received an email saying you are no longer needed on the 17 March.  That is six days after the 11 March some eight days after your meeting at the President’s place on the 8 March. So it is fairly soon – fairly close to the beginning of the events.  That when he – after he received that email he connected the email to the meeting he said he learned took place on the 16 March 2015, the evening of the 15 March.  A secret meeting between some board members and some suspended executives.  This first deal with Jabu – Mr Jabu Maswanganyi.  Here he has a hand in the drafting a letter that ultimately you put together to the Minister.  And this meeting of 16 March is referenced in that letter.  We shown you that letter.  Who is Mr Maswanganyi?    Yes Chair.    Yes.      Yes.    That is right.    Ja.  My recollection of Mr Linnell is that he did not speak in the meeting with the President.    That he did not speak.    That Mr Jabu Maswanganyi.    It does not matter.    Yes.    Ja, no Mr Linnell did say you were very uncomfortable in the meeting.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Myeni of course also says her son was not there.    Ms Tsotsi I have a few points then I am over.     Thank you Chair.  There is no particular order to this point Ms Tsotsi.  These are just versions we get from the commission – from the other witnesses.  We understand from the other witnesses I think Doctor Ngubane in particular to some extent Ms Venete Klein that you had made when you presented the report you made allegations of misdemeanours against the four executives.  So you told the board these people must be suspended and these are the reasons why they should be suspended.    Yes.    No it is Doctor Ngubane.  It was Doctor Ngubane Chair who said Mr Tsotsi mentioned misdemeanours and suspensions on the 9t h.    Ja.    And I sought to – I sought to put..    Sorry I sought to put to him that the audio does not reflect that.    I do not want to help you Mr Tsotsi but that is the recording of the meeting does not reflect that.     It was Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein.     He was trying to recall ...[intervenes]      Try to recall what were the allegations.  And Chair, they... one allegation against Mr Koko, Mr Tsotsi was in relation to sexual escapade captured in a CCTV at the Arcade Parking Lot.     The one regarding the FD, the Financial Director.  It was about her allegedly interfering with tenderers during the bidding process.     No, that... no, that was ...[intervenes]      Yes, that is right.     To... to...      Yes.     Exactly, Chair.     Yes.     Should I assist?     Yes.     Against it.  Yes.  Your recollection is correct Chair.     That is exactly what Dr Ngubane testified.     Yes.     Yes, it is not ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Yes.     Mr Tsotsi, you will recall.  There is one where there is a to-and-fro about whether the FD should be     No.     My recollection, it is not.     Yes.     Yes.       And at the ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Correct, correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.  Chair, he does.     He certainly does.  And I think he alludes to them when he is with the P&G.  He alludes to them but does not specifically deal with them.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.  I think I did ask the question how the charges came about.  My impression is, he was relying on what was given to him by Mr Jabu Maswanganyi.     Those unverified and unidentified.     Well that’s correct, because his     So his rational is one thing, but he actually went and did is another.  But then the board still decided, this is not about wrongdoing.     [laughing]     When Ms Klein said there was no shred of evidence that they had interfered with previous investigation.  But Mr Tsotsi, that is what has been said about you.     That you motivated.  You gave allegations of misdemeanours as the reasons why.  And they say that four, on the 9t h of March, that you said that the four should be suspended.       [laughing]     Yes, Ms Molefe did say exactly this Chairperson.     Denying.  Because we have also put it to her.     Did you, Mr Tsotsi, say to them there is an inquiry and the suspension of the executives?  He said the suspensions was not mentioned.     And she referred us to the proposal that had their names ...[intervenes]      And she was saying    But Mr Tsotsi ...[intervenes]      Yes, I am going...     Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, Mr Baloyi was opposed throughout, to these suspensions.     And he asked about the urgency.  What is the urgency about?  Where is the report you are talking about or background information or background research?   And in regard to the issue of the urgency.  You are having the ordeal.  Or shall I say?  Giving you the tongue lash.       And he was opposed to this, right to the very end of the P&G meeting.     And he still requested that report.     And Dr Ngubane also says to him     And I am referring to it because I think he was red-flagged.     I think he was red-flagged.     The next thing is Mr Tsotsi.  You are already out but he raises concerns.  He testified here to some extent, not in so many words, but he has testified about the T-Systems contract.  You may not know about it.       The T-Systems contract which kept on being extended and extended.  He deals with it in his affidavit and he was querying why a contract of an IT was... the IT contract had reached some... what was the amount?       Ja, R 5.2 billion.  When it did not... the Audit and Risk had made queries on it, negotiations on the price.  The issue could be dealt with by the Executive Committee but the Board Tender Committee decided to... decide on the matter and that Board Tender Committee was chaired by Dr Ngubane.  But you would not know about that because ...[intervenes]      And he says that when he inquired... made inquiries with Dr Ngubane, Dr Ngubane shouted at him.       Yes, Mr Tsotsi.  Tell the Chairperson a little about this meeting.  We have heard about deceit(?) in Mr Linnell’s affidavit that there was a secret meeting.  He linked his emails, the email he received about you are no longer needed.   And we have asked him who were some board members?  Who were some suspended executives who met that evening in a secret meeting on the 16t h of March 2015?  Can you enlighten us on that?     Mr Tsotsi, may I... sorry, may I intervene?     Do you know who were the “some” board members and “some” suspended executives who were at that meeting?     We will have to stop here, Chair.     [laughing]     Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes.       No, shorter than that Chair.     I literally have one, two, three, four, five questions ...[intervenes]      ...to put to him.     No, I know.     I know.  [laughing]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, indeed Chair. 
MR TSOTSI:  Thank you.    Zola Andile Tsotsi.    No.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    Yes I do.    Alright.    Right.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    No I do not know.    No I do not know Chair.    I have met a gentleman who was said to Minister Brown’s advisor I just forget his name now.    No it was not Salim Essa.    Yes I do Chair.    Chairman I guess I should start with my understanding at the Durban meeting which Mr Seleka has pointed out that …    The understanding was that …    Right.    Correct.    Now the point I want to make about the Durban meeting is that the President said he would inform the Minister of the outcome of this meeting.    So clearly – yes and I will talk to the board.  So when I left the meeting my understanding was that the Minister will also be told of three executives.    Now it came as a surprise to me that there are four areas that were mentioned by the Minister.    And at the time I did not know about this meeting which occurred on the 10t h.  So I – I am – I can only arrive at a conclusion that there must have been some discussion with somebody where the Minister was either informed or was participating in a discussion which then introduced a fourth person meaning the FD.   So is it two things I – I cannot reconcile them because the understanding in Durban was three and the indication at the board meeting before the Minister arrived was still three.  The Minister comes in and she indicates that there is a – there are four areas to be looked into and then the name of the FD emerges.  Now in the subsequent meeting and in the P&G meeting.   So somewhere along the line it seems as though the Minister knew about the addition of – of the fourth executive.  Whether it occurred at that meeting of the 10 t h or as a result of that meeting on the 10 t h I cannot really say.  I do not know. But there has been you know there is this transformation of the – of the issue.    That did occur to me Chair.    Not at all.    Yes.    Yes, yes I can.    I want to find it.    Yes.    Yes I do.    The Minister was escorted to a what would be an almost like a cafeteria that belonged to Eskom within the building.    Yes.    Correct.    No it was verbal there was nothing written.     Correct.     That is correct, Chairman.     No one else.     No.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes. ADV SELEKA     Because he is the one who told me when I objected.     Chair, I just need to make a point here.  After the minister had left, I got out of from lunch and I was a little late.  I came into the meeting, maybe what, ten minutes or so minutes late, and I found two discussions going on.  Well, a discussion going on about two issues.   One was the number of executives to be suspended and secondly, the people to replace them in the acting positions.  Now in respect of this matter, I heard the name of the FD motion(?) and I raised objections.       The Finance portfolio.  And then I said    It is quite correct, Chairman.     Yes.       Yes.     That is correct.     Yes, I do.     Correct.     He was Group Executive for ...[intervenes]      Capital.     To Group Capital.     Yes.       Yes.     Correct.     Yes, Chairman.  What was happening was that we were experiencing delays in the commissioning of the first unit at Medupi which would have been the first unit of the new Build Programme.   Now, with him coming onboard, he was successful in accelerating the commissioning of this unit and actually managed to commission that unit sometime and I think it was in January of 2015.   Now it is a milestone from the perspective that the last time when Eskom commissioned one of those so-called thermal units was with the... would have been with ...[intervenes]      Ja, about 1985 ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, sir.     Yes, I recall that.     Correct.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.  Yes, I do Chair.     Chair, she was essentially looking for protection, can I say.  If I can use that word.  Because this was somebody who was sitting in the shareholder’s office and she felt that it was inappropriate for her to get that sort of pressure from that person.   And of course, I knew Mr Msomi.  Now, the protocol is such that I as chairman speaks to the minister and the chief executive speaks to the ...[intervenes]      DG.     Now I recall mentioning this to Mr Matjila and that I have got this feedback from the FD that she is being pressured to meet with some contractors, some light(?) contractors who are experiencing difficulties in accessing some parts of the organisation.  I think it was Primary Energy, if I remember.   And I then told Ms Molefe that I will speak to someone at the department.  Now I what I ended up doing was instead of speaking to the minister, I just spoke to the DG because I realised that in essence it is easier for the DG to deal with that sort of thing because essentially these people report to him.   And as it happened, the DG was at the time Mr Matona and I had a very good working relationship with him.  So I found it easy to address the issue with him.   So I left it at that.  I was not... I do not know what exactly what Mr Matjila did it about it at the time but that is what I did.     [No audible reply]      No, I do not recall that she told me.     Oh, okay.  Alright.     H’m.     IN all probabilities, yes.  I see the picture, yes.     H’m.     Yes.  Yes, I do.     I do not remember... Ja, I guess he must have indicated that herself.  I do not recall that she ...[intervenes]      But I recall what happened subsequent to that.     Okay.  Chair, the issue was that, you know, because of the growing deterioration financial position of the company, particularly because of the consumption of large amounts of diesel and the load-shedding programme or programme designated, designed to counter load-shedding.   Our financial position was declining and so there was some anxiety about what is going to happen, what is likely to happen.   And I think the... if I recall what the minister had wanted to get a financial position and here given us a certain timeframe.  I think in that meeting, the FD must have present.       Probably around the middle of... yes, it was about that time.     Or maybe two or three months that we were given to come with up something.  And I think also, Treasury people were, you know, were also in the loop on this particular issue.  Anyway.     Ja.       Okay so what happened then Chairman is that.  Ms Molefe at some point came to me and she said to me that she is experiencing some difficulty working with Mr Matjila who was the acting Chief Executive.  And that he was demanding things of her which she could not do.   And this had to do with waiving procurement process to enable the company called Regiment to do this project that was on the table.   Then I... then she also spoke to some board members in that regard and Mr Kunasa[?] was one of them, if I remember, people who were involved in the committees that were relevant to this.     And I then decided    Yes, to follow the law.  And there was some - I think – I do not want to call it an altercation but there was still some argument between herself and the Acting Chief Executive.  Who I then discovered was the one who were bought these Regiments people on board.  That is when I found out that Salim Essa was part of this business.  I did not know until I hear from Mr Matjila.  So…     Ja.  No, at the end of the day, Chair, the proposal and the suggestion from the board was that we cannot get into an involved exercise, then these people can only some sort of a desktop exercise.  I think that is – if my recollection is right, that is where the issue ended. And then I then had a meeting with the two of them because I realised that they were not working well together and what I said to them was, people, you know, let us – the important thing is to get a result because there is a result that is required by the Minister, so let us get on with the work and let us not create tension between us.     Yes.     Yes.     Oh, yes.     Balance sheet optimisation, ja.     It is called the balance sheet optimisation exercise.     That could have – would have been discussed in the meeting we had with her and the other board members, yes.     I remember one of the complaints she had, Chair, was the fact that Eskom was being charged for work that should not have been charged for having [inaudible – speaking simultaneously].     Exactly, in terms of that proposal she was being asked to sign.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair, you will recall, Chair, that Mr Matjila is by this time – was already – had already signed off on the TNA contract and I think it emerged around this time …[intervenes]     …that there was that problem.  So already, if he was embroiled with something to do with, you know, with the Guptas.     Now here he is bringing Salim Essa through the back door.  So is tenure probably had some sort of relationship with the Gupta family, somehow or other.  Ja, I think he – I get the impression that he must have had not only mandate from the shareholder he might have had a mandate from them, I do not know.     He might have a mandate from the Guptas as well, I do not know, because it looks like he was, you know, introducing their participation into the company.     H’m.  H’m.     Yes.     Chair, I cannot agree with you more, that just seems to be the pattern, the picture that is emerging.     And, of course, it does not end there because their long gain was to eventually replace the FD with someone who is agreeable, Chair.     So this was the – you know, the totality of the picture.     Hence she had to be …[intervenes]     Because that is the only opportunity they would have had of being able remove these people.     So if she was not part of that team to be suspended initially, they would have had it difficult to try and raise some or other idea or method of trying to get rid of her.     Just so they can put in their own people.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.  Alright, about this meeting, I cannot remember – what time was this?       Yes.     Okay, what I recall, Chair, is that at that time there was a big problem with security of information at the board meaning that there were reported leaks of communications coming out of the board and we were – I was advised that we should bring in people to come and sweep the boardroom and in the interim, if I recall well, there was a concern that came from the Minister where she was saying that we should not hold board meetings until we have cleared the security issue with boardrooms in the organisation. So the boardroom was not available for use at the time and I understood that there was – then I said look, we cannot have a board meeting until we are ready to have it and then I understood that there was a meeting of audit and risk to discuss this issue of Matjila’s signing of this contract because that matter was being addressed by them.  Of course, I do not attend audit and risk but apparently some of the board members went for that meeting and they decided, because they had enough members to form a quorum, to make this decision about this financing of …[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes, yes.     It was about TN – but I do not – Chair, I do not recall receiving pressure from anybody not to have a meeting.     Yes.     Yes.     I recall the fact that that meeting actually happened without me.  I was told by my executive in the office.  Because I had suggested that the meeting should be held over to the next day, which is the Monday because of this – to my recollection, the problem was with the pouresness of the board, boardrooms and that information …[intervenes]       Yes, Chair.     Well, Chair, if we are talking about people who are internal to government, that is a different situation.     Against people who are external to government.     Yes, I hear you.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  To the extent actually I recall that we even had to change the venue.     We actually had to hold a board meeting outside of Eskom.     Because of this problem.     Yes.     Yes.     It will certainly help Chair.     Meaning with the Minister meaning what?     I am not aware of that Chair, I am not aware of that I think if either we will have to look and find that SMS or something but I am not aware.      Yes, yes.      Who?     Page 10?     Yes, page 10.      Yes.     I would say so yes, right.      I actually Chair to be honest I do not recall Tony Gupta never asked me to you know to cancel a meeting.  I do not – no he has never asked me to cancel a meeting.       This was now the problem with Matjila.      Right.      Correct.      Yes, I would imagine that is the case yes because Mr Matjila would have to have had – well he was on the way to being disciplined for this had he stayed on in the company.  I think we traversed this during the TNA…[intervene]     Yes, that was my presentation yes.      Alright, yes.      That is right yes I can see that.      And of course it culminated in Cape Town I think that was the – it was like I was being warned and I was not taking the hint if I can call it that but then in Cape Town it became very explicit.       Yes.      Correct.      Yes.      I told Mr Seleka that I would have lunch at home today Chair.     I told Mr Seleka that I would have lunch at home today.     I see he is talking about 2 o’clock.     Exactly.      No he is going to have to buy it Chair.      Yes.      Chair I think her version is completely wrong it is incorrect.  First of all, I would have no basis for looking for advice from Ms Myeni.  She had nothing to do with Eskom and for all intense and purposes she would not be in a position to engage with me on issues of Eskom.  So my looking for advice from her I think is just untenable.  Secondly she indeed is the one who called to say that the President would like to have an audience with me at the President’s residence in Durban and she called me I think it would have been either the Thursday or Friday or Saturday, no Friday I think it was which would have been the 6 t h I think and Mr Linnell in his evidence I listened to confirmed to that he was also asked by Dudu, Ms Myeni to go and attend a meeting at the Presidency.   Now she did not disclose to me at the time she called me what the discussion was about notwithstanding the fact that I asked her what is it that the President wants to talk about.  Whereas with Mr Linnell apparently she did disclose based on the fact that she and Mr Linnell had, had a meeting on the 6 t h from what we gathered from his evidence.  So all in all Chairman that is a complete distortion of the facts and I think it is fair to say that the whole exercise of us going to see the President is well corroborated by what Mr Linnell also had to say.  So I do not know where Ms Myeni gets all of this understanding about what happened.  But from my perspective it certainly is not true.     No Chair there was no such indication whatsoever.     I had never heard of that and I do not know of anybody who was aware of it.      Correct.     Correct.      Chair I recall that appearing in Nick’s statement and I think he and I talked a bit about that.  Obviously at the time when Dudu Myeni alleges that I was trying to avoid myself being – a motion of no confidence being passed on me.  At that time, we should have been before the 26 t h of February.  There was no basis upon which I could even speculate that there could have been a motion of no confidence against me on the 26 t h.   So subsequent to that when Nick told me about this alleged rumour or information that in fact the board was intending to pass a motion of no confidence in me on that day the 26 t h of February.  I then started to think possibly that was the reason why the meeting was stopped because somebody obvious it would have to have been the Minister because she is the one who wanted the meeting to be stopped would have then known that I would have had to face a vote of no confidence from board members.  So if anybody should have information should this be the case it would be the Minister.     Yes.     I agree.     Chair I have no answer to that I mean I think she is off the wall completely if I can use that expression.  So I really cannot even begin to address that.          Explain?     Chair what I said in my affidavit is that I did not accept any instructions from the President because I do not take instructions from him, but I had a relationship with him but what I needed to do was to test the idea with the board with whom I have a relationship and that the board did the right thing by establishing the opinion of the shareholder.  So the process through which we went to deal with this matter was very different from what she is in her mind alleging that I was naive and that I took instructions from the President, no that was not the case.     Yes.     That is correct Chair.     Yes.      Yes.    Yes.    I thought it was mine. ADV SELEKA    Chair I think we dealt with this a bit earlier before the break when I was saying that my interpretation is that I was not taking instructions from the President or anyone else for that matter.  I was simply wanting to test this idea that he had with the board which is precisely what I did.  So I disagree with assertion that I do not understand my fiduciary duty.    Yes.    Yes.    Why that statement is not in my affidavit?    No Chairman this goes back quite a long way even during Mr Gigaba’s term of office.  On the occasions when the President wanted to understand what is happening at Eskom he would ask to see the Minister and the Minister would ask me to accompany him.  And this happened a few times over a period of maybe two – over two years maybe.  So you know it is sort of intermittently there was no particular pattern.  There is just the last one being when on this occasion.    No, no, no.  I was meaning that the concern that as – President has expressed about the situation at Eskom had been raised with by him in my presence and in the presence of the Minister as well before.  But there was no discussion about an enquiry.  There was no discussion about suspensions or anything like that.  It was just you know an opportunity for him to express his concern about the situation in the company.    No I did not know.  I did not mean in all those occasions that he had spoken separately to the Minister.    I did not mean – like I said some of the occasions I was with the Minister when the President raised the issues.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    No.  No I am referring to the concern that the President had about the performance of the business.  When I say he has finally made up his mind I am referring now to the – to the attitude he has taken of an enquiry and of a – you know the action that he is talking about there. ADV SELEKA    Chair that could be the case.  I – it is quite common that you hear from you know the shareholder representative the things that they think should happen in the organisation.  It happens quite a lot with the SOE’s anyway.  And I think this is something that I notice that you are very concerned with because you know the need for the board to be independent but there is undoubtedly quite a lot of interference may construed as political interference.  But it happens.  Yes it happens quite a lot.    Yes.     It happens yes.  It is in essence a reflection of – of political authority you know engaging.    Yes.    Yes.  Oh yes.    Chairman that is the SOE the Eskom I found in 1995 when I joined the company.  The company was making its own decisions and – and simply had a you know a normal shareholder liaison relationship.  But even the Chairman made very – made it very clear that he will not broker any interference by government. And I mean for those early years since the dawn of democracy certainly as far as Eskom is concerned that was the case of the company was extremely efficient.  It was a world class institution.    Yes.      Yes, correct.    Chair I must first of all indicate that the issue of my not recalling Jabu really bothered me for quite a while.    Exactly that Chair, exactly that.    No but it is fine Chair.    It is fine because there is some – a point I wish to make around exactly that.    Like I said it bothered me that I could not remember him.  So I decided look why do I not just ask Jabu if he was there.  So I called him and I asked him and he said yes he had been at the Presidency at the same time we were there.    For whatever he had been there for.  And as I said to him look it is funny that I did not remember you being there.    Now what he says is he had an encounter with Nick and myself in the anti-room so to speak in the – waited to get…    To get into the meeting but he says he did not participate in the meeting with the President.  Look this is what I recollect.      Yes Chair that is definitely correct.    The session before we met the President where Dudu was – Dudu Myeni was outlining the – outlining the issues.  And then we moved into the sitting room.    Yes where then the President came in and joined the meeting.    Yes.    Yes it is strange.    Yes.  Very strange.    Ja he said no he did not participate in the main meeting with the President.    Where the President was present yes.    But yes he was there.    Yes.    No he admits he was in that part.      Yes.    Yes it does.    Maybe I was very uptight Chairman so maybe I did not notice he was in the second one.    I said maybe I was very uptight and I did not notice that he was in the second meeting.    Yes.    No Chair the son was there.    Chairman that is blatantly false.  That is putting it as mildly as I can – as I can.  It is blatantly false.  Yes.    Chairman I do not – what happened was that Nick and in preparing whatever he wanted to present apparently had somehow got hold of some information regarding whatever might have been going on with each of those people.  I am not sure exactly where he got it from I really did not even ask him.  And what happened was when I was making the point I was saying Nick had said to me there are some issues around these people.  And I said, well look if there are issues around them you can raise them it is not an issue.  But the understanding is that these people are not in the position we had wanted to put them in because of them being having committed some misdemeanours.  That is not part of what the intention is.  So I – I think at some point I gave over to Nick and I think Nick must have said something about those things.  I do not believe that I – or if I said them myself it would have been stuff which I got from him.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is correct Chairman.  That is why I am – I am a little surprised because first of all in – on the meeting of the 9t h there was no discussion about…    Suspensions.    Chairman it also to me smacks of some agenda of some kind.  I mean why would someone say that I discussed these issues on the 9t h when you know there is evidence that I never raised any issue about suspensions on the 9t h. And I think the meeting of the 11t h any such discussion about whatever the people were supposed to have done would only have come out I think at the time when Nick was being introduced.  I cannot remember very well.  That could have – but that discussion did not persist in the meeting.    Because that was not the purpose of what we wanted to do.  I do not even remember whether Nick actually stated that the – as a result I do not even remember some of these – so called misdemeanours are.  So I think…     But that was put to bed as far as I know.      So I am just a little bit mystified as to how it is that I could have been pushing for the suspensions to happen when I was in effect opposed to the suspensions.     Yes.     Chairman, one of the things that would have been, I think, disrespectful to those executives who are concerned, would have been to talk about them being suspended in their presence in a meeting.  So, yes.   Quite honestly, they were sitting there.  Mr Matona was sitting there.  Ms Molefe was sitting there.  How on earth would you in a meeting of that nature, you know, start embarrassing them with suspensions?     Exactly.     It does not...     Yes, of course.     Yes, absolutely.       Yes.     Yes, I recall this.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      R 5 billion.     Not that specific aspect but I do know about the very dubious issue that occurred around the T-Systems contract.  Chair, this contract came up for renewal and everybody who put in their bids were interested including T-Systems.   And at some point, I get to hear that T-Systems did not qualify.  So they were taken out of the running.  And I believe - this is what I am being told now because I would not get involved in these issues.   But I was told that the contract and the bidders who are under consideration for the contract, there were some negotiations that were going on already to see which one should be selected.   All of a sudden, the whole process collapsed.  And a     Yes.  Chairman, I must apologise how it related to Norman.  He is a very pleasant person.  I guess I got very impatient with him for whatever reason.   But it is true what the evidence leader is saying about him, having been opposed to the contract(?).   Particularly the concern about the pace at which things were happening.  And I have a great deal of sympathy for that view because I had a particular problem myself with the suspensions.   So I understood where, you know, where he was coming from in terms of his objections.  And when I spoke to him much later, after he himself had been removed from Eskom. He recalled that his objection to the process that was then going on at the time, he believes must have had something to do with the way the board turned on him.  So, yes I do recall that.  Ja.     Chairman, things that seemed to take a completely turn after that alleged meeting of this... that night meeting or the secret meeting.     Of the 16t h.     And my subsequent letter in regard to that meeting with the minister, I think must have unsettled some people and they acted very quickly to turn the gun on me.     Yes.     Yes.     Chairman, I myself at the time when this meeting took place, I had no idea until the following day where upon I was told by Nick that there had been this meeting.   And that he believes that this meeting was in fact a decision to terminate his involvement in the process and that it was working against the decisions that the board had taken.   So he then volunteered to draft a letter to the minister from me indicating that, you know, there was this allegation of this meeting and this would have been in contravention of what the board had wanted to do and that there was ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Well, I asked... at the time I asked Nick.  He did not know.  He was not aware of who were in that meeting.  But I subsequently asked Jabu because apparently Nick had worked with Jabu to draw up this letter.     Yes.     And Jabu indicated that there was... Romeo Khumalo was there.     He knew that the meeting had taken place.     And he mentioned Romeo Khumalo.     He also mentioned Zethembe Khoza.     And then I asked who the executives were in that meeting or suspended executives.     That he did not know.     So I only heard of these two names having been present in that meeting.     No, he says he got it from his sources.     So I presumed that ...[intervenes]      ..you know that he was not there.     Ja.     No, I understand.       My invoice will follow, Chairman.     My invoice will follow shortly.     [laughing]  That is a good idea.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.
