ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson is to put the relevant parts of the affidavit to Montana and ask him whether he accepts what he said or denies and if he denies what the    Chairperson then we would like to start with the affidavit of Mr Molefe – Mr Montana Mr Molefe’s…    Oh should be sworn in I am sorry.    As you please.  Mr Montana you have heard what I have said to the Chairperson about the approach we intend adopting.  I want to start with the affidavit of Mr Molefe first you will find it in Bundle D which is in a file in front of you.   We received it – I received it a few minutes ago Chairperson.    I just looked at it very quickly.    So I do not…    I have not even…    Except for the fact that it is from Mr Montana I know nothing about it.    I just wanted him to adjust his microphone.    Sorry Chairperson I have been asked to ask you to put your mic at the centre they are not being able to record – I am sorry.    I am sorry.    Yes.    Yes    Chairperson may I place something on record?    I am not going to…   I am not going to deal with other matters that Mr Montana has raised.  Mr Montana says I am conflicted.  As the – an officer of court and I accept this is not a court but in general I am deeply conscious of not involving myself in activities that might involve a conflict.So I want to place on record I have never been briefed by Werksmans Attorneys in any matter involving PRASA or Mr Montana.  This is not the first time Mr Montana has raised it.  He has raised it with journalistswho communicated with me and out of concern I wrote to the lead counsel of the commission Mr Pretorius and placed on record.    What the position is and so let me doit now because it will form part of this record.    I did as well Chair.    I have never been briefed by Werksmans Attorneys in respect of either Mr Montana or PRASA ever before or after the commission.  I was briefed by Werksmans once about fourteen/fifteen years ago in a matter in Durban it was a commercial matter it had nothing to do with PRASA. In regard to PRASA one matter on which I was briefed was a matter in which I was asked to give an opinion on whether criminal charges could be brought against Mr Montana.I am surprised that Mr Montana thinks that that disqualifies me because that opinion said that given the position Mr Montana occupied he could not be criminally involved.  But it had nothing to do with anything that the commission is in.And Chairperson when I came to the commission Iwas not aware of what stream I would be fitted into    But I just want to assure you Chairperson, public at large and perhaps Mr Montana if he is open to persuasion that I am not conflicted at all.   As you please.    As you please.    As you please Chair.   As you please Chairperson.    Chairperson there is Mr Hotz from Werks – Werksmans he wants to place something on record.  He asked me to place – to indicate to you Mr Hotz from Werksmans.   Yes.      As you please Chairperson.  Just one more housekeeping.  Mr Johan Van Loggerenberg who was mentioned in Mr Montana’s affidavit asked me to place on record that he is here – he is not represented but he justwants to place on record that he is in fact here.    In the affidavit.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Mr Montana can I just explain what Iwant to do today and it can either be fast tracked or it can be a slow process.  Mr Molefe has made a number of allegations against you in his affidavit.  I want to look at the relevant parts or the relevant paragraphs of his affidavit and ask you whether you deny or confirm the correctness of what he said and anything you may want to add. Okay I am going to refer to specific paragraphs and I hope you will not mind I will read them it just becomes easier so that the record is complete and your answer to that question appears all in one.Is that alright?  I want to start with you will have …    Yes.    Bundle D Chairperson.    PRASA Bundle D.    And it is Exhibit SS6.      That – that is so.    Now have you got it Mr Montana?   If you – we are going to look at page numbers and paragraph numbers. I will start off with page number the first page is page 3 it is the page on the top right hand corner in red.      Page 3.   Page 3 yes.    So at paragraph 11 he says that he was appointed to the PRASA board on the 1 s t of August and soon thereafter he met with you in your capacity as Group Chief Executive, is that correct?    He says you then congratulated him on his appointment and told him that the previous – that you had told the previous chairperson that you intended resigning as you had been with PRASA for many years and that you still intended resigning in the future, is that correct?   So can I just ask and it is on record but is it relevant that it was not at the first meeting?    And then in paragraph 12 Mr Montana he is – Mr Montana – Molefe says he responded by saying that PRASA was carrying out a major program of modernisation and the board would need you to remain and lead the team at PRASA to discharge historical past, did that happen?   Right then in paragraph 13 he says and starting in the second sentence on the second line of paragraph 13. “There is – PRASA was beginning its execution of an ambitious government program of modernisation.”    20?    Then at paragraph 15 he says that   And then he says   The board did not ask?    I am just asking did that never happen that the board asked for presentations.    As you please Chair.  So we can accept that when Mr Molefe says that he asked for these you were not cooperative and he had to secure – he and the board had secure the documents as he says in the rest of that paragraph from the attorneys concerned.    That that is not correct.    Okay.  At least we know the areas of difference so …    Then he says in paragraph 16   Can I just ask you to turn to page 38 this – because the basis that Mr Molefe bases that on PM2 and I do not want you to think Mr Montana that I am trying tofavour Mr Molefe’s version I am just trying to on the basis of the information before us to show you that it does appear in the financial statements.  If you look at page 38 which is PM2.    Yes 038.    Yes.    You will see at paragraph 14 it says   This is 2014 and 2015.    Okay    Can I just ask you to turn to page 38.  This – because it basis that Mr Molefe basis that on PM2 and I do not want you to think, Mr Montana, that I am trying to favour Mr Molefe’s version.  I am just trying, on the basis of information before us, to show you that it doesappear in the financial statements.  If you look at page 38 which is PM2 ...[intervenes]      Yes ...[intervenes]     Yes.     You will see at paragraph 14, it says    This is 2014 and 2015.     And Mr Montana, again, I do know – what, as the Commission, we have got to do is.  We have got to look at documents that are presented to us.  If you look at page 34, that says that this is The Final Management Report on The Audit With the Year Ended31 of March 2015.  That is the heading to this document.  Now, I am only raising this in this context because I accept you that the financials were done after you left but it is still for the period while you were there 14/2015.  Unless you are saying to us that thesefinancial statements misrepresent the position after you left.       R 550 million.     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      I think Wednesday.     I think, Mr Montana ...[intervenes]      Mr Montana you know, I am the evidence leader the Chairperson obviously rules whathappened.  You know we have got a lot to go through, this is what I am going to suggest and I really do not want you to I misunderstand.   I want to go through them, I said to you the process I was using.  Everything you have said is relevant and I am not taking that away.  Let us put in the right place because there is another issue.   As we were talking I was just thinking, how does the Chairperson, when he is writing his report, put the various parts that you are talking in a logical way because they areall over the place, if you know what I mean.     So if we could just be disciplined about that, you can say …[intervenes]     So long as we are on the same page.     As you please, Chairperson.  Then …[intervenes]     Yes, no, no, I understand.     Sorry, Chair, the clarification that I want now is this.  You have seen PM2 which says there was that irregular expenditure - we have been to page 38. Now as you were talking I understood you to say but that is based on false information that was presented to the internal auditors, is that your point as well?     No, I understand.     I just wanted to clarify.     So you say that that is false.     Okay, but we have been through that, I do not want you to.     Sure.  Then at paragraph 17 he says that aside from that challenge about the audit, he says that there was a concern that employees were regularly suspended or dismissed often in violation of their constitutionally guaranteed labour rights and he says the CCMA reversed many of the decisions to dismiss them.  Do you agree with that?    But, Mr Montana, I am sorry, I am going to have to limit you to answer this issue.  He is talking about employees, not Chairpersons of boards and so on.     Okay, I think what the Chairperson issaying and I should not talk for him but let us get the fact.  The fact is the employees were dismissed, they were reinstated by the CCMA.   You say that is not a matter for which you should be held responsible because those decisions were taken byother PRASA officials, is that your answer?     So Mr Montana, let me help you.     And really we must get on.  I am sorry, I am going to have to be firm about his.     And the reason I am saying that is, it is quite clear, we all know that Ms Ngoyi and Mr Dingiswayo were dismissed in 2017.  He is talking about14 and 2015.     Okay, well he is clearly not talkingabout them.     I will just alert you to this so that we are not at odds, but that is more or less a finding made by the Public Protector as well but we will come to that because I am going to give you an opportunity to deal with it.     I am merely making the point, that is one of the reasons I raised it.    Mr Montana, let me just say to you can we please make progress?  You are saying you want to assist the Commission, I have to insist that we do things in a structured way.  I am not stopping you but I did not wantto leave that point when I was saying to we are going to return to it.     We will, yes.     We will deal with that then …[intervenes]     Then in paragraph 19 he says that in regard to the Braamfontein Depot modernisation project and the purchase of rails and turnouts, the board before …[intervenes]    Yes.     Yes, yes, as you please, Chair.     So in paragraph 18 he refers to two tenders, the Braamfontein Depot modernisation project and the purchase of rails and turnouts.  Are you aware of those two tenders?     And then he says that at a meeting it was said that those tenders were important – I mean, sorry, were urgent.  Do you agree that that is what happened?     Yes, okay.  Then he says that – in paragraph 19 before the board approved of that, that is his board now, it wanted a probity report as an assurance that the relevant procurement prescripts and processes hadbeen followed.  Is that correct that he asked for a report?    Paragraph 19.     Yes.     Yes.     No, no, sure.     Mr Montana, can I just summarisewhat you said?  Firstly you say there was no probity report so you and Mr Molefe had agreed with – but you say he never asked for a probity report.     But was there a probity report?     Okay, that is the answer you and him agree on.     As you please, Chair.  So, MrMontana, let me ask you this.  You have told us that the probity officer’s contract had expired.  That is correct?  If you could say yes.     And I do not mean it with disrespect.    Now what I want to ask is, even though the contract had expired you say there was a report or there was not a report?     Right.     Okay. So but the point then is that the real contention between you and Mr Molefe is he says he asked you for the probity report, you promised probity report, you are saying that that is false.     Okay.     Okay.  So that is the only difference between you and him.     No, no, I understand that, he is obviously trying to say that you were being defiant or not cooperative or being dishonest.  Whatever it is, we know what the difference …[intervenes]     [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] outside the Commission.     Yes.  Now then he says soon afterthis you asked to be released on leave saying that you were suffering from fatigue, is that correct?     Then he says in the meantime the board asked for a probity assessment of the tender processes and he puts up the report as PM3.  I would like you to look at please pages 88 and 89.     No, 88 and 89.  Remember we are looking at the top right hand red numbers.     This is the report – and I just want to     Okay, if you look at page 89 then it     And then in the action plan it is said    Then let us look at what we …[intervenes]     No, we moving from it.     Yes, no of course.     But sorry to interrupt you.  I understood you to say there were no probity officers at the time, so I am just trying to understand how your correspondence would be with nonexistent persons.     Yes.     No, no, you must answer my questions, I’m sorry Mr Montana, but I’m not dealing with what Mr Molefe said, I’m dealing with what is in thisaffidavit and that’s all I’m asking you about.     The question was, does he accept what is reflected at pages 88 and 89 of the report.     He accepts it.     Then he says, are we finished withthis point because I want to come back to it.     And the fact is, nowhere in any of this process, Chairperson, is there any allegation of corruption.  Now I have little – I have full sympathy for MrMontana wanting to say, but let’s accept that even if it was non-compliant, it doesn’t mean it was corrupt and that must be placed on record, but we can’t go on revisiting documents that are before us Chairperson, because it will be an endless process.     Yes and we must accept that Mr Montana must place on record that what is before us now, there is no suggestion of corruption, it is things Mr Molefe indicated that there’s corruption, he denies it.     I can’t let this go, Chairperson, I don’t want to – Mr Montana the problem on that issue, and I don’t want to address it in your absence.  The problem about what you’ve just said now is, you, at pages 88 and 89, concede that a tender must be reissued, must be…[indistinct – dropping voice].  So that is – you are part of that decision making process, it may have been a wrong decision and you’re entitled to raise that, but you can’traise it on the basis that, see, because of my absence – because you were part of that decision making process.  I’m just putting that on record.     As I understand the mask that you’ve seen, you said on account of this report we are losing billions of rand, is that correct?     Oh, okay, then I misunderstood you.     Then, at paragraph 23, Mr Molefe says that as a result, and I know you’ve disputed the fact that he asked for the probity report or that Mr Buthelezi tried to push this, that’s the point he makes at paragraph 21, but paragraph 23 he says,“That he was of the view that there was too much power concentrated in the office of the CEO”,You don’t have to – I’m just placing that on record.  Then he says, if you look roundabout four lines or five lines, “Accordingly, the Board withdrew from Mr Montana, Chairpersonship of the subsidiaries and appointed Chairperson’s from within respective subsidiaries to lead them”,Did that happen?    Yes.     I just wanted to finish this, Mr – in paragraph 23 all that was said was, that he had removed, from you, the Chairpersonships of the subsidiaries, you are saying that that’s false?     I’m just asking, was it false?     Of Auto Packs and Inter Site as it were ja.    And that never changed until before you left, that did not change?    As you please.    As you please Chairperson.  Mr Montana we had stopped at paragraph 23 can I just ask you to look very briefly at paragraph 24 where Mr Molefe says hebecame aware that the Public Protector had released an interim report and he came – became aware of it through the press.  Now just to ask a couple of questions around that issue.When did you first become aware of the Public Protector’s interim report?    Now the point that Mr Molefe makes inthe last paragraph of 24 that the board had not been aware of this, is that correct or had you informed them?    He comes to that in a moment.  Let us deal with that because I think that is dealt with in the – in    Yes.    Ja.  Then he says that   Yes.   Okay so I am – okay so I know because I have read the Public Protector’s report the question I am asking is did you tell him that the Public Protector had posed questions which you had answered?    Sorry I do not want to stop you I think you misunderstanding my question.    Mr Molefe is saying that you told him that the Public Protector had posed questions which were being responded to that is all I am asking.  Did you tell MrMolefe that?    No, no I am saying.   Oh and then he says he raised this issue just before the memorial service of Minister Collins Chabane and he says - is that correct if you look at five lines from the top of paragraph 25.   “Because I raised the issue again later in March just before the memorial service of the late Minister Collins Chabane.”    Okay.  So let us just go on with what he    Provisional.    Yes.  Now I am asking did this happen?    Did you hand him the file just before the memorial service for Minister Chabane?    That is what he is saying as I understand it.    You gave him – you gave him the reportat the same time you gave him the letter.    Okay.      Ja he says in fact that you suggested you read it – he reads it when he gets home.    Okay.  They – I mean in essence we can say there may be a difference of a week or so but all of that …    Then he says in the letter you indicatedthat you had elected not to renew your contract when it expired at the end of March – no it says there 2015 that is obviously 2016?    And that you were resigning forpersonal reasons, is that what your letter said?     “I presented the resignation he says Mr Molefe to the board which accepted Mr Montana’s resignation but asked him to continue to work while the board searched for a replacement.” And then he attaches a copy of the letter.    No, no a copy of his reply to your letter of resignation.  That is what PM4 is.    That is his letter.    To you confirming the board’s – it is very interesting Mr Soni that he tells us about the board’s response.  Did he attach my letter of resignation?    No he did not.    Yes. Now…    In fairness to Mr Molefe I have got to place this on the record when he gave the evidence he did place that on record you had indicated you were prepared to stay for six.    Yes.  But can I just ask you quickly toturn to PM4 which is on page 147?      147.  You will see in the – in the first paragraphs he acknowledges receipt of your letter in the second paragraph.   Yes I will I am sorry Chair.      Yes.    Mr Montana would this be correct that this is the letter which is dated the 1 s t of April 2015 in which Mr Molefe responds in – to your notice of termination?    Now in paragraph 2 he says that the board accepts your resignation and the point you made is that you had given them the extra time but what is significant here and it relates to something we talked about earlier is    But here it had been done.    I am – the third paragraph of page 147.  The – the response to your letter of resignation.    No I am just saying that on thisoccasion there is a specific curtailment of your power.  Is that correct?    In fairness to – and he is not here todefend himself but I am not defending I am just placing something on record.  Because you are right that the board    Yes.    Yes.  Well are you going to do that at a later stage?    Okay.  I am …    Ja so long as it is – it is going to be confined to the issue.     Mr Montana, I am afraid I am bringing this up and I really again, I do not want to say something when you are not here.  As I understood your answers to the Chairperson’s questions.  You know two points.  One is you worked together with him but you made the secondpoint that you were aware that Mr Molefe had been appointed to get rid of you.  Now, is – have I understood correctly or did that something – is that something that developed in his mind later?     No, no.  I am not trying to stop you.  Do not forget my question.  My question is a slightly different one.  Did you have the impression, whether you put it in so many words or not, that one of the reasons Mr Molefe had accepted the appointment or was appointed as Chairperson of the Board of PRASA was to get rid of you?     Now you have already dealt with the Knysna meeting which is addressed at paragraph 28.  Nowhe says there that in addition to make a litany of complaints – and you have indicated what some of those are – you also attacked Minister Dipuo Peters.  Is that correct, at that meeting?     Okay.  Now you might remember my question to you a couple of minutes ago.  If you look at paragraph 29, it is informed by the following.      Paragraph 29.     It is 29.     Page 9.     Paragraph 29.       He says    Yes?     Okay.     No, I understand.    But then he goes on to say    Yes.     Okay.  Now you said that you did nottell him this at the Knysna meeting.  Is there on any occasion when you told him that the board had been appointed with the express purpose of getting rid of you?     Alright.     I see.  Let me ask you this.  You may not have said it to him but did you ever entertain that notion that Mr Molefe had been appointed as chairperson – sorry – and his board had been appointed for the express purpose of getting rid of you?    Yes.     I am sorry.  We will come to the appointment of the board on a different occasion.     I am asking, slightly, a different question.  I am saying, did you entertain that thought in your mind?  Because now we have mentioned three boardmembers.  As I understand it, there were 11 board members.  Because the idea here is that the board had been appointed to get rid of you.  Now this is three out of 11.  I am just trying to work out because in someways, Mr Montana, I need to be fair to you.  Is the stop-shop-dispute(?) [Speaker moves away from microphone and not clear] between you and Mr Montana – I mean, Mr Molefe?  At some stage, I will have to make submission to the Chairperson and the Chairperson at a later stage would have to make a decision.  We would have to base – I – my submission and the Chairperson his decision based on all the information that we have been able to out from the different witnesses.  But I just want to know in respect ofwhat your view is about the purpose or one of the purposes of the appointed or...?     Mr Montana ...[intervenes]      Mr Montana, I just want to see if I understand you correctly.  You say - and I am not disputingit, I am not accepted it but I am not disputing it either – you say Mr Molefe, Ms Manase and Mr Steenkamp were appointed irregularly in whatever ...[intervenes]      No, no I understand.  But the fact that they were appointed irregularly does not mean that they were appointed to, in a sense, to get rid of you.  That is – so that is what my question was directed.     Not was it a properly constituted board.     And so, I would just like again your answer on that.  Was, in your view, the purpose of theboard or some members of the board to get rid of you forgetting whether they were appointed properly or not?     He did, yes.     Sorry, Mr Montana.  Could you ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct] [Speaker is unclear.]     [Indistinct] [Speaker is unclear.] [Speakers intervening each other – unclear.]     Yes, sorry.  No, Mr Montana, I – weheard this earlier and so I am not trying to ...[intervenes]      As you please, Chairperson.  Mr Molefe in paragraphs 30 and 31 says, more or less,what you said that the relationship between you and him started to ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry.  Page 9, Mr Montana.     Of the affidavit.     Paragraphs 30 and 31.  We can go – I mean, that is – it is what both of you seem to agree on.       Alright.  Then he in paragraph 32 he deals with the appointment of Werksmans Attorneys and says that that appointment was brought about because of certain recommendations made by the AG in his report.  Are you aware of that, the appointment of Werksmans toconduct the investigation that the AG report has required?  Are you aware of that?     No, no.  I am saying that the reason that somebody was appointed, not Werksmans themselves, was because the AG had required forensic investigations.  Are you aware of that?     Okay.  So are you in a position to say that that is not the reason why forensic investigations – I am not saying Werksmans was properly – that is not my point.  I am just saying that the appointment of forensic investigators, according to Mr Molefe, is that the AG’sreport had required.       Okay.  Let us leave because we know that Werksmans issue...  [Speaker is unclear.]  As theChairperson has said already, evidence has been led on that and obviously you want to lead evidence.  Can we leave that aside for today?     And deal with it whenever.  Well,certainly now.  Not for today.     Okay.  And then he points out that there were difficulties but let us just leave out all the issues raised in paragraph 32 about the appointment of Werksmans.  And I will make a note that this is still to be dealt with.  And you will get a full opportunity to present everything you want.       Yes, yes.    Alright.  Then at paragraphs 33 the points are to two contracts that were reviewed and set aside, the Swifambo contract and the Siyangena contract.  Now again I would ask that we just leave that because Ihave some specific questions based on the findings of the board.  Now in the last sentence of paragraph 33 he refers to Mr Roy Moodley and then in the next section of his affidavit he deals with Mr Roy Moodley.  Before we deal with what Mr Molefe says, let me ask you, did you know Mr Roy Moodley?     Yes.     Well?    Okay, I am only going to deal with those matters to the extent that it involves PRASA without honing in on Mr Molefe because you have read he says that Mr Moodley tried to capture him, that is what he says but you are not here to defend Mr Moodley, and I would hope not, but the only point I am making is you cannot addanything to it so I am going to confine my questions in respect of Mr Moodley who these issues, the ones at paragraph 34 and 35.     The US Masters.     He says in the second sentence, that is in the middle of paragraph 34 – remember this is their State Capture Commission or the State Capture     So he says    And Ms Ngoyi …[intervenes]3     As you please, Chairperson.  Then he     So your answer is you do not know.     Mr Montana, I just want to point outin law it is not whether Mr Moodley was the owner, it is where the people described him and told Mr Molefe.  That is in issue [indistinct – dropping voice].  So when you say it is hearsay, of course it is, but it does not mean it is inadmissible in law.  I am just making that point so that you understand the context in which Mr Molefe’s evidence on this issue is [indistinct – dropping voice]     Yes, okay.  So …[intervenes]    Yes.     Okay.     And that is why each time I kept     Yes.     And Royal Security?     But, I mean, you are aware that Mr Moodley is associated with them.     No, I say he is associated with that company.     “I would go so far as to say that if one did not know Mr Moodley one would easily mistake him for an executive manager of PRASA.  I was told that he would often walk around with managers in their work environment almost as if he were the PRASA manager.”You are not aware of that?     No, no, I am asking a different question.  So [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes, okay.     Okay.  Then he says at paragraph 37    Okay.  May I ask you then to look at paragraph 33 where he says that Mr Moodley invited him to the Durban July, I think it was in 2015.  “There was an attempt to persuade me to attend. Mr Moodley told me that then President Zuma and Minister Jeff Radebe and other ministers had accepted the invitation and were his guests at the event every year.” Are you aware of that?    Have you ever attended any July event that Mr Moodley hosted?     But never by Mr Moodley?     Okay.  Mr Montana, to take theprocess forward, in the rest of this section of the affidavit until paragraph 45 Mr Montana (sic) effectively says that Mr Moodley wanted to pay for his trip to a golf tournament called the Masters in Augusta in the United States.  I am just placing on record that he does make the point that Mr Moodley wanted to go – he did not want to go with Mr Moodley and then Mr Moodley dropped off and he went off on his own.  I am just placing that on record so that we know the issue you have raised here.     Okay.     Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  I will just [indistinct] you again for the purposes of understanding what the difference between you and Mr Molefe is.  Mr Molefe says the fallout between you and him occurred because he tried to hold management – he and his board tried to hold management accountable.  You are saying no, it was because he had a predetermined agenda, if I can put it [indistinct – dropping voice]    No, no, Mr Montana, I am sorry, I am asking you a different – so my question is this, he says you – the fallout was because he tried to hold you accountable, you give a different reason.  Is that a fair assessment of your difference?     Let me tell you what – and please listen to the question, it will make it much easier, Mr Montana.  You have a given a reason for the fallout.  Now Mr Molefe is giving a different reason.  I am just saying that is it fair to say that that is one of the areas of differences between you and Mr Molefe, what caused the fallout.  We know there as a fallout.     Yes.     No, I understand.     Yes.     That has been filed, Chairperson.     But it did not deal with this.     Will obviously have to deal with it once Mr Montana’s affidavit has [indistinct – dropping voice]     As you please.     Now, Mr Montana, just to get this point, we know that there was a fallout.  In paragraphs 47 and  - what 47 really gives details, Mr Molefe details different aspects of that fallout.  We need not deal with that because we know you have different views on it and for present purposes we do not need to work out whether what he says in the rest of paragraph 47 is correct or not.     Alright, now that we have finishedwith 47 can I ask you to turn to page 15, paragraph 48?     Page 15, paragraph 48.     So he deals now in the rest of this part with why he thinks you were able to protect your position at PRASA.  I am just giving his version and asking     Yes.    And Mr Mabunda.     Yes. “Mr Montana was the director in the office and worked directly with Minister Radebe.  Mr Mabunda was appointed as a director in one of the divisions reporting to the Department of Public Enterprises.” Is that correct? MR     I am reading paragraph 49.     Yes.     Yes.     No, it is an allegation, it is not fact.     We will deal with that in a moment,let us deal with the facts, is it correct that you worked under Minister Radebe?     Right, and is it correct that Mr Mabunda was a director in one of the divisions reporting to the Department of Public Enterprises?     Okay so factually that is correct, you are saying don’t read into those two independent facts arelationship between me and Mr Mabunda, is that your point?     Then he says at paragraph 50    Yes, okay. “Mr Montana soon followed him to the Department of Transport where he took up the position of Deputy Director General for Public Transport.” Is that correct?     And then he says    Can I just raise something with you Mr Montana, it is important.   You keep saying what the Commission, the Commission, so let me tell what our role is.  Our role is we get allegations by members of the publicby ...[indistinct], we put those allegations down, we put it to implicated persons.   Now we don’t put this as a fact, this is not a Commission of Finding, this is an allegation made very much like in a court of law.   Now you have a different set of facts, put them onthe table but don’t make accusations about why these are being put over there.   Let’s just get to the facts, whether Mr Molefe did it deliberately or not we need to understand what it is.   So all you want to say in regard to this, and I hope it is going to be the rest of your testimony as well, to say look it is correct that I was appointed Deputy Director, but I didn’t follow Mr Radebe, I applied for a job and it was a cabinet decision.   It just removes all the unnecessary aspects so we can deal with the facts.     Mr Montana I am sorry ...[intervenes]      As you please Chair.   Mr Montana let me just give you this as well, that it is always difficult when you have got person A making accusations against person B and then person B making accusations against person A, and they are like two different versions, but even within that context you can get a set of facts that are common to both and that is all I was saying, so if you feel that I wassuggesting something untoward I was not.  I was merely saying I understand you say that I did not follow you, but what we do know is you were appointed as Deputy Director.  We now know that it was a cabinet appointment.   All I was saying is in response it just has to facilitate the facts so we concentrate on that and say he says this, but this is the facts, and then we move on, as to whether he tried to mislead or whatever is an entirely separate thing, but I just want us to get the facts and that is all I am trying to do.    Yes, no, no, I am fine.    Yes, as you please Chairperson.  Mr Montana, so let us just finish with paragraph 50.  On thefacts you do not have a problem, you just are unhappy about the fact that it made it sound as if you were simply following minister Radebe when in fact it was a government appointment.  Would that be correct?    And please, I skinned this invitation and reiterate what the Chairperson said.  Where ever that is so, let us just clear that up and then but we know what the facts are.  Now I need to say this to you because you have probably read the affidavit or the further affidavit. You know that once the issues is that Mr Mabunda’sfirm, Siyaya, the S group received preferential treatment at PRASA.  So that is the basis on which this factually, the factual matrix that we are dealing with is important.  Now we know that the taxi recapitalisation program was headed by yourself.    Sorry.   “Mr Molefe says Mr Mabunda left the Department of Transport to pursue private business interest and received one of the ...” Well firstly, is that correct that Mr Mabunda left theDepartment of Transport to pursue private business interest?      Oh, I see.  So you are saying he left the Department of Public Enterprise?    Okay.  So we now know that Mr Mabunda was never in the Department of Transport.    And his, Mr Molefe says he received one of the tenders for the taxi recapitalisation program.  Is that correct?    Can I just ask you on that, did you know Mr Mabunda?  I am talking around the time that he received the taxi ...[intervenes]     How close were you and he at the Department of Public Enterprise?    Then at paragraph 51 Mr Molefe says   Alright.     Yes.     Okay, no sure.     Right.  If we said later that that should I mean the, I understand you were trying to showthat there is no link between the leaving and the private ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Then at paragraph 51, Mr   How much, how long after you left the Department of Transport?    May I just ask you, who was your predecessor at the SARC?    The reason I am asking is you might, you seem to have followed this when the speakers was here.  One of the questions was that the Chairperson, I mean the CEO of PRASA has to be approved by cabinet.  Were you approved during the period when you were first appointed to PRASA or was it Minister Radebe’s decision?    So your first appointment was anacting ...[intervenes]     As you please, sorry Chair.    Then Mr Molefe says Mr Mabunda appears to have emerged as a service provider who was awarded contracts in around 2010 providing signal services and advice to PRASA.  Is that correct?    And then in the next sentence he    Yes.     Modernisation.    What was his skills training, was he an engineer?    So, and his position at Siyaya?      And, but the company was called according to what Mr Molefe reflects, it was called Siyaya Engineering Consultancy.    S Group, yes.     And his position in the company was CEO?    Then Mr Molefe says   But would Mr Mthimkhulu be the person in charge of the technical division?     Yes.  No, no, no please and it is going to come up as you will know in the Swifambo matter, so ...[intervenes]     He says   And I am just saying this, I know a figure of a billion rand also has been given by I think Mr Dingiswayo in his affidavit.     No, it is the payments made to Siyaya, because you would see here there is, he says earned approximately 900 ...[intervenes]     Well, of Siyaya.    Yes.  Alright.  Then he makes the point which I think you would sympathise, well not sympathise, but you would accept that he was ahead of thestruggle and he was not being ostracised.  I mean I know he gives a different reason, but is that about right?  That, no.    Yes. But for that, was he ostracised or you say that did not happen?    Yes, as you please Chairperson.  Mr Montana, in paragraph 55 and 56 the dealings, or he indicates that he is now going to deal with the Swifambo contract which he starts off with at paragraph 57 on page 17.  Are you there?    Page, paragraph 57 yes sorry.    Ja.    So I will just read to you and you tell    Now is that a correct summary of what he says the case was about?    Yes.     Sorry, I did not hear you?   Yes.     Can I then say, but okay.  So I mean that is more or less what PRASA, the new board of PRASA argued and alleged in the Swifambo affidavit.     Then he says   And then he says   And then he says   Then he says   Yes.  So I will tell you what the affidavit does or what has been done in the affidavit.  Mr Molefe has extracted findings of manually the Supreme Court of Appeal and set them out in his affidavit.     Virtually word for word as to what thefindings are.     And what I want to do is deal with each of those findings as made by the SCA.  So can I say, and if we want to look at the judgments, they are available, but for present purposes there is no need to.  You may obviously refer to any other parts of the judgment, or outside the judgments that you want. But can I say, this is what he says at paragraph 59.     I just want to ask you one question on that.  He dismissed your application to be an amicus.  Didyou take that decision on appeal or did you apply for leave to appeal?    Did you apply to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal?    No, no, no I understand.     Yes, okay and I mean that clearly shows that you did not agree with what he said and you wanted a higher court to make the deformation.    I am talking about the amicus...[intervenes]     Yes.     No, sure.     Well, let us place on record what theCourt found.     And then we can ... you will have your chance and but before you do that, I will want to point out some parameters that we would have to set for that.  Now    Yes.     Read them.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.      Yes.     Yes.    So that is the first finding.  The second finding is that Swifambo did not submit their BBBEE plan for goods and services it would procure for the duration of the contract.  The third finding is or what, the    Alright.  Then at paragraph 60 he says that at paragraph ...[intervenes]     Sorry.    And then he says again in respect of    Now the contract between PRASA and Swifambo was concluded on the 25 t h of March 2013 and the relevance of the dates I can just point out is this, that the recommendation to the BAC is made on the 24 t h of March12.  It is a year and a day later that the contract between PRASA and Swifambo was complete. You accept that?    Yes, and then it was only on the 4 t h ofJuly 2013 that a contract for the supply of locomotives was concluded between Swifambo and Vossloh.  Now Vossloh as I understand it was the Spanish company that would manufacture the locomotives?    Then at paragraph 61 Ms Molefe says   Yes, except that Mr Montana this is a commission of inquiry.  It is bound by judgments of Courts.  Now you may have a criticism of the judgment, but we, I just want to point out so we are not going to go into areas that are not going to be, because I will say immediately tothe Chairperson, who is of course the Deputy Chief Justice, and he knows the law better than I do.I will say to him that we are bound in terms of the constitution to accept what the Court says.  You may comment on it, but I am posing that very importantguideline for two reasons.  One is as a commission, we owe a duty to our courts to respect the constitution and therefore their judgment. I just want to point this out to you.  Our greatest president ever, President Mandela, when he was faced with a judgment adverse to him, he said I will comply, even if it means I will go and have to testify when all his lawyers said he should not. Now that is the respect that the constitution demands, and I am just placing that on record, so I am notgoing to continually interrupt you.  I have that duty to the commission, to the constitution and to the country and of course to the judiciary.      I do not want, remember we are dealing with the judgment here, dealing with Mr Molefe.    Mr Mula was the ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Mr Chairperson, I am constrained to raise a number of issues.     Mr Montana, your allegation deal withone issue first.  Your allegation against Judge Francis was put to Judge Francis and he submitted an affidavit.  I do not have it in front of me, but I will tell you what he says.  Firstly, before I do that. As I understand it you say on the day, on the first day of the hearing, that is the day when your application be admitted as an amicus was dismissed.  Is that correct?    He says, sorry.  You say on that day you saw Mr Molefe come out of Judge Francis’s chambers.    As I understand it, the hearing was on the ninth floor of the High Court building.     But whatever floor it was, you say that Judge, you saw Mr Molefe come out of Judge Francis’s chambers.  Well, Judge Francis said ...[intervenes]    Judge Francis says in his affidavit, that at that time he was based on the fifth floor and thehearing as I understand it, was on the ninth floor.  So you could not have seen him, you could not have seen Mr Molefe come out of Judge Francis’s chambers.  You are smoking Mr Montana.    Were you part of that meeting with Judge Francis?    So when you say you were outside, outside where?     Outside the Court.    Yes.  At the Judge’s chambers.  That is where they normally meet.     I am told that the affidavit was served on you.    But you know Mr Montana, and please you must accept that I cannot stand here and allow an allegation, a serious allegation to be made against a judge of this country and when I know what his version is not put it to you. You may respond on a different time ...[intervenes]    I understand.     Yes.     Heard him.    Yes.     But I am going to raise a slightly different issue.  That is the day on which he dismissed your application to be admitted as an amicus.  Is thatright?    Now I understand that you were separately represented in that application.  In other words you had an attorney at least when you brought theapplication to be admitted as an amicus.     Yes.  Now you saw Mr Molefe leave Judge Francis’s chambers on your version.    So your answer is yes?    Did you tell your attorney and your counsel?    Your counsel?    We are not talking about yourspeaking to Mr Molefe.  I want us to deal with the questions I am asking Mr Montana.    Alright.  So did your, what was your attorney’s reaction to that?  I mean this is as outrageous and a commitment to judicial duties as one would find.     This happened, this incident of Judge Francis, you are saying this happened in July 2017.  Is thatcorrect?     I ...[intervenes]      Had you made a complaint to the Judicial Conduct Commission?     Now when did you first see PRASA’sstatus in the Swifambo...?     But was it – it had to be before your application to join this ...[intervenes]      Right.  Now, on your version, that contained not only misrepresentations, it contained... by PRASA’s version.  PRASA’s version before court.  Is that correct?     Did you tell you – this was a R 3.5 billion contract.  Did you tell Swifambo’s legal     But Mr Montana, my question is a different question.  You knew that they have would have information?     Yes.     Can I ask you?  Did you know Mr Auswell Mashaba at that time?     Auswell Mashaba.     Yes, Chair.     The time of the court case.     You knew him?     When did you meet – when did you first get to know him?     That is Swifambo contract?     Now once the review application had been brought, you were aware that if the contract was set aside, Auswell Mashaba stood to suffer severe loss.       Yes.  Did you tell Mr Mashaba    You have gone through that Mr Montana.  So ...[intervenes]      You see, we are talking about a slightly different issue here.  When you found your application to be an...  You have not seen Mr Molefe, on your version, leave Judge Francis’ chambers but after that you became, on what you have said today, that this judgment was made after an irregular communication between Mr Molefe and Judge Francis.    As it please Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Perhaps this is the right time to sayit.       We have submitted what Mr Montana said about in court, the Supreme Court of Appeal judges ...[intervenes]      ...to the President of the Supreme Court ...[intervenes]      ...by the Supreme Court of Appeal.    And we indicate that should they wish to say anything, we would place that on record.  We have not received a response from the... of the SCA.     Chairperson, I should just point out.  In fairness to the judges concerned.     So the public out there does not think that there are judges who regard themselves as unaccountable.     I have little doubt that – they all know that they are accountable and they do regard themselves as accountable.     But in these circumstances, it would be unfortunate to create the impression that there is even – well, not only an obligation – even a judicial duty for them to respond.     Because when one looks at the affidavit, there is not anything specific against any of the judges.       As you wish.      Chairperson , I need to place on record that I have looked now again at Mr Montana's affidavit and in fairness to Mr Montana, he did not accuse any of the judges of being corrupt.  What ...[intervenes]     Judges are being corrupt.     but what he did say is that the judges of the SCA had deliberately lied and eat considered theconduct to be disgraceful but it is, as I say, in general terms but I - in fairness to Mr Montana I do not want it to be said that I looked and didn't correct the record.  it is correct that Mr Montana didn't make that accusations.   And it came about, Chairperson, because I haven't looked at his affidavit...     But it needs to be placed on record.      Chairperson, you have suggested inregard to the Mr Montana's allegations against Judge Francis and obviously against the SCA at one would look at it again after Mr Montana has been given judge Francis’ affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...which I understand he has been given but I accept he - it may not have reached him.     But we will hopefully obviously have to deal more carefully with that because reputations are atstake.      And given what has happened today, the SCA might take a slightly different approach.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, as it has been said that he must keep in our lane.  [laughs]       Yes.  I just want to - now I have finished, Mr Montana, with the rest of what Mr Molefe says in his effort over.  It is at page - in regard to Swifambo - it    No, Chair.       Then Mr Molefe says that of you –    Alright.  Now, then having seen thatthe SCA in the Swifambo matter made reference to what the Public Protector found.  Mr Montana, Mr Molefe deals with her report.  And can we do it in the same way we have done the SCA report?     He says at paragraph 68    Yes.  And of PRASA’s and    As you please, Chair.  Mr Montana, Ineed – and I say this with the utmost respect to you, you have criticised the judgments, the Swifambo matter, you have made allegations about all the judgments.  You have criticised the judgment [indistinct – dropping voice] but this Commission, because it is, subject to the constitution, has to accept the findings of courts of law and until they are set aside on appeal those findings stand and in respect of the Public Protector you know that the Constitutional Court has said until a court has reviewed and set aside those findings, those findings stand.  I am placing this on recordbecause I have heard everything you say, it is on record but in fairness to you I need to say that at the end of the day those are the submissions I will make to the Chairperson.  I do not want to say it in your absence.  We do not have to deal with it today, I have little doubt thatyou will come back but I just placed that on record so you know what my approach to what you have said in respect of those judgments and this report.     As you please.  Then, Mr Montana, you might remember in paragraph 72 and 73 Mr Molefe says that given the Public Protector ’s report he would haveexpected support for the board’s resignation.  Now in the next section he deals with former President Zuma’s attempt to intervene and you know what it is, it was intervene in your leaving PRASA.  I will just read to you – I want to say this to you that there are parts of his affidavit which do not concern you because they happened between Ministers Radebe, Peters and President Zuma and Mr Molefe before you came on, so I am not going to put all those matters to you, I am just going to deal with – and I am not being selective, I am just saying that those are the matters youcan deal with and I would like your comment on it.     So he says at paragraph 74    But can I just ask you because it will come up again.  Your state of mind at the time that you handed in your letter of resignation and then when the board accepted it with that letter that we have read with those conditions which you point out were really meaningless, in regard to your state of mind, you had determined you wanted nothing more to do with PRASA with this qualification, while Mr Molefe’s board was in place.    Okay.  So I just want to be clear,your answer is, my state of mind was that I am not going to go back to PRASA.     And it was unequivocal, in other words there was no doubt in your mind.    Mr Montana, let us get back to theaffidavit now because that does not concern – and I am not being unsympathetic.     I can understand your anger, I just want us to stick in our lane, if I can put it that way.    Right, then in paragraph 75 he says    And then     “The meeting took place on the 20 August 2000.” And that is correct, is it?     “It was initially …[intervenes]     Chairperson, this is an important issue.     And my worry is that we gloss over something and then it comes back to haunt us.     By the – it will not – I do not intend going over everything, Chairperson.     So he says    Okay.  Then in paragraph 76 he says    So were you invited in writing or was it an oral communication to you?     And what did he tell you the purpose of the meeting?    Of July.     The 20 t h.     Let us get back to …[intervenes]     I do not mind, can continue, Chair.    Then at paragraph 76 Mr Molefe     Alright.  But certainly Mr Moodley was not at any meeting on that day that you went there.     No, no, no, I am asking a different – you would know.  If Mr Moodley was at a meeting you would know, I am asking at any meeting that you were.     Now thereafter, from paragraph 76onwards, Mr Molefe described what happened in your absence and we can leave that out.  That is up to     Yes.  Yes but is it correct that Mr Radebe called you into the meeting?     But you cannot dispute and I am just – so that we need not deal with it, you cannot dispute thatthere was a meeting between Mr Radebe, Minister Peters, President Zuma and Mr Molefe before you were called into the meeting.     You see …[intervenes]     You of course would not know what Mr Molefe was told about the meeting and so on.     Or what Ms Peters had been told is the purpose of the meeting.     Now can I just ask you this.  On what Mr Molefe is saying, they were already in the room when you were called in.  Can you recall if that happened?     Okay, so this is now what Mr Radebe says happened at the meeting.  I would just like you toconfirm …[intervenes]     Oh, sorry, Mr Molefe says that it is – it is ten hours later, Chairperson, so I apologise for that.     He says that    He says that    Did not?     Sorry, Mr Montana, I just want us to get through this and you can give your version.     Otherwise we are going to be all over the place.     I understand that.     Oh, did he say that?     At that meeting?     Okay.  So I am just going to say this to you, you know because you have followed this, neither Mr Molefe nor Minister Dipuo Peters recalls that it was Mr Molefe who said it.     Ja, I am challenging …[intervenes]     Yes.     At paragraph 88, second sentence,    Then at paragraph 89 he says    Then he says that he and Minister Peters had gone into the meeting not knowing what the agenda was but it appears that you had been briefed beforehand because you then proceeded to present a long report in which you attacked Minister Peters and him.     Two hours that’s right.      ...[Indistinct]      As you please Chair.  So can I just – and I know it is five years ago, about how long did it – you speak for Mr Montana?     Mr Montana can I ask you about a document called PRASA In Turmoil?  That’s a document which as I understand it you compiled around the 26 t h of July two thousand and ...[indistinct – dropping voice]     Okay, I just want you to be unequivocal about this.  That document you’re aware that there is a document called PRASA in Turmoil?       But you didn’t compile it?    Now I asked the question in thiscontext because Mr Molefe, and maybe I got that impression, seemed to suggest that to a large extent at the meeting you articulated what was contained in that document which he says you had compiled?      Can I then ask you this, on your version, and I am saying this because there is the Molefe version.     On your version you and Mr Molefe left whilst the two ministers and the President continued the meeting, is that correct?     Now Mr Molefe says that the meetingstopped because the President fell off to sleep.  Is that correct?     That is how she put the contextcorrectly Chairperson, that is the one issue that both Mr Molefe and Minister Peters agreed on, that the meeting stopped because the President had dozed off, and they all left the meeting, leaving him alone.     I just want us to understand because I need to put to you the dozing off according to Mr Molefe came at the time when he said to the President, and I know you disagree with me, but I am putting it so that we understand where the differences are, when he said to the President well if you want Mr Montana back you must come and address me and the President was, as he puts it, didn’t take kindly to that, but just soon after that he dozed off and everybody left.   You say that that didn’t happen at all.   And there was no reference on your version to the Board rescinding the decision.  Sorry you shake your head, does that mean no?       Okay, and there was no discussion about the President being invited to address the Board?       Now when you – and you say you andMr Molefe left, but the few minutes ...[indistinct] the President ...[indistinct].  What did you and Mr Molefe say to each other as you left?     I just now again want to understand each of your states of mind.   You are in a state of war with each other, that is the purpose of the meeting as you recall, is that right?     Right, now this meeting takes place and you on your version it all ends well because you and Mr Molefe agree that you will not be attacking each other?     Was there any discussion, I mean it looked like now maybe you didn’t bury the hatchet but it looked like there was some less antagonism between you and Mr Molefe.   Was there any discussion of how there could be a reproachment rather than simply a cessation of facility?     Did you stop attacking each otherthereafter?     Yes.    Chairperson I don’t have it at hand.      Yes, yes.  And I will check it, I will check it up before the next time, that is one of the matters we will raise.     Chairperson I just want to ask one further question in relation to this meeting.     Mr Montana if you look at paragraph 91 at the bottom of page 23 in the second sentence Mr Molefe says – well let’s read the first sentence, he says you spoke disparagingly about the Board, he didn’t respond, we know your answer to that was that that didn’t happen, you didn’t speak disparagingly.     He says something that I would like     Can I just – I thought as you did, I would just like us to read this again, because he says as Mr Montana had threatened to litigate against the Board, he is not saying that the threat came at the meeting, as I read that and then he says although he never followed through so I don’t think there’s a confusion in his mind that the threat was earlier.  What though is there is no doubt inhis mind that he told the meeting that he would reply in court should your threat to litigate materialise.  I just want to know whether that issue was discussed ...[intervenes]      And he didn’t raise it?     So you understand he is not saying you made the threat at the meeting.    Chairperson the rest of Mr Molefe’s affidavit doesn’t deal with any matters concerning Mr Montana so insofar as Mr Molefe’s affidavit goes we haveasked all the questions we want to, subject of course to the matters that are in abeyance, especially about the ...[intervenes]      Affidavit and also in relation to judgment.     Yes, yes Chair.     Chairperson if I can just give a roadmap of what is still ...[indistinct – dropping voice]    It will be and so Montana can prepare for these things, it will be Ms Ngoyi’s affidavit, Ms Mzingwayo’s affidavit and Mr Ollerman’s report.  Those are the matters.    Chairperson can I – I just wanted to finish on a bit of a positive note, in relation to Mr Montana’s affidavit I have indicated to him that there may be a very expeditious way to ensure that his affidavit ...[indistinct – dropping voice] he has agreed to meet – yes and Bongani so that – Ms Msinga, so that we can – it probably won’t be done by Tuesday but at least we would know quite soon how the matter can be brought forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  The lighting does not seem to be very good.  So if somebody could do something about it.  Okay alright ja they will attend to it.  Yes, yes Mr Soni.   Oh and if you are ready to start at least Mr Montana should…    Do the oath ja or affirmation.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    I am sorry okay let us start afresh.  I – if you could speak up a bit I did not hear the answer.  I need to hear the answer.    And you – and it is – I think it does not come out so you cannot raise it.  No but that is fine just try your best – oh okay.  Okay just start afresh Registrar.   I am sorry I did not hear that answer.    Oh okay thank you.  Yes continue.    Thank you Mr Montana; you may be seated.  Yes Mr Soni.    Just one second before you proceed Mr Montana.  I did hear that you might wish or you would wish to make a statement.  I think I have been told there is a statement but I have not had – I have not actually seen it.  It might have been sent to me but I just have not had time and I have not read it.  I normally want to see it if it a written statement so that I can satisfy myself that it is not going to implicate people who have not been notified and so on.  So – so I assume you have got the statement MrSoni?    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.    You have not had a chance to…   Ja.    Ja.  Is that more or less correct it isabout 98 pages?    Ja.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Especially (speaking in vernacular).   Yes.    Well just before you proceed Mr Montana both you and I have just said some things in a language other than Isi-Zulu we need to share with everybody so you must start to say what you said in Isi-Zulu or is it Isi-Xhosa then I will also say what I said.  I will put it in English so that nobody thinks that we do not want some people to understand what …    (speaking in vernacular).    (speaking in vernacular).    Maybe …    Maybe in a friendly you meant you are asking in a friendly way you are not fighting.    In a respectful way.  Yes, yes.    Ja.    Ja.  Maybe before you do that let me say also what I said I simply said in Isi-Zulu that especially because he had just taken the oath literally translated what he said was he was asking in a – what is it – church spirit literally you know or…    It is meant – it is meant to say in a respectful way.  So I said particularly because he had just taken the oath.  That is what I said.  You – you are – I getthe impression that you are now saying well because that statement we have not read and it is long one needs a lot of time.  I am suspecting you want to say can you just be given a chance to say a few words.  Is that correct?    And are not going to implicate anybody.    Yes.  Five minutes?    Ten minutes?    No I – no I have been – I think I cannot say that I have been definite with everybody but generallyspeaking it has been between ten to fifteen minutes maybe twenty but if somebody says I know so and so he went to thirty then maybe that might be happen but most of the time it has been ten, fifteen, twenty minutes.  Is that fine?    Okay alright.    No that is fine I will allow you.  I will take your word that you will not implicate anybody.  Thank youMr Montana you may make your – your remarks.    I am sorry.  You want to say something to Mr Montana?    His mic okay alright.    Thank you.  Remember the promise about not implicating.    Ja okay.   Yes, yes.    Yes.  Thank you Mr Montana for largely not really implicating anybody.  I just want to say to you that I commend the fact that whatever concerns you have with the commission, its legal team or investigators or even with the Chair you have articulated those concerns I believe in a constructive manner and – and I have not seenanything destructive or disrespectful in the manner in which you articulated your concerns.We as a commission should be open to people articulating their concerns about us.  This is a very deep and important commission.  It has got many people, men and women who are quite committed to its work would invest that they fair but we – it would be wrong to – for us to think that we never err – that we never make some mistakes or that everything we say will always be understood in the way we intended.We – I certainly accept that sometimes I may say something intending one meaning and it might be understood in a different way.  So I hear what you have said all I can say to you is I am very keen to hear all sides.  I am very keen to heardifferent perspectives about matters.When I gave judgment in the – or a ruling in the matter of the application by Mr Ajay Gupta for leave to cross-examine some witnesses and I dismissed the application one of the things I said was if they were to come back I would grant them leave to cross-examine.I had no doubt about that as long as they complied with the rules.  I am very keen to hear particularly persons who are implicated in a very serious way.  I want to hear their side of the story before any findings can be made. And where they do not participate it is a pity because I would really prefer to have all – everybody’s perspective.So I can assure you that there is no predetermined outcome I have on anything but I respect everyone’s view but certainly I can assure you of that.  I can assure you that I am looking at all evidence.  I may at a particular time think along certain lines on something but it does not mean I have made a finding.  When I hear another side I am still open to saying oh but that was not right.  So – so – but I – I am happy that you are here.  I am happy that you – you are ready to deal with issues and whatever concerns you have you have articulated and you have articulated them in a manner that is constructive as far as I am concerned.So – so we will continue.  I must just say this because maybe I will not – I might forget you made reference to your affidavit that you sent last year I think …    Oh okay.    No I am used to people saying my voice    So – so I just want to say about that affidavit Mr Montana because I did read it – the whole of it.  It contained a number of things that I was very interested in and I can tell you now and I shared this with Mr Soni then that the impression I had after reading that affidavit was that it appeared that you had taken a decision to really be helpful to the commission.  That was the impression I have – I had and I shared it with Mr Soni.There are a number – there are many matters thatyou deal with in that affidavit that I think are very important and as you know the commission I determined a date when I wanted you to come and testify early in January unfortunately there were issues about annexures and so on but I just want you to know that that is the impression I hadafter reading that affidavit and I want you to know that there are a number of matters in that affidavit that I was very interested in.Indeed the legal team had gone to the extent of even sending the affidavit or portions thereof to implicated persons even though the annexures were not there because the idea was they wanted as I understood it to expedite matters.  So I thought it is important to mention that so that you know it and – and of course there were challengesabout the – there were challenges that we all know – know of.  So – but I thought that that is – that is all I wish to say. But I must also maybe say that you will have noticed that the issue of the – of Werksmans has been brought to the commission and that is because in part because your raising of the matter made it possible for one to say let us have a look because he – he raises this issue he feels strongly about it.  So it has been brought to the – to the commission and – so I just mention that.Okay let us – oh you want to – yes Mr Montana.   Yes.    Or Trillian.    Not McKinsey – McKinsey.    McKinsey ja.    Well let me say this about your affidavit.  Because of where we are in terms of time for the commission I do not know if much can be done if the issue of annexures were to be fixed but I would be – I would be very happy if they would be a way to sort out that issue ofannexures because as I say your affidavit has a lot of things that I think are very important that this commission would like to look into.It is just a pity that we are where we are in terms of time you know.  So I would be very happy I know that between yourself and the commission maybe certain things have been said and all of that but maybe a discussion that we have been having this morning maybe it might just open the way or an attempt to try and sort that out (African language).  Mr Soni you remember the phrasing (Africanlanguage).    Okay.  In a spirit of cooperation and without fighting and so on so – so – because then once that has been fixed one can apply one’s mind to what canbe done with it at the time where we are.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  We are at six minutes to eleven I wonder whether we should just take the tea break now and then – so that when we come back we go straight up to lunchtime?    Maybe we should do that.    Yes okay.    You –     Ja.    And you told me.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja, no, no that is fine.  Let us take a – the tea adjournment now so that we do not start stop, start stop.      We take the tea adjournment now and after that we will go up to quarter past.    Eleven and then we will resume at quarter past and then continue.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    Okay.    What is that we are supposed to start with the witness evidence now.    Mr Hotz what is that?  Put on your mic.  We have been meaning to commence with the witness’evidence. Somebody will help you.      Okay no that is fine.  At some stage I – it would be dealt with there are a lot – quite a number of applications for leave to cross-examination that are being finalised so – okay alright.  Thank you.  That is – yes Mr Montana.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    No, no they are not going to do that today.    Ja.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes well put it this way if you – if subject to issues of time and condonation if you did not previously file anything in relation to it having read what they wrote in support of the application you might when you take legal advice get advice as to whether there is anything you should put before me before I make the decision.  Okay alright.  MrSoni.    Oh was he mentioned in the affidavit?    That we – is not being used today?    Oh as long as he is advised that it is not being used today.    Okay alright thank you.    Let say first Mr Soni what bundle we are using.    For the record.   PRASA Bundle D.  Ja.    Okay.    That – and that will be Mr Popo Molefe’s affidavit?    Okay alright.  Yes.    You can keep your mic on all the time Mr Montana.    It will read 003.    Ja.   On a lighter Mr Montana you say you wanted to step aside or step down at that time?   Okay alright.    Wait before you continue I wanted to say I was not sure whether he said you refused or he simply said you – you never provided the documents.    Yes.    Portfolio Committee.    Yes Mr Soni.   And – and it is not a situation where he might be mistaken about the timeframe where he locates that request – maybe it is a request that happened later becauseI think your – you started by saying you – the request was not made, is that correct?    But you said on your own you had provided a lot of documentation.    Yes.    2014.    Okay.      You must not forget I would like you to make an input on that question but maybe at the right time so – so you and Mr Soni – Mr Soni will also keep an eye as to when the right time would be.    So you can deal with it.    Ja.    Ja.    The red numbers but he – he will not mention the letters and every – and the 0 he will just say 38 so you.   Ja.      The red numbers.  But he will not mention the letter and every and the zero.  He will just say 38.  So you...     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     R 500 million.    Yes.     Mbete.     H’m?     So let me put it in a way I understand it.  Let us take out Mr Molefe for the time being.       And let me start what you said about 13/2014.  I understand you to say.  In respect of the Financial Year 2013/2014, the irregular expenditure was R 100 million.  Is that correct?     Yes.  Now I understand these financial statements to say in respect of the Financial Year 14/2015, the irregular expenditure is – is it R 500 million or ...[intervenes]      Million Rand.  And my understand of that is that whatever it is that had given – that gave rise to that irregular expenditure of R 550 million happened during the Financial Year of 2014/2015.  Are we on the same page on that?    Yes, okay.     Okay.     You accept, ja. MR     Ja.     Ja, h’m.     Ja.     Yes.     To the Speaker.     Well, I think for quite some time now I have not been sure whether it is Workmans(sic) or Werksmans.  So but I think, you know, some people say Werksmans, others are Workmans(sic).  So.       H’m.    Just please repeat that ...[intervenes]      ...at least I can ...[intervenes]      Ja.       [laughs]  Well, on a lighter note.  Somebody else is going to say I am agreeing with you.      [laughs]       [laughs]       H’m?     [laughs]       Just remember to translate those vernacular.  [laughs]       [laughs]  But it looks like it is quite a trend, you know.  Today is what?  When was Mr Mantashe here?       In the course of his evidence, at some stage also, he said the evidence leader [speaking vernacular] or something like that.  [laughs]  He resorted to his Xhosa but quite a few witnesses have done that.     I think Mr Zuma also did when hetestified in 2019.  He would put in some Zulu words.       [laughs]       Hang on, hang on.  Because I seem to remember something.  When you talk about the relationship of being the same people being in the same Whatsapp group.  You are talking about Mr Molefe and Minister...[intervenes]      ...Dipuo Peters.  But I seem to have the impression that you and the Minister we also, at some stage, getting along quite well but that had changed.  So that is why I wanted to know, who now are you talking about?     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      H’m, h’m.     H’m.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes, no, no, that is fine.     Ja.  Also, when you are done, when Mr Soni is done, if there is anything that you think he did not touch on which you think is important, I will give you achance to deal with those.  So you can makes notes as we go along of things that you do not want to forget.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Soni?     Well, put it this way, certainly from my side I hear what you say.  It may well be that later on when I look at it, I might need more clarification but I have heard what you say and Mr Soni, if he needs clarification, he will ask.  If he later on thinks he needs clarification you can be approached to provide clarification.     But the long and short of your answer is that he is not talking here about people that you dismissed.     Yes.     Well …[intervenes]     Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Well, I am not sure how important this allegation is of the dismissal of 500 members.  In the particular paragraph Mr Molefe does not mention the year, as I see it, in the previous paragraph, he is talking about the issue of the 500 million where he refers to 2015/2016 but as I understand it, as faras you are concerned, nobody that – the 500 members of National Transport Movement Trade Union, you say those – the decision to dismiss them would not have been taken by you.  That is one of the things you say.     Yes.     Yes, ja, no, it is fine.     Appeals the earlier decision of the Labour Court.     Ja.    Ja.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja, okay, okay, let us continue.     I am sorry, Mr Soni, maybe one of the things that you should do from your part to facilitate what you want to  - what you were talking to Mr Montana about is maybe do not take too big a junk to put to him.     Maybe more manageable points and let him respond to those points.  Maybe it is going to be better.     Ja, okay.    I think it is paying dividends, smaller points.     Had expired.     Yes but hang on, I think what Mr Soni is doing, he might be coming to the point that you want to emphasise.  He is taking various parts of your points to make sure that he has understood them correctly.     Ja, he might be coming to the point that you want to emphasise.     Ja.  Mr Soni?     Yes, okay, okay.     Yes ,okay.     Okay.     I’m sorry what was the question Mr – just remind me, Mr Soni?     And he said he accepts.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, no, no but Mr Montana, what was the point you wanted to add, just let me hear what the point was?  Yes, you may be, I just wantto…[intervenes].     Yes.     The affidavit.     Oh, that’s why you then…[intervenes].     Ja, no, I think that it’s a fair point for Mr Montana to make if he says in connection with this transaction, in his oral evidence Mr Molefe said this was corruption but when you look at the documents he relies on they don’t support the allegation of corruption, they justsay it’s non-compliance and you can accept, Mr Montana, that both Mr Soni and I understand the difference between something that’s irregular because sometimes it is irregular but there is corruption but sometimes there is no corruption it is just irregular.    So, you can accept that, that we accept ja.     Ja, no, no and we want to hear what you have to say about this thing.  So, the only difference is that we might just go in a certain order, but in the end whereyou feel that there is a certain context that might be lost, ask to make the point and then if we think it should be made later we’ll talk but in the end you will get a full opportunity to make the points you want to make.     H’m.     H’m.     Okay.     Okay, alright, let’s continue.     H’m. ADV VAS SONI     Yes.     Well, maybe just repeat it Mr Soni, because I wasn’t sure also, just repeat it?    No, that’s fine.     Don’t speak too far away from the mic.     Paragraph 23.     I’m sorry, Mr Montana, I don’t know whether it’s you or me.  I thought, much earlier you said your delegation of authority was R100million?     Okay – oh it’s just an example when you made – talk about R100million and R25million, you’ve been talking…[intervenes].     Okay,  I think we are at three minutespast one, I think we should take the lunch adjournment, or did you have a question that you wanted to ask?     Yes, but just at a factual level, I think that’s what Mr Soni’s asking for.  When they say they withdrew your Chairpersonship of the subsidiaries, is that true?     Yes.    Did they – but at that time were you Chairing the same number of Boards of subsidiaries as you had been Chairing when they – when Mr Molefe’s Board came or had the number reduced?     Yes, but in terms of actually withdrawing or…[intervenes].     That did not happen?     Okay, alright.     Yes, and I guess there will be minutes of Board meetings…[intervenes].     Ja.     So, you are saying, the Board did havesuch a discussion and took that view but while you were there, they did not implement that decision.     Okay, alright, I think we must take the lunch adjournment, we are at six minutes past one, let us resume at ten past two.     We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    I am sorry do you want to first announce what document it is Mr Soni?    Ja from who to whom and about what and what date it is?    Ja for the record.    It is much easier so we identify it on the transcript when…   You say it did not happen?    There are still no parties is it not?    Okay alright.    That is 2015?   But when exactly would you say your relationship changed because at a certain time or quite some time you – you have said that you used your fingers to say you were like this I think you said.    Oh him and Minister     Ja you see people who have been given evidence here have been describing their relationships indifferent ways.  Mr Koko was here and he said he and Mr Abram Masango were and as he put it tight you know like that.  He said that is a township lingo they were tight.    But then things changed.  So between youand Mr Molefe you – you were fine you had a good relationship I think that is what you said.    For some time. MR     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.     H’m.  By the February meeting, 2015, was your relationship still fine?     Ja.     Okay.     Ja.    Became hostile.     Ja.    Yes.     So that meeting at Knysna was the ten point?     Is that not the meeting where you say – where you – I think you did not use the word but it lookslike you confronted him.     Oh, okay.     Firm.     Ja.     H’m.     Okay do not go into details now.     Around ...[intervenes]     ...that was happening roundabout when? [Parties intervening each other – unclear.]     Okay alright.  Thank you.     If you – I understood you to say suggestthat he was brought in to ensure that what you and your management were no prepared to do was done in terms of the, I think, cancellation of a certain contract or award?     Yes.  I understood you correctly.    Ja, okay alright.     Ja, that is something else.  Ja.     Ja, okay.     That is page ...[intervenes]      That is in 2014?     Ja.     Mr Soni.     Okay let me interrupt you.  Again, in the spirit of making sure we can make progress.  I think what Mr Soni seeks to do.  I do know that you said earlier onthat Mr Molefe – I do not know if you added Ms Manase and Mr Steenkamp ...[intervenes]      ...was appointed with a particular purpose.  Mr Soni refers to their appointment being irregular.  So I am not sure whether you said that their appointment was irregular or when you said they were appointed or he was appointed for a specific purpose, that is the irregularity you were talking about?     Ja?     With the board before Mr Molefe or ...[intervenes]      Oh, the board before...  Ja.    Ja, its time had expired.     Ja.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay, okay.     H’m, h’m.     Ja?     H’m?     But the point that you want to tell me about, Mr Montana, is the point to support what you say, namely, that you got an impression at some stage that they had been appointed to get rid of you.     But you are saying it is an impression.     Ja, ja later.  That is what I mean.     Ja.     Ja, yes, ja. MR     Ja.     Okay, okay.  That ...[intervenes]      Okay alright.  So, basically, you are saying.  You are not able to say definitively that the purpose of the appointment was to get rid of you but you say after some time you developed – you gained the impression that was the purpose?     Ja, okay alright.  Mr Soni.     Just hold on one second.  Paragraph 31     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.  No, that is fine.  But it might be one of those things you would note for later.     Hang on, hang on.     No, Mr Moodley, you see, the transcript will not show this.  So you mean they were close, they were friends.     Yes, Mr Soni.  Well, I think Mr Molefe did give some evidence relating to …[intervenes]    Yes, yes, yes, ja, okay.     You meant Mr Molefe, you said Moodley.     Yes, no, no, no, I understand what you say but inadvertently you said it is funny that this point is made by Mr Moodley and Mr Fani Dingiswayo.    Ja, that is what I mean, ja.     Ja.     Mr Soni?     And you were not aware of such.     He was associated with it.     Yes, I think you have different reasons. You have given your reasons.     I think.     Mr Molefe says it is because you did notwant to be held accountable and you say that is not true.     A picture …[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes.     Was a turning point.     Yes, yes.     Last time, Mr Soni, when Mr Molefe was here, there was arrangement in terms of which he was to file a further affidavit dealing with certain matters.     Has that been filed?    Oh, okay.     Yes.    Yes, yes.  Okay, alright.     Yes.     Ja.     Thank you.  Yes, continue, Mr Soni.     Yes.    Ja, 49, the last sentence.  Well, there are only two sentences in the paragraph.     Ja.     I think the answer is that is your point, because I think what you are saying is – I think you used at some stage the word manipulation, you know ...[intervenes]      You said what is happening here is facts which have – which don’t create a relationship are puttogether as if there was a relationship between yourself and Mabunda at that time?     And you say at that time you didn’t know him, you were working in the office of the Minister, he...[intervenes]      He was appointed to the Department but you say you did not know him at that time?     Was appointed to the Department of Transport?     That is correct ja.     Ja, I think I understand what you are thinking, you want to make sure a certain perspective is ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Ja.     Let him finish Mr Soni.     H’m, I ...[intervenes]      H’m, you see Mr Montana I have no problem that as long as you have concerns you articulatethat because where you have concerns that need to be looked at, subject to our time constraints as the Commission, we must examine them and where they merit being looked into further they should be looked into further.   If there are good reasons where or why they cannot be looked into further then you can be told this is the situation, so I am going to give, I think Mr Soni wants to say something, but I must also say that well I am told I have – I have seen more than I think 380 witnesses over the past three years who has come and gone here, so Icannot remember everyone, so you mentioned a businessman whose affidavit you say was obtained I think but he was not called or something, so but Mr Soni might or might not know about that, but I – this is what I can tell you that the concerns that you have mentioned I want them to be looked at on their merits and where we don’t agree with you we will say no we don’t think this needs to be – you will be told, where we say no this should be looked at it, it will be looked at.I told you in the morning the issue of Werksmans isnow before the Commission and you had been raising this so – and we although we are nearing the end, we should have finished with oral evidence by end of March we are where we are, we are trying to wrap up, certain things might need to be looked at but each one must beconsidered on its merits.     Okay, alright, Mr Soni?     I think – I think let us do a ...[indistinct] because I can understand why sometimes even though you don’t dispute a particular fact that is being mentioned by Mr Molefe you might want to say something about it, about what he says, because from your perspective maybe itconnects with something else, but let us try I think from Mr Soni’s side he is trying to make sure that as we move on he is clear which allegations of fact are accepted, which are not accepted, but I think let us just try with a little bit – with some flexibility and see how it goes.So you – we will see as we go along, let us try and accommodate each other, I think we will be fine.     No, no that is fine.   We are at four o’clock, we normally take a ten minutes break at four but we also talk about the way forward so that we are all on the same page about how far we go into the evening.  We have been going into the evening for quite some time, evenings for quite some time to try and finalise.I am happy that we go on even up to seven, maybebeyond, what is your situation Mr Montana?     Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Soni how is yoursituation?  Okay, I hope the staff and the technicians they always understand and they accommodate me, but if there is a problem they will let me know.   Thank you very much.I think we have been doing quite well, we might not have been as fast as we would have liked but I think it is fine.   Okay, let us take a ten minute adjournment, weadjourn.  Okay, let us continue.Will the technicians switch this one off please?  It distracts this particular screen.  It distracts my attention.  Yes, okay.  But we can continue in the meantime.     Mr Molefe says.     You said Mr Radebe.     Earlier ...[intervenes]    Earlier Mr Molefe said he was, he joined, Mr Mabunda joined the Department of Public Enterprises when you were in the office of the Minister.      Of public enterprises.    So, okay I think you are right,      That must be the Department of Public Enterprises or not?    Oh, because you have moved?      Ja.     Oh.    But were you paid for the month that youwere not working, thinking you had resigned and then they told you, and they did not accept your resignation?    You want to exercise your right to remain silent?    Ja, well I was just raising it.  You know one can look at it at different levels, you say you resigned but you did not leave.  I understood you to be in effect saying after you sent that SMS of resignation you actuallydid not go to work?    For a month or so.    Ja, more or less.    Ja.     Ja.     Okay, well so maybe there was no resignation but they applied the principle of no work, nopay.     Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Soni?    Just remember not to speak too far away from the mic.      Okay, alright.      Well, I wanted to say Mr Soni read that sentence of page 51.  You said that is true, but I wanted to check whether the part also that says appears to haveemerged as a service provider.  You say it is also true or are you just talking about the fact that later he was awarded contracts in 2010?    Yes.     Ja.    Okay, ja no that is fine.  You made ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Which committee of the board was ...[intervenes]    The tender ...[intervenes]     Okay.    Yes, okay.  So you, the point you are making is that is how you got to know Mr Mabunda more?    Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay.  Mr Soni?   Okay.    Okay.    Okay, that is fine.     But I see here Mr Montana that he says he was ostracised by his own comrades and I am wondering whether you know all his comrades and you know that they did not ostracise him.     You might not know.  Ja, you might not know.    It would be different if he was saying he was ostracised at PRASA or maybe in circles that you know, that you ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Ja, my understanding in regard toparliament and Minister Phitso, was not that he was accusing parliament or Minister Phitso of ostracising him, I think my understanding was that in regard to parliament or the relevant portfolio committee his complaint was were they interested in the fight against corruption that the board was doing, and even when he appealed to them, to intervene and do their job, they were not doing their job.  I think that was, so maybe ostricization relates to outside of those institutions.      Yes.     But you must remember to say that in English.    Because I also do not understand that.    Ja, no I heard that part because you said it in English.    There was the other part, or was or you already translated?   Okay no, no, no.  I think  ...[intervenes]    Okay, thank you.  Mr Soni?    I think Mr Soni, in so far as these are findings that are in the judgments ...[intervenes]     You can just ...[intervenes]     Ja, because ...[intervenes]    Obviously he is not going to say those are not findings.     He will deal with them when he comments on the judgment.    But he will indicate I think when you have read, I think it is about what, three or four more?  Three, four more under that paragraph 59?   And then he can indicate, he can confirm that he is aware that it, they are findings that were made in the judgment.     Ja.     Maybe ...[intervenes]     Mr Soni, I take it Mr Montana you acceptthat the, that 59.1 to 59.4 are findings or conclusions made in the judgment?    Ja, to 59.4.    Yes, yes ja.    Yes, no I accept that you do not agree.  Just to know that you know that they are made.     Okay.    Yes.     I am sorry.  Just repeat what you said?    Ja.    Mr Soni, you had come to a point where he can deal with, comment on the judgments.     Yes.  You may comment, ja?    The affidavits.     And depending on when it was, I might have been ...[intervenes]   On the panel.    So I am just saying, I am not saying do not say what you want to say, I am just saying depending on which year it was, I may have been on the panel, ja.     Have you lodged any complaint with thejudicial conduct committee over the years or not?    Ja.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  No, that is fine.  We in the judiciary always say that we have never said that the judiciary should not criticise but we say it should be fair criticism, it should be well informed you know, be based on facts and not just generalisations and so on. But you have given us your comments on the two judgments.  Mr Soni, do you ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes.     Remember to speak close to the mic.    That answer will not be captured.     Well, what Mr Soni is doing in fairness to Judge Francis who was asked to comment on your allegations and supplied an affidavit, he is putting to youJudge Francis’s version, which is what he is saying.     You might react, you might want to respond to that or he, but he is saying this is the version that the commission has obtained.     Ja.     Have you not been given a copy of the affidavit?   Ja.     Ja.    Yes.     Yes.    Minister Peters    You were told, but you were not given the actual affidavits?    You will get an opportunity.    No, no you can ... you can certainly put it.  All he is saying is he is not able to respond.     But definitely ...[intervenes]    It is only fair that the public who have heard him ...[intervenes]     Hear what the other side of the story is.     So go ahead.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes, no I think what should happen Mr Soni is state what the judge’s version is to the extent that Mr Montana says he has not been given a copy of the affidavit.  Let him be given a copy of the affidavit and he will let us have his reaction to it, and then let us take it from there, but it is important that because he has put his version about the matter, Judge Francis’s version we also know.   Ja, ja.      Mister...?     Auswell Mashaba?     Mr Montana ...[intervenes]      ...so that I can hear you or closer to the mic.     Ja.     H’m?     Ja.     Okay.      Hang on.  Let Mr Montana finish his point.     H’m.    Ja, but your answer is, as you say, you did not because you had no obligation.     Okay.      Mr Soni.     Mr Soni, I think this issue of his allegation about the judge’s, let us deal with it once he has a look at Judge Francis’ affidavit to be – and let him reactin terms of an affidavit in response if he wants to.     Then if – then we can look at how it should be dealt with.  There is a question of the Judicial Committee but there is the question – the issue that it has not been – a no complaint that has been lodged over a certain time but I think let us get that sorted out and then let us then look at it.  But the Judge Francis’ version, I would like you to put its essence or the role of it publicly as well.    So that it is heard.     Well, I do not know if there are any affidavits from those – from ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Well, Mr Soni has told – has mentioned about Judge Francis.  Mr Soni, you want to say anything about the SCA judges?     H’m?     Ja.     Ja ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  So, Judge Francis’ affidavit that the Commission has, the Legal Team will make it available to you and then – to the extent that you reacts to it once – reacts in terms of an affidavit, responding and we will take it from there.  In terms of ...[intervenes]     Ja?     H’m?    Well ...[intervenes]      Well, let me say this Mr Montana.  As you would know by now, the Commission has got a Rule 3.3. Notice process.  That is, if there is some submitted an affidavit or statement that implicates you or may been seenas implicating you, you are given a copy thereof and you are given an opportunity to respond or apply for leave to cross-examine that person and so on.  That is an election.  You are not obliged to do so.  So I have a suspicion that that is what have may havehappened with the SCA judges but it might also be that it was not given as a Rule 3.3. Notice and maybe it was simply given as affording them an opportunity to know that there is somebody who has some allegations or criticisms about their judgment and do they want to say something.  There are, of course, as you know, situations where even if somebody who has been given a Rule 3.3. Notice has chosen not to respond, where the Commission can – the Chairperson can compare and there are situations where people can be issued with summons andso on.  So it depends on a lot of things.  So I think that is the explanation.       Ja? ADV VAS SONI     Ja.     H’m, h’m, h’m.     Ja.    H’m, h’m.    No, no that ...[intervenes]      What would you like to say?     H’m?    H’m?     Ja.    Yes, but hang on Mr Montana.  You are     Yes.     Yes, ja.     Yes.  But also, I must just say.  one ofthe things that one has got to think about in the context of the issues you raise about the High Court judgement and the High Court judge and the SCA judges is that - is the question of to what extent are they all those issues.  Would all of those issues be properly dealt with by theCommission as opposed to going to the Judicial Conduct Commission if we just specifically established to deal with complaints against judges.  So then that is something also that we will have to think about.  Ja.  Okay alright.  we are at two minutes to six.  We normally take a 10 minutes break every two hours.  so let us take a 10 minutes break and then we will continue.     We adjourn.     We will see at seven.  We will see once we are at seven o'clock and talk about whether we continue or not but let us continue for now.  Ja.       He did not accuse any of the charges ofcorruption?     Yes?     Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.     Yes.  No, that is fine.     Affidavit, yes.      Yes, ja.     Yes.     Ja.  No, no that is fine.  AndMr Montana’s clarification that he has not and is not accusing any judge of corruption might be an important factor in considering weather - to the extent that he may wish to ventilate those issues that may be his concerns might be beta dealt with in the judicial conduct committee ...[intervenes]      ...because from the commission's side we have to always keep our eyes on the terms of reference, you know.    So - but let us look at it once he has had a chance to look at Judge Francis’ affidavit.     Yes, we must keep in our lane.  Ja, ja.  Okay alright.  Let us continue.       Yes, you have ...[intervenes]      Ja, he has made his point, ja.     Ja, just to say where it is, to be found.     Sorry, Mr Montana.  Just lower the mic.     H’m.     I am looking at 72.       Yes. “Given all these concerns which had been add the public space, one would have expected that the board’s decision to accept Mr Montana’s resignation would receivesupport from those who cared about PRASA, its employees, the commuters it serves and the public good...”I understand that to mean that given what the Public Protector recorded as having found in the previous paragraphs, the fact that they accepted your resignation should have got support from others that – those who care about PRASA.  Ja.      H’m. MR     H’m.     But before you do that.  Let me tell you what my understanding is.  My understanding of what Mr Molefe is saying here is that although the – I am now putting it in my own words – although the report of the Public Protector may have come after you had left, it related to things that happened while you were Group CEO of PRASA and therefore anyone who becomes aware ofthese findings by the Public Protector and thinking about the fact that they accepted your resignation, if they care about PRASA, they should accept.That is how I understand that.     Okay.     Okay, okay.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     H’m.     Before you do so, can I just establish where that review application is in terms of it being pursued?  It seems a long time.     2016, Adv Madonsela.     Ja.     Before you continue, why should – well, I understand you to be saying to the extent that your review application might not have been finalised, it was because there was the second phase, as it were, of the Public Protector ’s investigation.Now you were not satisfied with certain findings or things about the firstPublic Protector ’s report.  Why could that not be dealt with on its own?     Because, as I understand it, the first one was viewed as final in regard to the matters that it was dealing with and then – or that is the impression I had.     Yes, ja.     Which she could not do.     Because her term expired.    Ja.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     68?     Million, ja, millions.     Ja, you follow the law you …[intervenes]     Okay.     Yes but you have said you have got your review application.     Are you intending to pursue it?    Ja.     Mr Soni?     Yes, let us continue, Mr Soni.     Mr Soni, are you scared that if yousummarised the gist of the matters or version relating to the meeting you might lose some important things?     Ja.    Ja.     Yes, no, no, that is fine, that is fine.     Or maybe, Mr Soni, before you proceed.  Briefly, Mr Montana, before Mr Soni proceeds, how did you come to know about the meeting?  Were you invited?  Who invited you?  What time were you told the meeting would start?     Yes.     Yes, okay, okay.  And what did you – do your remember the time that you were told the meetingwould start?     It was 6 p.m.  That is the time you were told.     Oh, okay.  How long ahead of the day of the meeting or time of the meeting were you invited.  Do you remember?  A day or two or a week or…?     About a day or two.     Ja.     In Pretoria.     Oh, okay, alright.     Ja.     And this was August.     22, I think.     The minister who spoke to you at great length would be Minister Radebe?     Ja, okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Mr Soni, we are at two minutes past seven.  You have been on your feet for the whole day, you have been facing questions the whole day, we have been seated.  I am quite happy to proceed for another hour but I am sensitive to particularly your situations.  How do you feel, Mr Montana?     You are still strong.     Yes, yes.  Okay, Mr Soni.     You do not mind.  Okay, let us go for another hour and see how it goes.  Okay.  Yes, Mr Soni?     Sorry I think, Mr Montana, Mr Soni asked you a question sometime earlier and I am not sure if Iheard the answer, I want to ask the question again.  What had you been told was the purpose of the meeting?     The press conference, yes, ja.     Connected with the fights.     Public spats, oh.     Okay, no, that is fine.  Okay, continue Mr Soni.    Okay.    I think, if I am not mistaken, the occasion when she spoke along those lines, if I recallcorrectly, she said it was prior to that meeting, I do not know whether to say much earlier.     And my recollection is that as far as the meeting is concerned, he may have confirmed that Mr Zuma spoke along these lines, I am not sure.     But I seem to think she was saying – he was connecting this statement by Mr Zuma to what she had told the President on an earlier occasion about people likeyou and others that she thought had skills that should not be lost to the country.     Yes.    So one, are you saying that you and Mr Molefe left the meeting at the same time?     Leaving it not on the basis that you would be called back, there would be some discussion and you would be called back leaving completely for theevening?     And because the President wanted to speak to the two ministers?     The meeting you said should have probably started around quarter past six, I think you said?     It was meant to be six o’clock butprobably started at about quarter past six.     Ja, no, no.  No, no, I mean the one which you attended.  Now on your recollection, how longdid this meeting take more or less?     Because I think both Ms Dipuo Peters and Mr Molefe said, if I am not mistaken – certainly Mr Molefe said it was about two o’clock I think in the morning.  Ms Peters, she might not have been certain but I think she spoke also of the meeting either having ended around that time or certainly after twelve.     Yes, yes, yes, and you think when you – on your version when you and Mr Molefe left it would have been around what time?   Or when you say twelve is it when you left?     Oh.     Ja, but what it means is that you can only talk about when you and Mr Molefe left the meeting you wouldn’t know how long they remained after you left.     Is that right?   Okay so on your version about five hours ...[intervenes]      Four or five hours, and I think both of them if I am not mistaken, that is Ms Dipuo Peters and Mr Molefe, said that you took most of the speaking time, I think the estimate is by one of them, I don’t know if it was both, it was maybe about two hours.     Two hours or so which maybe onreflection might not be most of the speaking time, maybe I am wrong to say that, but they said you took quite some time.     H’m, well Mr Molefe’s version, which I think to a very large extent was corroborated by Ms Peters ...[intervenes]      Was that – was that one, I think MsPeters put it along the lines that your presentation, or whatever you said, made it clear or was consistent with somebody who wanted to come back, that you were talking about how knowledgeable you were with PRASA’s business and so on and so on.  I think, I may be mistaken, but I think Mr Molefe may have been more direct in terms of saying you wanted to go back to PRASA and his version was that – and the President was trying to get him to – that is Mr Molefe – get him to agree that you would be taken back, but Mr Molefe said he was resisting that because asthe Board they had taken the decision to accept your resignation and he said he went so far as the discussion between him and the President went as far as him saying to the President well President you will have to come and address the Board and when I questioned Mr Molefe what emerged was that he was saying well if the President wanted the Board to rescind its decision to accept your resignation you would have to come and talk to the Board, or the President was asking what the rationale was of the Board’s decision to accept your resignation.It was along those lines, and I think Ms Peters was also along those lines, even though she might not have been emphatic, but you are saying, one, you never spoke on the basis that you wanted to go back, two, you say the President never talked about you being knowledgeable...[intervenes]         ...in PRASA’s business, it was Mr Molefe who said that?     Yes, are you saying that Mr Molefe was in a way lamenting the fact that you had left, you had – even though they wanted you to stay for three years, is that what you are saying or not really?    Or he mentioned, he just mentioned it?     And so on your version the discussion, was the discussion about the two sides, namely Mr Molefe and yourself, stopping the public spats.      Okay.     Well was the substance or gist of whatyou said, you say it was a report or a report back, was it about what you had done at PRASA, what the state of PRASA was when you left and what the challenges of PRASA were as you knew them when you left, was it along those lines?     H’m, Mr Soni?     It is important to clarify this.    You may be saying it is correct that what – it is correct that’s whatMr Molefe said, or you may be saying it is correct that the meeting ended when – because the President had fallen asleep?     Which one is true?     Okay.     Ja.     He came back?     Unless of course – unless of course they are talking about – he is talking about what happened after you had left but you say you left with him, Mr Molefe?     Yes, because it is interesting because both Ms Dipuo Peters and Mr Molefe spoke on the basisthat everybody left at the same time, it was I think on Mr Molefe’s version around two am, and when they left the President had dozed off and was sleeping, that is what both of them said.   Am I correct Mr Soni?     None of them spoke – testified about any of the participants in the meeting having left earlier than others.     Yes, Mr Soni?      Was that a yes?     At the meeting when the two of you left on your version, was there a formal pronouncement, maybe I shouldn’t say formal I should say clear pronouncement of what the conclusion was, you had been invited to thismeeting to try and resolve the public space, was there a pronouncement articulated as to what the outcome of the meeting was?     There was on such?     H’m, but did you know that because you – that’s what you were told at the end before you left the meeting, or that’s what the two of you just understood?     A jabbing? MR     Not physically.     Outcome?     H’m, it just seems a little strange to me that when the President, Minister Radebe maybe a minister, Dipuo Peters, prior to the meeting were very concerned about the so-called public spat which was between yourself and Mr Molefe, that they should allow asituation where you leave the meeting before there is a clear outcome about this issue of the public spat.   You ...[intervenes]      No that’s fine.  Mr Soni I don’t know, I am aware that the Commission did ask Mr Radebe to provide an affidavit and give his version of the meeting    But I don’t know whether you have got it because it would be interesting to see what his version is compared to the two.     But you know of it?     No that is fine.    Ja.     Minister Radebe’s affidavit.     Ja, okay no that is fine.  I think we should stop at this stage, obviously we have not finished.   Tuesday next week is available, there was a witness who had been scheduled but had to change and some otherdate that would have been used by another witness that will be given to him, so how is your availability on Tuesday from the morning?     But you would avail yourself?     Ja, okay Mr Soni are you okay?     Okay let us adjourn your evidence then, further evidence to Tuesday.   Let’s start at half past nine, let’s start at half past nine ja.     Yes.     Okay, that’s fine.   Thank you very much Mr Montana for your cooperation so that we could work right into the night, thank you Mr Soni and your team, thank you to the staff and the technicians, thank you to everybody for all your cooperation, I know it is Fridayevening and Mr Montana was saying earlier on it is Friday and for young people, so I am hoping that the young people in this room don’t say hey you know these people who are not young anymore they forget that it is Friday, but I just want to thank everybody for all your cooperation toassist the Commission to try and finalise everything.     Ja, well I think that if the spirit thatcharacterised today’s proceedings is anything to go by that issue is going to be sorted out at least, it is just not going to be a problem, and I think it just shows what happens when everybody has a constructive and positive approach and attitude to issues, so I have no doubt it is going to be sorted out, so thank you very much to everybody once again.I must just announce for the benefit of the public that on Monday the Commission will be hearing the evidence of the Speaker of Parliament, Speaker of theNational Assembly as well as the Chairperson of the NCOP on the issue of Parliamentary oversight.And then in the – that will be during the day in the evening Mr Mantashe will come back to finish his evidence representing the ANC.  We adjourn.

MR MONTANA:  Tshepo Lucky Montana.   Not at all.    Correct. That is correct.    Sorry Chair I am too tall  the system is just a bit – sorry about that.    Tshepo Lucky Montana.    No.    I do.    I said I do Chair.    So help me God.    Thanks Chair Mr Soni you – you probably have been interacting with the commission in the last few days and I requested I think on Monday I requested the opportunity to make a statement.   I received an email yesterday I think it was just after lunchtime in the afternoon I thought I just going to make – jotted comments at the beginning before we start Chair and I was told that no you can – you can make your statement but if you – if you submit that and I think I have been in interaction with your team and sent them emaileven in the early hours of this morning Chair because I think – Chair I think there has been a lot said about the – about PRASA, about me and I think it is more than fair that I be afforded opportunity to – to address a few things that are of concern to me.Chair I have honoured notwithstanding the fact …    It is about 98 pages.    Chair indeed.  I – the intention is not to read the full statement.  Chair you would recall that I have raised numerous concerns about the process that we have embarked upon.    At the commission.    And Chair I think let me say that the commission told me I think it was at five past twoyesterday that if you want to make a statement it must be a written statement submitted.  And I submitted it – it is true because I had to sit down and write the statement in the early hours of this morning.  And I know Chair that the procedure is very important.    (Speaking in vernacular) Chairperson.    That…    Indeed Chair indeed Chair.  So I think I would appreciate Chair I promise I am not implicating anyone.    Beyond what I would have said in my otheraffidavit that is the subject of discussion and debate between myself and the commission.    Chair I am not sure if I can try.   (speaking in vernacular) I can translate Zulu I am Pedi.    (speaking in vernacular).      You are better placed Chair.    In a respectful manner Chair.   That we may not have – because of the time.    That I have received.  Chair I mean let mebe very frank.    (Speaking in vernacular).    Indeed.    Indeed – indeed Chair I will appreciate that indeed.    No Chair.   Chair I think we – I thought you were working on averages of thirty minutes Chair for…    Chair no I think that is fair I will respect that.    Thank you.    Thank you Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice for an opportunity to address you today.  It was in my initial application Sir to address a wide range of issues facing our country here today that is beyond the challenges of PRASA.Those of us we had the opportunity to serve in government, in leadership positions. I think we have got the duty when we come here not implicate other people, not to attack other people, not to deal with the real issuesfacing the country and I think in the course of my testimony today I wish to do that.Deputy Chair – Deputy Chief Justice behind the story of PRASA there is a story about our people.  It is a story about the possibilities that we have as a country. And I think it is very important that we – we ready to take time to discuss it.  I know that a number of issues have been made.  I have expressed my reservations.  I have made the statement Deputy – Deputy Chief Justice that I find the commission biased.  I find the commission pursuing a predetermined agenda and I want to put those on record today.What I mean by that because I think it is very important and let me put on record that I had serious reservations Advocate Soni.When I received thisparticular summons because – because I would be having an on-going battle with the commission.  I have prepared an affidavit.My interaction with this commission there is nothing to do with the allegations made by Mr Popo Molefe, by Ms Ngoye and Mr Ollerman.I wrote to the Chair on the 26 t h of July 2019 asking for an opportunity to testify highlighting a whole range of issues that I intended to address.  Chair the commission came back to me at that time they wanted to curtail myevidence.  They wanted me to take some parts that deals with the appointment of Werksmans Attorneys and a whole range of investigators.I followed the commission very closely Chair and I have taken issues with a number of – with the way in whichthe commission has addressed issues and I again respectfully Chair you said in one of the statements that there will be a time when we have to sit and face each other to – face each other …    Thank you Mr – thank you.  Thank youAdvocate thank you.    And Chair I – I think that the issues that I wanted to raise relates to how the commission and I am afraid Chair that some of the issues that I want to raise relates to some of the comments that the – as Chair and you know it was a difficult thing.  I said how do I say this without – tell the truth, be forthright whilst at the same time respecting the Chairperson and respecting this particular commission.Chair let me – let me indicate that the way in which    Indeed Chair I – (African language) on this unfair thing because I think that is the crux of the thing.    Sorry – sorry Chair I will move this piece.  Chair that money ended in my affidavit I asked the commission please subpoena the accounts of Popo Molefe because he – Popo Molefe has been one of the best witnesses here, the most preferred witness of this commission.If you calculate the amount of time when before the – the lockdown Chair you ask Advocate Soni here you said him, how much time do you want with this witness?  He said thirty minutes.  He went to a four days Chair he had –he had four days and he was called across beyond PRASA itself.  Popo Molefe had the most amazing time here.Yet this commission is revisioned to ask about all the unlawful things that he has done some of them we have laid charges.I have opened a case at Brooklyn police station.  Chair this commission did something other than the NPA the manipulation on the NPA matter – HAWKS and the NPA matter.  Advocate Soni says to me here today he wants me to respond to the issues raised by your own investigator   But I think that I find the commission highly – highly compromised because these issues is not just – I mean there are instances  which shows Chair.  I know people have said ask for the commission for theChair to recuse himself.Chair for me I am raising issues I do not even want here I am happy that you are Deputy Chief Justice you are chairing this commission.  But also I am saying Chair like – and we always say that when someone is in a position ofleadership, a position of authority and this would be my final point it is God and it is those who have given birth to you – (African language) and (African language) but none Chair I am a child of somebody.   I am born, I am a son of Karee Stephen Matlala (African language) these are people who gave birth to me and they hear this commission making serious attacks on me  Some of them so factually incorrect and I think during the – throughout the – this testimony and answering questions I will be able to do that.Chairperson (African language) and this – these are not cowards.  Both Bakoni Matlala (African language) these are warriors Chair in history and their blood in my blood veins here are not cowards.  It is the Matlala’s, it is the Kekana’s, it is the Montana’s.   Chair and I think that we should be – and when we deal with these issues I want to show this commission but this – this affidavit that I placed it defines Chair the starting point.  Not because I do not respect you Chair I do not respect the Advocate Soni but I think a lot of things Iam going to take them head on based on the evidence and I hope that the commission will treat me with the kind of fairness and give me the space in the same way that you have given Popo Molefe in particular.For all the hearsays he was not there when PRASAdid all this work Chair so I put that Chair as an opening statement and hope that we will deal with some of the issues in the course of the – of the conversation.Thank you Chair.    But voice Chair.    Indeed Chair.  Chair I think we should – we should proceed but …    But I am actually pleased to hear Chair that in respect of the matter of the affidavit because thiswas the issue that I was going to raise today that I prepared an affidavit and it recalled that my affidavit was not prepared in response to any allegation.Popo Molefe testified in March eight months after I have approached the commission after I had given the commission and I said I want to assist the commission with information that I know in my role in government from public enterprises when we restructuring all the state owned enterprises to transport and my life in PRASA and I said I am willing to do that Chair.The problem with the summons today is that it invites me – my affidavit has not been admitted as evidence and we know the commission has spoken Chair about my annexures and I will not drag the issue but I just want to put it on record.  Chair the – when I submitted my affidavit as I have said I think you have seen it is a 447 page affidavit and I said I do not want to burden this affidavit I will submit my annexures separately and I think I worked to the commission.  They came to my house to collect all thepapers.  Every number links to – oh and the annexures links to the issues that are there.  The commission has said to me no but these things are not properly marked or numbered and I said no, no it is fine let me work with the commission so that we correct allthe – what you saying is not properly marked or numbered so that – the commission said to me Chair you did not use what you call it established practice – the format that we use.  And I asked Chair can I have this format so that my annexures are in line with what the commission requires?  It has taken me over three months and I have realised that not such format exists Chair.  So I am pleased Chair that I think that your words are assuring, that you have looked at the commission and Chair I am not raising the issue of Werksmans and to talk aboutirregularity.In fact the conclusion of my annexure I – because this impact on our – on our democratic dispensation as a country and I say in my -  in my affidavit there in my conclusion the work of this commission would be incomplete without it looking deeper because it is not about irregular and fraudulent expen – appointment.It is Chair about the fact that I submitted this evidence, a lot of reports that shows that Werksmans and the companies working with them have actually based theirreports including those that they have given to the HAWKS through irreg – unlawful surveillance activity.My house has been broken a number of times.  My son nearly died.  So these are matters of life and death but is the – the matter we discuss of the HAWKS and NPAactually shows the extent to which democratic institutions can actually be manipulated to achieve nefarious goals as it were and that is the spirit in which I am raising the Werksmans issue.But Chair thanks very much that you have said you will have a look at it and I am hoping that the commission will engage me so that go deeper because in each and every – after every paragraph I put an annexure to support.You ask Chair finally you ask some of your witnesses here Mr Koko the commission ask him Mr Kokowhy do you interact with is it Regiment Capital when the contract is with McKinsey or whatever it is called?    Or Trillian.    Exactly those parties Chair.    But that was the point that Advocate Seleka took on here with Mr Koko.  You will see Chair when we say Werksmans has been paid R350 million weactually refers to companies that are not contracted to PRASA but who are contracted by Werksmans.Some of them their job simply to chase after me, break into my houses so that they can try to find anything that they can – so that I can be prosecuted through whatyou call manufactured charges and trumped up charges Chair.So I am glad that we open up this thing then we are dealing with the real state capture that we should be looking at Chair.  Thank you.    Chair I – I unfortunately I represent myself as well on the legal side.    But Chair I think I would – I would also take legal advice on this issue.  I have welcomed the – when thecommission alerted me to the fact that Werksmans wants to cross-examine I said no I welcome in fact there are a lot of things that the – I think that it would be good for them to cross-examine me.  Chair but they – they can do that only on the basis of my affidavit.   I am here to reply to respond.    Yes, no Chair I accept that.    But I am saying even procedurally.    It is on the basis not of my response to Mr Popo Molefe but it should be under basis of my affidavit which is not the statement.  So I think – I think Chair we willdeal with it at the right time.    And I will take legal advice once you have made your decision Chair.    I have got it thank you.    Thank you Chair.    On the top.    Top right.    3 ja.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair but the – that was not on our first – on our first meeting ja, but that is correct, you are right.    It is relevant Chair because we – I think at the first meeting it was immediately after Mr Molefe had been appointed the whole board had been actually appointed by cabinet.   There was a cabinet statement issued and I thenobtained his mobile number; called him to congratulate him and made arrangements to go and see him.  He was playing golf at the Gauteng Golf Estate.  He had arranged a venue – met there.  I introduced myself.  We spoke about the history – where we come from and how I know him particularly as ayoung activist in the UDF in the 1980’s and then I left – I gave him three documents.  I said these are your bedtime readings.  It is not the board induction we will have a board induction at the right time.   I gave him the strategy of PRASA what they call a corporate plan.  I gave him some of the documents dealing with the – with our modernisation program and I gave him our document outlining our real estate strategy and that is how we parted ways.  He says I will read and then we start with the process and we will have an induction.  So the – the issue about me intending to resign I raise it of course a few months later and this is after Mr Molefe had said to me, you know we think got a new board you must sit with us one of the three years.   And I said no and there is a reason for that I think at a later – in the course of the conversation we will come to that Advocate Soni.  But the reality is I said to him at that time that look I have been here for almost ten years.   My health is not good I want to step aside and everything but there will be subsequent meetings wheresome of these things were dealt with but the – but – so that was not the – in the first meeting but it happened almost within the same – more or less the same time – timeline.    I wanted to do both Chair step aside but I still have thirty days in respect of the step aside the rule Chair.    Chair indeed that – that happened.  Mr Molefe had wanted me or rather suggested to me that I should stay at PRASA for another three years.    Chair the – the ambitious program to modernise our railways was of course underway at that timewhen Mr Molefe arrived.  The R172 billion investment would have been over a 20 year period and not 40 years.  Over ayear period.    20 ja not 40 years.    No that is correct Chair.    No Chair that is not correct.    No, no, Chair we had a – an inductionprogram.  This induction program addressed everything.  It was addressed by – firstly by me – we welcomed the new board where I briefed the entire board on the strategy and we gave them two big files.  So the one on the strategy side summarising thoseissues and the other one was address – were issues addressed on the – on the regulatory legislative side which was addressed by the Company Secretary Mr Lindikaya at that time.    Chair I – in fact on the day he said that I was sitting here listening.  I came especially for that and I want to say that it is a – and he said I refused to cooperate with them.  That is false Chair.  How would I go and see thechairman at the golf estate, offer him documents about PRASA when we welcome him.  And then a few months later I withhold documents.  I – for me it did not make sense.  There is no objective basis why I withhold this.Chair let me say the PRASA modernisation program and I think that is…    Chair even that is false.   I had – we actually provided so much information if there is one thing is a weakness and you can see Chair I wrote these statements in the early hours of this morning.  I provide information and – and there was noreason because we – you see we were not involved in criminality. There is no reason for us to hide documents and do these kind of things.   So Chair it is not – his assertion is  - is so incorrect – it is wrong and I do not know where – where he finds that – where he finds that – where or how he can make such a statement.  He got all the information including regular quarterly meetings of the board.   I wrote detailed reports and annexures on issues that the board had to deal with.  There are contracts of course –if we deal with one contract the rolling stock renewal program the R53 billion to replace the entire fleet of MetroRail.   I mean these documents are with lawyers it was – they were so big I do not even carry those documents.  But they were accessible to the board.   Let me – let me hasten to add though Mr Soni Mr Molefe and I when we were invited to Parliament and I cannot recall the date now to brief and he has just joined PRASA to brief the Standing Committee.   The Standing Committee on Appropriation.  It was chaired at that time by Mr – Mr Paul Mashatile.  We went there; I briefed the committee; I presented to the committee and then he opened of course and said the CEOwill take us through a presentation.  At the end Mr Molefe then in fact was saying – was talking about the rolling stock program more specifically that you know we have even investigated this matter and we find that it is perfect it is done in a proper way.Now Chair I did not know that was in – it was being investigated.  For the first time just three months of Mr Molefe – of Mr Molefe being in PRASA I heard in Parliament from his own statement that they have investigated this issue and they are satisfied with the fact that this contract wasdone properly.Chair when we deal with the Werksmans issues we are going to come to this particular issue.  Mr – so it actually shows that the relationship in my affidavit I say there is a network and this I want to bring you to – to this particular network that has been in operation including the fact that they started investigating me when I was still at PRASA without actually even any board resolution – board resolution to that effect.Chair I want to assure this committee I am – I havegot my own shortcomings and the witnesses but I respect authority and that is why when Mr Molefe was appointed the first thing I did was to congratulate – to welcome him, congratulate him.  It was not – I would have waited – I could have waited for the board induction when they came atPRASA.  I followed him to where he was and said Mr Molefe – I even told him that he inspires me Chair and I think he mentioned that point because the relationship with Mr Molefe even though he did not know me personally at that time but there is a long history to it which I think may not be relative at this – at this point in time.Chair – Chair there is no reason why I would withhold any information from Mr Molefe for the board as they – as they were a properly constituted board of PRASA.    Not on his.    Chair I want to say that is – and Mr Molefe knows he is probably watching this he knows that this – that is not correct.   Chair.    At my own initiative Chair.    Chair let – let me say the relationship and I deal with this at length in my affidavit.  My relationship with Mr Molefe when he became chair between August until   August 2014 until November – end of November we had a very good relationship.  We had one on one meetings.  Well then we had one on one meetings in fact most of the meetings were not even taken place at PRASA.  They were taking place at his offices – he is a director of Lereko Investments which is based in Illovo and most of the meetings were happening there.But Chair I will explain in the course of this – of this testimony.  I knew why Mr Molefe was there.  You heard thetestimony of – of former Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters, Mr Peters spoke about you ask a question to Mr Molefe in March you ask him what happened in the relationship, why things were good and why things turn bad?   Chair I do not know if this is the right time but I wantto help you understand, answer that question for you because both Mr Molefe and Mr Dipuo Peters did not provide you with the right answer.    Outside in the streets Chair on a lighter note to say at that time it was the same Whatsapp group and then it went the other way pear shape and that is why we have the kind of problems that we are talking about Chair.  So he did – he did not make any mistake Chair he just know that his assertions – his statement to thecommission was not correct.    (Inaudible).    Thank you Chair.    Chair you know sometimes when you do things as an afterthought because you want things to fit into each other you say things like that.  In 2014 we had a delay to our audited financial statement.  Not because of management problems Chair no because there was a huge issue between us and the AuditorGeneral at that time.  It had to do with the locomotives.  As you know the locomotives Chair we are going to talk at length about that.  The locomotives were – were – Chair we unlike the commuter trains which we build a factory but the locomotives 88 of them but we ended up contracting for 70.  They have to be built in Spain and I know there has been a lot of debate about whether we should have built them or not I think at the right time again I will deal with that issue Chair to show the issue of public interest.We never faced this challenge about the R500million.  Chair when I was at PRASA and I know that Mr Molefe painted a picture – he does that at the end of his paragraph as an organisation that is dysfunctional, that has got weak controls or non-existent and many individuals deployed in strategic positions lacked the required skills toadequately fulfil their roles. You know this PRASA I do not know Chair.  I was at PRASA I was CO for nine consecutive years. We have never had a qualified audit when I was at PRASA.  This was not conveyed to this commission and that is very important because there may not have been – have been – there may have been audited financial statements and annual reports and the Auditor General making certain findings but when the audit was delayed in 2014 the Auditor General said to us we want to travel to Spain to go and verify the components thathave been bought and everything and see how they should be treated in the accounting – in the statements of PRASA.  Okay – that is what the Auditor General said.We then agreed; we prepared for the trip.  The Auditor General then came back to change its position and said no we want PRASA to treat the Swifambo transaction as a pre-payment together with the other rolling stock program and if you do not do that we will disqualify – we will disqualify oh sorry we will qualify the financials to PRASA.This was towards the end and this board has justjoined.  This workshop that the Chair is referring to is actually the first induction workshop and it is at that meeting that we indicated to them that we may need a special agent Audit and Risk Management Committee of the board to meet to deal with this particular issue.So when I read and listened to Mr Molefe sitting there; up there manipulating these facts to convey to the commission that we have got this dysfunctional entity.  No that is not PRASA Chair. The PRASA that we – that we formed and I played a leading role in this establishment had major problem there because our railway system was falling apart.  But I will tell you Chair that when I was CO of PRASA some of my former colleagues are here if a train does not move old – this old trains and I do not get the satisfactory response themanagement knew that I will act.  They know that I will fire them and ask them to say let us get them to the trains in the early hours of the morning so that we can deal with the real business of this organisation.So Chair this picture that is being presented here that the commission should look at the – at these entities as being – you know if there is one entity that I think South Africans notwithstanding its many challenges should have been proud of.  I think one of them should have been PRASA and take out Montana there and deal with this entity and Ithink in my statement I detail some of the things that we have achieved and I deal with what happened the period after.So Chair we never heard.  I only appeared to in    Did not assist the commission it was trying to create and it was – it was a political statement more than providing the commission with facts.  Unfortunately I had written my affidavit before he make these allegations but I did later incorporate some of those things.It is false Chair.  The reason why the AuditCommittee is not R500 million – it is not a R500 million which came at a later stage but it has to do Mr Soni with the fact that the Auditor General wanted to change what you call an accounting treatment of how we treat locomotives.So if PRASA pay Swifambo money and this money goes to Vossloh and they buy an engine from another company now that engine is in Spain but PRASA had paid the money how do we treat that in the books?So there was a debate about that which impacted on the financials and not irregular expenditure or stealing ofmoney as being projected here or lack of controls Chair.And so it is not correct Mr Soni     Remind – PM – remind me Chair we are using the numbers at the top is it not?    Page 38?    Yes but I am saying this – this financials which financial year is this?     Yes Chair but that confirms my point.  In 13/20 – 2014/2015 the financials the irregular expenditure R100 million.    Then what happened is that I left in July before the financials were drafted.  The only let us know Chair I will not even accept that.  I work with the office of the Auditor General but I go into the details of the business including you know getting ...[indistinct – dropping voice] at a later stage but it has to do, Mr Soni, with the fact that the Auditor General wanted to change the – what do you call it – accounting treatment of how treat locomotives.  So if PRASA paid Swifambo money and this money goes to Vossloh and they buy an engine from another company.  Now that engine is not stable but PRASA takes the money.  How does it sit in the books?  So there was a debate about the in the financials and not the regular expenditure or stealing of money that is being projected here or lack of control, Chair.  So it is not correct Mr Soni.     PM...  Remind you, Chair, we are using the numbers ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]      38.     Yes, but I am saying this financials – which financial year is this?     Yes, Chair.  Ja, but that confirms my point.  In 2014/2015, the financials says the irregular expenditure is R 100 million, Chair.  Then what happened that, I left in July before the financials were drafted.  I will not even accept that.  I worked with the Office of the Secretary General but I go into the details of the businessincluding, you know, giving advices from people in the accounting field.  That goes to say what does that mean, okay?  And they fought – I always fought with them.  respecting the office but making sure that they get the right– and so these financials do not support Mr Molefe’s view(?).  It is supposed the fact that after I have left in 14 – in 2015, July.  When they finalised, they added in the irregular expenditure.  Chair, you raised a concern.  I think when Minister Peters was here, you were also very strong on that point.  Correctly, so to say how can irregular expenditure increase so much to almost R 20 billion and nothing was being done.  Chair, at the right time I want to deal with it.    Because I have also got a scientific answer to that particular issue.  So it is not correct. So this is a record after - and there have been agreements between in my absence.  Sp.     Chair, I do not think - Mr Soni, we should be partial(?).  Let me perhaps explain it systematically without even diverting on other issues.     There is 2014.  I am saying the financials – the Commission is being – or rather, the AG, the Auditor General’s findings for 2014/2015 was?     R 500 million for 2014/2015.     And if you look at Mr Molefe’s statement, he is definitely conflating the financials of 2014/2015.  In 14, what caused the delay was the accounting treatment and the auditors had pros(?).  In 2015, it is a different matter altogether, okay?  So there is nothing wrong with what you pointed.  There is a record.  I am not challenging it.  There is a letter, though, that I have written for – to challenge the financials.  I have written to the Speaker ofParliament, Baleka Baleka ...[intervenes]      Mbete.       Where I actually argued and wrote atlength that the financials of PRASA is presented by the Board of PRASA actually are wrong and they are misleading both Parliament and the users of the reports.  So I think, Mr Soni, the – when – the audit for 2014 was finalised which was the year.  So Mr Molefe joined in August.  We had the delay.  So it means he would have list(?).  If he joined on the 1 s t of July, he would not have been part of the 2014 – what is it called – auditor financial statements because they were getting approved by the board submitted on the21 s t of July.  But because there was a delay about the accounting treatment, so it then went to his board.  Now the amount that we are dealing speaks to 15.  So this is correct.  It does not support – what is it called – it does not support...  It does not support the assertions by Mr Molefe because he is actually referring to the – the R 500 million speaks to the 2015 Financial Year.     Yes, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    Chair, no, certainly we are.     We are Chair.     So that I accept.     ...made their own findings based on theevidence that has been presented to them and that is why the 2015/2016 Financial Year at the - what is it called – the irregular expenditure by PRASA ...[intervenes]      ...are factually(?) challenged, Chair.    Because – you see, when the auditors come – and let me put it up front so that when Mr Soni takes me through he understands what my point is.     Chair, at the heart of my letter to the Parliament to ...[intervenes]      My letter to the Speaker of Parliament which I copies to the Chair of SCOPA, Mr Themba Godi.  Isaid PRASA made serious misrepresentations because immediately when the first R 100 million story and later then became R 14 billion.R 500 million, it went to R 14 billion in the next year.  I then took a report to the Auditor General to analyse it.  It was not a trust(?).  Chair, I found something very shocking.  Actually, I did the calculation.  That the twelve out of the R 14 billion, R 12 billion of that amount was actually with irregular expenditure.  The auditors mention in their report that the accounting authority and management failed toprovide them with records though the payment had(?) a contract and all of those things.  They speak about the limitation of scope in their duties and what happened, therefore, is that – then they started to declare all of these things as irregular.  Now, weknow these contracts are there at PRASA.  We know in the financial statements the payments that PRASA does.  They can pull out those numbers and give it to them.  Then Popo Molefe went out to the media, Chair.  We are finding a lot of corruption.  R 14 billion.  And some of that, by the way, R 4 billion of that R 14 billion - R 4 billion(?) of the R 4 billion(?), Chair, has happened in the year that he was Chair.  Number one.  Number two.  He then went to – back to 2012, okay?  If you want to destroy a country and an organisation, you must dothat Chair.  When we formed – when we informed PRASA in 08 – I had a session with the auditors, Auditor General.      Chair, I want to call them the way I call them when I speak to my people Malamute.       But it became Werksmans the time for PRASA.  What is this Werksmans?  What are they doing at PRASA?  Mr De Voor(?) writes a letter, Chair, to Mr Molefe     Let me repeat, Chair ...[intervenes]      Because I can see you change your faceChair.     Again – and I like that Chair because this point is very important.     Exactly.     I think you are in this difficult position Chair.    But Chair I was watching again without digressing Chair.     I was watching a movie, this Nigerianmovie.  So this chap was talking and the other chap is a chief.  He does not like what he is saying but this chap indicated the chief does not – so he changes the facial     Chair, let me go back.  These facts – the Minister of Transport should not ask about the payments of Werksmans in the irregularity because normally oncontracts of this nature, we will charge 10% of the value of the work that they are doing.  So that it tells you Chair is that they do not only appoint Werksmans regularly.  And then in my affidavit I thoroughly demonstrated that actually the appointed Werksmans fraudulently.  Up to paid work for Werksmans, they then raised the numbers.  The higher the irregular expenditure and wasteful expenditure at PRASA.  So 10% of R 100,00, Mr Soni ...[intervenes]      Chair, it is R 10,00 or whatever if mymultiplication is right.Ten percent of R 14 billion [speaking vernacular] Chair.  So Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]      Chair, I will try, hey.    [laughs]       I do not know whether the ANC thing(?) Chair or ...[intervenes]      ...we learnt(?) it from there.  But Chair the response is extraordinary.  Here is the Minister who is accountable for PRASA.  And at that time, the relationship, it was no longer the same Whatsapp group.  It has gone – then Minister Dipuo Peter then writes some very hard letters.  PRASA is falling apart.  The board is not focussingon the right things.       Minister Dipuo Peters.     You know Chair ...[intervenes]      ...every time I talk about the elders and Ithink at some stage when we come to the meeting with the President because I laughed, I was told it(?) stopped for many hours.  The President fell asleep and everything.       My grandmother, Nonallele(?), she would teach me, Chair.  If I speak to an elder in a manner where I do not show respect and that she has taught me the principle, an elder is right and if they are wrong, you are to accept it.  Minister Dipuo Peters, Chair, I showed her my support and respect.  I left the testimony here, okay.Because she told the truth but she forgot one fundamental truth, Chair.  And that fundamental truth was the fact that her and Popo Molefe were working together...Chair, and I elaborate on this in my affidavit – and at that time we must look at the speeches at the AGMof PRASA immediately after I have left and a year later when that relationship changed.  Mr Molefe – you know, Chair, let me put it bluntly here.   Popo Molefe was appointed, Chair – he was appointed Chair of PRASA because I and my chairman, Mr Sfiso Buthelezi refused to accept that I am a lawful instruction to cancel an award, not a contract at that time, an award of a contract – an award for the new trains that we build because our people – I always say in my affidavit, it is very clear.  PRASA was destroyed by greedy ANC politicians putin light and award to a company.  Do even tenders – why do you appointed the French?  And I said to them change the laws and tell us that we should not appoint imperialist or multi-national companies because you are part of a well-oiled trained organisation.  You have signed things.  I was not even there that you are even going to allow these companies to – when they win you cannot say you do not like them.  Chair, they refused an unlawful instruction.  And we were at Mujanti(?) House when the firsttime the then Minister Dipuo Peters told Popo – told me and Mr Sfiso Buthelezi and a chap by the name of Peet(?) Sivula(?).  She come there – and this was the second     Can I just make this last point quickly and then I – I am sorry Mr Soni.    Because – so the point I am making is that I knew at that time when he had to sign, even against his will, that proper procurement process, he did not want to sign it.  And I stood up fought Chair.  When it got signed and gazetted, I celebrated and I said Shange(?), to Sfiso     Sure, sure.     I will cooperate with you, Chair,sometimes I get – because I happen to connect so many of the dots and I put it together.     So feel free also to say no, let us park that and let us deal with what is before us.     Thank you, Chair.     But, Chair, can I, without interrupting you, can we just confirm, Chair, on what basis you are leaving this thing because I was trying to clarify the 2014/2015 financial year.    They are not one and the – so this thing that Mr – evidence on the annual financial – audited financial statements, they are speaking actually to a different matter to what Mr Molefe is raising.  That is whatI am saying, Chair.     Chair, I am saying that when the financials were finalised I was – when I left, there was no 500 on the table.     So there was no 500 on the table.     Yes.    I am saying that if you look at 15/2016/2017 financial year, actually the PRASA statements, parliament audit standing committee, should not have accepted those financials.    Ja, ja, I am confirming that, yes.     No, no, Chair, I do not share this.  Mr Molefe was not at PRASA when these executives were fired, the only people that were either dismissed – there were two people that were dismissed and I think that both who testified before you, Chair, Mrs Martha Ngoyi well as Mr Fani Dingiswayo.   Now we can see that – you know, we are mixing up issues here, the NTM issue – I am the Group CEO, Chair, I employ with the approval of the board, I appoint CEOs of the PRASA divisions and subsidiaries, I …[intervenes]    No, no, Chair, hear me, Mr Soni, I hearwhat you are saying.  I am saying he is saying here people who were reversed CCMA on one occasion more than 500 members of the National Transport Movement, NTM, were dismissed only to be later reinstated by the Labour Court whether or not he was ultimate decision-maker, the CEO had to take ultimate responsibility.  Chair really.  Really, Chairperson.   And this – and when I say subsidiary, I am not talking about Chairpersons, I am talking about CEOs so all the group executives and the CEOs were appointed in factby the board.  I will recommend to the board appoint these people.   A person who works at a station or at the depot in Braamfontein does not report to the group CEO.  You know a person who works at the depot is a member of the National Transport Movement.  He works at the depot, he report to a depot manager of supervisor, who in turn reports to higher people.   These people were not dismissed by me, the reason they were dismissed, I think they were correct, Chair, butfor – I think that you can see that Mr Molefe is trying to stretch this point where he wants the person dismissed at the corner there to be attributed to me personality and you can see that he is not even sure, he says whether he is the ultimate decision but he must ultimately take responsibility. At what point does the CEO take responsibility?   Chair, if I put controls, I put systems in place and someone violate that, I do not take control but if a driver, a train driver smashes a train and an investigation says but the CEO did not put in place the necessary controls, this driver said he crashed the train because he could not see and they realised that he did not go for a medical check-up to see annually and that I did not put in place a system to make sure that this driver goes for that. I am personally responsible.    No, Chair, he is talking about 500 members.  Where are these people?  These are junior employees in the company.     You know, some of them I have not seen with my own eyes, how do – who issued a letter of suspension or dismissal of these employees?     No, Chair, I am saying probably two or three different things.  The first one I am saying here are junior employees, Mr Molefe is clutching at straws, he does not even know who took the position but he says Montana must take responsibility, Chair.  That is wrong.  So that is the first thing I am saying.  Secondly, Mr Molefe does not state here, Chair, who was irregularly dismissed or suspended.  Okay?  Today I am prepared to talk about two people, hedoes not mention them.  Is he referring Ms Ngoyi and Mr Fani Dingiswayo?  He does not state here, Chair.     Ja.     Yes.     No, they were dismissed by me, Chair, in 15.  Ms Martha Ngoyi, she is here, Mr Fani Dingiswayo, they were fired by me in 2015.     Who is talking about, Chair, so that we can be specific?     Yes, Chair.     But, Chair, can I ask you to address for one minute?     Because I think the State CaptureCommission, the workers that were dismissed and the country needs to understand what actually has happened.  We just spoke about the 500 million, that goes to 14 billion, to try and present the particular picture.   Let me explain to you what happened, Chair.  TheNTM members, those employees, they were dismissed by PRASA, number one.  They went to court, to the Labour Court, they lost, Chair.  That is the first issue.   They lost.  And you know what happened?  I was still there and for me, as Group CEO, even though I did not participate in the dismissal, because here it is people that were on strike action, there was burning of trains and everything.  I had to show the court how much we have lost as a result of this unlawful strike where assets were destroyed.   PRASA one the case, Mr Soni.  What happened thereafter is that 15 July came, I leave PRASA.  The employee relations guys, they get fired at PRASA because no, employee people, you are Montana’s people.  They get fired.  The matter then goes – MTN, within its rights, correctly so, goes to the Labour Court, Chair.     Appeals that decision by the court.     Chair, you must go and see – so they win that appeal because PRASA, exactly the point that Mr Molefe is doing, they do not then defend this matter properly, they actually collude with the MTN people, PRASA loses.  You know what the cost of this court judgment, Chair?  A billion rand for PRASA to reinstate these people.  It is a billion rand which it does not have in its operational budget.   So, Chair, here is someone who is destroying an entity, okay?  He is manipulating the State Capture Commission that people are being dismissed and everything.   He does not write here that if we handled this issue – in fact, when I realised that PRASA is going to be introuble, I then put a tweet - and this will be my final point, Mr Soni – I put a tweet, I say if I was still CEO of PRASA before the matter – because I was realising I had intel on what is happening on this matter, I say if was PRASA, call back these people, reinstate them, renegotiate the time so that we have win-win situation and people say no, like he wants to rule from the grave.   It went to the court.  PRASA failed to do its work.  They could not even explain to the court that each of these employees that were part of the 500, the court was sayingwe do not want a common purpose approach where you say there was a strike so if the train was burnt, all 500 are responsible.   But PRASA did not do its proper work, Chair, making sure that it followed those procedures, the impactis that it has got these employees who have been reinstated – and understand me, Chair, I am not saying they must not be reinstated, but the cost to the business of playing political games are exactly what Mr Molefe has done as he done with the irregular expenditure, 500, 14 billion and then, Chair, you were asking a month ago, how does it come to R20 or R21 billion?  Precisely because we are playing games with institutions that [indistinct], it will not happen when I was there, Chair.  I will never agree to it.So this is the real story, Chair.  So this thing that Montana dismissed people, people who do not follow my instructions, people who do not do their work or people who find that they are – because ultimately I am charged, I report to a board.   When I go to a board and they say Mr Montana – my board, people think they are my friends, they were taking me to task and my team had to raise their standards, Chair, and make sure that they deliver and at some stage Ms Ngoyi’s, for example, document, she talks about howshe was dismissed.  I think at the right time we will talk about it.     So, Chair, I am saying I do not accept this, I think that is false, it is actually a grossmisrepresentation by Mr Molefe.     That is not correct.     No, no, Mr Soni, but that is not correct.  Which Public Protector report?  Are you referring to Derailed?     Mr Molefe, let me just …[intervenes]     I would love to be Mr Molefe, Mr Soni.     Are we going to return to it, Mr Soni?     Okay, no I wanted to correct to the Chairthat the Public Protector …[intervenes]     We never dealt with it, yes.  Okay, it is fine, Chair.     No, no, Chair, I am aware.    Chair, the meeting of the 27 November, this was a board – yes, those tenders were very important, ja.      Are you referring to paragraph 19?     Chair, the board never requested for this thing.     But can I – there is a material point, Chair, I am trying to assist Mr Soni.    But you see, I do not want to us to lose the …[intervenes]     Chair, what has happened here, when weembarked, there were two major programmes, the buying of new commuter trains and the depots because when they were buying new trains, the depots where they were going to be maintained, needs to be ready.   So we had these major programmes.  And this was done under times that were said by the minister – by the Honourable Minister of Finance at that time, Minister Pravin Gordhan. Now one of the things the board of PRASA, that is before Popo Molefe, under Mr Sfiso Buthelezi, was thatbecause these are big we need to appoint probity officers to make sure because we were going to have a big fight on these issues, people are going to take us to court, let us appoint a probity officer so that when as the board makes decisions, because these are not decisions by the CEO, it is a decision by the board, we get an assurance that the process has been followed.   So that was the standard practice.  They did not have to ask for that.  So it started during Mr Buthelezi’s time.  It was a major governance control issue.Now when we come to this specific meeting, Chair, we say that the report is not there and I am asking to answer it in two ways in 18 and 19 quickly.   You know, Chair, here are major insinuations been made against someone that Mr Sfiso Buthelezi wantedthese things to be approved before he leaves.  At that time he was no longer the Chair of the board, he was the Chair of the PRASA’s Finance Capital Investment and Procurement Committee which basically before you go to the board, they are the ones who review these things before they recommend them.18 is so false, it is based on insinuation where evidence - Mr Buthelezi never did anything of the sort, Chair, he never wanted to push this contract.  In fact these matters were dealt with.  Management came – not Lucky Montana, management, the Chief Procurement Officer and the teams to come and present these issues that were there.  So 18 is false, Chair, this assertion is false and is actually trying to put a [indistinct] Buthelezi, insinuate that Mr Buthelezi had an interest in this thing on the depot modernisation thing.   This depot is important precisely, Chair, because we knew in 2015 we will get the first train, it had to come there, so that is  a number – let me answer number 19there, Chair.In 19, the reason why, Chair, there was the thing.  At this meeting no one was aware that the contract of the probity officer had actually expired, Chair, and it was actually – it had to be renewed, to be extended and it wasthrough that process.   I was sitting here when I heard Mr Molefe saying that I promised them this report and then later it was not there.   The meetings on this Braamfontein thing was actually held when I was on leave later and the CEO was a Mrs Ngoyi.  So, Chair, it is false, I do not accept it, it is false and the reason why there was no report, Chair, and the reason why there was no report, Chair, was precisely because myself as CEO and the board, we did not evenknow that the probity officer ’s contract …[intervenes]     Had expired and that has not at that time been brought to attention.  Now this thing is being turned to say we are misleading the board and we were to tell them that it is a report.   Mr Molefe had gone out to say there is corruption in this issue.  In my affidavit and evidence I provide evidence that actually that is false, Chair.  Okay.     No, it was a standard practice, Chair, with all the modernisation projects that we wereimplementing.     No, no, no, there was not in this particular meeting, Chair.     No, no, no, Chair, no, no, Chair, he is saying here - the issue here, Chair, I think that if we end it there we would be making a serious mistake because we will be misleading the Chair, the issues …[intervenes]    Okay, Chair.     Okay.     Yes.     I am sorry, just uncomfortable in the chair.     No, no, in this meeting I am confirming there was no report.     And at the meeting I was also not awarethe report – the contract had expired, Chair.     Chair, it is false.     And, by the way, Mr Soni, this report is not taken to the board by me.  The committee of the board,the people – because you remember, Chair, we have a delegation of authority of 100 million.   If the teams do a tender and it is 100 or below it will be recommended to me for approval.   If the contract is over R100 million and here we aredealing with contract far above my delegation of authority, the contract would go through the board and that will go each subcommittee which will look at it.  So there is a report before the board from this committee, Chair. So I am saying at that time materially both the board and I did not even know that the contract – there was no report and in the discussion, during the discussion, Chair, then the issue comes up but Mr Molefe did not ask Mr Montana where is the probity officer?  We never had that, Chair.    And it is a fundamental difference.     Well, Chair, his reason, Mr Soni, I actually captured in interviews and these interviews are available to the commission, he says this R4 billion tenderwas a corrupt tender …[intervenes]     Okay.     Chair, I went on leave and I pointed Ms Ngoyi to act in my position and I had indicated that look, it has been a busy year and I needed to take a rest.     Page 18?    Yes, ja.     Yes, Chair, this report was presented – was presented to management and I think that it is acorrect reflection of what happened.     Chair, we took that decision on those particular contracts, ja.     Chair, it is absolutely correct.    Are we still on this point?  Are we moving from this point?    Can I make a quick point, Chair?     Chair, you see – and that is why – you know, the way this evidence comes here is equally very important.   My annexures, Mr Soni, to this matter, actually I present the interaction between PRASA and the what is called the probity officers.  Okay?  Including where some of the observations by the probity officers were eitherincorrect or they were not right …[intervenes]     No, no, Chair, I think did not understand me.  I said before Popo Molefe even came to PRASA we appointed the probity officer for the big projects that were there.  What I said was that when we had this specific meeting the probity officer’s contract had actually expired.    So that is the point I am making.  And therefore there was already a process undertaken to ensure that the – what is it called, it is extended beyond that time because the services were still needed orrequired at that point in time.Now when the probity officers continued with their work and interacted, Chair, there is five other reports on this very matter and I would want to urge the Commission that do not base this thing only this report because actually there was even areas where there was consensus between management and the probity officers on what needs to be done, and by the way I attached this very report Chair and I quote – go back to page 88 Mr Soni, I quote, you know it says the – what do you call it, theprobity officers it is an overall, management at the board must take a decision to accept or reject a non-compliance with a policy for the two affected tender reviews.Now Chair these are professionals, if they knew that this tender is corrupt they will never make that recommendation, they will say it is a corrupt tender for throughout the documents that I have reviewed after Mr Molefe had been making assertions of corruption, none of the reports, Chair, on Braamfontein, on – because non-compliance and irregularities Chair, I want to come back tothat, it’s not corruption and here are the auditors saying, we are picking up areas of non-compliance.  For example, one of the - I want to point the thing.  We advised that there should be a workshop for the CSFC which is a Cross Functional Sourcing Committee prior to the sitting forevaluation to ensure that there is guidance for them around the sourcing criteria for consistency.So, they’re identifying an important control issue to say that if members of the CSFC cannot go in a proper way and there’s no consistency then there’s going to be a problem with this tender.  They are not saying there is corruption, then Mr Molefe runs …[intervenes].     Yes, but in this affidavit…[intervenes].     Chair, I think we’re missing each other.       Let me explain Mr Soni because I don’t want us to fight about unnecessary things, but they are very important.     You see, Mr Soni presents – here’s the report Chair, he’s presenting it to confirm what Mr Molefe presents – states in this affidavit, so these are Annexures, they’re not Mr Molefe’s.  Now, if you look at this pack and you look at both…[intervenes].    Both the affidavit as well as the testimony, so we need to have the transcript Chair, Mr Molefe actually – in the transcript he goes in much greater detail, so it is not evidence in a newspaper or in the media,it’s what he said when he first testified, in Braamfontein there was corruption and everything, Chair…[intervenes].     That is why Chair because you see in the transcript he is actually suggesting in the testimony here, that there was wrongdoing on the part of – and that is why the insinuation I dealt with, ...[Indistinct] wanted this thing to be dealt quickly and leave PRASA and then the spoils of the …[indistinct] that flow Chair, and I cannot leave that point because this thing here, Chair, auditors – I mean Ithink that I will report them to the professional body if they found corruption but they still say it is the Board, the management that must decide whether to accept it.  They are talking about a compliance issue, not a corruption issue.     Indeed Chair.     Chair, I’m smiling because you see, in the ANC on the ground my job was not to carry firearms, it was on propaganda and always say something that matters that materially affects the people.     And I earlier on, indicated about the MTNthing which I said was a lie.  Let me explain to you what this thing means, Chair so that this Commission has an appreciation of what it means in congruence.  Chair, when this thing, this tender was cancelled in Braamfontein the President went to Nigel in …[indistinct] where we built thefactory, not any other person, us okay.  This modern factory to build trains, the trains, Mr Soni, they start to come into the system.  Five years – six years after I’d left, Chair, despite the fact that the money was there, PRASA has not been able to build a single depot, okay.  Chair, what it means is that, as trains are chartered, they can’t even be deployed …[indistinct] in Soweto or Kwamashu or in Khayelitsha or in Bonteheuwel is actually not able to get the benefit of this investment because these trains can’t be used.  So, I think that the – when you play political gamesthis is the result of what you have, Chair.  Now here’s a report that tells us that it was within – the Board had to use its prerogative to proceed or not and if he says that the irregularity or non-compliance is material or not, they must make that decision, Chair.     But five years down the line we have invested over R50billion to buy new trains and most of them come today, six years after I’ve left PRASA, they can’t come into the system because some report iselevated above any – the requirements of the economy and ordinary people accessing job opportunities, this is what we have [speaking in vernacular], Chair.     People are going hungry that’s what I’msaying.     I don’t understand, Chair, I don’t understand this point being made.     Not because I reject it, I’m just saying, I can’t follow.    I can’t follow what Mr Soni is saying that’s what…[indistinct – dropping voice].     No, I’m not saying that.     I’m not saying that I’m simply saying that here’s a report which has got a whole range of other fact and information to it.  A tender is cancelled, Chair, and somebody, of course, tells the Commission about how irregular, lack of controls and  all sorts of things and thensix years down the line, I’m not saying – I was part, I was there but when the Board took a decision on the 23 r d of December 2014, Chair, Martha Ngoyi was sitting in my position, I was not at PRASA – I was not there but I’m not disowning that position.  I was the CEO of PRASA, and you’ll see in my statement and in my affidavit that I say, I come before this Commission to take accountability and I take full responsibilities, and Chair, you know this thing, I happen to know it from the tip of my hands.  When somebody plays games, like what is happening with thisaffidavit, I know I’ll be able to point it and, in this instance, I’m saying Chair,  I’m still repeating Mr Soni, Popo Molefe didn’t assist the Commission, actually was trying to drive it towards a particular direction and I – one of the things I’ll be able to – I should be able to do, to assist theCommission, to get the two facts.  The Chairperson will assess, based on what he has said, based on what has been said in the evidence and come to a determination, Chair, I’ll respect that.     Chair, when I left PRASA I was still the Chair of the …[indistinct – dropping voice].     I’m sorry Chair, I’m saying when I left PRASA I was the Chair of the two subsidiaries, GroupCEO, there’s a good reason for that Chair. So, this is the view that Popo Molefe is advancing.  I want to ask Mr Soni, you know, 23.     Paragraph 23 Chair, I want to make two points.  Is this fundamental to the collapse of PRASA today and I want the Chair to have an appreciation of that.  Chair, every year, when I started at PRASA, at SRCC before we formed PRASA, my delegation of authority wasR20million.  When – later on the Board had increased the delegation to R50million and it went to R100million.  Every year, as a requirement Chair, we are assessed both on the issues of materiality’s and significant framework of the business, the level of spending and the level of investment so that you don’t want the situation where the Board comes everyday to the company because Management is not able to make decisions.  So, if you look at the R100million, Chair, at that time was appropriate for PRASA and this was approved by the Board, was reviewed annually as it were.Now, there are two lies Chair, that are being told in this thing. Mr Montana was a one-man-show, he’s not using so many words, he didn’t consult.  Chair I think the Committee should summon the minutes of the PRASA Exco, the level of debate and discussion and you know, Chair, when theBoard delegate R100million to me, in turn I had to delegate R25million to the CEO’s, R10million to the Group Executives.  So, if we talk about PRASA, anything below R25million I didn’t see Chair.  Anything above R100million went to the Board. Now, let me tell you a story, Chair…[intervenes].     R100million Chair.    No, no sorry, Chair, I may have made a mistake I’m referring to R100million, it still remained R100million when I left but I’m simply saying that delegations of authority are not numbers that are thumb sucked they are made because you want operational efficiency, you want decision making but still the Board can’t abdicate its responsibilities.  That is why, even if acontract is R5million they pick up that it is a problem, the Board says, CEO not even in your delegation of authority but in the delegation of authority down there something wrong is happening.So, delegation doesn’t mean abdication, Chair, it’s very important.  Secondly, I’m sayingChair that, I wanted to tell you a story how this issue, what Popo Molefe and them did at PRASA because of this thing in 23 and it’s part of the Annexures I’ve submitted.  One of the things that is vital to running trains is issues of maintenance and availability of components.  Maintenance, very vital for railways, Chair what happens that because there is this – this Montana is powerful the Board comes and cuts the delegation of authority to the CEO but because they want to control, also, what gets approved in the business, they then terminate the delegation ofauthority to people who run trains on the ground.  I never – I held people accountable, Mr Soni, but I will not go there and say, you are buying this component, that delegation must be given so that we can hold people accountable.  There’s a report of PRASA people, which is part of my affidavit, Chair, it actually shows that the reason why the number of available trains that collapsed in the country, is because people in the depots are not actually able to buy even the smallest spares because everything is approved at the head office.  So, it’s inappropriate, here’s aChairman who comes and tells this Board – so it tells this Commission that you know, R100million Chair, in the context of a company that must spend R15billion on capital a year is a very small amount of money but if you look at how they’ve destroyed PRASA because of thisirresponsible thing, which is not having any scientific or management basis you want your people, so that when a train, particularly an old system like Metrorail.  Chair, people come from overseas to ask me, hey man, this thing is old but how do you keep it running  okay because I had to make sure that at least, out of 100 trains 85 of those trains run and my people if they don’t do their work at the depots, they’ve got delegations to get the right components and everything.  Popo Molefe comes, scraps this thing and what you have is a situation where the country today, Chairtoday, the country can’t run 70% of the trains that I ran, okay.  I ran the number of trains, held people accountable, Chair, I think maybe I should request one day for you and Mr Soni during lunchtime, let’s go to Park Station and you see the disaster, in three years, what it took us to build inyears, the Board of Popo Molefe destroyed in less than three years Chair and they are not held accountable.  Let me make this final point, Mr Trevor Manual was here Chair, when he testified, I think it was September 2018, he made a very profound point, he said – and I think he’s one of thereasons why I agreed to tell you, he said, Chair, it’s very important that we go back and look at what happened at that time.  You see now people say, State Capture, corruption and then you get confused.  Let’s get to the detail, why were trains running at 84/85% when Montanawas there.  Why today, we can’t even run trains at 20%, because they came and break this thing in the name of fighting State Capture and corruption.  It’s wrong Chair, let’s turn this thing, my statement today, is an assertion I’m challenging this false notion because I think we’re going to destroy the country and I see it happening with other State owned – so this 23, if this Commission were to accept 23, Chair, I think that this country is going to go to the dogs, excuse my French Chair.     No Chair, I know that they were discussing the…[intervenes].     No, no Chair, I don’t want to use theword, false.  Chair, the Board of Popo Molefe had said, in line with what they are saying here that in their view, the Group CEO Chairing subsidiaries, okay but I think by the time I left PRASA they haven’t affected that particular decision and Chair it’s an opinion that he has but Ithink…[intervenes].     No, no Chair, when I left PRASA I was still chairing the Board.     No, Chair, there are two subsidiaries at PRASA, the others are divisions inside the Board, so, I was Chairing these two and there’s a particular reasons why…[intervenes].     Ja, I’m saying Chair, I’m saying that the Board of Popo Molefe, in their discussions, I accept that point, they’ve raised the issue of, if the CEO – that is why I say, in the Board’s view that did not make – that did not go well for good corporate governance. The Board of PRASA,under Popo Molefe had that discussion and I’m aware of that discussion…[intervenes].     No, it was never withdrawing Chair.     I was never withdrawn Chair.     May in someone’s imagination but when I left PRASA I was – I left PRASA I was the Chair of the twosubsidiaries, Chair…[intervenes].     There’ll be minutes, exactly Chair.     But, Chair, I’m saying this point at the bigger level, I’m saying this assertion as well it’s so wrong Chair.  If you want to run PRASA without running its real estate like many railway companies are doing then you’re going to destroy this company, Chair, and that’s what wesee.  You need to align what you have property – you need to ensure that your property division or the property portfolio really supports this business.  This was a destruction of value, so it sounds good, good corporate governance but in business in real terms congruently itactually has a, what is it called, a – I didn’t want to – the opposite effect. Whether it was intended or not, it’s something else Chair, I don’t want to debate that but I’m saying that I don’t even agree with that view but yes, Mr Molefe is right that his Board did say, we do not think that, moving forward we want to have a situation where the Group CEO also Chairs subsidiary Boards and maybe that’s what made people say that he thinks I’m a very powerful man.     No, no Chair it was not implemented.    I think the report could have been shared with us in May 2014.  Ja I think around that time – April – May if I am – I cannot recall the exact date.    No Chair I think the previous board was fully aware and mandated me Chair to deal with this matter and PRASA had actually responded in a number of occasions – in a number of – there has been lots of correspondence within PRASA and the Public Protector and – but also I can – let me indicate that this is also not correct.  Mr Molefe I do not know when he read the newspapers but he was informed by me.  I actually shared a copy of the – of the report withhim.  In fact later on I deal with the – with issues – the fights between myself and Mr Molefe relates to this particular matter.     No Chair I think that – that happened there is no in March 2015.    Ja March I think – Chair I think he mayactually be – Mr Molefe may be right in terms of the date ja.    Chair the – the investigation by the Public Protector dates back to 2012.    And you see in 2012/2013/2014/2015 there has been a lot of exchanges we had – we had already responded to – to all the issues. We had submitted even lots of files of tenders, contracts to the Public Protector to have a – to have a review of those.    No Chair I think – I think that we understandthese questions. When the Public Protector writes a report one of the things he then describe – define or describe the matter in detail and he depose in questions in detail so – so…    Okay.    You know Chair I briefed him about this matter because it dates back to 2012.  When the new board came…    I briefed him about this particular issue yes.    No Chair I do not think the sequence is right.  The sequence is not right and I think that – no Chair Ivolunteered information to Mr Molefe not what is described here but I think the long and short of it I shared information with him and we did not discuss this Public Protector matter in detail and he reported – he reported the matter to the board to say there is this issue; it is being attended to and that is what it was left at until of course then there was a major dispute and I deal with it on this particular matter.    Ja let us call it the right word is provisional report.    Public Protector’s provisional report and Iindicated to him that as a company’s management we are – we are responding to all those issues.    No, no.    Chair no I think the – the – it could have been around that time because I know that when we went to the memorial service of Minister Chabane that is when I had given him my letter that I will step down from my – from theposition of CO.  If I recall when we had a dispute on this particular issue around early – early April so I think that in terms of time it may be more or less the same time but Chair I gave – I gave him the provisional report of the Public Protector.  If the file refers to that I confirm that.    Okay.    No, no, no it could have been – it could not have been the same time. No that came after.    The letter was just an envelope before wewent to the memorial service of the late Minister and I said – I actually – we would not even open it.  He did not even know. I said Chair if you can read this – if you can have this as your bedtime reading.    Ja, no I think we may be confusing two things.  I think both happened but I do not think they happened at the same time.  There was a time I shared a letter of resignation – my letter of resignation on the 15 t h ofMarch and then later on we had – we had for example I think we had the memorial service and then before we – a few days or a week later we went to the funeral in Limpopo and I think we were both at the office so those – I think it is more or less the same – the same time ja.    Happened ja.  I can confirm that.    No 2015 ja.    Yes that is what my letter stated ja.    My letter of resignation?   Oh that is my – that is his letter.    For me.    And let me – I asking that for a reasonChair.  When I resigned from PRASA and my letter is there I think it is part of the record already.  Yes I think at some stage you asked Chair but you see the letter of resignation.  I said my contract provides for me to – provides for a three months’ notice period but I said to Mr – I said in the letter tothe chairman I do not want to do three months.   I said my contract provides for that but I would asked the board to find a suitable replacement and I am prepared to spend six months so that their new CO can understand PRASA and what drives it, its logic and everything.   I offered that in the letter.  So it is not – it is not the way he puts it.  Of course in the letter of response they did say the board reserves the right to say look we do not serve your notice period but I offered the board Chair and I explained to the board.  I explained to Mr Molefe.   If – if in my letter that if I leave in the middle of all these major changes there are going to be difficulties.    But I offered – I offered the board yes.    147?    Oh I am sorry.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.    Where – where are you reading Mr Soni?    But what is your question specifically?    Chair I am smiling Mr Soni because Chair I read – I received this letter, I confirm that.  But it is a funny letter I must say because the letter describe or tries tocurtail what has not actually not been the truth.   Chair the – as Group CO of PRASA the delegation of authority was very clear from since the organisation was formed in fact from the days we had a South African Rail Commuter Corporation.  The appointment of executives is a responsibility of the board.  I recommend to the board.   So I think this letter and perhaps once I – Advocate Soni is done here I want to go back and make the point because you – you will not understand my letter and this letter and what happened in the matter of the PublicProtector report if you do not understand the background.Why I decided to resign at that point and the relationship and the reasons I provide and what happened when I met Mr Molefe in Knysna.  So – so the letter was served on me; it does curtail anything Chair.   I think you know Mr Molefe he would have loved to have the opportunity to either fire me, dismiss me or curtail me and he found that it is not possible in this lifetime Chair.The issue is the executives were appointed by the board so you right and say there is no executive that areappointed.  If I had interviewed people I had to interview them with the – what you call the board’s remuneration and HR committee of the board.  We interview recommend to the board and there are times when between us myself and the board we do not agree on this particular appointment andthen I have to either convince the board that this is the right    No, no I hear – I hear you and I agree fully there.  Here is a letter but I am simply saying that why do you tell me about ...    We did not – because it did not happen inreal times.  I had 100 million what is significant when I still approve 100 million.  I did not approve – I did not appoint executives.  The executives are appointed by the board.  So this letter reflects something that I want to touch Mr Soni.    To touch on sorry.    Well I wanted – I thought when you are done with probing this matter you give me the opportunity.   Unless if you want me to do it now.    No, no I am going – it is a five days’ well   I am exposing myself here Chair.      Chair the – the – I said earlier in my testimony that Mr Molefe came to PRASA for a particular reason.  In his operation and me and him as I said we – we used to interact so either basements of PRASA we talk ANCpolitics and everything and sometimes he will say me Comrade Lucky and I kept on reminding him no, no Chair I am going to call you Chairman call me CEO and that you are my senior or my leader, you are the same age as my father so you cannot be my comrade even if in the structures we want to treat people as required.  That is what I did.Now the point I want to make is that between November and February there was very good interaction including the fact and he does not say it in his affidavit Mr Molefe brought in a lot of business people to meet with me   2015 Chair my apologies – 2015.  Six or – six or six months after Mr Molefe had been in this board we appointed we had the meeting in the North West I think just closer to Sun City the board meeting for the year.It was act – it was basically the first real meeting of the board after it came and had to attend to the issues about all these – the induction but I was unhappy with that board meeting.  I spent a lot of time outside with the board having an in-committee meeting.  Okay.That is number 1.Number 2 the board wanted to restructure somehow to restructured the business.  It is a prerogative of the board I said that but the way it is done when you restructure business it is very important you must have all the information on the table and that information is done whetheryou appoint a consultant outside or you ask management you do not just come and say now the approval for this we are placing there because you are running an organisation with a lot of interdependencies.   So it is very important to understand that.So I was unhappy with that.  Now when they have and I think Advocate – Mr Soni I want also to – to advise you to also look at the – some of the statements made by Mr Collins Letsoalo which I think are relevant to – to my particular matter.So there was an attempt to change.  I said to Mr Lindikaya who was the Company Secretary at the end of that board meeting I said today is a day I am leaving PRASA.  I was not resigning in that board meeting of February but I have already noticed what was happening and I decided to leave.But I did not want to fight Chair I wanted to leave in peace and I – that is why my letter is crafted in the manner that it is crafted so that when I leave there is still unity, there is stability in the business.   Already I have seen ourexecutive management team being divided between people who are loyal to Popo Molefe who are loyal to me I did not want to do that.  I wanted to leave in peace.   But I – I said that during the break Mr Soni to you that in African tradition when someone – your visitor leaves– leave your homestead you assure them that I have tightened my dogs, do not worry, leave in peace.  Okay.  So that is what I was doing and Mr Molefe said – and when I left approaching the gate he then unleashed this terrible dogs okay to come for me.So I had given him that letter.  I was unhappy and I then gave effect to my decision to resign.  But in my departure I did not want to create a fight with Mr Molefe or the board so that letter comes.  This letter Chair and let me remind you Mr Molefe had always said Mr Montana I wantyou to stay for three years because you are the one who understands this then can help us.  Okay.Now when I resigned he goes to the thing and I speak    No him and Minister.    Minister Peters.    Yes Chair.    Chair.     Because of the way he came to PRASA, I knew.      But I knew Mr Molefe, Chair.  He did not – he probably did not know me because I – when I met him I explained to him.  I said the first time I met Mr Molefe was when he was in – it was in court at the Delmas Prison Trial.  I was part of the young people who went to court to support our leaders at that time.When Mr Molefe and them were sentenced to prison, I was outside the court on that particular day.  When they went to Robben Island and they appealed, I waspart – before they were sentenced, Chair, there was a big meeting at the Johannesburg Central Methodist Church in 1988 where we had the solidarity meeting which was disrupted by the police.  So I have seen this man, the big man that Irespect as part of the leaders in the thing.  When they were released from prison, they still actually were wearing prison clothes, Jan Smuts Airport, not O.R. Thambo.  Young kids will not know that that was the Jan Smuts Airport.     We were the youth who were carrying them and singing and celebrating...  So when he was appointed as Chairman I said we are – I am happy to have this man but I knew that there was this other reason whyhe was appointed, but I tried to work with him.     Chair, it was on a descent.     We were on a downhill.     But we were – I think the relationship was decent.  But after April ...[intervenes]      ...the relationship between myself and Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]      ...became hostile.     We were not seeing eye to eye.  We were not planning board meetings together.     We were doing things together as required.     Chair, what was ...[intervenes]      Well, I did not confront.  I was polite, Chair.     But very ...[intervenes]      Very firm.     I made it very clear and said this is the situation and I want you to know that I ...[indistinct] but Iwas not going to fight with him because the decision to leave PRASA was my decision alone and everything.  And he kept on saying – Hey, Chair and he - you remember they placed him with Minister Dipuo regarding the meeting with the President.    Chair, our relationship collapsed and much completely now after that meeting.  It was my decision instructing PRASA Technical CEO that he must cancel the contract of South African Fence and Gate.  That company failed to deliver on his contractual obligation yet ...[intervenes]      Indeed, Chair.       [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      This was around April/May 2015.     Chair, look, I did not use those wordsbecause I did not know whether it was explicit but I think the point here is that I was committed to work with him.  He – I think that he decided that he is going to take a different path(?).  There were actions.  I mean, the cancellation of the - what is it called – the contract on the – or rather the tender on the Braamfontein modernisation  He had a lot of time(?).  He was actually even out of town when the board meeting was set, but that is not how you run companies because you want a CEO to do things in a particular manner.    No, no, Chair.  I would not say that, no.  I would not say that.       The award to the Tegeta contract.     Yes, you understood me correctly.     But whether that will mean me being fired or ...[intervenes]      ...or me leaving the company, it is something else, ja.     No, Chair, that is not me.  That is not me.  I am very forthright and direct but attacking people, it is not me Chair.       Let me go there Chair.     29?     29.    Page 9.     Okay.     Chair, in Knysna ...[intervenes]      ..that is not what we discussed.     But, yes, subsequent to that, I think that we did after I have met the Minister on two different occasions.     Ja.     Not at the Knysna meeting, Chair, no.  At the Knysna meeting, Chair, I spoke about our report getting to the journalist, the provisional report, and that he was telling me to stay but he was carrying a dagger.     If that is what he was trying to describe than that is correct Chair.     Chair, we have had a lot of interactions including in writing, in black and white, and I cannot recall specifically saying that to Mr Molefe.     But I know the situation had deteriorated and we were throwing – we were going at each other in a very big way.  Ja.    Chair, I was very suspicious of the appointed of three people...       Because the appointed, I have regarded as irregular.  The entire Board of PRASA was advertised by Minister Dan Martins and then he was replaced as a Minister with the Cabinet reshuffled.  Minister Dipuo came in.  She took all the people that were nominated through a public process.  They were all nominated by members of the public.  There were three people that were brought tothat board, Ms Molefe, Ms Zoto Manase and Ms Willem Steenkamp.  And if you understand, again there is a context to this to understand why they were brought in but ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Chair, in my affidavit and in the statement that I presented today, I make mention of the fact that the Board of PRASA led by Mr Sfiso Buthelezi was – the term of that board was coming to an end.  So naturally there was going to be the appointment of a new board, whether Mr Buthelezi and members of – some members of his board will continue in that role, I think is neither here nor there.  The issue is that there were an introduction ofthe appointment of Mr Molefe, it had to do with – excuse me – with what the Minister had said to us in a meeting,     Sorry, in 2014.    So the budget speech was – but my letters, my annexures Chair, which is a source of debate, shows the ongoing fight which involved PRASA and the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport in respect of this particular programme.  PRASA is where – is precisely because of that and I detail that in my affidavit.  Then there was Minister Dipuo Peters.  Then there was a third man, the Treasurer General of the ANC, ...[indistinct].  Now each – these three people, Chair, theywere telling Buthelezi that the deployment of the – by the ANC...  No, Chair, the decision about the appointment of this – of these three people into the board was the decision of the interaction between the three people, okay?  And that is why in my affidavit – in my affidavit I respond – I actually take up the issue of the appointment     No, I am saying that Chair in no uncertain terms, yes.     Sure.    Sure.     Chair, I think that is you comes after – you recall in my – excuse me – in my testimony early in the day.  I spoke about our meeting in Cape Town.  You know, Chair, and I described it in detail because I think Mr Soni ...[intervenes]      Chair, the Board of PRASA ...[intervenes]     ...the Minister ...[intervenes]      Sorry, sorry.      The Board of PRASA ...[intervenes]      Board of PRASA – I said firstly, its time had expired.       Before Mr Molefe.     Yes, Chair.     It was, ja.  It was coming to an end.     And you see, Chair, we are dealing with issues in the middle, unfortunately.     Because of the nature of the issue there.     And that my affidavit is not on the table.    In my affidavit I explain, in fact, what has happened and why I started to form certain opinions.     Of course, to stop – to respond directly.  Ido not know if Mr Molefe, Ms Manase or Mr Steenkamp were given a mandate that the Minister of Transport for     No, I want to bring some other point which is very important, Chair.     Which, unfortunately, is in my affidavit.  Let me just go straight to it.     So, we heard that earlier, yes, but for the first time I hear that there is a – there was investigation on this big contract that the ministers had problem, Chair. Then after that presentation to the Appropriation Committee – and I – again, I detailed this in my affidavit – Mr Molefe leaves with the Chair of the Portfolio Committee who had attended the meeting of the Appropriation Committee.  And Chair, they leave.  They go and have lunch after the – after we have been for the presentation.  I also go in an opposite direction.  The Chair of the Portfolio Committee had later that evening called me to brief me about what had transpired.  And this I reported – it is in my statement to the Parliamentary Inquiry on Governance at Eskom.  Chair, the – Mr Molefe – that is why I thought Ms Magadzi, Dikeledi Magadzi, the Deputy Minister of Transport he would have conveyed this to the committeeduring the testimony.  He said on that very ...[intervenes]      But ...[intervenes]      Chair, but not when they arrived.     Over a period of time.    Then a lot of things have happened ...[intervenes]      ...that Lucky is there to steal for Zuma.  That is what they said Chair.     And unless – if you look at my affidavit where I did tell these things, you then not understand...  So, firstly, here is the – or the board has not taken a decision that he must investigate this particular committee(?).  It is mentioned in Parliament.  I hear it forthe first time.  Three months into the term, who was appointed to do this investigation?  What are the terms of reference?  That is the first issue, Chair.Secondly, the chair of the committee comes and     That would be fair summation, Chair.     I am trying to find the page.     Page 9 of the ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay?     Okay.    Are you asking me about the appointment of Werksmans?     No, Chair.  The only thing I know is that the report of the Public Protector, of course, hadrecommended that contracts of R 10 million and above be investigated and then later the AG’s office.  Yes, I think did the – did make it on recommendation around that.  I thought Minister Peters dealt with the issue about how to combine these investigations and all of those things.     Chair, we are not going to go around this issue because I think and naturally it required in my affidavit because I deal with it and I have used the term information.  There are two things here.  The PublicProtector is very specific and who should be appointed to look at this and this.  And secondly, we know that the Minister of Transport, and she said here, oppose this thing     Today, ja.     Thank you.     Can I highlight on paragraph 31?     Chair, the statement that has been made – and this is important because at a later stage I want to deal with this matter about the Public Protector.  Mr Molefe says the investigations into PRASA, particularly the CEO, Mr Montana, I am hoping that the Commission will lead evidence on that because you will see that ...[intervenes]      That is I say at a later stage we want todeal with the Public Protector.  It is actually in today’s statement.     Because I feel that part of the process is to present the Public Protector ’s report as it is about Montana.     And Chair, I, in fact as a matter of fact, that report did not make any finding of corruption and actually there are very few instances where I feature.  Shedeals with employees, the irregularities in the – but not – but if you listen, you read now this report is a damning report on Montana and everything and I read this, Chair, and say – and the media repeats these lies without reading and sharing the facts of the – so Chair, I would want to take it out at the right time when I present my own affidavit, Chair.     Chair, for now so that I do not disturb thetrain of thought of Mr Soni.     As CFO of PRASA?     Yes, I did know him, Chair, I knew him.     I do not know well, Chair, I know him, he was contracted to PRASA long before so he was one of the key security risk company I think Royal Security provided services.     I can add, Chair.  Chair, I can add.  Again, you know, I was taken aback when I listed to MrMolefe talking about Mr Moodley.  Chair, it was like this and they even agreed to go and play golf together, they told.  They were like this, Chair.  These same ones are grouping(?) and today I said, Chair …[intervenes]     So I want to say, Chair …[intervenes]     Chair, they were told at some stage – MrMolefe told me that him and Mr Moodley, they are going to travel together to the US to play the golf event.  I do not play golf, I have never played golf, I was a caddy for 12 years and it was at a time when players, white players in particular, would pay you based on how they played the game, that I really cannot pick up, I was a caddy and that is why I do not the way I hear my other executives they were going to play golf.  I take the view of a caddy, I do not go to – so they were flying, Chair, they wanted – they planned a trip whether to the UK, the US together and thenI come and sit here, I hear that Mr Moodley tried to capture Mr Molefe.  Very interesting.  Very interesting, Chair.  I can – that is the best I can say.     No, no, I do not know their relationship before that.    No, Chair, I think it is very interestingthat – it is very interesting, Chair, that this point is made by Mr Moodley, but it is also made by Mr Fani Dingiswayo in his affidavit.  So it is not coincidence, Chair.     No, no, Mr Molefe and Mr Fani Dingiswayo.  They both make this point, Chair.     No, no, Chair, I was meant to say Mr Molefe and I apologise.     I was meant to say Mr – and, Chair, the point – I know that [indistinct] here, I do not want to respond to it, Chair.     But both in my affidavit and in my statement today – you see, the proper names of state capture, if you look at what he says, you look at thetestimony of Minister Pravin Gordhan in October 2018, he makes similar points.  So this is an ideology, it is not an objective thing.  Mr Moodley, who did he influence because Mr Moodley was appointed I think in Railways in around 1991 when I check the history of that company.  So who didhe use money to pay to appoint him?  Because he was appointed – I was not ever probably born, I was not at PRASA.  There was no PRASA at that time.  MetroRail was not even known by its name, it was still part of Transnet.  So I think he must come and explain.  So, if you make that point, make it more concrete to say we think Moodley paid Montana or paid to get this contract but you also have told us that before Montana was born Moodley was at PRASA at Transnet or Railways in 1991, not – I only joined PRASA in 2006, the South AfricanRail Commuter Corporation in 2006.  Moodley was already having a contract for over 10 years, Chair.     I may – if, as a CEO, I do not know that but the chairman, non-executive chairman, Chair, knowsthat employees at PRASA – I mean, how do you measure that?  Which employees, in which depot, in which station said that?     Well, I do not know but I am askingmyself, it raises different questions that is here is a chairman who goes around getting to stations, asking employees and where did they challenge(?) this think, Chair?  Is this evidence, is it state capture where we are told rumours and hearsay because that is what he is saying here.  Which employees?  I think, Chair, what the Commission should do, should ask Mr Molefe to provide details and we get those employees to come and testify here or else it is hearsay, Chair, I cannot recall to hearsay.     But, Mr Soni, does it not surprise you that me, Lucky Montana, who was then the Group CEO of PRASA does not know about this issue.  It is someone whois fulltime and then someone who is supposed to come there once in three months, he interacts with these employees, he knows it.  I mean, I just find it odd, I find it very strange.     So I am not saying it is false.     But I am saying I find it very odd, as a non-executive chairman.     I was not aware of that, Chair.     Of Strawberry Works?     I am aware of them, Chair.     Royal Security, Chair, I am saying is being doing work in Railways since 1991.    He is an associate?     With Royal – no, no, no, Chair, I know that, I am well-aware of that.     Mr Soni, do you believe this statement?  And let us look at this – Chair, let us look at this statement.     But I am – I can – Chair, I am not aware but I can see that is a very false statement.     You say that maybe a contractor mayhave unfair advantage but to say that going as far as walking in the workplace is like him serve as a manager.  I think, Chair, is – is this the PRASA I know?  I do not think we are talking about the same organisation here.     No, no, Chair, not at all.  I do not play golf, I do not go to those events.  I have never been – the last time I was at the golf course was when I was a caddy at the Irene Country Club in Pretoria.  I used to get into a train at Eerste Fabriek and Mamelodi and then travel back,Chair.  So this thing about golfs, Roy Moodley, they have got nothing to do with me, Chair, it is their discussion and I think the two of them must come and tell the Chair how did they meet, which golf, who was paying for those things.  They have got nothing to do with me, I was never involved in any golf activity with Mr Moodley.     No, not at all.     No, no, Chair, I have attended the 1 July.  I was invited by Vodacom and I also had a suite there.     No, no, no, it has got nothing to do with Mr Moodley, this was a – probably I did not know Mr Moodley at that time.     No, Chair, I know that, I do not know thedetails but Mr Molefe did tell me about the fact that they are talking about the US, who paid, who was going, I was never party to it, Chair.     And let us look at paragraph 46 now, thisis now we have finished with that section on Mr Moodley because it does not – it is not a matter on which it would     Chair, I do not know, it is his view, but it is factually incorrect, I mean the Public Protector report was released, Chair, in August, I had already left PRASA in August 2015 so how can a report that was released after I have left be the basis of a fallout?  It is so illogical.     So on a factual – so whatever view he has that he was there to hold people – but then tell us about other things, not the report of the Public – because it was written in August, I left in July.     And this investigation was ongoing before Mr Molefe became a Chairman of PRASA.     Chair, holding management accountable, does not require someone special for that.The management …[intervenes]     No, Chair, no.  Issue of the accountability does not feature.  Early in the morning Mr Soni asked aquestion about this issue of reports, me holding information.  I dealt with the issue of accountability.  As a CEO, I am accountable to the board, it appoints me, I am accountable to the board.  It does not require a special person because that is what Mr Molefe is trying to – ourdisagreement, Chair, had to do with other issues that I have listed and I think we can evaluate the information, like in this paragraph, Chair, you can see that Mr Molefe in trying to retrofit and give the thing, he actually may give you – he exposes a thing that the report of the Public Protector – it  was released after I have left, so how did he know that this report that – I have left PRASA, I was not at PRASA when this report was released in August.  So factually, Chair, you can see that – he said I made a mistake or he just does not know what he is talking about.    Chair, I have articulated this thing I think today.     Yes.     Yes.     Chair, I am saying it is not true, but I am saying the Commission will of course look at the …[intervenes]     At the sequence of events and the facts and all of those things.     Including what is I am saying factually incorrect that Chairman is projecting himself as achampion of accountability and then even brings a report that came after I have left.  So, Chair, you may chase Montana but…     Really, after I have even left PRASA there is a report that continues to cause a strain between me and Mr Molefe.  I mean, there you can see it in black and white.     So it tells you that this is an absolutefabrication, Chair, that Mr Molefe is busy with.  And I am not – I hear the point you are making.  But I am going to – you can see, there it is in the paragraph that here is a man who is trying to find reasons after the fact and he even forgot that this Public Protector report was issued – and Iam very clear on this issue, okay?  And I have said earlier on, Chair, that the biggest  - what actually the final straw after all of those things, you asked me did the Knysna meeting, you know…     Was a turning point.     I said no, the turning point was when I instructed PRASA not to pay, to terminate the contract with SA Fence and Gate and recover all the money.  After SAFence and Gate and Gates had received payments approved irregularly by Ms Ngoyi and then they paid into the foundation trust of Popo Molefe.  I have asked this Commission but let us subpoena the accounts of Mr Molefe and his foundation, Chair, you are going to see – you are going to see that people who come here and accuse of corruption are in fact the most corrupt.  I am just asking this Commission, go there and you will see that who is paying and you ask yourself, Chairman, come back here and explain to us how is it possible that companiescontracted to PRASA are paying into your foundation?  And most of in my evidence – in my affidavit, Chair, you know what happens after they paid?  The value of the contracts goes up.  So the more you pay – it is a very systematic scheme that Mr Molefe ran at PRASA.  It is a corruptscheme, Chair, it is in violation – I even say in my affidavit, it is actually, if you talk about the prevention – the PRECCA Act. If you look at the Popo Molefe Development Foundation you will find the evidence of gratification and all of – it is there in the evidence.  And this Commission, I will ask, Chair, the investigators, they go and take 22 page reports written by Paul O’Sullivan and that, they do not investigate because they are chasing us but really investigations are to be undertaken.  Like in this instance,the Commission – I was told the Commission will subpoena my accounts which were already close by ABSA but it cannot get where money flows, Chair.So, Mr Soni, the reason that he is – he is trying to create as if, you know, out there in public we should believe that no, they are just disagreements between Mr Molefe and the things on matters about – no, you had a man – Chair, I am a very straight man and you have got someone who was involved in schemes and you will see it is in black and what where both Minister Dipuo Peters, MrWillem Steenkamp with – and Popo Molefe were trying to force me to pay a company that failed to deliver on its project and that goes – so it goes and make donations and then they come back and say increase the value and when do they increase the value and when do they increase thevalue of this contract?  Not when I was there, I go on leave, Martha Ngoyi, when she was here, Chair, she told you about everything, but she did not tell you about her role in this particular matter and why I had to take action against her.  So it is not true, Mr Soni.     I want to be very firm and will become very clear because the Commission is going to right sweetheart(?) report that no, we think there was a fallout, Mr Montana was going left.  No.  There were wrong thingsthat were being done, Chair, and some of them I – I put my foot down and say they will never happen and SA Fence and Gates, I did not only cancel, I instructed the CEO I want us to recover the money that was paid irregularly to this company.     Chair, he must deal with it.  I know I do not have the authority, Chair, it is your authority.     But he must deal with it.     I do not know how he is going to explaincompanies contracted to PRASA – not only at PRASA, Chair, the recent one has been in parliament where Minister Gordhan was answering a question from the EFF, why companies contracted to Transnet, M & S, paid in excess of a million to the Foundation Trust.  Here is a Chairman of a company, he told you, Chair, he was a paragon of truth, of good governance when he was sitting there, he was telling you and, Chair, you even said the country needs a man like you and I said my time is coming, I want to tell DCJ about direct corrupt activities.  We are –there is the insinuation Montana did this and that, there is money in his account.     No, Chair, it is absolutely – what he is saying is absolutely correct.  The only thing that is     Page 15?     48, okay.     That I worked under Minister Radebe, Public Enterprise?     That is correct, Chair.     He worked there, Chair, yes.     49?     Chair, no, can I respond?     Because I think that is where we have a[indistinct] but let me deal with where this thing comes from and that is why, Chair, the problem with the Commission, okay?  That is why I stated in my statement, when you read Werksmans’ reports, they are saying these things. Mr Molefe brings it there as a fact in his affidavit. Okay?  That is the first issue.     Yes, it is an allegation.     Chair but there people are describing – I thought people would say Mr Mabunda and Mr Montana did these things, it was a corrupt deal and all of those things.  I was working in the office of the Minister of Public Enterprises, nè, did not know Mr Mabunda from a bar of soap.  The Ministry which is not the same as the department, only later get appointed in the Department ofPublic Enterprises, it deals with issues I think about financial analysis of State Owned Enterprises and all of those things.Now this thing that I – so this person was in the Department of Transport, sort of Public Enterprises were now closed Chair, surely ...[indistinct] Mr Montana knows someone in Durban and therefore there should be something between him and Mr Soni.  I mean is that the evidence?   This allegation Chair it doesn’t make sense to me, it seems I am being crucified for the fact that MrMabunda came to work in the Department of Public Enterprises when I was in the office of the Minister of Public Enterprises.  I did not employ him, I did not even know him from a bar of soap, why is that an issue?         Indeed Chair.     No, not in a division Chair, he was part of the Department of Public Enterprises.     It doesn’t make sense to me Chair.     Yes.     No Chair there was none.     He was appointed to the Department.     Yes, yes.     Sorry, ...[intervenes]    That is correct Chair.     That is correct.        Yes sir, that is correct, it was not launched by Minister Radebe, it was – the paragraph there, the game, the manipulation of facts Mr Montana soon followed him, Chair I didn’t follow, I applied for a position advertised, interviewed by cabinet ministers and my appointment as Deputy Director General was a cabinet decision, that is the first thing that we must – so this thing that I followed Mr Radebe, was doing – done favours and that, it is something that must – Molefe had said that no itis because of his relationship, I applied so Minister Radebe manipulated other cabinet ministers to say no appoint my boy here.   You know it is things like this Chair, and the second Chair the taxi recap programme we recall it was launched during the time of the Late Minister, Minister Daloma.       Chair can I beg to differ.   I know Mr...[intervenes]      No, no Chair.      Chair can I raise you on this one?     Because I think – I think that Mr Soni – Mr Soni is making a statement that I am not agreeing withChair, not because I have got a different view, or a different perspective.  Let me – I just want to give it two instances which I am going to deal with I think later in the day, but let me just address the first point.   You know my accusations Chair against theCommission are not accusations, I am not making accusations, I have raised specific issues which the Commission has actually conducted itself in a manner that I said violate the very terms of this Commission.   Mr Soni this Commission, and I know that when I say this Commission we include the Chair, the investigators, the legal team and everybody, and it becomes unfair because if you’ve got Ms Rangakata which was not involved but she is an employee of the Commission, she is part of the Commission, Chair thisCommission has been very selective in their application, okay.   I will tell you that when I was accused, when the accusation or the allegation about my properties I was here.  Mr Soni and the Chair making certain type of statements, but not only that Chair.   You invited everyone who accused me, there was someone who actually put an affidavit that says I am a businessman, I have done a property deal with Mr Montana, I don’t work for government, I have got nothing to do with PRASA.   What did this Commission do, they kept him aside not to comehere Chair, to hear a different view.The affidavit that has been served on me, Mr Andre Wagner.   Okay, so that is the Commission having Chair no this one we want, this one we do not want.   Okay Chair, I have mentioned the other instances of this.  Let me give you another example Chair, Mr – you asked Ms Singole the Chair was there, about Siyangena, but I am told that you are going back to it, let me use a different one of the Public Protector.   You know Mr Soni must – should look at his comments in respect of the matter of the Public Protector.   Chair not a witness out there, this Commission, the Evidence Leader, was telling the Chair that one, there is only report of the Public Protector, and Mr Montana didn’t challenge this particular report, and Chair I don’t know if – I don’t even know thatyou know that the report of the Public Protector only address about 60% of the issues what you call derailed.   The other issues were addressed by Advocate Ncubani.  When you put the two reports, you have got this extreme report that I was taking on review, it is only 50%, there is another report by Advocate Ncubani, and I was sitting there hoping that the Evidence Leader would then say to the Chair, Chair we have got this report and we have got this report, and we still have to ascertain whether Mr – no there were time to say that to drive the – not anybody, theCommission itself, the Evidence Leader, to say this damning report because you are trying to create a particular – so I have got instances Chair where this Commission has selected information that it puts as evidence and kept others outside.The reason why in my affidavit Chair is actually not admitted.   In October, 7 t h of October 2019 ...[intervenes]      Can I finish just, no can I finish this point.     7 t h October Chair 2019 after I submitted my draft the Commission wrote to me and told me that my affidavit, my evidence ...[indistinct] it is outside the terms of reference of this Commission and I said I would rathernot testify if the Commission is actually playing a role of hiding the truth.So Chair with respect I think that Mr Soni ...[intervenes]      But when he makes a statement like that I will not accept it because I have seen this Commission acting actually in a manner that I would say violates its very terms.Now you gave me some assurances in the morningChair, and I accepted that, I said let us move, but when there are assertions made when I know the facts are different ...     Thank you Chair.     Chair I accept your guidance, I would live with that, I am saying – you see for me Chair I don’t worry what Mr Molefe, Ms Ngoyi say about me, but when theCommission says certain things or deliberately omits certain evidence then I take exception, but sir you have given guidance, let us take that and move forward ja.     No, no Chair I am here Chair, I will only ask that perhaps we – request that we take a comfort break now, but I will be guided by you Chair.    Chair, I am saying it was a governmentappointment number one, and number two I am saying you can see that this entire paragraph is riddled with insinuations but some of the facts are correct.  I do not want to debate that.     Chair, I think Mr Mabunda was never at the Department of Transport.  I think probably there was an error there.  I will say the Department of Public Enterprise.     Ja, it cannot be transport.  He never ...[intervenes]     Ja.      Minister, indeed so.    Indeed.    That is correct.     That is correct Chair.    Chair, I have now I knew him from the Department of Public Enterprises.  So by the time I was at transport, I had already met him.  I knew him from there.     No, we were never close Chair.  We were employees.  Of course the nature of the Department ofPublic Enterprises was at that time, I do not know today, a very small department.  So the ministry and the department were almost operating from same floors. So it was very small, because it was actually an office before it became a department.  So we knew each other Chair, but we were not what you call friends, no.     That is correct Chair.     No, no.  For me it is the Department ofTransport Chair.     Ja, I had moved to the Department of Transport.      The Department of Transport.  Chair, can I just ...[intervenes]     Just a factual issue.  Where it says that he left.  We corrected that, that Mr Mabunda left theDepartment of Public Enterprises to pursue private business interest, and then but as far as I know, he actually went to join the provincial Department of Economic Development under Minister Tjabane in Limpopo before he went to private business.    Ja.     Interest ja, no I think that should have happened at a later stage.     That is correct Chair.     Chair, I actually never left.  As deputy director general I was responsible for a number offunctions, RE busses and taxis.  When I was doing the taxi recap, I of course I had attacks on me.  With my house being attacked by some taxi war lords or whatever, and of course the state hesitated to provide security for me. I then resigned.  Of course I was overseeing the very process of the consolidation of passenger rail entities and I was serving on the board of the SRCC as well, being DDG.  So I left Chair.  I then resigned and I said I am resigning with immediate effect. So I then sent, actually I did not even sent a letter. I think I sent an SMS to say my house was attacked by guys with AK47’s and everything.  I am no longer coming because the minister had instructed that I be protected but that protection is not forthcoming. So I am leaving.  It was during his budget vote oftransport.  I did not even go to Cape Town.  I just decided that, but a few ... a month later Chair, the minister said to me but we have not accepted your resignation.  You are a member of the board. Of SRCC and the board had asked that whilst they are busy searching for a CEO, you come and help us for a period of 18 months.  So they asked me to do three things in three months.  Complete the consolidation of rail, of rail entities. That is why we form PRASA Chair.  Prepare for the10 FIFA World Cup and to save Metro Rail from collapse.  That is what I was asked to do.  They say instead of you leaving, help the board with this task, but of course later I became, it was then taken to cabinet that I stayed there and I stayed there for another seven years. So I spent nine and a half years in the rail spacing.  So I never left, actually despite the fact that I have resigned because of the violence that was happening at that time.     Chair, I think ... I am not sure, but I need to check especially considering the tax implications of your question Chair.  Chair, I think ...[intervenes]    Indeed Chair, on this particular one Chair.  I did not declare it upfront.  Chair, I cannot recall exactly the details, but I had resigned, but I ended up not leaving because of the situation and then I was tasked.     I did not go to work for ...[intervenes]     Well, I do not think that it was a full month Chair.     For about two, three weeks and I was told that we have never accepted your resignation.    We think you must, you serve on theboard, so go and help the board on this task.    Ja.    Chair, even in that one I will be forced to pay back if I was paid, so I am very careful now, to agree with that response.     It was Mr Eddie Lekota, but at that time Chair he had left and we had a lady called, acting in the position called Ms Nellie Thlaba.     No Chair, it was a cabinet decision, because I acted and in October 2007, then cabinet approved my appointment.     It was an elected position, ja.     No, that is correct Chair.     Yes Chair, I think this matter is in the public protector report as well, where the Mr Mabunda or him working with a German company called the German Rail Operators, Ditshabana, had tendered and won the tender and there was a complaint that they got the tender improperly and one of the things, positive things about the rail, it actually dismissed that part of the thing, saying thatallegation is not substantiated.     Yes Chair, the first one as I say was a signalling.  There was a transaction advisor for signalling.    And let me explain, I do not know Chair if you will allow me to because we are going to deal with these things.     But our relationship with Mr Mabunda ...[intervenes]     Because I think it is helpful for the commission and the questions that will come.     Chair, the ... they tendered.  They won this thing.  We took a decision which was done by myself and the board at that time the Chair of the committee ofthe board on this was Ms Bridgette Gasa.  We decided to say we have interacted with all these companies all over the world.     That is the ...[intervenes]     No, the finance capital investment and procurement.     Committee.  That what we need to do, we need to approach the Germans.  There was a letter that Siyaya had written to the then Minister of Transport, Minister Sibunda Bele at that time.  The letter was then forwarded to us at PRASA.Where the Germans indicated to us what they have and that they have partnered with this company.  So I say no, that is good, but we want to see the Germans.  I travelled with Ms Gasa from the board.  We went then to see, we then took certain decisions in our discussions with the group.We say look, we are commencing with and I will explain at the end why I am explaining this to the commission.  We said PRASA is implementing a very complex modernisation program, yet it does not have theskills to do so. Can we sign an agreement, and we signed a memorandum of agreement with the German.  On signalling of course they won a tender, so it was not an issue, but where you see them, and I think the other tenders you askabout Chair, is in respect of the what is it called?Of the depot modernisation program.  Where we are preparing for new trains.  The German support to us was invaluable Chair.  They help us with all the designs.  In PRASA, when we started PRASA, there were not even drawings, technical drawings for most of these facilities. [indistinct] Siyaba DB, had actually put a tender for the Braamfontein, after we signed an agreement they have also put the bid for the Braamfontein facility.  The Braamfontein depot.   Which it is modernisation, which we discussed earlier on.  Now Chair, the CEO of PRASA technically comes and briefs me about the tenders that they were running.  I said but we have got a problem, because what you are giving us is not a railway solution, it is a construction. A depot looks, it looks like it is outside the railway, but it is an integral part of railway operations, including safety and operations.  So it tells us that in South Africa,after we have done this bid, we actually do not have that company, the companies that understand that. That instead of appointing GB to build Braamfontein, are you also going to appoint them to build Durban, Salt River and Cape Town as well as Wolmerton inPretoria?  We have got a memorandum with them.  Let us agree that they then provide us with the engineers to do the drawings for us so that when you go out on tender, so the relationship Chair has to do with that. Of course, people have tried to link it and say no, Mabunda and Montana public enterprises and all of those things.  So we live in a world where we are no longer supposed to know people Chair or that should not have been employed. So Siyaya DB, what has happened I said in mystatement Mr Soni that six years after I have left, there is no depot that has been built, and Chair you heard the testimony of Judge Makubela here.  Remember the issue had to do with the payment of Siyaya and that dispute. The reality of the matter Chair, because of what we are doing to ourselves as a country, we have a situation where PRASA and Siyaya are in dispute, that all the drawings, the technical drawings and the plans, are sitting with people and they say okay, we have done this work, we have not been paid. We are keeping these things, because you do not appreciate the work.  The essence of that is that PRASA today is actually left with the situation because you say everything is irregular, everything is corrupt.  So here is a young organisation. It cannot implement anything today Chair, because for I think the dispute that this commission was discussing was about 80 million, 80 86 million.  Yet we cannot rule out infrastructure worth billions, precisely because the technical, and that is the reason why we needed that partnership with the Germans. There is collapse, PRASA will not be able to implement anything Chair, unless if they knew its board and management, it does not have to be with Siyaya.  They need to appoint a strategic partner that would assist themin doing that technical work, even before they go out on tender.Because if you go out on tender, you do not have this detailed work.  you do not have the bill of quantities, you do not have the technical drawings.  You then have a lot of variations, because you cannot even control the cost in this process Chair.     No, no Chair.  I am saying when he wasemployed at public enterprises ...[intervenes]     I came to know him.    And he left, he disappeared.    And I think that is when he was working in Limpopo for Minister Tjabane.    And then he came back.  Of course he was part of, it was not his company but another company he was part of, called I cannot recall the scrapping agencies of all taxis, and then of course the tenders that were processed.     No, no.  He was not an engineer.     Chair, I think my understanding, he is the founder of Siyaya.  Which was I think that is training based on what he was doing at the Department of Transport.  He was dealing with the financials of state owned enterprises.  He belonged to a division called entity over sight where entities reporting to the public enterprises, Eskom ... sothose would be the teams that analyses the balance sheet, what level of recapital ... so I think it comes more on the finance side than on the engineering side. But he had, Siyaya had a lot of engineers from South Africa, and they partnered with the Germancompany.  The German railway, the PRASA or Transnet version on the German side.     No Chair, I think there are different companies.  There is Siyaya Engineering, I think that they have got the Siyaya Group.  I think they call it S Group.    But they had in a relationship with PRASAthey were primarily in the partnership between Siyaya DB, which was a specific partnership that they had Chair.     Chair, I do not know exactly.  I cannot confirm that but I know he is a founder.  He was the founder.  Whether he was Chairman or President or CEO, I cannot confirm that.     Chair, yes I can confirm with signalling, I spoke about it, there was a tender and they got the tender.  With fuel, Siyaya got the tender and with other engineering services and Daniel Mthimkhulu Chair, our technical division Chair was the one doing most of that work. So I do not have each and every detail on some of the projects they were doing there.      No Chair.  You see, that is why this thingof Mthimkhulu, the way it is written in this page, I do not know.  Can I have one minute to just explain?    In the Swifambo matter.  No Chair, then I think perhaps let us leave it at that Chair.  I will come back to it and deal with ...[intervenes]     Ja.    I will deal with it at that time, yes.     Ja Chair, I think so.    Is that the value of contracts or the actual payment?   Yes.  I think Chair, if we sign the document, if I remember very well, because I participated in the liquidation hearing of Swifambo was called as a witness there, the amount of ...[intervenes]     No, Siyaya, sorry.  Of Siyaya.  My apologies Chair.  Of Siyaya.  The amount was in the orderof about 850 million.  So I think maybe Mr Molefe is not far, far from the point in terms of the amount.     Mr Molefe was never ostracised.  He did wrong things and that is why he created many enemies as well.      No Chair, he was not ostracises.  I think a lot of, I think there was a lot Chair, where people realisedthat Mr Molefe was actually how would I say Chair?  He basically led a double life for lack of a better word.  On the one hand ...[intervenes]     Chair, maybe ...[intervenes]     Exactly Chair.     But he mentioned to be specific Chair, inhis testimony firstly he says parliament did nothing.  He then said he briefed the AND national executive, I do not know of course about, I was not part of that briefing and thirdly Chair, he mentioned Minister [indistinct] and I think both the minister, the former minister and the deputy minister came, and actually refuted the case that he made. So ...[intervenes]     So I do not think so Chair.     Chair, can I give you a good example, soto understand Popo Molefe?    Let me put it in Phedi and I put it in, you know there are times when you say in your father ’s kraal you have got sheep, and then every day you come andcheck your sheep, you find that one sheep is missing and you take the dogs, you go around the forest to check, there should be something eating my sheep.  You go out there Chair, you do not look here inside.     Yes Chair, let me say it in English.  That when you look after your father ’s ...[intervenes]     Chair, so when you look at the case of Popo Molefe, I am saying Mr Soni, it is a situation where you have got sheep at home, at your father ’s homestead.  Every morning you wake up, there is one sheep missing and then you take the dogs and the boys, you go out.     Yes.     I am trans, yes.     But then one day you discover but I do not see even trail of blood, of anything dragging these sheep and then one day you pull off the wool from one of thesheeps only to find that you have got a wolf in your father ’s kraal.  So he is eating the sheep Chair.  Lots of people have been able to see through Mr Molefe and I think that for someone who has made such a huge contribution, I think that he needs to reflect himself.  He cannot fight corruption and still have, receiving money from, through his foundations. Those things do not go hand in hand Chair.  So he would be ostracised.  I do not doubt about it Chair.    Paragraph 57?    Ja, I am there.      Page 17.    Indeed Chair.  Indeed.     Chair I think in the application by PRASA signed by Mr Molefe, that is what they set out.     And I tried Chair to apply as a friend of the Court but my application was not accepted and I think Chair it is very unfortunate.  It is ...[intervenes]    I say it was very unfortunate.     Because having the court dealt with the matter where there were huge misrepresentation, all the facts were not placed before the courts, but we respectjudgment by all courts Chair, but the judgment in my affidavit, I go into detail about this particular judgment Chair.     Indeed Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct.    That is correct Chair.     No Chair, proceed.  I want to make a comment on the two judgments and ja.     Ja.     Yes.     No, no that is correct Chair.  I agree with that, ja.     I applied for leave, which he also dismissed Chair.     Chair, I need, I did appeal the decision but let me just, because ...[intervenes]     I did appeal the decision.   Yes.     No, no, no both the two judgments Chair ...[intervenes]     I did not agree with them, I still reject them and actually in my affidavit I deal with them.     But I do not know whether you want me to deal with them now.     Found, ja.     No Chair, I do not know when Swifambo was formed, the date or the period before that, but with bids of this nature, that is what happened because if a company bids, either an established company or people who form either JV’s, it happens. It is not unusual.  Actually that is what happens.  If you look at what Gabela is.  Gabela is an [indistinct].  But it then say we want to bid, let us form a company.  This is a special purpose vehicle.  To bid for that project. Okay.  You then assess the capacity of that.  you for example in the Gabela case you will ask for what we call parent company guarantees, to say but this is a special purpose vehicle, if we want guarantees, who is going to stand for this guarantee?So Chair, it has happened.  In fact, it actuallyshows lack of understanding of what he has been saying about this and the drama that has been created, but I will comment more on it when I give my overall comment to assist the commission to have an appreciation of what is happening here.     59.1?    Ja no Chair, I accept that.    I do not agree with them, but I accept it.    I have read the judgment Chair, I have seen that.     That is correct Chair.     I accept that Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair, listening to the reading of thefindings by the Court, it gets so scary and if you do not know the facts of this matter, and that is why Chair when PRASA went, and Chair I accept that I am not here to review this matter. I will just state the facts that, because I think theCourts got it wrong.     And Chair, I am going to say something which, and say it with a level of seriousness, because it is in my affidavit.  Both Courts ...[intervenes]     I am saying that I am going to say something on this issue, more specifically the two judgments.     Which I think that, is something that I take seriously.  But if I could be allowed some time to deal with this issue and assist this commission ...[intervenes]     Indeed, indeed.  Thanks very much for that.  You see, you are making life difficult for me.  Because all the things I am about to say Chair, I do not want it to be viewed as if I do not respect the judicial, I do not respect the Courts and all of those things. Chair, when PRASA went to Court, and again Iaccept the fact that we are not here to review the this particular, the Court judgments and all of those things, and I take into account that these are civil matters.  So the Courts also took decisions based on balance of probabilities. Chair, when PRASA went to Court, I read the paper.  The PRASA paper.  I was shocked with these papers, the amount if misrepresentation and I went to Court.  I said look, as a former CEO of PRASA all these findings that they, because they emerge from the, what is it called?    The affidavit that was signed by Mr Molefe on behalf of, anonymously denying the Courts of material fact which if they were placed before the Court, I am convinced Chair, that this judgment we would not have. That is the first issue Chair I want to say. I said as a former CEO of PRASA, I think I know the ins and outs of this matter.  I want to assist the Court.  I do not want to support this side or that side, but some of the things, and I said if indeed some of the allegations that are being made against me are true, then I should actually have been joined as a respondent and I was not. I think it was, I felt terrible when I was denied the opportunity to assist the Court in that matter.  Chair, there are certain things that are just not true, which the Courthas accepted and hopefully that when they are pursued probably by other agencies, I mean the first issue about, we know that there is a general use of the word corruption in the Francis J matter, judgment. I say Francis J when he dealt with the issue about,and I think Mr Soni touched on it, about the issue of admissibility of hearsay under what circumstances, I look at that Chair.  It was a serious error in my view, and I have consulted other people and asked, because it gave rise to this. Secondly, the issues about Daniel Mthimkhulu, firstly Daniel Mthimkhulu was an executive manager in the PRASA rail division.  But so much power has been given to this man Chair, as if he was so powerful.  He reported to a CEO of the rail division.People will tell you that there was this powerful guy reporting to Montana, even had found its way through the judgment.  Chair, let me just highlight three things from the Francis J judgment.  The first, and I will tell you what other additional issue. The reason for excluding me from that matter, I do not think, I have gone out to check, I am not sure that they are being sound.  Some of the things that have been accepted by the Courts, could actually could have been tested. For example, it is being alleged that Mr Molefe said that PRASA at that time changes procurement strategy so that Swifambo can represent an outright purchase.  Chair, we know even from the bidding process that that is factually incorrect. In fact other companies, General Electric is another bidder that was participating in that process.  He submitted an outright purchase that is there, and I put it in my affidavit so that I can assist the Court.  So I was dismissed and that fact, left out. So the Court is left with one version on which to make its decision, that only Swifambo was given, was treated fairly, what is it called?  Was given the privilege to ... it is not correct Chair.  The, I presented facts for example on the bid, on the briefing, compulsory briefingsession.It actually shows that all bidders, including those that did not bid, were given the opportunity to do all of those things that were there.  Again, if that fact is not before the Court, the Court will work on the basis that is before it. So I am trying to Mr Soni, to go around so that I am not seen to be attacking the judiciary, to take a more light approach to this issue.  Thirdly Chair, it is not true that Daniel Mthimkhulu wrote this specification.  PRASA had acommittee.Daniel Mthimkhulu was the head of executive, he was the head engineering services in our range division.  So this team PRASA had engineering functions in its different divisions.  On the technical side, in the rail sideas well as in its property side. So Daniel was a Chair of this particular committee, but he did not draft the specifications.  We actually had engineers who specialises in locomotives and everything involved in that process and in my affidavit I provide the names of that.So the Court had put a lot of emphasis.  Mr Molefe says in his affidavit the Court says Daniel was dishonest and, was dishonest and Swifambo did not oppose, but Chair, Swifambo cannot oppose something about PRASA. The internal matters of PRASA because they know nothing about that. So I think it is unfair in fact to expect Swifambo to talk about internal PRASA matters.  Let me add Chair, two important matters.  You know we are making a mistake Chair.  If you cancel Swifambo, I think you must cancel Gabela. Because we are dealing right in our, and I took the legal advice.  It was written by Mazwai, Dolah Mazwai and I attached it as part of the thing there.  It actually says thatmost of the issues that are regarded as irregularities, actually PRASA did not ask for them and you can see that some of the things that Mr Molefe is talking about, were actually afterthoughts Chair. Because at the time you would recall that even thePPPFA was not applicable to PRASA, because PRASA and other state owned enterprises were exempt from this particular issue.  When Swifambo Chair put a bid, I hear that there was no capacity. The head of Swifambo is an engineer.  Oswald Mashabo is an engineer.  There were four other entities other than what is it called?  Oswald Swifambo, Oswald Mashaba.  Other entities which are doing work in the rail space Chair, and they have never been mentioned because it disprove the notion that you have an entity that did nothave capacity. Chair, the most important thing that South Africa had to decide on, with regard to this locomotive, PRASA I think it was buying these locomotives for its long distance, 88 locomotives.  Where should it build these locomotives?  Did it have the quantities to build a factory?For example to build this locomotive.  The big answer is no, PRASA could not have done that.  The other company that uses locomotives, PRASA requires locomotives for 8% of its business.  Transnet requireslocomotives for 100% of its business. So we can see that Transnet would buy locomotives, or even build the platform, but PRASA and Transnet are not using same locomotives.  A passenger locomotive and a frail locomotive are not one and the samething. So when PRASA went on tender for 88, it ended up contracting on 70.  70 locomotives cannot sustain Chair, even a factory.  So we did not specify Chair, in the bid and when I say we I am referring to at the time I was at PRASA.  I am referring to our procurement teams, not me personally.They did not specify in the RFP the fact that you have to structure your relationship.  The bid provide us with a solution.  So the company structured it themselvesin many different ways and I just find it odd that you then take and punish them for the manner that we have, but what is interesting Chair, is that in this submission by Mr Molefe, he talks about the bid adjudication committee. We have heard that the Courts talks about Montana.  If there is one bid where I never even played a part, it is this bid Chair, because it was over three billion rand, over my delegation.  It went to the board, to the bid evaluation committee.It then went to the bid adjudication committee whowas Chaired by Mr Phiro Holero who came here and never shared with this commission the fact that he was the Chair and had recommended to the board.  Ms Matangoya was part of the bid adjudication committee, who was here. So, and this adjudication committee, one of itsmajor issues before they recommend to the board is to advise the board why, for example to say we have picked up certain, either non-compliance or irregular issues.  We think you must approve subject to the following conditions or we have disqualified these people because ... they did not do that Chair. [indistinct] Matango and others, they recommended to the board.  When the board of PRASA decided on this, none of these issues were there Chair.  Now Mr Molefe write about these issues, as if he only learnt about it after. Chair, Mr Molefe in 2014 in September, travelled to Spain.     Ja, no, no it is true sir, I hear that, but I am just illustrating a point here.  He said to the Court when he went to Spain and he delivered speeches on locomotives, he said certain things Chair which even contradict to what he presented.So the Francis J judgment, which were I think thateven from the beginning the judge defined himself that the Court has got the responsibility to fight corruption.  Which I think is very important Chair, that the Court has got a duty to fight corruption where evidence suggest that. In the Swifambo matter, I want to argue Chair and Iwill still argue to, till things change.  In the Swifambo matter, you may have identified those issues, but I think the Court went beyond his duties when he declared the Court, that contract to be corrupt. Chair, and I am saying that after I have now had at the benefit of even seeing the evidence that was presented before this commission, by the liquidators of Swifambo.  I think Chair, mister ... was it Sacks?   ADV VAS SONI    The forensic investigation, and Mr Mula I think.    Indeed, they came and presented Chair and they gave the numbers.  Those numbers, they tell us two important things Chair.  That none of that money that you have seen flowing, number one has flown to PRASA people. That is the first issue and it is very interesting that in corruption because who is supposed to be paid?  Is theone who award the contract, who does not exist.  That is the first issue.  The second thing Chair, I think you made the point to say there is this 3.5 billion rand contract, okay. Chair, PRASA spent on only 2.6 billion rand and when you analyse the numbers Chair, out of those numbers1.9 billion are used.I use approximate numbers.  Approximately 1.9 billion of that amount went to buy the transition components and everything.  300 million went on tax. Another 100 million goes onto issues of custom and the transportation of these locomotives.  We are sitting in the situation where the country makes noise about 2.6 billion rand corruption when in fact the money that went to the directors of Swifambo, it is quite clear that we talk in the region of about 2.8, 280 million rand Chair that isthere. The big question is are the directors of Swifambo, because remember Swifambo had delivered already 13 trains Chair.  They have built another seven that is on its way and they were in the process of building seven.  It is not a contract, I have heard this commission dealing with contracts where people took money and disappeared. Not in this particular one Chair.  There was no corruption in this particular issue and when I read the judgment, I expected Francis J Chair, to say we think thatMr Montana, Mr Mthimkhulu ... Mr Mthimkhulu Chair was one player. There was one engineer called Mr Ingwa Sekula who actually drafted the first RFI in this particular matter.  Not Mr Mthimkhulu.  Now you can see that the Courts,because they have been presented ... if your own father say my son it is very bad, he comes to Court and say my son is very bad. Why would the Court not believe the father, and this is what has happened Chair.  In my affidavit, I raise a matter Chair about what I found when I went to apply, which I regarded as improper conduct on the part of Francis J Chair, I raise it in my thing, that Judge Francis J met with Mr Molefe during the hearing of the matter. I was there with my legal team and I have said inmy affidavit that the conduct was improper and that I am considering actually taking the matter with a judicial service committee, with rather the judicial conduct committee, so that they deal with this matter because I think his conduct Chair, in the middle of this issue, he has met in the morning the legal teams of the respective parties. Then when we took a break, Mr Molefe joined the process.  He met them in the Court.  So Chair, I am not surprised when I see a judge, when a judgment is writtenin that way, but let me tell you something more Chair that will probably shock you.Mr Soni relies so much on the SCA judgment.  Let me tell you what the first, I was not even part of this.  The first, the first three paragraphs Chair, written by thejudges, the five judges, the full bench of five judges, they write a damning thing and they attack me Chair. I said well, I was the CEO of PRASA.  The judges maybe take it as it is not factual, it is what Mr Molefe said to the Court in the application.  Chair, when I prepared for my affidavit here, and it is in one of the letters I wrote to the secretary of the commission.The first three paragraphs of the SCA judgment, it comes from a report that is written by Basilius Consolium Professional Services, one of the companies contracted toWerksmans.  It was not the judgment first, it was this report. Word for word Chair, in fact I intended that when I come to testify, I want to read to you this judgment and read to you this report.  I asked in my letter to the secretary, who wrote this report Chair.  How is it that the judges of the Supreme Court, five judges can actually write in exactly word by word, comma full stop everything. Chair, there are many other factual inaccuracies.  You know what the judges in the SCA say Chair, they saythe PRASA locomotives have never even moved.  When this locomotives Chair were stopped and they have done 76000 kilometres, the judges made a number of other things Chair and I do not want to pursue them. So I am saying that we have to respect the Courts. But I see a judge in the middle of an important hearing, meet with one of the parties on the side.  I then have judges who write the judgment and is taking them from a report which actually is not a report that was tabled during, was presented as evidence. No, it is actually an intelligence report given by Basilius Consolium Professional Services.  I want anyone to tell me Chair.  So yes, we respect the Courts, but here we are seeing disgraceful conduct in my view.  We are seeing conduct that is inappropriate and we are seeingjudgments, and Chair I think that I am prepared there, it is in my affidavit. It is Annexure, one of the key annexures that I was submitting here.  Where I say look at these judges.  Look at the judgment.  We are being asked as a country if you have got evidence of improper conduct on the part of judges, present it to us. I included that report Chair and I included the judgment and you will see Chair, that this judgment, I reject it Chair and you know when the Constitutional Courtsaid it does not have a prospect of success because when it was looking at what happened with the judgment of Francis J ...[intervenes]    Absolutely Chair.     Exactly.  Chair, I am not criticising the panel.    Yes Chair.  No, no but even with that Chair, I do not think the Constitutional Court would have looked at the two judgments and said there is nothing newthat will come out of this thing.  I respect that.  But what I am simply saying, I think it will be irresponsible of me, as a South African, not to tell this commission that or not to go to the judicial conduct committee of the JSC and say here is a judge who met with one party on the side. That is irregular and that here are five judges who take, who attacks the BCPS report attacks me.  They say PRASA was controlled by one Mr Lucky Montana, and with his officials appointed what is it called?  Here are the facts Chair. The board appointed Swifambo, not Lucky Montana.  The officials who adjudicated on this committee Chair, is not my officials.  Are actually officials who came to this commission to accuse me of all sorts of wrongdoings.  Molele, Matangoye. They were there to do all of those things.  So Chair, I am asking myself how to deal with this issue, but I see ... I think that we must protect and defend the judiciary, but you must defend the right things.  We cannot defend something that is so obvious that the judges have taken Chair. It is my evidence, and that is why I think the sooner my affidavit is presented there so that we can deal with what I call disgraceful conduct by the judges in this matter.    No Chair, not on these issues.     Because I have decided that I want to deal with this, I do not want to pursue Chair.     But the cost for me, the cost of these court applications have been huge on me.  I have taken a strategic approach.    Go to the commission and put them there.  What happens, the country will know the truth.  But Chair, it would have been the right forum for me to do that, but I do not have the capacity.  But I am saying Chair,  here is direct evidence and that is what I want to ask Werksmanswhen they come to cross-examine me, to say you wrote this paragraph with your people. How did it find itself into the judgment as the first three paragraphs of this judgment?  It is so wrong.  It is so disgraceful Chair, and I think we should when we criticise, we should be very specific and Mr Soni, that is why I say that I need to be careful so that I do not even want to undermine what the former, the late President Mandela had said about the Courts.     As if now I am challenging the authority of our international icon.    That is correct.     Correct.     I cannot remember the floor.     Ja, I cannot recall but it was in the Johannesburg High Court.    Oh, it will not be recorded.  Yes, indeed Chair I can confirm that.    Chair, I am saying I do not know.  Do you want to deal with it?  I was asked Chair to respond to this judgment and then ...[intervenes]    Okay Chair.     No, no I am glad that the commission has followed that Chair.  I have not seen the response and I think at the right time I will deal with that, including the witnesses that I was with and that is why I put it that ...[intervenes]    The conduct in that way.  So I am happy.  I will not respond now, because I did not even know where his office is.  I said I saw him and I think that was the ... that is where in fact from my legal representative, theHonourable Judge in the morning even met with the different legal teams before the start of the case.     No, no I was outside.  I arrived early when they were still meeting.     Outside, outside.  Outside the Court.     When they were meeting in one of the rooms.     Can I suggest that I see the response of the judge, so that by the time we deal with it, because remember it is not on this specific matter, it is ...[intervenes]     Of his response?    And I look at that and say, and decide whether I even stand by that, and the witnesses.     Because I think that I was reacting to the judgment and I made this point, and it is there in my affidavit Chair.      No.  I have not seen it Chair.    So let me not say no, but I have not seen it.    All the affidavits that I was informed that people wanted to challenge including Werksmans, Judge Francis J as well as ...[intervenes]     As well as, I think there was a third one or Mr Pollow Sullivan.  So I was informed, but I never saw the actual papers.     No, no I did not see them Chair.  No, I was... at that, I was ja.  So Chair, I will double check ...[intervenes]    And then when we deal with my affidavit, we can deal with those in much greater detail Chair.     That is correct Chair.     No Chair, I had an attorney and there was a counsel who argued the matter.    Ja, I saw him even arrive in Court, Mr Molefe and then I saw him when he came from the very same room that I mentioned.     Yes, the answer is yes.    I did tell my attorney.  I was with my ...[intervenes]     I tell my attorney Chair, no I did not discuss with the counsel because he was appointed of course by the attorney but I was with my attorney Chair and we spoke to Mr Molefe in fact on that day.    But Chair, I have confirmed that.  I have confirmed that Mr ...[intervenes]     No, no, no.  Chair, I think I must take exception to this.  You see Chair, now I hope that Mr Soni will have the same energy when we also deal with the next, with the other matter phrased.  You said and I think you have guided us. You said Chair, that it is good that Mr Soni had put forward the version.  He is proceeding to argue on behalfof the Honourable Judge.  Let me be served with the documents, take advice on the issues and reply.    I think that is the correct way Chair.     Because if we do that, then let us argue and I bring the two reports.     And read it out to you and then I do not know what Mr Soni ...[intervenes]    I thought your guidance was that Chair ...[intervenes]     You have said criticism of the judiciary,where there is a sound basis.  You know, when Mr Molefe came out of that room Chair, when I was with my legal team, the attorney, okay.  He came, we even spoke to him.  he was hugely embarrassed Chair, but I am suggesting Chair that instead of Mr Soni taking the judge as, he can come and put his version here and say Montana is wrong. I see the affidavit but he is arguing on this particular issue.  I have then been given the benefit of even what the judge has said.     So if I have to come back and answer to it, I will do exactly that Chair.     And Chair, by the way I have put my version about the five judges of the SCA as well.     Chair, I do not have the actual dates.     Okay.     No, no Chair, I did not make but I made reference to that, that I am considering laying a formal complaint.  I mention that in my affidavit, yes.     Well, Chair it was ...[intervenes]      Indeed Chair.     That is correct, Chair.    No, no Chair.  No, no Chair.  Chair, I have never told.  We know, here in this Commission as we sit here, we know that I made a choice, taking my legal advice that I should do it in that way because at that time we were careful not to be seen to be supporting one party over the other but I knew for a matter of fact..And you know Chair the one thing I do, I write my own affidavit and I then sent them to the legal – I writethe facts, I write the story and say tell me what I am getting wrong, correct it and all of those things.  The affidavit on Swifambo, I think it is 76-pages, where I detail all of those things.  And I say in that in fact PRASA, which means Mr Molefe and Werksmans have withheld valuable information ...[intervenes]      Yes, and I exercised my right...  You areasking me why did not I do something as I did not elect to do it at time.       How does it help state capture, Chair, that I decided to be – to make a different application andnot help?  I choice not to work with Swifambo.  I wanted to go and assist the court so that the court can see the truth on this issue.     At that time you are referring to?    No, no.  At time, Chair, I knew him.     Ja.     Chair, I think I have first met him after PRASA in my contract.     The Swifambo contract, yes.      I think that is in ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry Chair.    Chair, I think it should have been 2012, ja.     When I first met Auswell Mashaba ...[intervenes]      ...and his entirety Swifambo Team, it was in 2012 after they were awarded the contract.     Swifambo, Chair, with all his parties in it, yes, they would suffer, yes.     But Chair, again, I deposed to an affidavit, a 76-page affidavit.  I put all the issues of why I thought the court – because ultimately it is the court that set aside the contract, not PRASA.  I put an affidavit.  I put the reasons and the facts and a lot of supporting affidavits.  For example, I put in documents that shows that not only Swifambo but PE hindered.  I have also a report, for example, done by the GM, Treasury at PRASA that makes a comparison of the different bids.  I put that in my evidence to show that the story that, for example, only Swifambo was given an opportunity, that is false.  So before ...[intervenes]      No, no.  But can you give me – can youplease allow me?     Exactly, Chair.  So I am saying Chair that – Mr Soni says to me, after I have applied to court, that why did I not discuss the matter with the Swifambo?  I did not have any obligation to discuss with Swifambo.  I did not have to go to Swifambo.  If he claims that I was not happy and at that time Chair you will recall maybe you want to deal with the Serega(?) matter.  PRASA hadadopted a strategy, this litigation strategy.  They were doing that and they were using my name.  I was being dragged and – but I was not.  Being called to respond, it is before myself, okay?     In this particular – you know, when you look at the Swifambo matter, the initial assertion by the – on the PRASA papers, was that the Swifambo matter was approved by Lucky Montana.  Now we know legally they want to change the papers because they realise that that was false.  It was a false assertion ...[intervenes]      I did not have an obligation Chair.     And ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Chair, I do not think Mr Soni ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]      So Chair, without – will I also be send the responses of the five judges of the SCA on that judgment?     But Chair I have raise(?) proper conduct about the five judges.     And nothing, but the Commission shouldalso do the same, not on judge.       Can I ask another question?  I am sorry, Chair.       I do not want to delay the proceedings.     Is it – we are all accountable.  I am here because of accountability.  To come and answer on certain allegations made against me.  I am making allegations against the judge.And I thought that, Chair, the stronghold would be that you are raising a serious allegation within that – the Supreme Court of Appeal because it goes to assure even us.      ...it is not the right thing to do.     But Chair can I really object to this?  Because I thought ...[intervenes]      Because I thought you guided us, Chair, to take a more balanced approach.     That there are no counts Chair.  You know, my criticism – and I do go into detail – not on this specific matter Chair.  I never accused the judges of corruption.  I did not do that in my affidavit.  And I think that we should not go to that.  I spoke about improper conduct, Chair, in my thing.     If I leave this matter, there are eight other matters where I said the judges made the – make errors.  give only one example where they said the trains arrivedand they have never moved.  It is a factual issue.  The trains have done 76 000 km’s but I make the point...  You see, Chair.  I am trying to be balanced here.  I am trying to here And make sure that I do not throw stones.      The truth of the matter is.  I am saying And it is a serious issue Chair because if I judge writes a report Or a judgement Which is. - I respect that.  I have no question with that.  But here is a judgement And this judgement - the attorneys at. Werksmans are fighting this issue on behalf of PRASA.     For the record Chair.  I had never accused judges of corruption.      That I must say.     We did not deal with it in that way.     No, Chair.     This, actually Chair, is the summary ofwhat I said comes from another report but ...[intervenes]      ... made the point Chair.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  Just briefly, Chair.  Firstly, of course, we know that I have challenged the report.  Instituted the review application in this particular matter, Chair.  And dealt with the ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Chair.  My apologies.     Chair, I think – I put the reviewapplication in Pretoria, challenging the – I put an application I think a few days after the PP released the report.  And by the way, let me again repeat.  When the report was issued, Chair, I was not at PRASA.  And I think, I find it very strange that particularly in paragraph 72 thatMr Molefe could use the Public Protector ’s report as they were dealing with my – I have left PRASA.  I was not there.  I do not know if you see that Chair.     Ja ...[intervenes]      Chair, I am simply saying there is no relationship between my resignation and the PublicProtector ’s report.     But Chair let me raise ...[intervenes]      No, I accept that Chair.     Thank you very much.     So let me raise just a few issues.     Because I have put – I said I have put in a review application ...[intervenes]      ...in August 2015.  The first part of my review application, I dealt with the errors of law that thePublic Protector had committed in the PRASA investigation.  One of the things I raised Chair is the fact that the Public Protector, for example, applied Section 38 of the PFMA which actually does not apply to PRASA.  Even some parts of the contract and all.  So I have detailed those.  No, I will not repeat.     I will not repeat that here Chair.     But Chair let me – and then, of course, inFebruary of 2016, I then moved the legal constitutional issues.       To then pick each and every allegation and a finding on that report.  I did that Chair.  Of course, the Public Protector had promised that she will publish volume 2 because she has only dealt with 50% of this, Chair.  She published volume 2 of her report in six months before she left, before she leaves office.  She left office without publishing that report which had an impact, ofcourse, on the ability of our review application without all those issues not being – because we could not challenge half the report that is there, Chair.Now, Chair, if you look at paragraph 68 …[intervenes]    It took almost three years for the PP office to actually finalise, after Advocate – I think she left in 20...     2016.     And I think that the other report was onlyfinalised – was it last year, volume 2, which are two reports that actually do not actually speak the same language, as it were.  Chair, I have written to the office of the Public Protector, that is Advocate …[intervenes]     Well, Chair, that was the – the advice I got was that it is proper to deal with the report in its total because at that time …[intervenes]    No, Chair, she postponed a lot of matters to volume 2 of her report.     Which she did not then do.     Which she could not do.     Well, Chair, she said within six months.  At that time she left, so the deadline she set herself, she could not honour, Chair.     But I followed that with the office of the Public Protector until they have course produced volume 2 of the report.  Volume 2 of the report, not the same line, Chair, that has been taken in Derailed, completely different.  I think that in all the matters it actually dismissed all the matters but one where it deals with theissues of the sale of a property between Transnet and PRASA and she say they should have followed a tender process, as it were.Now there was another court challenge to volume 2, Chair, which came from one of the organisations in CapeTown to say she did not do a proper investigation and all of those things.  So there have been a number of issues but, Chair, if I could just highlight a few things.     That I have raised, without taking the time.     You know, Chair, the heart of the Public Protector report and the finding quoted by Mr Molefe is inparagraph 68 and that speaks to Siyagena.  When you say the report of the Public Protector – of course I said in my first – the review application, I dealt with the errors of law, I have dealt with the Public Protector, Adv Madonsela.  Actually not even understanding PRASA, applying even legal prescripts that were not applicable to PRASA.  I think I have attached again in my affidavit, I have attached both my review application as well as a supplementary affidavit.  In that supplementary affidavit, Chair, I deal with then the actual details.  Now one of them is actually in 68.  This isabout Siyangena, Chair.Chair, the Derailed, Adv Madonsela said – stated there, Chair, that there were two stations that were extended to seven stations giving the contract a value of some 1.95 billion.  That is not correct, Chair.  Before 20 –in the period leading up to 2010 there were two stations that were modernised and Chair, let me clarify it because, by the way, before I go into that, you asked a question to Ms Ngoyi during the evidence to say were companies that were appointed pushed aside and Siyangena was put in there?  She confirmed, Chair.   Now I want to – and I said when I am here I need to clarify.  It is not correct, Chair.  Companies were appointed to modernise and build stations.They continued.  Siyagena was dealing with the installation of systems intothose stations, so there were no companies that were pushed aside and Siyangena pushed in them.   Chair, here in 68 we are dealing with 2009.  Intersite, a division of PRASA appoints Siyagena as what we call a nominated or a preferred or nominated subcontractor.  So they appoint them through a process, a competitive process and say when we appoint people to work on these stations, their people are going to install these systems, access controls and everything, it is going to be Siyangena.  So Siyangena is appointed in that way.Now there is another project, Chair, awarded to Siemens.  Siemens is doing the rest of the network.  Now these were 2010 project.  In 2010, Sir, in January 2010, just a few months before the World Cup Siemens had then withdrawn from a number of PRASA stations because therewas disagreement about monies, how much should be the value of some of the stations, so they pulled out of that.  PRASA had four months to prepare the stations for 2010. Intersite with PRASA then decided that no, we have got a company that has been properly appointed to do this work, it is on site, we are not talking about building of stations, it is not the change, it is using the very same company to extend because it has been appointed for that. So it is two stations and the stations affected, Chair, were seven.  Public Protector, the value of thecontract, Chair, you will not believe it, R68.4 million for all those service stations.     68.4, not billion, millions.     Now that 68, Chair, there is the drama in that report the first thing, other than applying wrong reports and prescripts of the law, despite having all evidence before her including completion certificates of this project, she made three findings.  The first one isabout the fact that these projects cost R1.9 billion rands.  In submissions I deal with this issue, Chair.  R68.4 million and not R1.9 billion.  So her findings is incorrect.  Then she went to create drama about this maladministration based on something that is factually incorrect.She then also says, Chair, she makes another finding in relation to paragraph 68, she says PRASA awarded work, for Siyangena to do this work under the pretext that this is 2010 work but this work was only done in 2011.  Chair, it is incorrect.  We have provided the Public Protector during investigation both completion certificates, the launches, these stations were launched around the country by even Minister S’bu Ndebele in the period leading up to 2010.  The last station was actually completed on the 8 June, just three days before the 2010World Cup.  The Public Protector made serious errors, Chair, in this report.Thirdly, the Public Protector, Chair, when she says – she talks about me, she says Montana went to Park station and fired companies there, Chair.  Okay?  And it is true, I went to Park station.  When I get there the station is filthy, we have got seven state companies that are involved in cleaning the stations, they are being paid and I said to my team, I do not fight, I said to my team if you do not deal with these companies then I am going to fire you guysbecause here is a station, the second biggest station in the continent.  I say if the President come here and find the terrible conditions, yet we are paying people for maintenance and cleaning, we have got to take action.  Those companies were then subsequently dismissed andthe PRASA Cres, which is our property side, which was the PRASA’s property section then put alternative measures for these stations to be cleaned.  No, Chair, the report comes Montana irregularly fires companies, Chair.  Those are the findings.I can go on and on, Chair, but I am saying that the report of the Public Protector falls(?) because of both the legal as well as the massive factual inaccuracies, I – you know, this report does not speak about me, Chair, and I think it is very important.  Out there people think the PublicProtector is about Montana and number two, it is about corruption.  I think we have read all the findings of the Public Protector.  She talks about maladministration, power and all of those things, Sir, about the employees that were suspended without following of procedures.  She never mentioned a single finding in Derailed.  In Derailed, not in the second volume of even this corruption that we hear.  When you hear people – a Public Protector, some of them even feel very strongly, has made serious finding of corruption, none, Chair.  I was the only person, you know,Chair, who challenged this report despite the fact that it made a number of findings because I became the face of this report and it was so unfair, Chair, I mean, one of the clauses of the PRASA SCM policy says when employees of PRASA or any business of PRASA wants to use a servicewithout got through a competitive process, where it is an emergency and so on, they need to motivate and get the approval of the Group CEO.Chair, there is one finding in Tshwane where the Public Protector says a chap by the name of – an employee by the name of Buthelezi approved the extension of a security contract without following what the policy provides, that you must motivate and get the approval of the Group CEO before you could do that.  So she is right.  But comes the next one where employees, not that areinitiate, a business of PRASA would motivate in line with that clause.  It is there in the policy.  I approve.  That constitute maladministration.  When it is not done, he did not follow policy, when it is done, it is maladministration, that is [speaking in the vernacular] which means whether you are – you are damned whether you do it or you are – I do not know, something like damned if you do it…[intervenes]     Exactly, Chair.  So this report, Chair, andthat is why I challenge, but I am glad Adv Mkhwebane, had actually produced a report, no drama, very factual, Chair.  This other report where even people can even say these stations were completed in 11.When we launched, we have got pictures, we have got ministersthere, the stations were used for 2010 and the Public Protector said no, they were only completed – it is the same finding that we are discussing on the SCA that we had trains that never moved when they have done 76 000 kilometres.  So this thing is about, Chair, representation of facts.       You know, if there is one person, Chair, finally, who cooperated with the Public Protector, it is me and Chair I think that to prove that I have cooperated andthat some of her issues and findings about information were really uncalled for.  I asked for the record when I – before I – when I did the review application.  Can you give me the record?  The Public Protector could not even give me documents that I had given to her yet she makes findings about PRASA not keeping proper records and all of those things.  But, Chair, for me, I will decide whether I want to take it or not.   The recommendation that Treasury runs a forensic investigation, the forensic investigations have been done. I have seen and read the reports.     I have got my review application, Chair.     Well, Chair, I will decide in the light of all of that and…     A of – I think five years has intervened since that time, I need to ask myself what value I get in going to court and spending thousands of rands.  But, Chair, I did challenge it and say it is wrong and factually I did put in those details, Chair.     No, no, Mr Soni, I respect I respect that, Chair.  I am not going to challenge – you see, for me, I am also not here, Chair, to get a favourable response, I want to put the facts on record, the Commission will write its report but I think, for example, most of these things that do not have any basis whatsoever and that is why I came to deal with them.  Once I have dealt with them in theCommission I do not need to go and spend money in a court and get what is it called, a hollow victory.  I do not need to be cleared by anyone, Chair, I live my life, I do not need any court to clear me, I do not need to be cleared, I know the truth and this is the truth that I am sharing.  But Mr Soni, I respect what you are saying, the Commission will have to do what it has got to do as long as it satisfied that factually those matters it deals with have got a sound foundation.  My affidavit will show you that most of those, in fact they are not worth the paper that they are writtenon.     Ja, sure.     No, Chair.  No, Chair, what is true is that I was addressing – we were launching the specificationsfor the new trains, not the specifications but – I think the specifications in Sandton.   A journalist asked – at that time the relationship, Chair, had fallen apart and the journalist asked will you go to PRASA and I was blunt and say no, I actually – I think it was a point, if I rememberwell, where I mentioned that I will not even go to PRASA with this current board as it is.  And, Chair, there had been unions, there had been people who lobbied and say – even members of parliament who said we do not think that he should be leaving PRASA at this point in time.So I have heard the testimony of Mr Molefe as well as the response by former Minister Dipuo Peters.  No, Chair, but I think that is a recollection, I respect that, Chair, but I had no interest to go back, I had resigned out of my volition, why would I want to go back to PRASA?  Iresigned.     No, no, Chair, I think that let us put it properly for what it is.  I was done, I had resigned, Chair, from PRASA, I explained the circumstances earlier on.  I was done.  A journalist asked me in the thing – I am not sure if my response was correct and that was later takenby the board and I heard Minister Dipuo Peters saying maybe like he wanted to come back and all of those things.  Chair, you know, I left PRASA in 2015, I have never been to any government office except always I state when I go to pay my municipal rates and taxes.   I have never been to any minister ’s office to ask for deployment or favours because that is not me, I do not do things like that.  I had left but there was war and this war was happening inside PRASA and outside of PRASA.  And if you speak, for example, to a number of unions they said look, we thinkyou are leaving at this point, even March, and said I must accept publicly that I will not step down and all of those things and maybe when I dealt with that issue, I may not have put it outright but my state of mind was very clear, I am done, I am moving on, but I was concerned that PRASA, if it does not manage a transition, it is going to find itself in serious trouble and unfortunately, my worst fears, Chair, three years down the line were proven correct because the train system had collapsed effectively.     At that stage I was very clear.     Chair, there was no doubt in my mind, but let us not forget, Chair, we live in a world of politics.  I had wanted to leave, I had a dream that I wanted to create a property fund of some kind and get involved in that business but there were political pressures, parliament, within government, within political structures that we think a resignation is a mistake and – but maybe I may not have given them a very clear answer, so I am responding to you, making them believe that I was keen.  And when I left, by the way, on the 15  July, remember – and this will bring usto the meeting that [indistinct – dropping voice].  Chair, there is a procedure in the way companies deal with matters including preparing agendas and directors, including myself as an executive director, would be informed in – for example, when there is an issue that they had a board resolution on, the issue of me leaving on the 15 July was not on the agenda, was not discussed even with me, Chair, I happened to leave and let me – and this is what saddens me, Mr Soni, I got to a board meeting, we discussed matters, we fight first about the Mthimkulumatter in the board.  Then in the afternoon, Chair, before we finished the meeting I get a call from home, your uncle is sick, he is very ill, come home.  I said no, I am in a board meeting, they said no, we do not think – it is very bad, you must come home.  So I then go to Mr Molefe, even though there was this war, but we could still speak as we continue to do to this very day, I said to him, Mr Molefe, ay, my uncle is not well, I need to rush home and then he says to me, no it is fine, when you leave, after we have dealt with the matters, there will be one issue on the agenda, which at that time was a standing item on the agenda, the contract of employment of the Group CEO and why it is on there, it is a standing item, it is because I have resigned and the board and its governance committed even that it is minutedwhere they say like he must help us, must work with us so that we find a suitable CEO and all of those things.  As I was sitting in the meeting, I get the call that my uncle had passed on.  I go back to Mr Molefe.  Mr Molefe, it is too late now, my uncle is – I have got to run to hospital in Pretoria, the meeting is in Johannesburg.  I run to Pretoria, do whatever I have to do in relation with the family.  After 12 midnight I go back home, Chair, that is when I find a letter where the board says after you have left, we – because we took a break and then after lunchthey met and they say we took a decision that no - I was already two months into my notice period, Chair – we felt you should no longer service your notice period.  That is what happened, Chair.So that created a big fight because I then said but none of the board members, even you, that is the direction that you – but when I stood up and left the meeting, what was effectively, Chair, a cowardly act.  A cowardly act, something that you view as a comrade and a leader - even if they have come to that determination, they would have waited, Chair, and said look, like he is got his own issues with the family, let me wait for him to come back after he has dealt with this and then we convey this thing to him.So I come from home, my uncle’s house, I go to theoffice.  So these are the kind of people that you deal with, Chair.  And when I took it up they said no, like he wants to remain a CEO of PRASA.  No, Chair, I have resigned.  Mr Molefe said we want you to stay for three years(?). I said no, I am going, I can only assist you.  Two months into the notice period they say no, do not serve the other remaining four months, we will pay you being at home.  Who would not want to be paid sitting at home doing nothing, Chair?  So I was paid four months not doing anything at PRASA but I left PRASA without doing a handover, Chair, and that iswhy you see the chaos because I was at the hub of the strategy, I put together everything about the modernization of PRASA. So if I want to go back or did I want to go back?  The big answer is no.  But Chair, I think that the – if youjust imagine, you come back home, your uncle has just passed on and you expect people to be your own comrades and they do something so inhuman, so cruel.So – but am I angry with him?  No, I do not, but I thought in an African way, they would have dealt with it, but legally, the matter was not on the agenda.  When I went to that meeting and when I left, I did not know that the matter of the contract of employment of the CEO was about discussing that we can – the board had the prerogative to take that decision that, hey, you haveresigned, we want another person.  But, Chair, then still you have to deal with it properly, not when you come and I leave the meeting and then they start to say no, he left to attend to his uncle, he should not come back.  That is how cruel, Chair.  That is the cruelty, that is the kind of – how people lose their own humanity because of power.  They want to control this thing and they even forget that this man is grieving for his uncle.  That is what happened, Chair.     Sure.     Yes, Sir.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, ja.     Well, Chair, I do not know the time if he was given but I was told the meeting would start at six.     Chair, I was invited by the office ofMinister Jeff Radebe.     The minister and the presidency.     No, it was six p.m. Chair.     I was there around quarter to six at the venue.     No, Chair, I think it was a day or two,Chair.     But, Chair, the meeting was meant in fact to take place in Cape Town.     And I flew down to Cape Town.  You must recall during – when this meeting took place, I had left PRASA, I was not longer in PRASA working for government.  But I flew down to Cape Town.  And the meeting was cancelled.  I came back – of course Icomplained that you cancelled the meeting, I am using my own personal resources and then the meeting of course that is described here took place in …[intervenes]     In Pretoria.  At Mahlamba Ndlopfu, not atthe presidential guesthouse, Chair, as stated by Mr Molefe.     Chair, I got the call – I think I got the call from the office of the minister, I do not remember receiving an email.  I may be wrong, but I do not remember an email.     Chair, if you go back, when I left PRASA, I left on the 15 t h.     Of July 2015.     This was August.     Yes but the week – the circumstances of my departure, Chair, there was a big fight in the media. There was a big fight in the media.  Now I was meant to address a press conference to give my side of the story and everything.  I got a call from Minister Dipuo Peters who asked me and say like we think you should not proceed with the press conference, we will have a meetingwithin government, we will discuss this issue, we do not want this public space and everything.  Then I rejected what the minister said.  I said but, Minister, I have met with you on two occasions, I have raised the issues, now it is very important that I put my side of the story to the public.So I went to – so before I started the press conference I then got a call from Minister Radebe who says he had a call from Minister Dipuo Peters and that I have rejected cancelling.  So the minister spoke to me at great length and said look, we have a meeting in government todiscuss what is happening around PRASA but we do not want …[intervenes]     Radebe.     Yes.  So he spoke to me persuading me not to – I said look, I have a press conference, I have journalists there at the hired – packed, and I cannot just cancel.  I then said look, it is fine, I will not go into thedetails, I will talk about other things in respect – I said I will respect what the leadership says and then at whatever time we have that meeting.  So this meeting, Chair, is in fact – did not come out of the blue.  PRASA itself had its own press conference planned, so mine was going to be onMonday, the PRASA press conference was going to be on Tuesday.  We were both ordered by government, both Minister Peters and Minister Radebe, to call off those press conferences and that this matter must be discussed internally.   Even in this meeting – now I heard, Chair, that no out of the blue the President – no, Chair, there is a background to this meeting because the government and the President explained in that meeting we do not want, as the ANC, the public spat that is happening amongst yourselves as ANC, as ANC comrades, and that is basicallywhat transpired, Chair.     Well, Chair, I still have …[intervenes]    I still I have the energy but again I will be guided by you and…     No, no, I do not know what that is all about.  I have never met the President on that day, I never met Mr Moodley.  I went to a meeting at the – I arrived at Mahlamba Ndlopfu at around five to – quarter to six and then I think the meeting started more or less at around that time.  So I do not know which security official, I know nothing about that.     I would not know, Chair, I would not know.    No, on that day, Chair.  No, not at all.      I would not know, Chair.     Chair, my recollection of that meeting is that we started the meeting all of us at the same time.  I did see Minister Peters in one of the waiting rooms there.  We greeted and everything and then the meeting started when the President arrived which I think was about 15, 20 minutes later.  I do not recall that but I do not know about that experience, whether there was – I do not work – I wasno longer in government, I did not have a right to ask who was here before, I just went to a meeting and I attended the meeting, Chair.     No, I do not know, Chair.  Maybe the meeting was meant to start at three, I was meant to join at six, but I was only told be here at six and that is what I did, Chair.     Chair, the meeting was told it is a follow up, you will recall I mentioned on that the …[intervenes]     The press conference, we were told there will be an internal discussion and I was …[intervenes]     Connected with the public spats and everything.    That is – the meeting was all about, Chair, was about that, Chair.     No, I would not know, Chair.     No, I would not know, Chair.     No, Chair, my recollection is that we wereall there.  I have seen Ministers Dipuo Peters in the thing but this was 2015, I may have – there may be a bit of detail that I may have missed but my recollection is that no, we started the meeting at six together.  Now it could be – it is possible that they may have been there earlier and had the meeting, I was asked to join when I was thinking that I am coming – I am very important, I am coming to be part of this meeting, Chair.     Mr Molefe.     I think something to that effect, Chair, yes, that is correct.     Ja, the President never said that, Chair.     Not at all, Chair.  In fact if I were to explain a bit, I know that the people said the President had asked everyone to speak at the meeting, starting with the Minister, with the Chairman of the Board and then it wasmy turn to speak.  Now when I started, Chair, to speak, I said look, I am not going to get – I do not want – I said, Mr President, these are my leaders, I do not want to go into details and find a respect dispute, the only thing I can do is to indicate what PRASA has done so that we can protectwhat we have achieved as a country.And then …[intervenes]     Okay.     No, fair enough.  Thank you, Chair.  The President – so the point is, the President never said it in fact there.      If there was one person who said it, it was Mr Molefe telling the President that Mr Montana is knowledgeable and that is why I wanted him to stay for three years, not the President.     Mr Molefe, yes.  Yes, it was in …[intervenes]     At that meeting, Chair.    Ms Peters actually said he told thePresident, Chair, I think on two – on the two days that she was there.  The first one she said I told the President that Mr Montana is knowledgeable, he knows about transport and that the President could use him as an adviser in Africa or that I could use – I, as Dipuo Peters, the Minister, could use Mr Montana as my special adviser.  Those are the words that she used here, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, you are absolutely correct, I agree with that, that is what she said.     What I am simply saying is that after I spoke – actually, I did not even finish what I was saying at the meeting when I was talking about PRASA, then the President stopped me in the middle of that discussion and he asked the minister is what Lucky is saying true?  The minister confirmed that.  Then the President looked at the Chair of the Board, Mr Molefe, and said Mr Molefe, is what Lucky saying – and Mr Molefe then made that statement, Chair, in that context and the President said – because he was quite disappointed he said well, there is a war. Actually I think he may have used those words, but there is a war out there, we come to a meeting, we are told that PRASA is making this progress, we are told that this young man – he uses those words indeed, this young man is knowledgeable, he knows about transport, yet – so this is said in a meeting, but out there it is war.  Chair, I think – and it is at that point that I remember both myself and Mr Molefe were asked to leave because the President wanted to have a conversation with his two ministers.     No, that is not – the President never said such a thing, he never said that at all, it is incorrect, Chair.     Chair, in his opening remarks of why, was about the public spat and not about bringing Montana backto PRASA.  The never President never [indistinct – dropping voice]     Chair, that is not correct.  I mean, I would be disrespecting the President by attacking ministers and the Chair of the Board.  I mean, I - it is not done andChair, I had there my notebook, so as they were speaking I prepared notes because I decided on my approach – and some of these ideas I came to write later about where PRASA is and all of those things but there was not such a thing, I never – there was – actually the meeting ended ona very positive and a jovial note and then we left the ministers, the President and the ministers, we took leave and Mr Molefe and I then had a bit of discussion, we said our goodbyes.  That was the end of the matter, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.     Completely, totally, Chair, yes, it was done.     Indeed, Chair.     Indeed, Chair, around that time.     Ja, but I am not referring to the earlier meeting because I did not know about it, Chair.     Chair, it took a bit of time, four, five hours probably.  It was late when we left there.     Chair, I think at around twelve, I do notthink it went to 2 a.m.  No, Chair.     When we left ja, I think probably it was just after – just after 11 Chair.     But again the issues of time for a meeting Chair, I cannot – I do not want to be firm about it, themeetings takes place, the times are, ja.     Indeed Chair.    Ja, four or five hours ja.     Chair that is not – this was interactive meeting, of course I was, I prepared a note because I am talking to my leaders, I cannot just – they are sitting there, they are making their views known, when I am given the opportunity I must be systematic, I am with the President and the Minister, so I jotted down points that I wanted to raise in the course of that conversation.   Chair I wouldn’t have spoken because – spoken that long, Minister Peters spoke for a while, then the President asked Chairman Comrade Popo what is your view on this issue and then there was a discussion for a while Chair and then the President says well let’s hear the views fromthe young man and then Chair that is when I made my point.Chair I had a list of things that I wanted to raise about PRASA, but I have only spoken about five at that meeting if I remember well.  That is when the President stopped me and say the PRASA you are describing and the award that we have does not correlate.   He then wanted – he wanted to confirm from Minister Peters if what I was saying was true and correct.   Minister Peters responded positively, the Chair then – the President asked Mr Molefe,who also confirmed Chair, and it is in that context that a statement that Mr Molefe says President Zuma stated that Mr Montana was very knowledgeable about transport, it was made by him, he even said inform the President that that is why he as Chairman he said I wanted Mr Montana to stay for another three years, and that is what actually I think it left the President puzzled.  So you want him to stay for three years and then – but that doesn’t correlate with the reality of that, and Chair that was the context of the discussion if I could recall very well Chair.     Not.     It was Mr Molefe Chair in the three year story.     No Chair I think ...[intervenes]     Chair the issue about the PRASA Board was never discussed even at that meeting. There was no issue, I think I know that Mr Molefe sometimes wants to present himself as a hero, and that he took on the President to say come, these are just afterthoughts Chair, there was never such a discussion.  I don’t know what is the views of Mr Radebe, Minister Radebe who had convened the meeting, but that is not my recollectionChair, I never asked to go back to PRASA, at that time, today and even tomorrow Chair that I am very clear on.     Chair it was about that, the person who introduced the issues was my notes how I spoke, because I said what do I debate with my leaders, that was actually my introduction, I said Mr President these are my leaders, I respect them and so I decided to use this meeting as a way of giving a report, and then I highlighted – I then provided some of the key highlights, because I had left government Chair, I thought that would be it, but there was never at any point a discussion where the President chaired, the President would not, he has not spoken to me to ask me doyou want to go back into that position, we never had that kind of a conversation.So I mean I was surprised when I read the affidavit about what Mr Molefe but look it was a meeting in the middle of the night, I may be wrong, he may be right.     But I never asked to go back, I never asked to – the President never asked for me to be there, the meeting was about – so I wanted – I couldn’t discuss with them Chair, what will I discuss with them, exceptsubstantive issues and that is what I put on the table, which the President stopped to ask the others to confirm whether what I was saying was correct and that is my recollection Chair of the meeting.     Chair – it was along those lines Chair, but I started with the fact that I outlined a number of government policies, that had been adopted and key decisions going back to the National Rail, Passenger Rail Plan in 2006, the Public Transport strategy adopted byCabinet and say all these initiatives were aimed at giving effect to government – it was not somebody taking their own initiatives on the side, and then I went onto – so Chair the fact, so all in all I think that was the – that was the approach that I took for the meeting.   Ja.     Chair I cannot recall, I don’t even think Ispoke for 30 minutes when the President stopped me.   I think as I said from my points that I jotted down I think that the President stopped me, because he wanted to confirm what I am saying was true which is what then we reverted to, then at the end of the responses that’s when he saidbut I cannot understand, that’s what he spoke about this wall, we are agreeing inside but this wall is there and the conversation continued.   I never even had the opportunity to complete all the notes, all the points that I have jotted down to share with the meeting Chair.     No, no Chair I noted there was adocument in the Unions that was called PRASA in turmoil or PRASA’s recent developments, something to that effect there, which was shared with me.  I have heard Mr Molefe saying that the document was compiled by me.   No that cannot be correct.     If I remember there was.     No, no Chair I didn’t compile it, I note that the document was sent by the Unions, they were saying oh a whole range of situations that I shared with you yes.     No Chair, I don’t know what is the relationship, I don’t know what his impressions were of me speaking.  There were certain things that we know, that were very clear about us, and I think maybe that’s the impression that he may have but no Chair I had notes written on my black notebook and hopefully I will still beable to find it and share it with the Commission’s evidence.    His version, indeed Chair.      That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     No, no Chair, I think Chair ...[intervenes]      No that the President dozed off during the conversation.     And Chair I have heard what Mr Molefe said but I think there is a context to it.    Fortunately for me who knew a lot of people in the Presidency, I remember when I arrived and served with tea some of the guys there they were saying we are opposed to this meeting, you guys know that [speaking in vernacular] has taken medication and actually the time that this meeting was taking place that Ubaba is not well, so that in fact doctors because this chap was sharing with me that I know them, were saying at that time half past six we have actually been given straightinstructions for the President not to meet with people, that is when he is supposed to take medication and all of those things.  Chair and the President did at some stage leave the meeting because of that and I think that the medication was taking effect as a result of that, so Chair but these areState secrets that we should not be talking about in that way, but I think for me that was the context, but I have listened to how Mr Molefe was using that thing to say here is the President who then called the meeting and later on the President Chair continued with the discussion.     He came back Chair as it were, so this thing about him falling asleep I knew it because PRASA colleagues said no but the President fell asleep, he doesn’t even know what happened.  Chair that is not true, that is...[intervenes]       No, no I left with Mr Molefe Chair, we spoke on the passage, we parted ways, we went to our cars, and that was it Chair.  What happened after – behind – both of us did not know.      No, no Chair my, and maybe because I was the youngest of all of the people in the meeting so I think I should be given the benefit of the doubt on thatone, because Chair I remember very well when I arrived I went to the reception room, I sat there, I was offered tea/coffee, that’s what I had and then I spoke to one of the guys there, who had served me coffee and that’s when he said hey but you guys why do you do this to Ubaba, you know that he is not well, it is the timeframe to take things, we are under orders but – and he said we hope this meeting will take an hour, will take only an hour, that’s what he said to me Chair and that is what happened Chair so for me the following, the dozing off there is a context tothe fact that here is someone who is taking medication and the meeting was not supposed to be, but it has been said in a very derogatory sense out there as if you know – and I think it is something that is not right.     Not.     No Chair there was no such a discussion Chair.     No Chair.     It was just small talk, it was just small talk, nothing of substance really and then we parted ways.    That is right Chair.     Yes Chair. ADV VAS SONI     Yes that is a yes Chair, sorry.     Chair that has never been my approach,you know in these positions in politics, even your enemy you walk with them, and I mean Mr Molefe will confirm this, I have met with him, bumped into him whether in a mall, at a funeral of ANC people, I always go to him, polite, greet him, even in the middle of this war Chair.   It was a war butwe were not fighting each other physically, I will greet him and to this very day Chair I think he has treated me unfairly, I think that he was not frank with me, understandably angry, I know where Mr Molefe stands on issues, I know where he stands and I know that in this divide it is that side and that side.   So I didn’t want – I accepted the guidance we got, that this is bringing you know ANC into disrepute, you guys stop all of those things and life continues.     Chair the – you recall that what happened thereafter, there were all these court cases that were unfolding and I think in a way the war continued in the media because for example I think when we met in November, that’s when the ...[indistinct] in 2017 I think there was this Yangela matter, so to a large extent the matters in the public space continued, so I don’t think it was what you call the cessation of hostilities because I usually don’t sign those Chair, if you fight with me I fightwith you forever but still greet you when we meet here.     No Chair.     There was probably with the Ministers, the President just said to us look I want to talk to my two Ministers and then we left, me and Mr Molefe so there was no such, I don’t know whether it happened after we’d left, but when we left the only thing that we knew was that looka public spat is not in the best interests of the country and the ANC and that was it.     No Chair after the President had opened the meeting and then Minister Radebe also spoke at the meeting in terms of what he has done, there was a lot of – it was a jovial meeting but at the same time you could see that there was a ...[intervenes]     Not physically, for example Mr Molefeaccused Minister Radebe that no he is closer to me and – no in fact I think it was Minister Dipuo Peters that when she called me to cancel the press conference I refused but when Minister Radebe called me to cancel I then cancelled and then she was saying to the President but ...[indistinct] is only prepared to listen to – he is closer to Minister Radebe, he is only prepared to listen to the Minister.  Then Minister Radebe in his response in a very jovial fashion said but I am much closer Mr President to Popo than to Lucky and he went on to explain at length some of theinteractions that this is to I think Botswana ...[indistinct] all of those things were – so it was a political meeting Chair where you know somebody is a ...[indistinct] position, somebody moves his position and everything but still the – it was a cordial discussion and for me I was in a difficult position Chair, because despite the fact that I was unhappy with some of the things that happened I couldn’t say it in that meeting because I am meeting with my seniors, not my own age group, I had to be respectful to the President and the Ministers so I had to be careful and that is why I jottedthe note so that when I speak I am not all over the show, but I more pointed, I deliver the message that I wanted to give, and that’s what happened Chair, so when we left, me and Mr Molefe, there was not a clear instruction ...[intervenes]     Outcome as it were, they remained to continue the discussion, and I never spoke to any of the Ministers or Mr Popo Molefe about that meeting, I just – life continued Chair.     No Chair you are absolutely correct, except that we took it when the President made the opening remarks, because he said this has to stop, and so I think there was no debate about that, and that’s when the composition happened Chair so there was no discussion but – there was no discussion further, I think that the President made it very clear and I take it that all of us hadaccepted that the President has shown us the line and all of us have to accept that that is the way to go.     Ja.    No, no Chair, this was not – I think Chair that I dealt with the issue at the press conference, where I said actually the Board’s decision, because it was procedurally, it was not done in a – a proper procedure has not been followed, I will take this on the thing, so in my press conference you recall that I was asked to cancel it but I didn’t cancel it because the media was already there, but I didn’t go into the details of the issue and I made thatstatement Chair, so I think he is confusing the statement I made when I spoke to the media with what had never transpired at that meeting.     Not at all Chair, not at all, it was never discussed at that meeting.    No, no, not as far as I can recall.     No, no but the matter was never discussed or raised Chair from my recollection of the meeting.     Well Chair if you remember I have been summoned to this meeting Chair.    No, no I will make myself available Chair, thank you. 
ADV HOTZ:  Thank you Chair.  Chair in light of the proceedings this morning I merely wanted to alert the Chair unfortunately our senior counsel could not attend this morning but I wanted to place on record Chair as you would be aware that Werksmans has indeed applied to the Chair for permission to cross-examine Mr Montana.   Obviously we – we are in your hands Chair as to how and when but I merely wanted to place on record that there is that application Chair.
MONTANA:Except Chair that the auditors ...[intervenes]   Chair I think let me describe the relationship as – you know I respected Mr Molefe.  I think we had a relationship.  ...including to what she told toMs Magadzi ...[intervenes]   Let us say you are reading a…[intervenes]  I resigned in March 15.  15 March 2015.
