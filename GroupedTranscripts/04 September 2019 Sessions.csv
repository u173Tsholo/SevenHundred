CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Just repeat that?    I see – oh why is it written in such small letters 17.1 and 17.2?    You see I just see on this one CC17 and I am trying to look for CC17.1 then I realise after some time that…    Well under divider 17 I have got a SABC letter.      Under divider 17.    In CC17.1 I have got a letter from – with the letterheads of SABC not a statement.    Okay let us – let us.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Let us start afresh.  17.1 is that the correct one?    Okay.  Right.    Yes,  okay,  right at the beginning.    Okay no that is fine.  I thought it was –     Yes – is there another statement?    Of his there?    And where do I find it?  Is it right at the top as well?    Okay that is a supplementary statement.    Okay.    Now before we start I am going to ask you to – in regard to each witness to mention to indicate what each witness’evidence – under what part of each witness’ evidence will fall in the terms of reference so that I am satisfied that we are – the witness is going to be giving evidence that falls under the terms of reference.  I am just going to take some time to refresh our memory about the terms of reference because I must make sure that the evidence that I hear falls within our terms of reference.  The terms of reference read as    Well you see Mr Sundaram’s evidence was tied in with the project of – the establishment of the New Age and ANN7 and there is a specific reference to the New Age in the terms of reference.    So that was fine.  It is connected with the Gupta family and there is specific reference to it to in the terms of reference.  Now it is not every wrongdoing that may have been happening invarious state owned entities or government departments that falls within the terms of reference   It has got to be wrongdoing that can be    Is that right?    Now you know 1.1 appears to have a problem and you    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Hm.    You see if you – if you lead evidence that shows how – that shows wrongdoing that was connected with the awarding of contracts and that wrongdoing would have been against the policies.    Of the – of SABC procurement procedures that – that should be fine.  That would be fine.    That might not – you might not even need 1.1 which    You know.  It might fall under – under – under 1.4/ “Whether the President or any member of the present of previous members of his National Executive or public official or employee of any state owned entities breached or violated the constitution or any relevant ethical code or legislation by facilitating the unlawful awarding of tenders by SOE’s or any organ of state to benefit the Gupta family or any other family or individual or corporate entity doingbusiness with government or organ of state.” If you – if you link it to the awarding of contracts it should fall under that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    As long as in the end there will be that link.    There will be?    But I would like if I could be given a memorandumthat in due course that will show that in the end this is how the witnesses will link up.    Their evidence will link up.    Yes.    If you can update that – that memorandum.    But as we – as we proceed I mean I will take it that that is what you – that is what you are planning to do to end up linking;    With – with what others witnesses will say.    Is that understanding fine?    No, no, no.    I must be satisfied.    You satisfy yourself but I must also be satisfied.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no, no.    No, no Ms Norman.  You must satisfy yourself that …    That the evidence is relevant.    But the fact that you have satisfied yourself does not mean that I am satisfied.    Because I should not allow evidence that is not relevant.    Ms Norman.    Ms Norman.  I must be satisfied that the evidence that is being led is relevant.    And falls within the terms of reference.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   I must make a ruling whether it should led or it should not be led.    You are assisting me to do this job.    And you are doing quite well but I still need to be satisfied.  So that is why it is important if I have questions that you make submissions to say we have submit it is relevant because of a, b,    And I listen to what you have to say if I am persuaded I agree if I am not persuaded I do not agree.    Okay.    Yes.    No, no in principle that should be fine.  So do give me that memorandum that you say you will update but as we go along with every witness.    And I accept that sometimes it may be difficult to show with the relevance with regard to a particular witness because the relevance might become clearer when another witness comes later on.    To give – that I accept.    That it might happen.  So – and to that extent youmight be aware of some witnesses who are going to come.    Who might clarify certain things but it is important that throughout we keep at the back of our minds that we want to fall within the terms of reference.    Okay.    Alright.  Alright then.  Let us…    Let us - let us then have the witness sworn in.    Thank you.    Let us - let us first admit it.    The lever arch file containing the - again it is a sworn affidavit Ms Norman.    It is not a …?ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   The - the lever arch file containing the affidavit of Mr Jonathan Thekiso will be marked EXHIBIT CC17.1 …  And the lever arch file containing Mr Jonathan Thekiso’s supplementary …    Is a statement or affidavit?    Will be marked EXHIBIT CC17.2.    Ja.    He - he starts the way I would start.    Yes.    Sorry.    Is purging not where the employer or somebody in a higher position wants you out of the company or department for anillegitimate reason?  In other words is the position not that there has to be an illegitimate reason.  If I - if I say you know I think your health is no longer - your health does not allow you to give us 100 percent in terms of what you are capable of doing and I would rather let you go and let me get somebody who can still give us 100 percent. That would not be purging in the sense in which it is normally understood.  Is it no?    You - you see the way I see purging and I want you to tell me how you see it is that there has to be an illegitimate reason and maybe illegitimate is too wide.  An illegitimate motive maybe because if I am just wrong in understanding what procedure must follow but I am acting in good faith.  I have got nothing against you.  I am just wrong in understanding what is required. I might have difficulty understanding that to be purging but ifI think you are a troublemaker because you keep on asking too many questions on things where I think you should not be asking too many questions.  You must just let - allow things to happen and those are wrong things that I want to happen and I think you - I think you think you are clever. That - that is separate.  If you are a trade unionist and you are always giving me problems because you insist on the rights of workers being respected and all of that and that is the reason why I want you out.  I think that would be purging.  It is an illegitimate reason.  If I think you belong to a wrong political person wrongaccording to me and I only want in that position somebody who belongs to a certain political party. That is for me on the face of it purging - you know.  If I - if you are standing in my way because I want that tender to go to - to be given to so and so and you are insisting that it will only be given to 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156whoever legitimately wins the bid - the bid.  That is purging for me.  You understand?    But if I think that in your position I think the performance you give me the best you can give me is about 60 percent but I think I want somebody who can give me 80 percent and I - I discuss that openly.  It does not appear to me that it might be purging.  I just want somebody who can do better than you are doing.  You understand?    No.  Then that is - then I am very interested in that. You know but if - if the reasons are not illegitimate I might not be interested but where the point is the reasons were illegitimate then - then I am quite interested.  Yes, thank you.    I am sorry.  Did you say page 5?    Yes.    Ms Norman I am sorry.  Is there a particular reason why you do not mention the name of the person?    I did not hear.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Well Ms Norman.  No reason is - is provided in paragraph 4 or anywhere in the letter.  Is it not?    Ja.    A decision was taken by the SABC that it could do without Mr - I assume it is Mr Feliti …    And that it would pay him in full for the remainder of his contract which was more than two years.    It does - the letter does not say whether the SABC nolonger needs anybody to do the job that Mr Feliti was doing.    It does not say and - and one would have understood if the position was that there is no longer any work for him to - to do.  You know.  Lawyers might argue about whether or not in that event he 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156should be given the whole amount for the rest of the period but at least one could say that is the reason …    But this letter does not say anything like that.  That is your understanding as well?    Ja.  At the time of this letter were you in this position at SABC and therefore would you have known about the circumstances surrounding this term - this letter?  I - I ask that question becausesometimes Human Resources would be consulted when people - people’s contracts are being terminated.    Oh, okay.  Alright, but being in the Human Resources Department have you had a chance to look at the personnel file relating to Mr Feliti if it is still being kept and see whether there is anything that gives a good - would give us an understanding as to why the SABC    For the Commission?    In terms of the circumstances?    Okay, alright.    Does it relate to Mr Feliti?    Hm.    Ja.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Did you say 3-6-6?    Double three six?    Yes.    Yes.    Do you want to read that amount Ms …?    So that - that would have been somebody who earned more than a million Rand a year because we know that it is supposed to represent over two years?    Yes, okay.    What page?    In - in respect of people such as Mr Feliti it will be important in due course to have evidence that relates to whether somebody else was subsequently employed to …    Do the same work that he would have been doing for the remainder of that period.    Compared to what Mr Feliti was paid.    So that - that becomes quite important …    Because if somebody else was appointed to do that job then it means that for the remainder of the period when Mr Feliti supposed to have been there effectively the institution was paying two people for the same job.    A job that should be done by one person.    Okay.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Well do you not want to tell us first tell who we aretalking about?    Oh.  Why do I always not hear you when you mention names?    Is it Mr C Oliver?    Olivier?    Okay.    Yes.      Okay sorry I am at 248, should I be moving to …[intervenes].      And the note I at page 248?       Miss Norman?      It won’t every letter that he would need to read in full he could just give the gist such as this one to say, according to the SABC the reason was a breakdown of trust of the relationship and thisthe amount they gave or something like that depending on what really is important.   I’m sorry you said TGRP stands for total…[intervenes].       Normally it does Chair it’s the total cost of employment, sometimes I call it total cost of employment.       Ja okay.       Not a fixed-term contract?       Okay and you say he was two months away from qualifying for retirement, early retirement?       Yes.       The compulsory retirement age is 60.       Yes.       But once he reached age 60 he would have been obliged to retire.       So basically what they decided is, we will pay whatever you would have earned between now and age 60 so that you       Yes okay.       Yes maybe before we do that, is the position that you don’t know the circumstances surrounding the break-down of the relationship?       It is the position?       And there is an interest in future because I think ordinarily if there’s a breakdown of an employment relationship you are not obliged, I think, to pay for the whole period that the employer would have paid you, you are simply obliged to pay – to give them notice.  Maybe you might or you might not, depending on a number of things to pay what may be called severance pay but it might be that you’re not even supposed to pay severance pay because it’s not a retrenchment, you know so therefore one might look at it from the point of view of what is it that the SABC was obliged to pay and what did it pay and howmuch is that difference and what reasons are really given, what was the motive for paying so much money when there was just a breakdown  in the relationship.       Okay alright we’ll take the tea adjournment and we will resume at twenty five to twelve. We adjourn.    122?    Mr S M Masinga.    What was his position please?  Mr Masinga.    Oh okay.  Did you say we must go to page 133?    But are you on another bundle because on this one133 is the second page of a letter addressed to Mr Matlala not Mr Masinga.    130?    Okay.  I thought two times you said – you agreed when I said 133.    Okay 130.    Yes okay.    What page is the amount reflected?    Ja he was paid R4 539 745.99 – R4.5 effective R4.5 million.    Was he on a fixed term contract?    And how much time was left, do we know?    Are relevant to give…    The idea is to say there was something illegitimate about this.    Ja…    Aha.    Okay I can see that is 3.6.    And this was – the termination was the letter of terminated was dated 24 June 2015?    Ja at page 122.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   So – so he worked one month?    Ja it says 3.6 at 128.    And was to continue until 31 May 2018.    [Indistinct] terminated with effect from the effective date of this agreement.    That means he worked …ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   For one month one week or something like that.    And then his contract was terminated.    Ja that may be so but do we have something that does say whether he was paid that amount represented the balance of his contract?    Yes.    Hm.    Oh.    Yes.    That suggests that that amount of R2.6 million may 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156not necessarily be just the remuneration he would have paid for the balance of the term.    It may be that it is meant to settle whatever disputes there were between the parties.    Because of what it says there.  But that is different from the R4.5 million or so that appears in the other bundle and I do not know whether even if you deduct tax.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Ja.    Yes but part – well with all the terminations that we are talking about it will be important as I said earlier to show that there is an illegitimate reason.  The one that we started with on the face of it.    It does appear illegitimate but we might need to get – might be necessary to get more information.    And was there no need for the duties that he would have performed to be performed by anybody or did somebody be – was somebody brought in.    And what is more important about that one is that there is not even an allegation of any problems in the relationship.    You know whether somebody working a month is enough for you to conclude that there is a break-down in the relationship so one needs to see whether there is another reason – there is a different reason.    The other one I think was – oh this one I think the two – the last two related to trust issues.    So they might – they might be more difficult than the first one to establish an illegitimate reason but it always depends whether there are facts which support…    What is being alleged but again whatever we are doing we have got to leave room for a situation where a termination is wrong.    Okay.    Is that the amount – total amount paid to various employees whose contracts were terminated in certain circumstances during a certain period    Okay.    Yes thank you very much.    You are excused for now.    Thank you.      Yes that is fine.    Are we still going to need them today?    Yes.  17.    Okay.    Under 21?    Okay.    Yes please administer the oath or affirmation?    Thank you.    Well you did not have to say it.    I am sorry.  Do you remember for how long before you came they had been doing this or is that something that you cannotremember?    Yes.  Okay.    For quite some time.    Okay.    Yes I have got it.    Yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   That is the signature page?    I am sorry which – her signature is the one on behalf    Oh there is your name. Okay thank you.    Hm.  I would like us to go back.  When you arrived there was an arrangement that was already in existence for these breakfast shows.  There was no formal contract or agreement between the SABC and TNA or anybody about these.  A report must have been given to you even if it is verbal to say this is how this thing came about.  I would like to hear that. What were you told was the main motivation that was given toSABC when they were approached to be involved in this thing and what - what was in it for those who approached the SABC.  What was in it for the SABC and it maybe that what was in it for the SABC was what you have said namely the news but I would like you to take me from there?    Was your understanding that the idea of these breakfast shows had originated from the News Department or had originated from TNA or from outside SABC?    That would be very strange.    Yes.    Yes.  Well maybe somebody else will enlighten …    Because it is likely that the idea came from one sideand the - approached the other side to say this is what we are thinking and then the other side was persuaded and then they - they dealt - dealt with it.  So as you understood it.  The purpose was to do what with these breakfast shows?    So - so the idea was to so to speak bring Government to the people …    And Government would then tell the people what they are doing - what Government is doing I assume …    Yes.    A moderator?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    But TNA would make money out of it or not?  As you understood it.    There was a distance?    Hm.    So - so the - the answer would be - would the answer be that you did not know whether they were going to make money or not make money.  You regarded it as SABC.  You regarded that as really none of your business.  Is that right?    Before you move …    To another point Ms Norman.    This - this sounds very strange to me.  Here is a - the Group CEO of SABC.  Somebody is saying to her please come I want to take you somewhere and does not want to tell her where.  How come you did not insist to Mr Motsoeneng I cannot just go anywhere justbecause you - you think I should go there?  I am not going where I do not know.    It was not his car that he normally used?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And I guess well you might also being new you might have also wanted to build relationships with people that you were working with including the COO and you might not necessarily needed to show distrust or anything without a reason?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    But have - having - having gone there to - was it at the residence or was it at the company of Sahara Computers?    At the residence?    Yes at the residence?    Hm.    Were you upset about it that Mr Motsoeneng take - took you for that really?    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja, ja but you did not say - did you say anything to    You cannot remember, yes.    Okay, thank you.    But - sorry.    But from your own recollection what is your sense of how much they increased.  Would it have been three - three times a month, four times a month or you cannot even remember that?    More or less.    Yes.    Events?    Okay.    Yes, okay.    To be compromised.       Did it depend on what the subject matter was or it      About fifteen, thirty minutes or you are not sure?      No that’s fine.  Let me just ask one or two questions about the newspapers.  Were these newspapers that were delivered ona daily basis to SABC that you are talking about?       Yes.       And is it the New Age or it was…[intervenes].       New Age, yes so at a certain stage it did come toyour attention that the New Age was being delivered to SABC?       It was put on your desk but in terms of volumes did you get to know what volumes you were talking about that were being 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156delivered and whether it was just the headquarters of SABC or it was SABC throughout the country?       So the way it worked was it that whoever delivered them would put them somewhere and staff members of SABC, as they came in if they wanted to take a copy they could take a copy, is that right?       Yes, so initially you thought that they were just giving these newspapers because of the relationship that existed with regard to the breakfast shows?      Yes but of course that would be strange would it not,if they were just giving newspapers without expecting payment for them even if there – even if it was because of that relationship with regard to the breakfast shows.       So if it was just a few copies, even if it was daily you would have thought that it was part of that arrangement?       But once the volumes reached as certain level you wouldn’t think that, would you, once the volumes were – it was quite alot that was being delivered and not being paid for?       Yes, but as you saw them did you become aware that it was big volumes that were being delivered or that you never saw for yourself in terms of where they were being placed and staff saw them as they came in, you never saw what they volumes were or you       Yes.       Well I would have thought that if the volumes were high and one saw that it looks like on a daily basis there’s a big stack of the New Age that gets delivered everyday like that, unless somethingsimilar was happening with other newspapers, you know, that would catch one’s attention to say, this is unusual particularly if anybody can come and just take the newspapers, there’s nobody saying pay or anything like that and that it ought to say to somebody, I hope we are not paying for this and maybe I would like to know if we are paying for this or something like that, is that something that you don’t think one would expect to occur?       Yes, okay alright let’s take the adjournment we’llresume at five past two, we adjourn.    Yes we may proceed.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Okay alright.    I think the last part of our discussion Mr Mokhobo I wanted to just say that and I maybe I did say it I have forgotten that you have responded that seeing a big volumes or a stack of newspapers or a particular newspaper always being delivered to the – to the institution that should be making money with those newspapersin the circumstances where it would be free or you thought it would be free may have been something that also should have been of concern. To say we do have an agreement with these people that agreement provides for everything as far as our relationship is concerned why are they giving us free newspapers now?  You understand that – that 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156perspective?    Hm.  Thank you.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   What page number is that?    CC27?    Oh well I was looking at this Parliamentary transcripts that is not the one.    [not speaking into microphone]    Yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Maybe let us get the – let me get the full context to this particular issue.  Mr Motsoeneng was receiving a certain salary for the position he held at the time.  Was he still acting COO at the time or was he already COO?    He was still acting COO.    Yes okay.  I think just talk more to the issue than you have.  I just want to understand because you know sometimes one read all kinds of things in the newspapers and I would rather hear exactly 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156the context here.  How did the whole thing arise?  From what you say it looks like it was not just him?    It was looking at other people as well.  So I just want to get the full context.  How did the issue arise?  Who did it apply to?  What was done in regard to him?  Was there anything done in regard to other people who may have been in the same category?  And how much are we talking about?  I just want the full context.    If you do remember.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Who would issue a recommendation?    Human Resources.    That is the increase?    So is this something that he Human Resources Department would do annually?    Or did it just come because of certain circumstances?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   It came annually?    And they would look at maybe everybody or certain categories of people that attracted their attention in terms of maybe salary discrepancies or things like that?    Ja.    This may be something that you are able to deal with or you might not be able to deal with.  Maybe it might be a HumanResources kind of issue but I – I would have thought that there could be an increase that is given that is attached to the position as such and not to the incumbent to say anybody occupying this position as of this year will be paid this.  And that when you start looking – looking at how well a particular incumbent is performing his or her duties that – that might be something separate and that it is directed at the person rather than the position and in that case that is when I would think of something like a performance bonus.  Because then that answers to the question whether a particular person or incumbent is performing well separate from what a person occupying that position is supposed to bepaid irrespective of what the performance is.  SABC did not have that kind of distinction?    Well you see I raise that because you mentioned that everybody was saying that Mr Motsoeneng was doing so well – was performing so well he deserved an increase.  So I am saying I can understand if that arises in a situation where you seek to reward good performance.  But I do not expect that to be a factor where you are simply saying somebody who is doing this job should be paid at this rate leaving out the incumbent or whoever may be occupying the position.  So that is the background to my question to say why would his performance be relevant to whether he was given this increase if itwas simply to put his level – the salary for his position to the level where it should be where anybody coming after him would be paid at that level irrespective of how he or she performed?    But as far as you recall the increase that he got did it simply serve the purpose of putting the salary for a person in his position serving in that position where it was thought it should be irrespective of the identity or performance of the incumbent or was there – was part of the increase to address that and then another partsought to address or reward good performance on his part?    Yes, yes.  So based on our discussion looking at it now his performance should therefore have been irrelevant?    If one looks at it now.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Hm.    Or rather – or rather he might not have been deserving of an increase himself.    But his position.    The position was…MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   May have been deserving of an increase.    Yes, yes.    Okay. Thank you.    Which month?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Which year was that?    2013 oh.      I am sorry we – Ms Mokhobo I am sorry we left out in our last discussion something that I had mentioned I would like to know.  And you may or may not remember it namely what – how much was the increase that was given to him now – maybe you might be able to say it was 10% of whatever he was earning or is that something you    Yes.    Yes.    But you cannot remember.    I am sure arrangements can be made to find some documents to     Okay.    The documentation.    Okay no that is fine.    I think somebody must help her.    The red numbers on the top right hand corner.    I am sorry that would have been roughly how much    Ja.  I thought you would just remember without calculating.    Okay well.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   About 6 – about 6?    About R6 million.    Thank you.    I am sorry Ms Norman we may – I just want to makesure we do not leave this without …    With anything hanging.    The amount that was equivalent to twelve months salary or remuneration why were you given that amount?    Sorry.    Well you know earlier on and I assume you may have 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156been sitting there.  We had Mr Thekiso dealing with people who were paid certain monies/amounts and so on and as I understand the - the focus seems to look at - at least some employees may have been paid more than they should have been paid and the reasons or motives may have been illegitimate for doing that. So you - you did not deal of course with the question of why you left and that maybe relevant to why you were paid that amount but if you had decided to leave on your own without there being any dispute or anything.  I know of no reason why you or anybody on a fixed term contract would have to be paid for any - any amount if it was just theirdecision that they want to leave.  So that is why I am - I am asking.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Hm, hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Hm.    With regard to the last issue are you saying that you and Minister Carrim were at opposite ends …    Right.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    The policy?    Now was …    Was the other voice Ms Tshabalala the Chairperson of the board.    Yes and MultiChoice - no she was on the same side    Yes but you were on …    On the other side?    And you know that Minister Carrim was in agreement with you?    He was in agreement with you?    You and him were - were on the same side on this issue?    Yes, yes.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Deputy?    Yes.    Yes.    Well it - it - that issue the MultiChoice as well as this - this digital - it was called digital?    Should be collected.  So and - and I would urge you if the investigators or the Commission might not have got much information from you in regard to that aspect.  I would urge you if possible to give the Commission as much information as you know …    Because one of the things that certainly when the matter came before the Constitutional Court I could not understand is why it was taking so long for Government to make up their mind oneway or another on the issue and I think I seem to remember that at some stage in the public media maybe in the court papers I do not - I cannot remember that the - the ruling party on its side was saying what has been done is not in accordance with the policy. This might not have been at your time.  It might have been at - at a different time but it was one of those things where - where you do not understand why it is taking so long to implement and if there are challenges why do people not just make up their mind.  This is the right thing.  If it is the right thing we are doing it.  If it is not the right thing make up your mind and make it clear where - where you stand but yousay that - you - you are saying that your departure from the SABC was not really because you just wanted to leave and there was no problem. You say there were - there was a problem or there were some problems but you say in particular you as the Group CEO and the Chairperson of the Board at the time Ms Tshabalala you were in 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156disagreement on the issue of - on this issue of digital migration and - and MultiChoice.  The MultiChoice Agreement making it almost redundant to look at - at the digital migration or being inconsistent with the whole idea. You know and the two of you were - could not agree on that and she was insistent that she wanted it to go - to happen.    Yes, yes.    There was some rush to have it signed …    During the time when you were on leave?    Because you were standing in the way?    So would it be - would it reflect your thinking to say you were pushed out of the SABC?    Yes.    Yes.    It was not true.  They were - you had no children working at ETV?    Hm.    Yes.  So - so it was - was it those two reasons around which you and the Chairperson of the Board at the time could notagree?    Yes.    With - ja.  Yes.    Yes.    Hm.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Improperly?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Yes, okay.    Yes.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Yes.    Okay, okay but whoever it was - was doing so on your behalf or on behalf of both parties?    Oh on behalf of the Chairperson?    So there had been a discussion between you and the Chairperson …    Before the person was instructed to draft it?    And in terms of that discussion you had indicated thatyou were prepared to leave?    Okay, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.  Okay, but the - the amount that you were given which I think you said represented or the agreement says represented 12 months remuneration.    Who came up with that - that amount?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   She came up with the amount?    The third party?    Yes.    Lawyer or not really?    Hm.MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Oh, okay alright.  So - so the amount did not come from you?    It came from their side?    Ja, their side.    Ja and the way they explained it to you was that this is what - the CCMA would normally award.  Is that right?    Where - was - were you told that this is what the CCMA would award if for example you took them to - the SABC to the CCMA or …?    That is what you were told?    Okay and then you accepted that?    So in - in a way was it to you like a settlement to make sure that after that there would be no further litigation or how did    Or just as some compensation for the fact that you were not finishing your term?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You were just …    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes and …    And this - all of this related to you being pushed out?    Okay.  Thank you and - and you say you have been pushed out of SABC for standing for what you believed was right and    Thank you.    Just repeat the page number.    Are we on the same bundle or a different bundle?    Okay.  I have got     I have got it and what is the page number?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  No all of things will be …    Of the documentation and whatever knowledge and information that you have please give - give it to the Commission because …    It is very important.  My recollection is that there was a lot of money that was involved in - in that whole thing and that it took so many years.  I mean up to now …    I think sometime this year there was something in the newspaper.  I do not know what development …    About them.    To deal with that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  I think there was something in the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156newspaper sometime this year and I think I - I asked Mr Pretorius and Mr Nombembe to take note and make sure that it is pursued because …    It was something like there lying somewhere …    And nothing is being done …    And where money is being lost.    Okay, thank you.    Yes, yes.  No, thank you.ADV THANDI NORMAN    Okay.    Thank you very much Ms Mokhobo.    And I understand that there is another statement that you had already started working on.    Yes.  So in - you - you will probably maybe asked to come back at some stage.  Arrangements will be made but thank you very much for coming to share your knowledge with - with us about these issues.  For now you are excused.    Thank you.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Yes.    Okay.  How - how much time?  10 minutes, five minutes?    Five minutes.    We will adjourn for five minutes.      We adjourn.     Yes, are you ready?    Yes.    That’s the one I have been having.    Yes.    Mmm.    Have we admitted the one for – CC25?    (microphone off) the file containing the statements of – no I think we're D, now I see it says statements.    You are much younger than me, you should not forget so easily.    Okay, alright, yes.    Ja, no that’s fine.  Can we swear this one in now?    Ja, administer the oath or affirmation.    Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will giveshall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so raise you right hand and say I truly affirm?.    Thank you, yes you may proceed.    Did you say paragraph 14?  Oh yes, ja, I can see. You will arrange for a supplementary affidavit?    Okay, ja.    Is that this year?    Okay.    Ja, but I think about whether you, the program was allowed to be aired what you wanted to air on TV and they were saying no don’t, I want to know ultimately what happened to it?    But on the day that you got instructions were you not planning to air that on the same day?    Oh you did go ahead?    Despite the instruction?    Okay, okay.    It was just completely wrong?    Did Mr Jimi Matthews during – you said he gave you a speech or a lecture, did he say why it was that the EFF should not be you know events or anything connected with it should not bebroadcast?    Yes, so he spoke in general?    And then the acting head of – did you say it was Ms Ditlhakanyane?    Yes, Acting Head of Radio News.  Ja, also this was a radio broadcast, not a TV broadcast that you were planning.    So, and when you were speaking with Mr Matthewsyou parted with  him on the basis that you would listen to whatever instruction that Ms Ditlhakanyane would be giving you and evaluate it, implying that if you thought that it was a lawful instruction that was in line with the policy of SABC you would comply but if you thought it was unlawful or contrary to the SABC’s policies you would not comply, is that what you were implying?    So on that day you went ahead and broadcast whatever you wanted to broadcast in regard to the EFF, contrary to Ms Ditlhakanyane’s instruction.    Were there any consequences to you as a result of you not complying with that instruction or not really?    Denying?MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE   Yes it had happened, okay thank you.    I may have, I am sorry, I may have interrupted your planning, I think he was starting on turn about Mr Motsoenengappointing Ms Ditlhakanyane in the permanent position when I interrupted him, I don’t know if he had finished that part.    Okay, thank you.    I’m sorry, I am sorry, what is RSG listener?     Oh, it is a radio station?    What is the full name?    Okay.    Oh, is it like Maphuta in isiZulu?    (laughing) well I can understand what it means but I think a lot of people do understand, yes thank you.    Oh.    Do you recall who would have signed that, would it have been himself, making himself head of, the person with final say on    Okay.    Did you move away from 78 or are you still at 78?    Oh, okay.    Okay, okay.  So we go back to his statement?    Okay.  Was his statement at the beginning?  No, it isnot ...(intervention)     Folder 12.  Okay and what paragraph?    Okay.    I see that you put what Mr Motsoeneng said inquotation marks.  Did you mechanically record what he was saying?    In paragraph 16.1 you just read that whole paragraph which is in quotation marks.  Did you mechanically record what he was saying?    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Yes, okay and you will put his response to Mr Krige for Mr Krige to comment on - on what Mr Matthews has to say?    Okay.    Well maybe do you want to let him comment if he has any comment on paragraph 30.1?    Is there anything you want to say about what Mr Matthews says in paragraph 30.1 that has been read to you?    Yes.MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE   He was no longer there?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, okay.    Huh-uh.    Is it anything for which there is a transcript alreadyhere?    Ja.  No, no I am talking about the recording that you are talking about.    Is it a recording in respect of which we already have a transcript here?    Now if - if there is a transcript it is - it is okay.    Ja.    Okay.  That is fine.  That is fine.    Thank you very much Mr Krige for - for coming and for sharing with the Commission your experiences.  Thank you very much.    You are excused.    Thank you.  Tomorrow how many witnesses have we    So we could start at 10?    Okay.  We will adjourn the proceedings for the day and we will start at 10 o’ clock tomorrow.  We adjourn.
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good morning Mr Chairman.    Yes thank you.  Mr Chairman the witness that we intend calling me this morning is Mr Jonathan Thekiso.  That – his statement – there is two bundles before you Mr Chair they would be marked Exhibit CC17.1 and Exhibit CC17.2 to CC18.    17 – Exhibit CC17.CHAIRPERSON   And the next – the second one – he has two statements the one is in that bundle and the other one is in Exhibit CC17.2 that is where his supplementary statement is.    Point 2. Oh.    Oh they used a smaller font yes.CHAIRPERSON   His statement in CC17.1 is the very first statement.  It will be under the divider marked CC17.  And it starts from page 1 the statement itself and then the rest are annexures.  Statement it goes – starts from page 1 up to page 10 and the remainder are 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156annexures.      What does the letter say Mr Chairman?    Oh.    No I think – I think Mr Chairman you looking – if you could look at the file divider.    That is the correct one.    And then if you turn that file you will find a divider that is marked CC17.1.    Yes.    That is then his initial statement and thena supplementary statement it is in CC17.2 which is in the lever arch file marked CC17.2 to CC18.    Yes.    It will be on top yes.      Yes.  It starts from page 334.    Yes.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you Mr Chairman.    Yes.  Thank you Chair the evidence that 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156we are leading is a continuation of what we stared.  We started this last year with the evidence of Doctor Kaufmann who had identified what state capture is and he had testified that if you capture the media that is state capture.  We continued with that evidence through the evidence of Mr Sundaram who indicated the attempts to capture the TV stations.  So this is a continuation of that.  And Chair would recall that Chair has always told us that he needs to answer three questions.  The first question is what happened?  The second question is how did it happen?  And the third question is what must done in order to make sure that it does not recur?  Now state capture as it is this phenomenon does notcome as the Chair would know in a bundle identified as state capture.  We are adducing evidence to show how the attempts were made and that will fall squarely within 1.1 of the terms of reference because there    Yes.    Yes.    That is right yes.    Yes.  That is – Chair would recall thatright at the outset when the commission commenced.    As the legal team we had made submissions on the terms of reference.    How far should they go?    And to what extent can they be limited if they have to be limited?    So that is the challenge we have.  For example if you take the SABC.    We are going to call one or – one of the former Ministers to come and explain to you how certain contracts were entered into.    But we are going to also show you how skilled people were removed in order to enable people who were not qualified.    State capture to happen.  And unfortunately without us doing that we are not going to be able to assist you when at the end of the day we have to submit a report and 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156deal with what is it that happened within the SABC.    Yes.    Yes it will be.  Yes.    It will – Chair the difficulty is one with the evidence as it progresses I cannot take this witness’ evidence 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156individually.    And say this evidence on its own will show you state capture.    I have to link it with the other evidence that you are going to lead.    And then you will see how the process itself unfolded and how we get to the point of the contracts.  Becausein the – in the establishment you need people who are going to facilitate procurement and we are going to show you how people were removed and who was replaced and how that process unfolded right up to the stage then when contracts were entered into, when policies were changed. So that is the process that you are following.  Yes.    There will – the…    Ja.    Yes I think…    Yes.  Yes Chair no I think there is a 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156memorandum that I had submitted to you Chair.    But I can update that memorandum.    Yes ja but…    Yes.    Yes.    It will lead – Chair I would not be leading this evidence if it did not tie up with that.      That is an assurance that I can give you.CHAIRPERSON   I know Chair but…    Yes.    But also Chair in the rules you have made it our obligation as the legal team.    The responsibility to place evidence before you and I would not place any evidence that I regarded as irrelevant to the terms of reference.  And the evidence that …    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Chair has not heard the evidence    Chair I had placed….    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Chair I…    That this evidence is relevant because it is going to tie in with other evidence that is going to show ultimately how the contracts were handled.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Thekiso please could you switch on your mic?  Thank you.  You have two files next to you.  The one is marked EXHIBIT CC17.1 and the other one is marked CC17.2.  Do you see that?    We are going to start with the one that is marked CC17.1.  If you could just place that one in front of you.    Admit them.  Yes.  Thank you Chair.    Yes.  It is - it is written sworn affidavit Mr Chairman but at the end Chair will find that it is just signed.    Thank you.    Affidavit.    It is - it is a supplementary affidavit Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.    In what position are you employed?    Okay.  What do you deal with within Human Resources?    Thank you and I would imagine that before you do that you yourself you must be able to say I am qualified enough    Yes.  Could you just place your qualifications before the Chairperson please?    Would start, yes Chair.    Yes.  Thank you.  Before you joined the SABC where were you employed?    Yes.  Thank you very much.  So then you have just told us what your obligations are as - as the Head of Human 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156Resources.  You were asked by the investigators of - of the Commission to go through the contracts of the persons that had left the SABC and especially where there where agreements of separation between those people and the SABC …    And - and you are just going to take the Chairperson through those to show how these people left but your assessment of all these contracts as you were asked by the investigators of the Commission what - what did - what was revealed by the contracts and the manner in which they were - they were enteredinto?  Just roughly without now pinpointing to specific cases.  We are going to deal with that.    Yes and then as an HR - I would regard 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156you as an HR expert given the years that you - and the places that you have been dealing with this.  Ordinarily if a person - if there is a dispute between the employer and the employee I would imagine that would be resolved by a disciplinary hearing?    And you have come across instances where there would be a disciplinary hearing and before the SABC is vindicated on whether or not it is in the wrong - it was in the wrong or it was correct in what it was doing then there is a settlement parting ways.  Sometimes that follows even an order from the CCMA that thatwould vindicate the SABC?    Yes.    Yes and you make - you say you do not find conclusively that there was purging but you say the indications were there.  What is your understanding of purging employees?    Yes and I would like to just take you and …    Oh sorry Chair.    Thank you.  Thank you.  May - may I take you to page 5 of - of EXHIBIT 17.1?  I beg your pardon to page 38.  I 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156beg your pardon.    Yes, 38.    Thank you.  This is one of the - a person who was once employed by - by the SABC Mr Feliti.    Yes.    Page 38.  I beg your pardon Chair.  Iinitially said five.  I made - it is page 38.    Thank you.  Could you just read that letter into the record so that we can deal with the matters that the Chairperson has raised with you?    Yes.    Sorry.  Before you move.  The letter is dated?    So this was almost a period of two years before the expiry of that contract?    Yes.  Thank you.  Please continue.    I beg your pardon.  No, no reason Chair.  Mr Feliti.  I beg your pardon.  It is Mr Dingaan Feliti.  I did mention it initially yes.    And there are - there is no reason except to say that the SABC itself has decided not to continue with the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156employment?    Would you regard this - what is contained in paragraph 4 would say this was a legitimate or illegitimate reason advanced to any employee for terminating employment?    Yes and it was - one would say it was …    No Chair.  No reason except to say I amusing my own prerogative.  Yes.  So that is basically …    Yes.  There is no reason.    Thank you Chair and then - then after you dealt with each and every employee that left during that period and where they were set - oh sorry.  Maybe - let us finish Mr Feliti and you will see that at page 49 Chair if I may - not 49.  If I may just direct youto see page 42.  That - that payment is payment that relates to Mr Feliti.  Am I right?    Yes.  The first - if - if Chair has a look at page 41 …    Chair will see that - that is the SARS income tax schedule …    Yes.  Yes that is correct Chair.  3-3-6 Chair.  Double three - 3-3-6.    Double three six Chair, yes.  You will find that payment …    General Manager Human Resources appears.  The date 22 April and the amount paid to him appears there.    Yes.    Yes.  Could you read that?  How - howmuch was that?    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Thank you and then maybe you could take another example which you could just go to page 247 Chair ofBundle/EXHIBIT CC - sorry - 17.1.    At page 2-4-7.    Replace him.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Was paid, yes.    Yes, yes.    One person.  Yes, thank you Chair.  Thank you.    Yes and that would appear at page 249.    Yes.  I did Chair.  I said Mr Olivier.    Or maybe I speak to fast.  It is 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156Mr Christian Olivier Chair.    That …    Olivier, yes.    Yes.  There is a separation agreement that appears from pages 250 …    And that agreement was not signed byMr Olivier as you can see but it was signed by the SABC.  At - if you look at - maybe at page 254 the copy that you furnished to the Commission is not signed by Mr Olivier.       Chair could you please move to page 250, we’ll go back to 248 I just want to identify the agreement first. Okay at 250 this is called a mutual separation agreement, are you with me?           Thank you and if you look at page 254 of that, you will see that there is no signature appearing on behalf of 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156Mr Christian Olivier.      Okay and did you extract this information from your human resources files?       Were you able to find any other one that he had signed?       Only what you had furnished to the       And then if you turn over the page at page 255 you will see that there is a signature there on behalf of the SABC and that’s dated 25 October 2016.       Yes but there is also another document which I would like you to just identify where Mr Olivier has signed and said something, that’s Chair appears at page 247.       Yes Chair, and then at 247, Chair maybejust – so as to state the reason because the Chair had questions about the reasons, if you go to page 247 could you just read out what the reasons are that are advanced for separating from this employment agreement?       Yes Chair.       No, thank you Chair we’ll do that, thank   you.  And then at page 249 you drew our attention to the period for which Mr Olivier was paid and there’s various columns could you just talk to those columns that are there and the period for which he was paid?       So would that mean that remaining period, that’s a period of about five5 years, am I right?       Yes.       Yes Chair thank you.       Thank you Chair.    Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  The other example that you would like to bring to the attention of the Chair Mr Thekiso is that – that the one that relates to Mr Masinga am I correct?  It is the next one we would like to deal with and that you will 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156find…    Mr Chairman you will find that at page 122.    122 Mr Chairman Yes.  At least I did hear you mention the name this time.    Yes thank you Chair.    Masinga.  That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.  The reason given for the termination roughly is that Mr Masinga had engaged in other business interests and therefore a conflict – sorry are you lost?  Have you found it?    Oh you seem to be looking for something sorry.  Are you at page 122 Mr Thekiso?    Yes thank you.    Yes.  And if you look at page 133.  I beg your pardon, no, no, no I am sorry I turned to the wrong page.  I wanted to look at page 130.    This is where the agreement is signed byboth parties.      Mr Masinga he was I will give you now Chair.  It is – it will be in the list.  I will give you now.  I beg your pardon Chair.  He was the Group Executive Technology.    Yes Chair.  I wanted to just for the witness to identify – no not to identify the signatures but to see that this was signed on the 21 s t April 2016.  Are you there Mr Thekiso?    No Chair.  Page 130.    I beg your pardon Chair no I am sure I did not pay attention to the pages.    Yes or page 130.    Yes.  So that is 21 April 2016.  Are you    Yes thank you.  And then according to the schedule that you have prepared which should appear at page – in the next bundle CC – Exhibit 27.2.  It shows that this was – this relationship terminated on 21 April 2016 and that an amount of money was paid to him just over R4 million paid to him.    The amount is reflected Chair – if Chair goes to the bundle X CC17.2 at page 337.  And if Chair could count just    8 lines – that is correct yes.    R4.5 million yes thank you.    Yes thank you.  The one amount that you did not mention which was a huge – that huge amount or is that one of… Yes thank you.  The one amount that you did not mention which was a huge – that huge amount or is that one of…    Yes.    Context.    Yes.  Are you looking for information?    Alright okay.  You just indicate what –    Yes it will be – just a minute.    Although…    It appears – may I take Chair to page 128?    128 shows that his term of – it says Masinga’s fixed term contract with the SABC which became effective from 15 May 2015 and was to continue until 31 May 2018.    That is 3.5 Chair.    Yes.    The letter of termination…    No Chair it is years.  It is from – this is…    Yes.    Yes Sir.    Yes    Yes.    That is correct yes.    And then he was paid for the full term it appears looking at the amount.    We do have the schedule Chair which hasbeen prepared.    In relation to the documents that Human Resources have.    That is correct.    But then Chair if you look at the settlement agreement itself.    It gives a different amount.  It may very    If Chair – if I may direct you Chair to page 127?      Yes thank you.  Mr Thekiso would you read paragraph 2.2.7 of the settlement amount?  How much – what did they say was going to be the payment there?    Yes.    Between the members yes.    In fact it is almost double.    It is almost double that amount.    Yes Chair.  But Chair the witness is going to come back with the matters that the Chair had raised.  The witness is going to come back and do a proper table of the matters that you have raised.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   True.  Yes true Chair.    Another table and you have to come back with that analysis.  But just for conclusion these amounts of all these pay-outs during that period of 20 – largely between 2016 most of them, 14, 2016 that grand total of what was paid you reflected in Exhibit17.2 at page 338.    And that amount comes to how much?    Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    And in each instance you have got the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156name of the employee, you have got the title of the employee and then you have the amounts paid to them.  But maybe just – what is important to – you have also titled them.  You have got the group – there is largely most group executives.    You have got group executive technology.  You have group executive Chief Executive Office.  You have group executive news.  You have got group employee relations consultant.    So most of – you know you have got all ofthose people who were holding those senior group executive radio.    Yes.  So then when you come back then you are going to deal – continue with these so as not to waste time do the exercise that the Chair has asked you to do in respect of each and every one.     And the replacement of the people that you say in most instances were irregularly appointed in the place of    Thank you Chair.  With your leave then Chair may this witness be released for now for him to come back and conclude?    Chair I wish to call now Ms Lulama Mokhobo.    Thank you.  Her statement Mr Chairman is one of the files that the Registrar had placed before you marked CC20    We are not going to need.    We will need just the one Chair.    Sorry Chair may I just – we will need only Chair Exhibit CC17.1.    Yes the other one we are not going to    Her statement Chair appears…    Under – yes it appears under the file divider 21.    Yes thank you.    May the witness Chair be sworn in?    Thank you Chair.  Ms Mokhobo could you please just state for the record your qualifications please/    And before oh sorry then on the 16 t h February 2012 you joined the SABC, is that correct?    In what capacity were you employed?    Yes when you joined the SABC where – before you joined it where did you work?    Still at the SABC?    Yes. Could you then tell the Chair what your responsibilities were as a Group Executive office of the SABC?    If you turn to the last page where – that would be at page 9.  Is that your signature?    Yes.  Did you make this statement freelyand voluntarily?    Yes thank you.  Thank you just to move then to what you have stated.  The reasons for the commission’s investigators to approach you, you articulate those reasons at paragraph 7 of your statement?    Because they had a particular – a specific request that – could you just tell the Chair why – what you were asked    Sorry could you just – what you say in paragraph 7 just tell the Chair what is it that you were called to deal with by the – by the investigators.    Yes.    Is it – it is correct that you were involved in the signing of the contract between the SABC and the – TNA Media?    Sorry what was your answer?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO   Yes you were.  Oh before you deal with the contracts could you just tell the Chairperson how did it come about that SABC wanted to do business with TNA Media?    Yes.  So then – so when – they were already – when you say they were already doing business with the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156SABC that means that they were already delivering newspaper with SABC?    And this was happening without any formal contract?    Yes.  And then you deal…    Yes.  Thank you.  Then you – you – then you discover that look there was no contract and what are the stepsthat you took in order to regularise that situation?    Yes.  And then thereafter then you had this contract which you deal with in paragraph 11 of your statement?    Chair that contract would be found at page – starting from page 10.    Thank you Chair.  May I direct your attention Chair to page 30 I am sorry there is two.      Yes.  That is the signature page.  Ms Mokhobo is that your signature at page 30?    And your names are reflected there?    Yes.  I would like you …    Yes Chair yes and this was signed on the 13 t h March 2012?    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  In paragraph 11 where you have attached the agreement you also indicate who was negotiating on behalf of the SABC this contract?    Yes and who was that person?    And in which department was he?    Yes.  Did you - before you entered into this agreement did you as a person personally at your personal level know Mr Nazeem Howa?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    BRICS?    Yes.    Yes, thank you and then after your appointment did you have occasion to meet him?    And who were those people who congratulated you?    Yes.  Now - then what was your - when - when they were saying - what was your understanding of that conversation that you had with them?  That you would make it possible.  What was your understanding?  What is it that they - they wanted from you?    Yes.    Did you find that conversation in anyway 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156improper or were you - you found that - I mean I am not going to do what they - they want.  I cannot do it until as you say the tender processes have been followed but how - how did you assess that conversation?    Yes.  Then just on the reading of yourstatement having been appointed on 16 February 2012 and this contract was signed …    I beg your pardon.  Sorry.    Sorry.    Yes.    Thank you Chair and then how soon after 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156your appointment did this meeting - congratulatory meeting take place?    Of your - of your appointment?    Yes, thank you and between the time of - you had the congratulatory meeting and the signing of the agreement did you at any stage have any interaction with any of these people or some of the people that had congratulated you at all?    Yes.  So then how frequent was - were these breakfast shows?    Yes because you have already said that this was more important for the News Department who was at that time heading the News Department?    Yes.    Yes.  I had asked about the frequency and then you started by saying well they were supposed to be twice a month and then when - did those - did they increase over time and if they did to what extent?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Alright.  Can I just take you …?    Sorry.    Yes.  Maybe we need to deal with the aspect that you mentioned.  That you would have your reporters goingto the places where the breakfast shows were going to happen.  This is a matter that was raised by two witnesses yesterday.  By the Head of News, Ms Phathiswa Magopeni and by the Financial Chief - Financial Officer, Ms Yolande Van Biljon that the SABC never invoiced TNA for the costs that they incurred for airtime, for having their reporters 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156travelling there for - their equipment, for all of those expenses. They were never invoiced for that.  Do you have an explanation as to why that was so?    Compromised.     So would that even applied to the expenses that the SABC would have incurred I gathering or in attendingthe breakfast shows.       Ma’am from the following paragraphs then you deal with the terms of the contract itself but I’d like to take you to some specific terms of the contract, maybe starting with the one revealing to the frequency of these – if I may just direct you to go to page 15 please.       Yes.CHAIRPERSON      Page 15 Chair.  According to paragraph four of that, that agreement was going to remain in force for how long?       Yes and then there are just some terms 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156that I would like you to just highlight there for instance to the one which you have just dealt with, at paragraph 5.6 could you just read that term?       Yes so did you then,  when you said that over time these breakfast shows increased, the number of shows increased, did you then sign another agreement or an addendum to this       Yes, and may I also take you to the paragraph that deals with costs, which is 17.1.21 if my recollection is correct, if I may just take you to that Chair, I beg your pardon may I just take time Chair to get to that paragraph sorry I’ve marked it, where it says that the SABC shall not be liable to pay sub-contractors, I’ll take you to that, it’s 7.1.21 not 17 it appears at paragraph – at page       7.1.21, if you go to page 18.       Yes and was there, other than the terms that you find, for example in paragraph seven which were the duties and obligations of the TNA Media, maybe you can just highlight because the one about venues, that’s the more prominent term that most people refer to and that appears at page 16, the TNA Media shallconvene the events twice on a monthly basis or as mutually agreed by the parties in writing, if you look at 7.1.1.       Yes so until the time you left the SABC you were not privy to any other written terms, changing the original terms of this agreement?       Yes and then if you could just highlight those terms that you believe important for our purposes because there’s one – you had – initially you had told Chair that once there is a regular relationship between a particular supplier or maybe [indistinct] 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156supplier and the SABC so there might be wrong with that relationship but I’m just, for instance in 7.1.10 on the same page it says,“Ensure exclusivity to SABC as the official broadcast partnerof the events”.So it seems to me at this point then the relationship was regarded as that of a partnership.       Well the paragraph that you want to refer to where you say there was – that this relationship was not to be construed as a partnership, is that paragraph 6.4 on the same page?       Okay and then who was going to monitor then the implementation of this agreement?       Yes and you would have no role to play in making sure that they stuck to the terms of the contract?       Yes thank you and if you go – then on to your statement you highlight in your statement, largely, the terms as you’ve copied them from the contract themselves, am I correct?       Yes and all those they go up to paragraph 18 and what is of interest largely is the obligations of the SABC, you deal with those in paragraph 19, that’s at page five of your statement.       And that was in?     Yes so the SABC also, 19.2 was going to advertise these events?         Yes was that permissible?MS LULAMA MOKHOBO      Yes and in paragraph 21 you repeat 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156what you said in your evidence that your understanding was that there was not going to be any invoicing that was going to happen?       Okay and then you have some figures that you’ve put in there in paragraph 23, what are you saying in that paragraph?       Yes and then in paragraph 24 you say that you can confirm that the events did not stay within the contract because then they suddenly escalated in certain cases almost doubled and then – when this came to your attention or when you realised that, look this is no longer what we had agreed on, what steps did you then take?       Yes with TNA Media.       That was on, according to you – what is the date that you highlight there in paragraph 26?       In paragraph 26 when was thatconcluded?       Yes and then you deal with the renewal of the contract and then paragraph 30 you say the preceding paragraph that certain information was brought to your attention by the investigators of the Commission?       And then could you just tell Chair what you’re communicating in paragraph 30?       Yes, so that is them charging the other SOE’s for the breakfast shows?       Okay thank you and then in – from paragraph 32 onwards then you deal with the distribution of the       Could you just testify to those paragraphs and at what point did you get involved and to what extent were you involved in the distribution of the New Age within the SABC?       Yes and the delivery of the newspapers would that have been something that you negotiated on prior to you signing the contract or advised that it as part of that agreement?     What was the threshold of matters that had to be referred to as the Group CEO?         In fact if I may just – to confirm the evidence that was received yesterday from Yolande Van Buuren she mentioned a figure of R991 671.89 being the total 2018/2017/2016 – from 2011 up to 2018 that’s basically the figure that she gave.       From 2011 up to 2018.       Yes over seven years, yes thank you. Chair there’s some other – I would like to take the witness to different matters, the parliamentary committee dealings and engagements and their findings and I’d like to take you to some of the matter that they had raised therein.  I notice that it’s time for the lunch adjournment, maybe adjourn at this point?       They are just relevant for the purposes of making sure that at the end of the day we are able to verify certain information from her, they shouldn’t take long.       I’m not sure Chair because there’s also the multi-choice and the DTT matters – yes, thank you.    The one would be the Parliamentary transcripts we do not have to go through them but     But for the sake of the witness just to state what – what she needs to respond to and also I have placed back before you Chair Exhibit 27.    Thank you Mr Chairman.    Yes and that related to the increment to the salary of Mr Motsoeneng the second increment?    And at page 268 the Public Protector made the finding Ms Lulama Mokhobo the outgoing GCEO for her improper that disciplinary steps must be taken for her improper conduct in the approval in the salary increment of Mr Motsoeneng.    That – page 268 Chair which will be inExhibit CC27.    27 that is correct Chair.  That is the February 2014 Report of the Public Protector.    It is not, no Chair.      That is correct Chair yes.  At page 268.    And in the transcripts you were asked 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156extensively about the increment?    Could you just tell the Chair briefly because it will become relevant in another context later in the evidence before the SABC as to why you approved the second increment of Mr Hlaudi’s salary.    Yes.    Yes. Issue a recommendation – they would give a status of the salary level and give a sense of what other people within that band were receiving and then do a recommendation thatsays we think this person should be at this level.  This person should be at another level.   Now in Mr Motsoeneng’s case his matter had to be approved by the board Chairperson and he duly approved it because he agreed…    Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And lastly before Parliament another issue that was canvassed – the one thing that we have not spoken about is the date when you left the SABC.  When did you actually resign from the SABC?    Thank you Chair.  Maybe to assist the witness the date that is contained in the settlement agreement for your last day at the SABC is 28 February 2014.  Is that the correct date?    Your last day.  Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you.  In Parliament a lot was discussed around the package that you received.  You recall 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156that?  Chair on – Chair does not have to go to it but the relevant page is in the Exhibit that has got Parliament transcript which will now be Exhibit because we have not – introducing it for the first time that will be Exhibit 29.    Thank you Chair.  Chair the pages that are relevant for this purpose are in the Parliamentary Report which I ask that it be marked CC29 that would be from page 1 until page 28. This is where these matters are discussed in Parliament relating to Motsoeneng relating to the package or settlement agreement relating to Mr Mokhobo and also matters relating briefly to the Multichoice contractwhich is going to be one of the matters that this stream is going to be dealing with.  But just because at that point Parliament did not have these documents before it and also for the record for you to confirm I would like to refer you to Exhibit CC17 – 17.1.  This is the bundle that Mr Thekiso had compiled and I would like you to turn to page 155.    Oh sorry it is in – could you please assist/A    Sorry could you just help her.  17.1.CHAIRPERSON   Yes sorry.  Yes thank you at page 155.      Page 155.  It starts – the separation agreement starts from page 154.    On top.    154.    Yes thank you.  Is that the separation agreement between you and the SABC?    Yes thank you.  And then the amounts thatyou received they appear at page 155.    Yes there was a lot of debate around how much you received.  What was Parliaments information about what you had received?    Yes.  Could you then for the record and also to set that record straight just read out to the Chairperson the amounts as reflected on that page?    Yes.  Thank you.  And then lastly.    Those amounts – just.    Thank you Mr Chairman.    And then lastly there is something that Parliament dealt with in its enquiry which is something that is going to come later but there is a witness already who is going to – who has given a statement to the commission that is going to be called.  A Mr Roy Kruger.    Oh yes Chair.      Yes.        Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just for the purposes of the record.  You - you would recall that after our consultation you were requested by me that another statement would be required just on the MultiChoice …?    Yes.    Yes, thank you.  Yes, thank you.  Can Ijust - just to place the evidence of one witness that is going to come after you - maybe some time next week who just on this issue of MultiChoice - his statement you do not have to go to it.  I will just read out to you what he says.  It is EXHIBIT CC20 to 24 Chair.  This is    Page 12 Chair of CC20 to 24.    No - no this is the bundle - sorry.  It is the same bundle.  I beg your pardon.  The same bundle that has got this witness’ statement.  I beg your pardon.  The right - it will be under - his    Divider number 20.    Yes.    The page number is page number 12.  Are you there?    I will - I will just read out to you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, thank you.    Yes.  Will be dealt …CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    And will demonstrate how those boxes are just lying somewhere in some warehouses …    Without being delivered.    So that is the evidence that we are going    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  We will ….    Yes.  The investigators have got all that    We will show it to you next week.    Thank you.  Thank you.    Yes, thank you.    Thank you.    Can take over the next witness?

MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Jonathan Thekiso.REGISTRAR   I do not.    I do.    So help me God.    (duly sworn, states)CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.    I am the Group Executive of Human Resources.    My role is to provide strategic direction and leadership by aligning the HR strategy to the corporate plan of theSABC to ensure that the organisation can deliver on the mandate.  Secondly my role entails sustaining an environment that is characterised by healthy, competent staff members in order to ensure that the SABC becomes an employer of choice but quite critically we work very closely with line management to make sure that they can deliver on the objectives with a view to the SABC achieving the mandate.    Chairman I matriculated at Moletsane High School in Soweto.    In 1992.  I have a Bachelor of Social Sciences Degree from the University of Cape Town.  I have a Post Graduate Diploma in Management the HR stream from Wits University.  I have an Advanced Executive Program from Unisa School of Business Leadership.  I also have a Leadership Development Program which wasco facilitated by the University of Cape Town and Wits University. I also have an Executive Financial Management Program from Wits University.    I was employed in both the private and public sectors City of Johannesburg.  I have worked for Telkom Directories.  I have also worked for Deloitte.  I have worked for Vodacom and at Vodacom I had an opportunity to take assignments and    And in all instances it was an HR environment.    Yes.    What was revealed as we were going through the contracts was that people did not want to leave the organisation and they - in most instances - and there were agreements for them to leave the organisation on the basis that they were paid you know in lieu of their contracts.  For instance somebody might have had two more years to run in their contract. They were basically told to leave the organisation on the basis of payment amounting to the balance of the contract.  So ourassessment is that all in all people still wanted to work for the SABC people still wanted to contribute to the SABC but because of reasons we do not know they were essentially asked to leave the organisation on the basis of particular payments.    Correct.    That is quite correct and in - in some instances people would have gone through a disciplinary inquiry and the ruling of that inquiry would be that the person ought to be dismissed …    But instead of the dismissal taking effect the organisation preferred to enter into a settlement agreement and - and the person basically leaves the organisation as if they had resigned and in addition to that they - you know - they get paid asettlement figure - amount.    My understanding of purging employees is - 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156is to basically get them out of the way - you know - for reasons they may not be aware of or for reasons that are known only by the - by the employer of by the person who is actually getting rid of those - that particular employee.    Correct Chair but if the justification for wanting to get rid of somebody is the fact that there is a problem with your health of course there are mechanisms within the organisationthrough which we can take the person to ascertain the validity of that assertion surrounding the health of the individual but if there is nothing wrong with the individual and they get told that there is a problem with your health and as a result of a problem with your health - health we think that you might serve a better purpose at home. 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156If that is the case then that amounts to purging because in a sense you have not advanced justifiable reasons as to why this individual has to get out of the way.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chair.  I am - I am in total agreement with - with the examples the Chair is giving but I also want to highlight and - and impress the fact that in most instances in as far the - you know - the - the employees we are dealing with are concerned.  Their departure from the organisation was for mostly illegitimate reasons and therefore amount to - to purging.    Page 38?    Got it Chair.    Yes.    “Contract of Employment between the SABC and Dingaan Feliti.” That is the subject.    Number one   The letter is dated 19 April 2016.  Sorry Chair.    Correct Chair.    Number three   Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    I would say it is illegitimate.    Feliti.    Correct Chair.    It does not Chair.    Hm.    That - that is my - that is my understanding Chair.    No Chair.  At the time of the termination of Mr Dingaan Feliti I was not within the SABC.  This happened in 2016 and I joined the SABC in 2018.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is quite correct Chair.    That is - that is correct Chair.    Yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Okay.    The amount that was paid to Mr Feliti is R4 697 000 - sorry - 4 697 059,96.    That is - that is correct Chair.    Yes, yes Chair.      Yes, yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC    Okay.      Yes.      That’s correct.      No not…[intervenes].      That’s correct.      Okay the letter is dated the 25 t h October 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 15616 addressed to Mr C Olivier who was a General Manager Finance and Operations for the SABC and the subject is, SABC/Mr Olivier, separation,“The above matter and the meetings held on 24 t h and 25 t hOctober 2016 have reference.  During the abovementionedmeetings management made it very clear that there was abreakdown in the relationship between the SABC and yourselfand that the SABC contemplated severing the relationshipgoing forward.  You were also informed that managementwould prepare a separation agreement and would you provide you with a breakdown of the amount being offered.  Attachedare the following documents, 1) separation agreement and 2)document reflecting on the breakdown of the separationamount offered.  Please be informed that your last day inservice of the SABC will be the 31 s t of October 2016. You willalso not be required to render any further services withinimmediate effect.  Furthermore, it should be noted that theSABC will effect payment of the said separation amount intoyour banking account within 7 days from having received therelevant tax directive.  The SABC herewith wants to thank you for your contributions made during your tenure with the SABCand we wish you everything of the best for the future”,And this was signed by Mosholi Phaga who was the Group Executive Human Resources acting at the time and then it goes on,“Christian Olivier hereby acknowledge receipt of the letter 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 and have noted the content thereof and he signed it andthere’s also notes that say I do not agree with this and reservemy rights”,And the letter is dated the 25 t h or is signed on the 25 t h October 16.      Okay column one shows the current annual TGRP and TGRP stands for total guaranteed remuneration package.  The grand total there is R2 172 127.34 so that was theannual amount.  The current monthly TGRP is R181 010.61 and the next column shows…[intervenes].      Total guaranteed remuneration package.      That amounts to…[intervenes]      The next column shows 24 months and the total amount there is R4 344 254.68.  The next column is 36 months shows 36 months in other words the remuneration for 36 months would have been R6 516 382.02 and for 48 month the total amount is R651638 2000.02 sorry let me take that again, R6 516 382.02, the second last column shows 60 months which is R10 860 636.70 and the last column shows the remainder of contract which is 62 months the total there is R11475 852.39.      The remaining period is a period of five years.   Let me explain, where this comes from.      The employee at the time of thesettlement was 54 years and 10 months old, so they were left with two months before they could reach 55 years and at the SABC you qualify for early retirement from 55 years and so this total amount is based on 62 months which is a contract period of five years, so he was effectively paid for five years plus two months which is 62 months.      He was on a permanent employee at the time of the settlement.      Not a fixed-term contract Chair.      He was two months away from qualifying for early retirement so he would have been 54 years of age plus tenmonths, so he was left with two months before reaching age 55.      So then, in terms of retirement, ultimate retirement he would have been – he would have reached retirement age at age 60 because the…[intervenes].      That’s correct Chair.      So executives for the SABC can – must retire at age 60 the rest of the employees retire at age 63.  So insteadof the organisation waiting for Mr Olivier to serve out the five year term leading up to his ultimate retirement at age 60, the organisation decided to let him go at age 54 and ten months and then paid him the balance of the contract which was 62 months.  Sorry the balance of the contract which had been 62 months.      That is correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.      Thank you Chair, I’m advised that it’s time for the short adjournment.      It is the position Chair.      Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    No I am fine, I am fine.    I am.    Thank you Chair.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Thank you Chair.  The reasons for 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156termination of the contract of employment by SABC on Mr Masinga was that he was allegedly guilty of a number of misconducts.  But before the matter could be ventilated in a proper disciplinary enquiry the organisation decided to terminate the fixed term contract and entered into a settlement agreement with him.    130.    Ja.    Yes he was Chair.    Let me check.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   That is correct.    May 2018.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    Okay thanks Chair.  “2.2.7 Settlement amount means the net total sum ofR2 678 409.80  which is R2 678 419.80 free of any deductions, statutory or otherwise payable by the SABC to Masinga in full and final settlement of all the legal proceedings and attendant disputes.”    No.CHAIRPERSON   Ja.    Hm.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Correct Chair.    The amount is R102 403 331.97.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Okay.    Thank you.

MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Lulama Mokhobo    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    I have Masters Degree in InstructionalTechnology from Utah State University.  Prior to that I had a BA and Concurrent Diploma in Education from the then university of Botswana and Swaziland now known as University of Swaziland and I matriculated in Orlando High in 1974.  My apologies it is so long ago.    Yes.    I joined as the Group CEO of the SABC>    Prior to that I had worked as the Group Executive for Public Broadcasting Services and that was from 2005 to10.    Still at the SABC.    My responsibilities were to lead the executive team and therefore the entire organisation in delivering on the strategic imperatives of the SABC in the implementation of all policies that had been approved by the board and in some instances coming up with new policies and developing new strategies in order tomeet the requirements for the SABC for DTT and other activities.  And I was also a member of the board – an executive member of the board and by virtue of sitting as an executive member of the board one could also say I was involved in the development of policies, strategic direction and to some degree oversight of the organisation.    Yes it is.    Yes it is.    Yes I did.    Yes.    Okay.  I was requested to deal with the matters around TNA Media which was the television broadcast arm of TNA and the New Age newspaper which was one of the products of TNA.    Yes I was.    I am not very clear of the circumstances under which TNA started broadcasting jointly – well – it started working with the SABC because that happened long before I started at the SABC.  However a matter of concern when I arrived there was that they were operating without a contract and the dangers of doing that or quite obvious that there could suddenly be requirements of the SABCthat it could not meet and for the protection of the integrity of the organisation and the protection of the product that the organisation was broadcasting it was important for a contract to be entered into.      They were already delivering newspaper the live broadcasts were already happening.    Yes.    Chair unfortunately I do not have the detail.    However I am aware that they had been running for – for quite a while.    This could be tested with the SABC itself.    At that point it turned out that the then acting head of news Mr Mike Seluma and his executive management team were also aware of this problem – I will call it a problem and they had written a request to the legal department to draft that contract.  So 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156essentially this process was driven by the news department itself.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes it was.    In terms of the agreement the TNA was to provide and it did to provide the venues, invite the guests and provide all the requirements that the SABC would need in able to broadcast the show.  And all of these the TNA would do out of its own volition without any assistance from the SABC or any legal obligation to the SABC in terms of accessing the different people who appeared on the – for theshow.  And also the SABC had no responsibility whatsoever with the accessing, the creations sorry of the events themselves.  The SABC’s role on the other hand was to broadcast the events. And the reason the SABC – for the SABC it was important to do that was the events were mainly aimed at government and with the SABC’s core value being that of public broadcasting and therefore adequately informing and educating the public about what was going on in the country in particular in relation to the principles of the country and how they ran the country.  The SABC and myself in particular obviously saw this as anopportunity to do what was right for the public.  And therefore initially they presented themselves as something that was for public good and therefore it made sense for the SABC to do it.  But secondly there was going to be no exchange of money.  The SABC was not going to pay the TNA anything whatsoever for the events and for the expenses that the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156TNA incurred if it did incur any expenses regarding the setup.  And also the TNA would be under no obligation to pay the SABC any money for the presence of the SABC.  Now that may sound a little bit strange Chair however the reason is quite simple and straightforward.  In terms of the Broadcasting Charter and in particular the policies on news the SABC could not and was completely debarred from accepting any sponsorship for the news itself and the reason was quite simply that if it was receiving any monies then it would be difficult for it to remain objective. So if Party X provided the cash and the SABC received thecash and the SABC needed to cover a story on Party X.  Then Party X could very easily say but I am paying you.  So - so it was to block all possibilities of corrupt activities happening within the SABC News.    Chair what I was told was that the - the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156approach that the News Department had decided to adopt in “partnership” with TNA was to expose to the public what Government was doing for the public - for the country and to that extent the events seemed to be completely apolitical in the sense that just about all major political parties would go and - and say what they needed to say to the public through this channel and I am thinking of the major parties here. The DA for instance was - would be present on certain occasions and so would - a number of political parties would be involved.  So as I initially said Chair when I was informed of the criticalvalue that that programming was providing and the board itself - Members of the Board were participating very actively in the breakfast and that they would be invited and at the opening of each breakfast whoever was representing the SABC would go to the podium and say a word or two about the event and - and why it was being held. So there - there was very intense participation from the SABC right at the top level of oversight at the SABC and the political head of the SABC and other politicians.  So the - the reasons were sufficiently compelling for me to not say no this is wrong.  You cannot do it.  They - they were compelling enough to accept that indeed the - theprogramming played a - a critical role.    My understanding was that there was a 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156mutual origination.  It is a very strange way to put (intervenes).    But what I would suspect is …    With TNA having been the service provider so to speak I am quite sure that they may have engaged the SABC in saying can you come on board and let us do this together.    Yes.    The purpose was as - as they kind of sloganised it.  It was to - to bring Government to the people.  That is how it was sloganised and to the extent that the number of broadcasts increased and the trips to areas outside of Gauteng increased.  The argument was those trips and the set ups in the remote areas were important because those people also needed to know what Governmentwas doing. For instance there is a time towards the elections when I know that from the political parties’ perspective it was important for them as part of their rallying of the people it was important for them to go out and talk to the people and to that extent there were quite a 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156number of regional broadcasts that were done which should be in for instance - I know there was one in - in Mmabatho in particular where the local politicians were - were present and they did the discussion and the question and answer sessions.  So that is really it.    Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct and in fact sir - Chair there were question and answer sessions.    Where there would be an in - personnel from the News Department.    Who would be present in the breakfast …    And facilitate a discussion between whoever 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156the main speakers were and the - the audience that was present and they would also run SMS services.    So the broader public out there that could not be in the room.    Could also ask their questions and the questions would be run …    Through.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    You know Chair what I understood was that TNA would find a way to organise the events.  As far as I was aware the relationship between TNA and - and the SABC on those aspects wascompletely …    Arm’s length.    It was - it was very distant.    The SABC had no right to find out how and when they were getting the money and how much it was and therefore in respecting that relationship in that manner I was never aware of the monies that TNA was receiving in the running of the - of the broadcast.    Yes.  Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Mr Thaba Matebe (?).    He was the Acting Head of the Legal    Yes.  That is his signature.    Yes.    No not - not really.  It sounds like a bit of a strange question.  We - we only got introduced when …    This matter was being attended to.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   I had met - I think it was Atul Gupta …    Many, many years ago and that was long before I joined the SABC the first time early 2000s.  Possibly 2003.  I cannot remember but this was when the first meeting of BRICS …    Was coordinated in India and I got invited. At the time President Thabo Mbeki was at the helm of this country and I was invited as a member of his delegation to attend the - the …    The inaugural - it was called - the inaugural meeting and that is how I - I met him and I must say that at that time 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156there was no real I would say acknowledgement of each other.  It was just people from South Africa saying hello to each other …    And that was it.    After I was appointed it - it was something quite - quite strange.  I was - Hlaudi Motsoeneng who was Acting COO came to my office and said I - I have to take you somewhere very quickly and he would not tell me where it was.  It was all very hush,hush and we arrived at this massive house and I saw on the wall Sahara Computers and he said well we are here because these people want to congratulate you. So I went in together with Hlaudi.  I do recall that my phone and everybody else’s phone was taken and the battery was removed and we led into a dining room where the people who were present proceeded to congratulate me (intervenes).    I seem to recall that there was - well I thinkit was Ajay Gupta if I am not mistaken.  Atul Gupta I think he was there was well.  Duduzane Zuma and Mr Ace Magashule’s son.  I cannot remember his name and then there was Hlaudi and myself.  If there were other people I - I really cannot quite recall them because this was a while ago and we sat at the table. 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156There was a bit of food and they congratulated me and promptly told me that they would have liked to play a - a role in SABC’s DDT future because they were interested in creating a news channel and that they would hope that I would allow them or enable them to get access to a channel and at that point I said to them look I - I do not believe that it would be easy to just give anybody a channel. I am quite sure that there would have to be a proper tender process and a number of - it would be opened up and we expect that a number of people would apply also to be part of the DDT network of the SABC when it did come about and really there was nothing further todiscuss and they - they said congratulations and that was the end of it. I was not there long - you know.  We then promptly went back to the office.    I - I saw it as a - a lobbying of sorts for them to be afforded an opportunity on SABC platforms at that time and like Isaid I did not go in prepared because I did not know what this was about …    And as I said it was just to congratulate me.    I - I found it a little bit strange that such a - a proposition could be put to me but then I - I excused them mentally instead of me as well you know this is another lobbying because there is always a lot of lobbying going around with people seeking business opportunities.    He was very persuasive Chair and besides with me being new and him being the Acting C - COO at some point -Acting CEO and he - he was persuasive because I kept insisting where 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156are we going.  He said no, you will see.  You will see.  Come let us just go and there was a car parked ready to take us there.  It was not his car.  I - I assumed it was a car belonging to - to the Guptas and …    No it was not Mr Motsoeneng’s car.    It was I assumed a Gupta car with a chauffeur …    And I then thought you know what maybethere is no real harm.    I had no reason at that point ….    To be suspicious of him.    Yes Chair.  Particularly …CHAIRPERSON   Particularly Chair because Hlaudi was such a - a trusted member of the SABC Executive …    And as - as Acting COO he also sat on the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156board and …    He was very well loved and …    There were accolades and accolades heaped on him all the time.    So I really no real reason …    To - to be suspicious.CHAIRPERSON   And yes.    It was at the - at the residence.    Then it had a clock outside.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   It was a bit strange Chair.    It was a bit strange because there was really no further substance to that.    I was intrigued …    And maybe slightly annoyed because …CHAIRPERSON   You know I was - here I was taken away from my desk …    And - and yes it was around lunch time.  So you know …    But I was intrigued.    Ja.    Gosh.  I think it was within a week - within the first week.    Yes.    No.  I have to think very carefully nowbecause I think what - what happened was in the conversations and these were not formal conversations and not minuted the concern was raised that you know we are busy doing these breakfasts and there is no contract and this was some of the members - Board Members talking about it and I agreed with them that indeed you know you could not have a relationship of this nature which involved the SABC events and personnel going out of the SABC. Yes they did that regularly in the regular connection of news.  However - for other things - however having almost like a - an exclusive relationship with a particular party that it was not proper and in factChair it - it was eventually going to be - there was eventually going to be an audit finding because once a relationship is regular then surely it has to be regulated. Particularly if there are very specific deliverables from - from either party.  If you look at in terms of the SABC own process of 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156acquiring content you have to enter into an agreement.  However for the news yes it is different because they have to go and cover what is going on at the time that it is going on.  So a contract may not be necessary but in this one because this was a very steady supplier - content supplier.  It was important that there be a contract to regulate the relationship.    Chair initially there was supposed to be just two times a month.  Now this was 2012.  Then 2012 was just two yearsbefore the 2014 elections.  There was going to be a - a State of the Nation Address in Cape Town, the opening of Parliament and - and various other events - important events were - were happening within the country. There was there launch of the DDT.  There were all kinds of - of events that were happening and for the News Department it was important content for them and - and that is why they actually initiated the contracting process.  It was - it was important for them to have access to - to whatever content they could find which spoke directly to the people and - and that is how we ended up in a place where thecontract had to be entered into. Now my signature on the contract was really from a protocol perspective if I can call it that because the - the - TNA had their Chief Executive representing them and I was the Chief Executive of the SABC working with the SABC News Team in this regard.  Therefore that is 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156how my signature came on.  I do believe however that it could easily have been handled by the Acting Chief Operating Officer together with the Group Executive of News.    It was Mr Jimi Matthews.  He was Acting Head of News.    First there was Mr Mike Seluma …ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Who was there for a very short time and then he - he was removed and replaced by Jimi Matthews.    They did increase over time.  It is - it is very difficult to calculate the extent without looking at the records coming out of the SABC News Department itself and I think it may beworthwhile to get those records.  I do not have them.    As - as - you can imagine having left the organisation.  I have no access …    I - I …    I do not believe Chair that there was anexact formula.    They were all driven by …    Events …    And not necessarily by - by a formula.    At the very - from the very outset it had been agreed that the - the content coming out of those breakfasts was very newsworthy and SABC News would not accept money to cover a story of whatever nature and therefore the - the - if we call the event a base for a story.  They could not charge for it and therefore it would not be proper for TNA to pay the SABC. Chair you may recall that I mentioned earlier that in terms ofthe SABC News Policies and the Broadcasting Charter the SABC was allowed to go out and gather news anywhere and to whatever extent that it wanted to.  However the SABC News Department could not accept cash/money for doing so because that would effectively cause their dependence to be - how can I put it?      To be compromised yes.      Let’s put it this way Chair, the SABC worked on budgets so there would be a budget request through news and through rigorous process that would end up with Board approval for the allocation of the budget.  SABC news would receive its own budget, 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156from there, SABC News was free to do whatever it deemed fit and proper and pay for it with their budget.  Therefore, the Group Executive head of news together with his management team had it completely within their power to expand the monies that they expanded and to temper the spending of the monies if they felt that it was too high and it is important to state also that any interference on my part, or maybe let me say intervention on my part in this regard would have been viewed as interference as in me preventing news from doing its job.  Very, very fine line here, in the sense that as the Editor in Chief of the SABC could not go down to them and say you can’t do this, you can do thisand they would have to come to me to say we have a problem here, can you help us resolve it.  That’s the only way that I would get involved with the news department and none of that came to me.      Page 15?      For a period of 36 months.     “It is specifically recorded that the SABCshall broadcast two events per month and the SABC, shall atall times   have final editorial control”.      Oh okay, it’s a continuation from 7.1.20 and it begins with,“end at the top there and timeously pay all amounts due to any 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 sub-contractor in respect of any services rendered by that sub- contractor in terms of this agreement, if relevant.  SABC shallnot be held liable for payment of any amounts due to such sub- contractors under any circumstances whatsoever and any suchcontractor shall have no claim for same against the SABC”.      Yes.      No and Chair I believe that perhaps this was a caveat for the news department to have the flexibility to increase the broadcast to more than the two times per month and I would assume that their in writing possibly happened between them throughemail or phone calls, I’m not certain there.      I think this word was used quite loosely in the sense that earlier on we do mention that the relationship should not be construed as a partnership of any sorts.  This was just loosely  put as two  parties working together, therefore a party which is TNA a partywhich is SABC would then, I suppose, in this instance they were trying to emphasise the working together.      Yes.      It was mainly the Chief Operating Officer and this is acting with [indistinct]at the helm together with the GroupExecutive of News who would be Jimmy Matthews.      No I wouldn’t have a role to play once again with the independence of the news department being enshrined 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156completely.      Yes.      Page five?ADV THANDI NORMAN SC     Yes Chair.      On SABC2 on the morning live slot.      Yes it was.      Yes.      In this paragraph I’m stating that through the investigators from the Commission who came to me to discuss this matter, I found out that, in fact,  the outdoor broadcast had cost R20 326 000 over a few years and once again I do not have the exactdetail of how many years this was but it was over a few years and I would certainly request that the Commission requests a clear financial breakdown of these from the SABC.      As I mentioned earlier I could not interveneon that except to ask why there were so many suddenly and I was informed that they were critical.  More and more of the major players within Government were wanting to present their stories, not only Government, SOE’s as well were wanting to be given the opportunity to use the platform to inform the public of their work.      Yes.      Yes.      Come again?      On or about the 20 t h of February 2015.      Yes.      I really – at no stage during my tenure wasI informed or made aware of the fact that TNA Media was in fact charging rather handsome fees from the various State owned enterprises, I was never made aware.      I was never involved with the distribution of the newspapers at all, I was not aware of any contractual arrangement between the newspaper wing of TNA and the SABC and so I was quite surprised to find – shocked actually to find that the SABC had been paying for the newspapers to the amount of R930 873 and I found it very difficult to understand that because my understanding was that thenewspapers were being distributed to the SABC just on the basis of the relationship between the SABC and the TNA Media wing.  The TNA Media wing would carry stories about the TNA breakfast, so it made sense that certain newspapers would be distributed to the SABC so the SABC could see how they were being reported on and there was, as far 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156as I knew, there was no agreement for the exchange of money, so I was once again taken aback when I saw that the SABC was in fact buying the newspapers.      The newspapers had nothing to do with the broadcast contract at all, they were not included if there was any negotiation it had to have happened at Mr Motsweni’s level and probably Jimmy Matthews and I was never involved in that and I muststate that within the delegation authority framework and amount of this nature would not at all require permission from me for the expenditure to be incurred.      They were – I have this thick document which is the delegation of authority document, I’m going to try and see very quickly where this could be done.      Matters that would come to my approval would be spending against approved business plans for content acquisitioning or commissioning and those would be for scale code 110A which would be myself and scale code 110 which would be Motsweni and Mr T L Olivier’s level and those would be for amounts above R50million.  So there was a very clear staggered amounts approval framework which was quite categoric in how much who could sign for but I must also state Chair that in cases where there was goingto be a purchase order it had to go through and I would assume that there was a purchase order for the purchasing of these newspapers.      2011 up to?      Oh okay so it was for over seven years.      Chair I’m not quite sure whether they were delivered daily or as and when there was a specific mention of the SABC, I really am not certain of that, however, if they were being paid for then they must have been delivered daily.      I would assume.      The New Age.      Yes and in fact it would be put on my desk so I was aware…[intervenes].      No Chair I was not aware of the volumes but they would be put at the turnstiles, the entrance where the staff would go in and they could pick up a copy.      Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON     Yes Chair, if there was any payment that was being made during my time it was certainly concealed from me.      Yes Chair.      Well Chair there is, in television language what is called a barter deal which is where you get something back in 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156kind for whatever little bit that maybe has been done.  I assumed they were part of a barter deal, obviously not the quantum of the cost of the newspaper, obviously being miniscule compared to what was being paid by the SABC to be able to do – pay for this staff and the [indistinct] etcetera to be able to do the broadcasts.      Yes Chair.      Chair I must submit that, that is not one of the things that I worried about, that I concerned myself with because I did not think there was anything untoward for the delivery of the newspapers.      Well what I understood from what I was told was that they were being delivered for free.    I quite understand Chair. What I stated earlier was that this could be construed as a form of a butter deal where there is no money exchange but the newspapers would come with content about the breakfast shows.  Which should mean that the SABC would have the right to see what had been written up about the breakfast shows.  And that Chair I believe very strongly should never have been something that the SABC would pay for.  The SABC was already expending a lot of money to cover the broadcasts.  Getting the newspaper in return just so the SABC can see what has been covered,what was going on for those people – I mean a lot of the staff at the SABC would not be able to see the breakfasts themselves, the shows because they would be busy at that time.  But having the newspaper would kind of give them an indication of what was discussed.  And that was really from that perspective but I think perhaps the people who did decide to enter into this commercial contract would have to be interrogated as to why they did it.  Because it would have been literally adding money – your last pennies to a very wealthy person and that does not make sense to me.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  The – when I arrived at the SABC I think I have said it before there was an outpouring of adoration on Mr Motsoeneng.  There was a belief that he was doing an amazing job and that you know he was not being paid enough even as a Group Executivemember not as acting COO.  And there was a parity exercise that was being undertaken by the SABC through which people would be looked at from their skill code and then be given an increase if in terms of their skill code they were earning below par.  And that was really all that the increase was about.  So the Public Protector completely misunderstood that and she thought that he was given the increase as COO and he was not certainly not given the increase.  As the Chair may know SABC’s COO salaries are very high and that money that was added to his salary was nowhere near the salary of a COO.  And what was very sad for me was that in that misunderstanding there was noreal room for me to challenge that final finding.  I had responded to the draft finding and explained myself on that draft finding but somehow it was ignored.  Secondly if indeed I was to be disciplined for having raised his salary just so that he could be on the same level as other Group Executives I am quite sure that the board if it decided to embark 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156on a disciplinary process against me I am quite sure they would have thrown it out because this is a man that they were very happy with.  Ja and the other thing is that it was assumed that I had left the SABC because of the Public Protector Report it was certainly not because of that.  My discussion to leave the SABC began in October and that was a few months before the Public Report was – the Public Protector Report was released.  It was only released in February on the same month that in terms of my notice period my notice had come to an end.  So it was just a sheer coincidence that she released it at that time.  And yes I would have stood for – I would have stood up to thedisciplinary enquiry and had my name cleared there but it just did not make sense at that point when I was leaving.    No he was still acting COO.    He remained acting COO until I left.CHAIRPERSON   It was only after I was gone that he was…    Yes.    Oh yes Chair.    Human Resources.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    It went largely according to category.    The levels beneath management who belonged to the bargaining council their salaries were set in a verystraightforward manner through the bargaining council process and their increases were also determined through the bargaining council process.  But the levels from management and higher those would be subjected to scrutiny as to whether or not the individual was being paid appropriately.  And yes in many instances there would influence that 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156would come from how much the person was contributing to the organisation.  If they were very hardworking and – without doing a formal shall I say a very formal, very objective performance review organisation wide you had to rely on the manager saying this person is doing a good job and yes they are being underpaid let us look at their salary increase. Each one of them would bring a different motivation.  There had to be a motivation.  And on the basis of that motivation then HR would then recommend a salary increase.    Chair is quite right.  The – the salary increase was based on what people at that skill code were earning and he was far below them.  So he had to be brought up to – to match those 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156people.  There was no performance bonus payment approved during my period, during my time and I was very strict about that.  Based on the fact that we were still in a very precarious financial position.  Yes the SABC was in slight recovery but there were very clear terms of the government guarantee that the SABC had raised which National Treasury had approved.  And those terms were very categoric in stating what the SABC could or could not do with the money.  And I was – I was a stickler for sticking to those prescripts that were provided by National Treasury.  It would also have been responsible to try and give anybody a bonus when there was this massive recovery that theorganisation had to come out of.      I really do take your point Chair.  This came out from how the case was motivated and the almost overwhelming 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156push for him to get the salary increase and the push was confirmed by Doctor Ngubane so I am putting this as you know yes there was that legitimate reason which was to put him on par but on top of that there was the reasoning that he is also over and above the fact that he is underpaid he is also doing an excellent job.    Chair it was – the increase was made purely to bring him on par with people of that level.    Yes that is true Chair.    In a sense it is – it is true.    Look there were – there were some doubtsfrom other quarters.    Based on what later came out from the incumbent.    About whether or not he should have even been given a salary increase.  That was obviously based on people’s perceptions.    Because they had experienced him in that particular way.    The – what may be…    The position.    Yes.    Indeed Chair.    Thank you for that.  Indeed his position was 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156deserving of the increase.    Shoo I – I – I put in my letter of resignation I think it was in October and in fact at the board strategy session which was held on that particular day I do not have the exact date.    That was 2013.    Well that was because after – yes the 28February that was – that was my day.    It was my last day at SABC.    That I am certain of.     It was not 10%.    No I cannot remember the exact amount.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   There should be Chair there should be.    I think the HR Group Executive may be able 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156to provide the figures.    When he comes.    I am not sure where to find it Chair.    Page?    On the top – oh okay and it is page 1?    154.  Yes I see where it begins.    Yes.    Yes.    Parliament was totally misinformed and I am not sure what the reason was apart from probably trying to damage my reputation.  Parliament was given a figure of between R8 and R11 million and it was widely reported in the media reports and I was ridiculed when in fact it was totally untrue. That is not the amount that Ihad received.    Chair I received R4 221 179.22 which was 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156equivalent to twelve months of my gross cost to company at the – which was equivalent to the total remuneration that I was already earning at that time. Then I received a further R1 400 736.00 which was for the restraint of trade agreement which effectively barred me from being employed by an entity within the same industry.  And there was a further accrual of annual leave which was R395 652.51 it seems like a lot but I hardly ever took leave.    Yes it was before tax.    It was about R5.6     Chair it was a long time ago and there is a lot of stuff that I have buried.    About almost R6 million yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    The - the agreement was that I would be paid for just one year.    The agreement was that I would be paid forjust one year.  It - it was an amount that I suppose would be equivalent to what the CCMA would recommend to the entity or if - if an employee was leaving before completing their contract.  Something like that Chair.    Chair at that time there was a level of desperation in particular by the Chair of the Board for me to go because I had challenged a lot of her decisions very vigorously and she was - she was very angry with me.    There are board minutes …    That show how locked horns over the - the    Because I just did not agree with it …    At all.    Although I have not given them to the evidence leader …    Which were completely inappropriate …    But they - the Chair of the Board then decided that Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Olivier who were both acting intheir capacities incidentally should go ahead and sign that contract and she was very abrasive with me.    I had to take a week off - slightly less than a week off to take care of my granddaughter who was gravely ill.  So I took emergency leave …    And in that week while I was gone they then decided to meet with MultiChoice and quickly conclude the contract …    But the - the process was fundamentally flawed.    I did not agree with the process in the first place.    Of how they arrived at - at Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Olivier signing the contract but secondly there were clauses that were just totally improper …    That were included there.    Where we locked horns and it was really ugly.  It was very, very ugly.  The second instance was when the then Minister of Communications Mr Yunus Carrim was getting frustrated with there being no industry agreement on the - the set-top boxes that were going to be used for the digital transformation of the country and in terms of the digital migration policy of 2012 which was in force at that time it was important for those set-top boxes to have a - a control mechanism which was set to do a whole lot of things that would benefitthe public including the ability for the public to access messaging to connect to the internet and be able to do whatever they needed to do using the set-top boxes without even having to go and buy a - a computer and - and to me and to a whole lot of other people that was what expanding the knowledge, economy to the poor was about. 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156The poor needed to have access but it was impossible for them to - and - and the argument was that.  Well there is cellular telephone and how people access content via cellular.  It is extremely expensive.  Now those set-top boxes particularly for the (indistinct) were going to be given for free and if they had a set-top box which was encrypted and which could enable connectivity to a telephone line so it would have return path. Then you would have citizenry in the most far flung parts of this country.  As long as they had even an old black and white box who would be able to access Government documents.  Their children wouldbe able to access content for them to - to study.  It is a - the - the benefits were just enormous but all of that was - was thrown out when the MultiChoice Contract was entered into.    No.    No Chair.  Mr - Minister Carrim agreed completely with the digital migration policy as it was published in 2008.  He agreed with it and as I said so did a whole lot of us.  I am - I amalready originally trained as an educationist.  So for me I saw a massive benefits for the children of this country and the adults and anybody who needed to be informed. So he was in agreement with that but he was frustrated  because after the - the SABC had signed the MultiChoice Contract the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156SABC and the MultiChoice Contract effectively prescribed to the SABD that the SABC could not accede to the inclusion of encryption on the said topics and by doing that …    They basically threw out the entire plan that the SABC had and other industry players …    Who saw the benefit …    Of encryption.CHAIRPERSON   They threw it out.    Now Minister Carrim was caught between two - two parties who were not agreeing with - with each other.  The one party of which MultiChoice was part of was saying there should be no encryption.  There should be a simple set-top box.  After all people will eventually find these TV sets that would have these things built onto them and this has still not happened up to today. You still need a decoder box from MultiChoice in order to seetheir signal.  So I am not sure where they were coming from there.  The other argument was that cellular telephone penetration was - was very high and people could access data and - and whatever.  The third most ridiculous notion was that the SABC would willy-nilly switch off people using the encryption technology and that is absolutely not what it was 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156intended for. The SABC would never do that at least not under my watch if I was still there when this was launched.  Then you had on the other hand people who agreed with my perceptions with the views that were expressed by the late Minister Matsepe-Casaburri when she wrote the - the - she launched the …    The policy and many other Ministers who agreed with - with that approach.  So Minister Carrim was caughtbetween the two parties.  The one strong voice saying no, no.  The other strong voice saying yes …    And so he brought everybody together.    The - the Ms Tshabalala voice was that there should be no encryption.    I was on the other …    He was on the other side.    Yes.    We were on the same side.    His Deputy, his DG …    And other people.    Everybody was in agreement.    Digital migration.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.  In fact Chair she - she instructed Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Olivier to go ahead and sign the contract even though the contract had not been processed appropriately within the  It made - it makes a very clear pronouncement on this.  It says in page 2 of the applicable delegation of authority framework.    Paragraph 2.4.  It says   Because I was an encumbrance.    Yes, yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.  In fact attempts to push me out had been going on for quite a while.  I think at least three times there were rumours swirling around the organisation that I was going tobe suspended or was going to be fired and there were lots of lies that were being said about me.  The most ridiculous ones being that I was a shareholder at ETV. Now ETV together with - was - was on the side of the set-up box control - the encryption …    And therefore because I was saying yes encryption …    And we having industry discussions aroundthese matters.  They said I was a shareholder at ETV and my children - two children - were working for ETV and then people could go to that bottom pit of lies to tarnish my name.  So much was said.  I mean it was said I was lazy.  I was not doing my job etcetera and things just got to head and …    Yes Chair.    It was an absolute untruth.    There was never an attempt by my children to look for work at ETV.    There - there were further other reasons.  I locked horns many times …    With Mr Motsoeneng.    He undermined my authority.    Many, many times …    Why she would that.  There was absolutely no decorum …    And the reason was quite simply that Chair I was refusing to do things that were not according to policy.    I was refusing to do that …    And therefore they had to find a way to sully my name as far as possible.    I know for a fact that they canvassed the -the agreement of some top politicians.    That I should - I should go.    So at a point when I decided I was going to go was when this final - it was like a final push Chair when the lies came out about me and my children and ETV and - and all of that. That is when I realised that these people were capable of killing me because I just did not understand how anybody could have so much malice and having locked horns with the Chair we - we bothagreed that perhaps it was time that I should go and I drafted a memorandum to her stating that I think it was time for me to go and I hope I will be quickly compensated because I was being forced to leave my seat at the time when I was not ready to through their actions and by the time Chair - I think it is very important to note that - and this is 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156something that is never reported on. That under my leadership the SABC finances became extremely healthy.    I had - I had ensured that the advertising industry rebuilt their belief in the SABC and indeed they did.  So advertising money started coming into the SABC.  I made sure that all the leaking taps were closed.  By leaking taps I mean Chair opportunities to spend money wilfully for …    Yes Chair.  I did not write the memorandum myself.  She engaged the services of an external party …    Who drafted the separation agreement.    With that at all.    Yes.    The - the …    Yes indeed Chair.    I indicated that I was - I was intending to leave …    And however I would stick to my statutory obligation of …    Serving out notice for three months …    And the funny thing Chair is that towards theend of my probation period she wanted me to extend and stay until after the elections.    2014 was election year …    I had reached the end of my tether.    Yes Chair.    Together with …    The third party.    The third party is a well-known …    Lawyer who …    No.    Calculations.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  The CCMA would as - as …CHAIRPERSON   Ja.  The CCMA would as - almost a standard practice award one year.    Yes.    Then I accepted.    I had to claim compensation if I was not finishing my term would have been too paid out the remainder of my 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156contract …    Which was three years.    But I was not willing to engage in that - in that fight.    For the sake of mind …    Integrity.CHAIRPERSON   I thought well - you know - and - and also the fact that there was a - a restraint of trade.    It meant that my family and I would suffer …    For the period that I was under the restraint.  So it - it was just fair that …    I should be compensated some money for -for not being allowed to work within the industry …    That I have been in for …    At that point it was more than 20 years.    Yes Chair.  Indeed.    Certainly.    Yes.    Yes and I …    Started writing.    No, I do …    Yes ma’am.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Yes Chair.  Very, very strangely we had made thorough presentations to the board on the DDT position of the SABC which included the set-top box control and all the arguments regarding the benefits for the country.  Not for the SABC for the public and the board was happy and approved that policy position and on that basisMs Tshabalala then wrote and we co-signed that letter. Then suddenly I am not sure what the date - what the date is on that letter.  It is - it is very important to recognise the date because then suddenly she wrote a subsequent letter to Mr Carrim and I - I do not have a copy of that letter but I remember vividly and in that letter 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156she capitulated and said the SABC was not going to support the set-top box control.    Now what I cannot quite recall was how that was synchronised with the signing of the MultiChoice Contract.    I - I cannot quite recall that.  So it would be    The dates of the letter because then we can work it back to …    When the MultiChoice contract was signed.    Thank you.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   And yet vast amounts of money were paid for that.    And those Chair were set-top boxes without encryption.  So if there was this excitement about distributor set-top box without encryption why were they not distributed.  I do not understand.    Yes I have started working on it Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    We are indeed Chair, we are ready.      Chair before you, you will have two files, the first file being CC52C16.     Yes indeed so Chair.CHAIRPERSON     And the second one is CC25.      It is a small presentation file.      Chair today we have a witness ...(intervention)       No Chair we haven’t admitted CC25 as      Yes indeed, we can admit it now as – by the Chair’s direction.      I shouldn’t Chair.      Thank you Chair, today’s witness is Mr Krige, he forms part of the well-known SABC 8, just to bring to the Chair’s attention that Mr Krige has a flight to catch later this afternoon, so if we have not finished with Mr Krige’s evidence by four o’clock if the Chair would just approve for us just to go just a little bit after fouro’clock, that would be much appreciated.      Yes, may the witness be sworn in?      Thank you Chair.  Mr Krige can you 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156please turn, if you have not over already to folder CC12 in the file, on page one what document is that?  On the first page, you will see the page numbers are written in red on your top right hand corner      And will you please turn to page 9 of that document.      Is that your signature in the middle of the page?      Mr Krige you have also stated that you do want to make a correction in your affidavit?      Thank you.        Yes Chair, I have already had a conversation with Mr Krige about that.      Thank you Chair.  Other than that Mr 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156Krige everything is true and correct on the affidavit?    Mr Krige where are you currently employed?    And Mr Krige before your retirement on the 31 s t of May where were you, how long were employed by the SABC, just give us just a short background of your career?    And in paragraph 7 you highlight the start of the editorial interference.    From your line managers, can you talk about you know when this editorial interference commenced?    Mr Krige that directive, that instruction that you had received not to broadcast the EFF was that in line with the    Thank you.  Mr Krige let’s jump onto paragraph 12 of your statement where you highlight a second incident of an editorial interference with the SABC announcing that they were not going to cover any protest action.    Chair a witness that we have allocated for Friday would be able to talk to this report in detail.  Going back to paragraph 12 Mr Krige you highlighted a media statement issued by theSABC saying they were not going to cover any protest action.    Can you talk to this, can you give us the foundational phases to you know why this began and you know how the editorial interference how was it implemented then?    Sorry Mr Krige, can you just identify who Foete is, because there are ...(intervention)     Mr Krige can we jump onto paragraph 15 where you highlight a pre-election workshop, can you just shortly just explain what is the purpose of a pre-election workshop, you know who    Okay, and in this election you  highlight that Mr Motsoeneng had made certain statements which you hadrecorded in notes.    In handwriting notes, in handwritten notes.    And the second set would be on page 79.  Mr Krige ...(intervention)     No Chair I did not, these were just to indicate that these were actually the handwritten notes from thatmeeting.    I am just going to head back into the paragraph because it will be quite difficult to look at those handwritten notes, but he has captured them in his main statement, in his main affidavit.    His statement, and that would be paragraph 16 on page 6.    It is not the beginning, it’s under folder 12, page 6. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Jakob Daniel Krige.       No.       I truly affirm.         Ja, it is my affidavit.       Yes.       Yes that is my signature.ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL      Ja.       Ja, on point number 14 there was a mistake slipping in saying that Mr Matthews is the Chief Financial Officer but he in fact was the Acting Chief Executive Officer.    16    Ja.    It - it was a bit of both.  What I did Ijotted down certain words that he was saying and then directly after that I - I typed it out as - as stated here in this affidavit.    Huh-uh.    Mr Motsoeneng spoke to us in two different - at two different occasions.  The gist of it was that the    I am not sure about what the other people’s reaction was.  We were so used to what we call (indistinct) speak at that stage that he was just - we thought he was just blabbering on.  At that stage what I did I messaged a - a colleague of mine back at Auckland Park asking to go through our internet which - where the Editorial Policy is displayed and to see which policy the SAB - the SABC is using and there was no - no sign of the 2016 or the newEditorial Policy. It was still the old 2004 policy.  So I was puzzled.  The people did not show a lot of reaction.  There were no one questioning the fact that - that he said that but he also left directly after that - Mr Motsoeneng left and we - there was no time to discuss this - these instructions.    Ja.  You know how workshops work.  You sit there and you listen and you make notes and afterwards everyone isdoing anyway their own things - you know- and as I said at that stage it was very confusing within the newsroom especially after 26 May statement.  We did not know what to do.  We did not know to react because you cannot cover a protest or broadcast protest. You still covering it but do not - do not - you do not broadcast 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156it.  Do you send out a team of reporters to a scene but if there is violence then you - you take them back to the office.  So everything was very confusing at that stage and there was not a lot of guidance from - from someone like Mr Jimi Matthews who was at that stage the - well according to us the Editor in Chief. He just said he derives his oxygen from the newsroom and there is not a lot of oxygen at the 28 t h Floor where he - where his offices was and he said he was not going to give any editorial guidance.  So he left it to Mr Motsoeneng to give us editorial guidance.    Hm.    There - there was a recording made by people who were there but this comes from my notes and it also formed part of an affidavit that we - we sent into the Constitutional Court …    In 2016.CHAIRPERSON   Ja.    Ja.  What happened after the - the statement to ban violent protest on 26 May?  There was an outcry from all over the country from the media and especially the NGOs and there was a protest march planned to three of the SABC’s offices and on the morning on 20 June we - I participated in a line talk - daily line talk where the Acting Head of News Mr Simon Tebele gave instructions toremove three of the stories from our top story list. To explain we have a diary every day and there is a list of top stories and then there is a diary of each and every region. So as an editor seated in Johannesburg I can have a look at the top - top stories and then look at all the regions and see all the promised stories that should arrive before the end of the day or for the next morning’s shown. So it gives you an indication of what to expect and the top stories are the most important stories and we try every program and news bulletin - bulletin to try to focus on those stories.  So that morning Mr Simon Tebele removed three of the stories.  It was Y2K. The right to know campaign that organised marches to the SABC to complain against the - the policy of not showing violence - violent protest ja and at that stage the Economics Editor Ms Thandeka Gqubule questioned Mr Tebele’s decision and then he explained to her that it - it must be removed because it is - it is about us - the SABC and I 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156understand it that that meeting on the 27 t h Floor where they said we cannot we criticise the SABC. We cannot allow people to criticise the SABC and I made that connection at that stage.  So they removed those stories because it was negative or it was about the SABC and that whole meeting was recorded by my colleague Suna Venter which we later transcribed and it is or what you see here is - is part of that transcription where Mr Tebele said those stories are out as discussed earlier. Then Thandeka explained that we - she - she does not want    Ja.  At the SABC we always have the - the problem as part of one of the SOEs and also as part of the media.  It is - it was always difficult to - to report on yourself or what happened in your own - in your own company.  So I can understand from certain people’s point of view that you do not - there is a lot of companies thatforbid people to talk about their own company but in our - in our situation we were also part of the media and according to me we had - if there is anything negative about the SABC we have to put it on - out there. Get people to react.  Give the - the SABC the right to respond 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156and report it as - as our Editorial Policy expects from us.  We cannot - we are not in a position - as soon as - there is 22 million people in the country that there only source of news is the SABC.  They cannot afford newspapers.  They cannot afford DSTV.  So it is very important for the SABC to fulfil that role of - of giving news to each and everyone in this country and we cannot ignore something like that.    No.  His only reason was - was it is - it isabout us.  That was his only reason and then we continued with the - the line talk.  There was no further discussion allowed.    Ja.  What happened then we went to the Labour Court on 18 July.  There was a - a disciplinary hearing.  I think Ms Krivani Pillay will - will explain that what happened there.  There was a - they tried to - to conduct a disciplinary - disciplinary hearing but it was never concluded and then we were waiting for a next date to appear and before we appeared we were all dismissed.  I wasdismissed with - along with seven other colleagues.    What happened was the initial disciplinary 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156hearing there - there was a planned meeting to go to the Constitutional Court on the Friday.  We called it Black Friday and we were supposed - me, Thandeka and Suna - were supposed to lead the - the march to the - to the Constitutional Court and 23 hours earlier before that we - I received a phone call from - from the Disciplinary Committee and telling me that I must be at the disciplinary hearing the same morning as the - as the march to the - to the Constitutional Court which was a breach of their own Disciplinary Code because you need to give someone at least 24 hours’ notice. You must remember at that stage we were locked out of theSABC and we had not access to our computers, to any files, to anything that you could use in a disciplinary - during a disciplinary hearing to defend yourself.    In valid.    Ja.    Ja.  As if we were never dismissed, ja.ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE   I am on page 18, yes.    He is only half right.  My paragraph nine refers to something that happened in 2014.    When - when Mr Motsoeneng was - no.  He was CEO but according to the Editorial Policy at that stage the Editor in Chief was - was the CEO and I think it was Ms Lulama Mokhobo …    Who testified earlier at that stage.    So it is wrong of him to say that Mr -Mr Motsoeneng was in fact the de facto news boss in 2014.    Maybe he knew something that I - that I did not know at that stage but     However the - the later part of that is correct.  That in 2016 by - at that stage Mr Motsoeneng was already the Editor in Chief.    Ja.  That is an easy way out.  It is one of the - the most common excuses if - if a man differs with a woman.  It is either sexist and if she is Black then - then it is racist. He is playing the - the man and not the ball.  The issue here was an instruction from 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156my superior - my line manager that we cannot report on any EFF activities.  That is the issue. Not - not the fact that I am sometimes confrontational.  Of course in a - in a newsroom it is a robust environment and sometimes we are confrontational and it does not matter if it is a man or a woman or Black or - or Coloured.  It is not the issue.  That is not the issue.  The issue is was the instruction that Sebonelo gave me lawful or not but he tries to avoid it by using - you know - sexist or a racist implication.    Well I read Mr Joe Thloloe’s report and itwas definite that him - he, Sebonelo and Simon Tebele was giving instructions via certain people to the newsroom.  So if that is not fingered.  I am not sure what - what he means.  Maybe I made the wrong deduction.  We can look - look at it when we discuss the Joe Thloloe report and the implications of that.    Ja, this is very sad that the newsroom was not protected at that stage.  If - if Mr Jimi Matthews said that - that Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng had the final say about news and it is maybe just an indication of what - what was going on in the newsroom?  You mustremember at that stage we were not informed that the CEO is not the de facto head of - of news or the Editor in Chief. At that stage the SABC had not told anyone as far as I know that - that there was a change in the Editorial Policy but ja.  He resigned.  That I agree with before the decision to dismiss but there 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156was no one not one line manager not one person in the SABC that stood up and defended any - any of the dismissals or any - any of the suspensions.  Not one and he was part of that.    Ja.ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE   It is Chair, ja.    Maybe just one thing and referring back toMr Matthews’ argument or affidavit is that - that people must understand that the newsroom at that stage there was a toxic fear.  There was uncertainty.  We - there was no protection from anyone.  Not Mr Matthews.  Not Mr Tebele. Not Mr Motsoeneng and it was a very, very difficult situation to work - work in and I think if I can just mention what happened yesterday with Ms Phathiswa Magopeni the new Head of News.  That is - that is the sort of leadership that we need in a newsroom and you need a newsroom that is bulletproof.  That is free from interference where you can do your job as any other journalist should do and thatdid not happen during 2016.  That is all I want to say.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja.     I retired on the 31 s t of May from the SABC. ADV MPHO     Say again?CHAIRPERSON    Ja, on the 31 s t of May I retired.     I have been employed 1990 at the SABC, five years as a field reporter, seven years as a senior producer and then the last 15 years I was the Executive Producer of the Current     Ja, I was a part of a group called by the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156media the SABC 8 after we have been dismissed by the SABC in 2016 and as far as I understand I was approached to explain the process and what happened at that stage.     Yes.     Yes, there was always a sort of editorial interference but one of the most profound instances was on 5 t hFebruary 2014 when the Acting Head of News at that stage Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane, came into my office and informed me that we could not report on any of the activities of the EFF, the Economic Freedom Front party at that stage, and when I asked her why she said it was an order from the 27 t h floor, and my understanding was that it was coming from the former CEO Mr Motshlale Motsoeneng, which was strange because he was not the editor in chief and he had nothing to do with news, so I couldn’t understand the instruction and I explained to her that it was not possible to ignore any political party, it was just before an election period and she said we had no choice because it was a directive fromthe top and I told her that we will go on broadcasting news and not ignore the EFF.  Ten minutes later I received a call from the Secretary of Mr Jimi Matthews who was the former Head of News at that stage, the Head of News at that stage, he requested me to come to his office, 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156where in the presence of Ms Ditlhakanyane, gave me a speech about not conforming to the rest of the SABC and accused my team of thinking that they were an island on their own.  He proceeded to tell me that I have to obey all instructions from Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane on which I responded that if she gives me instruction I will listen to it, and evaluate it and then act accordingly, it depends on what the instruction is.  Ja, that was what happened there.  What happened also was that on the same year in December Mr Motsoeneng appointed Ms Ditlhakanyane in a permanent position as     Ja, that comes later ja.     Ja, what happened was that there was an outcry in the media after it became known that the SABC did not want to broadcast any EFF stories, and then the next day or the next – within two days the SABC put out a statement denying that there wasany instruction to that effect.  So then we carried on with coverage of the EFF.     We planned to do that and we did that 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156during our midday program, we had an interview with the EFF which we broadcast.    Ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja, it was just completely wrong, there was no way that you can ignore a political party in any country or any news for that matter that comes to your attention.     No he did not explain that instruction, the only thing that he said that I must listen to my line managers in that sense the Acting Head of News and that I should listen and obey all their instructions but he did not give me the time, the opportunity to 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156discuss that specific instruction?     Ja, ja.     Ja, Ditlhakanyane ja.     Ja, that’s right.     That’s correct, at the SABC and according to our editorial policy the decision making stops at the Executive Producer and that was my position, it is only when you are uncertain of certain decisions that you must make or when there is a lotof money involved to do a trip or whatever that you would see the upwards referral route, then you will go to your superior or your next line manager and discuss it with her, if you are uncertain of the content of certain issues then you will do that, but usually the buck stops at the Executive Producer and anything from outside we would deem as 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156interference into your programs.     Her instruction ja.    No consequences as I said shortly after that the SABC put out a statement which of course ...(intervention)      Ja, ...(intervention)      Ja,, I was just referring to the fact that later that year Mr Motsoeneng appointed Ms Ditlhakanyane in the permanent position of Head of Radio News, Mr Matthews was appointed 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156as the GE of News and Current Affairs while another employee, Ms Nonthando Maseko became the Head of Television News, the announcement was made on the same day and if – and later in 2019 when Mr Joe Slovo was – a report was released all three of them were fingered as part of people that was part of giving instructions to the News Room, I think it was just with making that point.     Ja.     The SABC released a press – sent out a press release on the 26 t h of May 2016 where they banned all coverage of violent protest action.  Now it was very strange to us and also to the media outside because that’s clearly a form of censorship, so on the 30 t h of May we invited three guests to our show in the morning todiscuss this development, it was Tim du Plessis who was from Media 24, Professor Frans Kruger who was from Wits University and Mr Thladi Motsoeneng who at first he declined, he did not arrive at the studio.  So we had a discussion on this policy which was clearly not editorially sound, it was not Constitutionally sound, you cannot withhold the 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156information from the people, if you look at the BCSA, if you look at ICASA’s regulations and also at our own editorial policy ,it is totally out of line.So we had a discussion and the next morning, the 31 s t of May, we conducted a studio interview with Mr Motsoeneng, who was accompanied by Mr Anton Heunis who was his sort of – I don’t know what he was, he was never introduced, but he sat in the studio maybe because he could understand Afrikaans, and afterwards there was a debate between me and Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Heunis regarding the content of the previous day’s interview and I told them we had aproblem as journalists to read about certain policy or issues in the media and no one within the SABC ever communicated the directive directly to us and then I was issued up to the 27 t h floor, where I was joined by Mr Heunis, the Acting Head of News, Mr Simon Thebele, Mr Matthews, Jimi Mathews, who was the Acting Chief Executive Officer at that stage, Ms Ditlhakanyane, and a colleague Ms Kravani Pillay who was the Executive Producer of SAFM at that stage, and what happened there was that each one of the people made turns to explain certain things.  I took notes of it which I typed afterwards, if the Chair wants I     Mr Motsoeneng started in saying we are cleaning up the organisation people are doing their own stuff.  There are many journalists outside that want to work for the SABC, the environment outside is bad.  And he continued saying no person is 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156independent, the SABC is independent, this is a new SABC, you must adapt or find a job somewhere else.Then he said that Tim du Plessis was from a rival organisation, and we cannot allow people from outside to say anything negative about the SABC, and he also accused us that we asked Frans Kruger leading questions during the interview and then he switched over to something that my colleague, Kravani Pillay, will later explain when she testifies, about Editors Forum, which was one of the programmes that must go, and then Anton Heunis was the advisor, sort of advisor for Mr Motsoeneng, said I am an RSG listener, I know I am not a journalist butyou misunderstand editorial freedom and that we are asking leading questions.And then he asked me why ...(intervention)      RSG is the Afrikaans Public Broadcasting station on the SABC bouquet, have got a radio station for each and every language so RSG ...(intervention)      Ja, it’s a radio station, like SAFM is for     Ja, for the different radio stations, so RSG is the Afrikaans radio Station.     Radio Sonder Grense.     So then Anton Heunis asked me why didn’t we do an insert about that show that the presence of cameras on unrest scenes leads to violence, and ...(intervention)      Foete, okay Foete was my nickname, that is not my real birth name.     It comes from Maphuta when I was asmall boy sir.     Ja, that is correct Chair.     And then he asked us why didn’t we use research to show that the President (indistinct) duly to violence and then I asked him, but I said to him but if you liaise with your auditors before hand and if you told us that you were going to give this instruction then we would have used the research that you based yourinstruction on and then Mr Motsoeneng said but I don’t believe in research.  He said you must defend the organisation, no journalist is independent, the CEO has a final responsibility for news, which was also strange to me because the CEO has got nothing to do with news.  The COO as the Chief Operating Officer which deals with operations 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156and the CEO is the editor in chief, it was only shortly after that that we realised that Mr Motsoeneng changed the editorial policy and it was signed off in February, three months earlier, which made him the de facto Head of News.     But we didn’t know that, it was never communicated, it only came later.     At that stage Motshlade turned to the Acting Head of News with Mr Simon Thebele and he said Simon if 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156people do not adhere get rid of them, we cannot have people who question management, this is the last time we have a meeting of this kind, from now on you handle things on your level, and then Mr Matthews the only thing he said it is cold outside, if you don’t like it you can go, you have two choices, the door or the window.  And that was about it in that meeting.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, it is quite difficult. 
RASIVHETSHEL:And before being employed ...(intervention)  
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Krige am I correct in saying this is an extraction from what Mr Motsoeneng was saying?    And I have noted that you have put this complete paragraph in quotes.  Is this what - word for word as to what Mr Motsoeneng was saying or was it just - you know - were you paraphrasing?  Can you just explain?    Okay.  Can you just read out 16.1?  What was …    Stated by Mr Motsoeneng?    And - Mr Krige and what was the response to these statements that Mr Motsoeneng were saying?  I mean you have a room full of editors and people in the profession who are 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156very knowledgeable about editorial policies and how a broadcasting should work.What was the response to his statements - Mr Motsoeneng’s statements?    So there was no pursuing what he had said at the time.  Just - everybody just left it in the air?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Krige there has 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156been evidence of potential purging that had happened at the SABC and you highlight in paragraph 17 that you - you yourself became a victim of this purging at the SABC.  Can you just elaborate on how that came to be about - how that came along?    Mr Krige let us just go back.  The removal of these three stories were against the Editorial Policy.  Is that correct?    And did Mr Tebele give any justifiable reasons that are in line with the Editorial Policy as to why these three stories should not be aired?    And subsequent to that encounter about the removal of these three stories was that when you were dismissed?    So from the time from the disciplinary hearing to your dismissal - if - if I am correct that is less than 24 hours?    And the Labour Court found your dismissals were …    Not lawful - in valid …    And you were reinstated thereafter?    Indeed so Chair.    Yes Chair.    Mr Krige are you there on page 18?    Paragraph 13 he states that   Indeed so Chair.    The next paragraph   Okay.  Responding to your paragraphs and 11 of your affidavit.  It reads   Thank you Mr Krige.  Chair just to go to the information about the transcripts.  We do have a recording of the meeting that Mr Krige did highlight but however that recording from what I have been informed is not clear enough.  However if the Chair wants to have a listen to it we can provide the Chair with that recording.  However you know I have been told by the tech - by …    No the - it has not - there has not - it is for - it is for what is said in Mr Krige’s statement.  There has not been any dispute of the authenticity or …    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    And in - well paragraphs 24 to 25 04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156speaks about the transcriber - how - how these were transcribed in your affidavit and so forth and you did hand in a recording to the investigators.  However as we relayed it was not clear enough for us to play but it is a true reflection of what is stated in your affidavit?    And that would conclude the end of Mr Krige’s affidavit as well.  Mr Krige if there is anything that you would like to add on top of - if there is anything that you feel that we have not relayed but we have come to the end of your - of your affidavit.    Chair just to bring the Chair’s attention to - we do have a transcribed - a transcription of that recording.  It is on page 121 of CC12.    And that would conclude the evidence of Mr Krige.    Yes Chair.  10 o’clock.
