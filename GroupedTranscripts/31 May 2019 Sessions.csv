CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Are you ready?    Okay let us proceed.    I have got Volume 13 it is page 912?    Yes I have got it.    Ja no that is fine.  It may prove significant, it might not prove significant but it might be helpful to try and trace where it got used for the first time and one can take it from there.  But the other questions that I would want you to deal with at some stage before you finish your evidence is whether the use of the word ‘relocation’ may have – it may have been simply the use of a wrong term but other than that everybody understood what was happening.  In other words was it just the use of a wrong word – incorrect word or were there – was there some motive to choosing to use that word because for example that might seem on the face of it to justify charging certain costs.  You understand?    Yes.  Okay alright.  So you do not have to deal with that now you can deal with it at some – at some stage before you finish your evidence and if it is something that you are not able to say anything you just tell me.    Yes.    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Ja and in that regard it may be that the documentation you look at for that purpose if the documentation that you can look at is limited in the sense that maybe you cannot look at documentation that other witnesses used then we would want those witnesses also to do the same.  But if you are able to have a look at everything that would be fine.    Okay.    And that is the one starting at 9135?    Thank you.    I am sorry, I am sorry.  If you are able to tell me during this time when Mr Gama was acting Group Chief Executive was that the time when Mr Brian Molefe had left Transnet or was he just away temporarily?    Okay thank you.  And Mr Nair was acting in the position in which – in the position that Mr Gama had occupied before when Mr Molefe was there?    Okay thank you.  You may proceed.    Is there a good chance that this is the first time that this word relocation is being used in a memorandum at this high level?  Or you might not be able to say?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was used as well.    Okay.    Okay.  Because it might also be important to see when did senior people within the – within [indistinct] start using the same terminology.    Okay.    Thanks for – for reminding me of that full name of that acronym because there are so many of these acronyms one gets confused sometimes.    Yes okay.    I am sorry let me interrupt you.  Do you understand what – which has been absorbed means there?    You do not?    Okay alright thank you.  Continue.    So the memorandum was compiled by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe who signed.  It was recommended by the – recommended by Mr Ravi Nair acting Chief Executive Transnet Freight Rail.    It was signed by him on 22 July 2015.    It was also recommended by Mr Ndphiwe Silinga Group Executive Legal and Compliance and signed on 22 July 2015    It was recommended by Mr Anoj Singh Group Chief Financial Officer on 22 July 2015.    It was recommended by Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani on the same date and signed on the same date as well as by Mr Garry Pita and then the following day it was signed by – approved and signed by Mr Gama in his capacity as acting Group Chief Executive of Transnet?    Well I do not know whether you have picked up something that I cannot see or have not been able to see in this memorandum.  This memorandum seeks approval that a very large amount of money what R647 000,00 be approved for…    Million yes.  Million be approved to be paid for what is called relocation costs but I cannot see anything in the memorandum where those who Ms Mdletshe and those who recommend and ultimately Mr Gama who approves which says why is this amount a reasonable amount to spend on this so called relocation.  All I can see is the background and the fact that the amount falls within what was budgeted for under contingencies.  But the fact that there is budget for an item is not justification for paying a certain amount for that item.  You must still check whether that amount is justifiable.  I have not seen that here on this memorandum so I wonder whether you have seen that?    Hm.  So approval …    Thank you.  The – that this amount be spent on the so called relocation is recommended by various senior people and approved by the acting Group Chief Executive without any of them asking this very critical question would we be spending – would we be justified to spend so much money on this relocation – so called relocation?  How is this amount justifiable?  Why is it R647 million and not R100 million?  Why is it not R50 million?  And nowhere here in this memorandum is – is that amount of R9 million that was first given by CNR reflected...    To say that is where we coming from initially these costs were estimated at R9 million but now we are talking about R6 hundred and something million rand.  So that the full picture is shown.  That is not mentioned.    Now in your investigation did you find that Transnet and maybe the previous witnesses would have dealt with this I just cannot remember now – did we have proof that Transnet did receive that estimate of R9 million or acknowledged having received it and responded to it in one way or another that was made initially?    So certainly it was received by Transnet?    Hm – but were you able – were you only able to tell that Supply Chain Management received it but you did not find any evidence that other people in Transnet the GCEO, Mr Gama, Mr Molefe, Mr Pita, Mr Anoj Singh did you come across anything that suggested that they at least knew of this amount at some stage or another?    Yes.    The R9 million?    Yes.    Oh.    Yes and you have not come across – have you come across anything that shows that the Board was told of this R9 million quotation?    You have not found anything?    Okay because it is important to find out to establish that Transnet received this quotation of R9 million for this cost.  It is important to establish what their reaction was to it because that becomes quite important for them to justify how they were reacting to offers of hundreds of millions of Rand for something that they would have known at some stage produced a quotation of R9 million and I think from what Mr Mnyandu said even with that R9 million maybe should – should have been lower – you know - I think.  So - so it is very important to connect all of these things.  Who was aware of this R9 million quotation?  What did they do about it?  How do they justify – how do they justify approving R600-and something million afterwards?  Where is the interrogation of these amounts that they were obliged to undertake on behalf of Transnet in order to protect Transnet’s interest and the taxpayers money.    Okay.    No, no that is – that is understandable and – and I accept that it is not all the questions that I might think of or Ms Sello might think of that you and your team may have thought of and not all the questions that we think of are questions that people watching from their homes can think of.  There will always be questions that somebody else thinks of that you might not have thought of and that on its own and depending on the question - on the nature of the question – and what your task was and what you had before you – you know – there might be no blame – you know.  So obviously there may be certain questions that are too obvious so that if you do not ask them people say but what was he doing if he did not ask this question.  So – so – but at this stage I – I understand – you know.  I understand that there are certain questions that you may not have asked but of course there are some that even if a witness is hostile if they are important you have to ask and if they do not answer that is – and you have no power over them – just record that they did not want to answer but …    Yes.  No, no that is fine.  So we might have to – to look at all of these things to really establish who knew what in – you knew about this …    R9 million quotation and later got to know about over R600 million for the same thing …    And why was the R9 million not accepted but as Mr Mnyandu implies even that R9 million should not have just been accepted.  They should interrogate everything that has got cost implications for – for Transnet and for the taxpayers.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No thanks and I do not know if we asked Mr Gonsalves but we need to know whether from his side he knows any reaction that may have come from one or other official from Transnet in regard to it.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  That is fine, thank you.    Yes.    Just one second please.    Okay, alright.    Where – where are we – which page are we going to …    And just – just tell me again what the question was.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Yes.  I have got it thank you.    I guess you are – you are answering it by compounding it.    Hm.    Or rather latest?    Refer to our latest.    As opposed to last.    Hm.    Or described.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    But …    Oh, ja.    I think you made the point that the memorandum that you were reading talks about a certain discount.  Is that right?    Discount which you say cannot be found in this letter from BT.  Is that right?    In terms of the amounts once they talk about different figures that should affect the amounts.  Does it affect the amounts – the final amount or does it not affect – I just – did not - have not looked at it.  The amounts that they talk about in – in the memorandum in regard to BT compared to the amount BT talks about in this letter where they do not mention this other discount that the memorandum talks about.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    But you did not do the exercise of – of establishing – establishing exactly what the amount would be the real amount if …    Yes, yes.    Okay.  So I think it would be important to – for somebody to do it if we have not done it also.    Ja, it is an arithmetic exercise.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  That is what I am talking about, ja.    Ja.    Ja what I’m looking at is to see whether there may have been some genuine errors somewhere by somebody or whether there is much more to it.    Thank you.    Before we do that, what it does mean is that when you put the two amounts approved for both BT and CNR then you have about what, 1,4billion?    So – or is it just under 1.3?    Ja, okay alright, for the relocation – for the so-called relocation costs.    Ja, now before we proceed let me ask this question.  When you look at both memoranda, the one from CNR and the one from BT, they appear to say, look, this money that we are asking you to approve has already been – or falls under contingencies, contingencies that have already been approved, so it’s really not a problem, you know, just approve, okay and it looks like, then Mr Gama is satisfied and then approves.  So now, since we know that from the memoranda that was sent to him, both in regard to BT and in regard to CNR, did not really include motivation by the compiler of the memoranda as to why those amounts were acceptable.  The question would be, whether, when contingencies were approved there was anything that related, specifically to these so-called – this so-called relocation or whether contingencies were simply approved on the general basis, whatever contingencies may come up, they should be taken care of under this amount we’ve put aside for four comma something billion rand as I recall.  So is that something that your team looked at as to see whether one can say, look the approval of the contingencies, the information that was before those who approved contingencies was such that there was no need when this request was made, to interrogate this issue more because it had already been dealt with, is that something you looked at?    One would really expect them to interrogate these issues but I’m just trying to see  what kind of possible justification they might have because it’s a lot of money and you expect that they – any memoranda that seeks to say such big amounts must be approved would deal with why it’s acceptable to pay in the first place and why it’s acceptable to pay the particular amount in the second place, how is that amount made up, what are the items, you know, and that’s lacking in both memoranda, so – ja, okay.    Yes, yes – no we’ll have to hear from them it’s a lot of money and as Mr Mnyandu says you don’t expect people to say, look there is budget for it so we can just pay.    Ja okay.    So your investigation did not find anything suggesting that the high value team report that he said should be made available to CAE, namely the Chief Audit Executive, you found no evidence that it was made available to the Chief Audit Executive?    Yes, did you ask the Chief – the particular Chief or did the Executive whether she – is it a she?    She ever received it?    Okay when and where do they say that, is that something we have just dealt with or is it one of the things we didn’t read in relation to this letter to the date of this signature by Mr Gama, when was this, when they said this?    Yes.    Yes this is just – just – this is a memo from Transnet Internal Audit addressed to Mr Siyabonga Gama, Group Chief Executive and what date – there’s no date given on the first page, what date was it…(intervention).    7 June 2017, there is a stamp on the right-hand side, on the left-hand side it’s…(intervention).    Oh so it was received by the office of the Group Chief Executive, which would have been Mr Gama at that time.    Okay so now we know that’s June 2017 and – that’s June 7, so he is making this note the following day?    He might or might not have seen it yet, isn’t it?     He might or might not have seen it yet.  What do you say, if it arrived the previous day in his office and he signs the following – he signs this memo the following day we don’t know whether he had – it had reached him or am I missing something?    Oh this is the memorandum he’s commenting on?    Okay in a letter to – on 23 July reference is made to the fact that the HVT report is being finalised, I would like that the HVT report is produced, is this the HVT report?    In his note that we’re talking about after – below his signature, he talks about a letter to himself, as you have told us, which is dated 23 July, this is not this note at 9148/9149 hey?    HVT negotiations for Durban relocation, yes, CNR consortium and BT, Bombardier, yes for your approval/signature, comments.  You might be able to read that better, that handwriting AD Thomas/ Gary Pita, kindly ensure that all information that was required for the HVT report is produced or be produced – is made available to the CAE in order for the HVT to finalise its report.  So who is writing there because that is addressed to Mr Gama isn’t it?    But when you go to his note on page 9152 he seems to repeat that.     Is that why you say he’s commenting on it?    But the letter of 23 July is some other letter?    Oh okay, so – and those were signed on the 22 n d we might just have made a mistake by saying 23 instead of 22.    Oh he signed on the 23 r d so that’s maybe the reason why he used the 23 r d.    Okay so what do you make of his – you were making a certain point about is note below his signature at 9152, that is what triggered my questions, yes there was a point you were making.    It was strange that he made this note.    Ja just repeat that point.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh now I see the point you are making, you were saying – you were saying how could he be talking about the production of that report because he had just been told in that memo that TIA cannot – could not produce anything because of their limited involvement.    Okay, thank you.    No we can continue.    Well you have said something about invoices and I was still to ask whether apart from the fact that the two entities gave their quotations and there was – there were terms of payments that they put forward which Transnet agreed to payment ultimately when it was done was it done on the basis of any invoices and supporting documents and so on?  Here I have in mind that if you have had to buy some material which are for this so called relocation you can produce what you have spent on them?    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Okay no that is fine.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay thank you.    Maybe it might be convenient that I ask you questions in relation to what we have just dealt with before you proceed.    So in relation to this – the use of relocation from what you are saying it would seem to me and I would like your comment it would seem to me that a relocation may have been just a wrong term to use but there would be legitimacy to any extra costs that may have to be discussed and negotiated that may have had to be discussed and negotiated between Transnet on the one hand and CNR on the other and between Transnet on the one hand and BT on the other arising from the fact that Transnet said you are now going to have to do this job from Durban and not from Gauteng.  It seems that to the extent that that would give rise to certain costs there would be nothing wrong in principle in the idea that there will be – there would be additional costs.  What would remain is whether those costs are reasonable and whether procedures processes are followed that are supposed to be followed before those costs are approved and paid.  Does that accord with your understanding?    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No I think we are on the same – on the same page.  What I am saying – talking to the principle.  So you still have to justify the cost but in principle if the agreement was you will operate from here and then later on there is a decision to say no you have to operate from somewhere else if principle there is no problem with there being a difference in price or there being a possibility of higher costs – more costs – extra costs but they must still be justified.  If you are being moved from Pretoria to Johannesburg the cost might be minimal or maybe there might not be any.  But if you are being moved from a place that is closer to one that is much further there may be more costs but each item of cost must be justified.  I think that – that is what you probably are saying as well?    Yes.      Yes.    Yes the principle that there could be extra costs has no problem.    The question is whether those costs if they do arise are justifiable.    Ja okay alright.    I think I know what your answer should be.  Your answer – your answer has to be when you put in your bid for that you will say well if it is in Koedoespoort this is what the cost will be.  Since you have not mentioned what other place in South Africa I can only quote once I know which other place.      No it is not a change of place but in terms of course it makes it – it may make a difference.    Ja.    In a decrease.    Ja but you only know whether it is an increase or a decrease once you know where?    Ja, ja.    Did I guess your answer correctly?    Okay.    Well did you establish who at Transnet got to know about the PWC advice?  Did you get to know a number of people who     Who can say did become aware of it at one stage or another?    Yes.  That is going to be important to take further.    One the proof that they were aware of it but we also need to know whether the Group Chief Executive or Activing Group Chief Executive depending on when it was became aware of it and to the extent that it was not followed what reasons – why it was not followed.      So it is just like the R9 million we need to establish each and every person in the hierarchy    Of Transnet.    Who got to know about it and what they did about it.    He was the leader actually.    Yes.    A very important member.    What would remain is the GCE.    And the Chief Executive of the Rail and Freight.    Ja.  Unit yes.    Okay thank you.    Thank you very much.      You are done.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine.  And there is also the affidavit that we talked about for the witnesses who came without an affidavit.  It may well be that when one takes the transcript of their evidence and one puts annexures – I am not sure it may well be that it might serve that purpose I am not sure but if – if it is – if one could have an affidavit that basically repeats the evidence that they have given but now puts it in affidavit form without the interruptions and everything that may be very convenient.    Ja if there is difficulty in one or another about that I am open to another option that involves using the transcript.    Once they have got to transcript of their own evidence they could even prepare that themselves and just bring you a draft of their affidavit and you can just have a look but it must be something that you know goes in accordance     With the evidence they have given.  And as an affidavit it might then attach annexures.  If it does not attach annexures it could just indicate that the particular annexure appears in volume whatever.    At what page then it would be convenient.  So at least with regard to them     You do not have a big job to do.    Yes.    Well it is the Chair that prefers it that way.    Ja – ja if there are difficulties you…    Ja    Yes but I think with lawyers it is much more easier.    Because your involvement will be limited.  They can draw the affidavits themselves. They know what their evidence was.  They know what documents they referred to in their evidence.    They are here.    And they both agree.    Okay thank you very much Mr Mnyandu for coming to give your evidence to the extent that there might be – there will be some aspects that still need to be addressed you will address them together with the Ms Sello but thank you very much.  You are excused.    Thank you.    Ja.    Yes.    It does not look like he is keen to address me now.    So we will take the tea adjournment.  It is now twenty five past eleven we will resume at twenty to twelve.      We adjourn.    Good morning Mr Pretorius.    How are you feeling?    Yes.  Okay.  No that is alright.  Okay, thank you.  The files that I have here are they new files or what?    Ja.    Okay.  Thank you.    Thank you.    I am sorry – I am sorry.  You just said it is based on MNS Report …    2B?    Okay.    Yes. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Please give me that.  That will be convenient.  Zonneke (Chair speaking to Registrar).  Yes.    Okay.  No that is fine.    Yes.  Ja, please.    And what knowledge …? ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    And I guess what knowledge they had in this sector.  Did they have the right knowledge to make the decisions because one, if they had the right expertise but nevertheless made certain decisions that were maybe inexplicable that might point to an intentional …    To prejudice Transnet but if they did not have the required expertise that might not show intention but it might show negligence or even gross negligence but it might show – it might raise the question of why they make decisions in a field in which they knew nothing.    Ja.  Okay.    Ja.  No that is fine.  That is fine.    Yes but just before that I think it would help if at the beginning of his evidence I could just be alerted to certain specific terms that one needs to understand from the beginning that he may be using that obviously I do not know about not being in his field of expertise.    So that – so that I – as we go on one know there is this term.    This is what it means and so on.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, ja.    Okay.  No that is fine.  As long as by the time they are used …    I have been alerted and (intervenes).    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Well …    Well Mr Pretorius that does happen and sometimes it is a bona fide mistake on the part of – of the expert.  Sometimes it is meant to show you how little you know.    So …    And I am sure other people say lawyers do the same.    Okay, alright.    Just a different language.  The witness may be sworn in please or affirmation maybe administered.    Thank you very much.    Oh yes.    Sir I am sorry.  It is BCom from Stellenbosch you said.    And BCom Honours Cum Laude Stellenbosch?    And then MCom Cum Laude …    Which university, Stellenbosch?    Yes.    And then PhD Cum Laude?    You thought you had had enough.  It is fine if you just get the degree.  No, thank – thank you Dr Bloom.    Thank you.    Yes okay.    I am – I am sorry.  This might be a question that has nothing to do with you.  I just see that there is an indication of at page 3 of those who were sub-contractors but I wonder whether they had – they had been put in as part of the consortium from the beginning but as I say it might be something that you know nothing about.  Somebody else would tell me about it.    Oh, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius is there something that somebody wants to do to assist the witness?    Hm.    Yes.    Hm    Oh.    Okay but – but I was concerned about the movement …    It has been sorted out now?    Okay, alright.    Ja, okay because any movement to the witness while the witness is giving evidence one needs to be careful about it.    Okay, alright.    (Intervenes).    If I am – I mean I am advised if I am informed then it helps.    If I do not know I do not know what is happening and …    Anybody watching might be thinking the witness is being told what to say.  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  So …    I – I can imagine.    But are we – are we okay now?    Okay, alright thank you.    I am sorry Dr Bloom.    I do hear you, but maybe if you can just raise your voice a bit that will help.    Thank you.     And apart from asking, maybe, you may be expected to do your own investigation of what may be in the public domain?     Something very basic at least.     Yes okay.     So in other words it’s the product of the work of the transaction advisors to Transnet, to say this is our advice and this is the analysis on which it is based.     To expect from that kind of report.     Okay.     I’m sorry just before you proceed, please don’t forget the question you were answering, I just want to go back to the answer you gave to the previous question.  Does that – does the instruments that you’re talking about to mitigate some of these risks arise from the fact that if the borrower in South Africa and the lender in China, if their agreement simply said, this is what you owe me, maybe you’re going to pay me in two years time without making any other – including any other arrangements the lender could end up being paid at a much – at a lower amount in value, in real value or that’s not really what it’s about?     Yes well – so that makes it why it’s important for the lender to specify that the repayments would be in their currency if they were to allow the repayments to be in the currency of the borrower they might run the risk that the currency of the country of the borrower weakens and then they end up getting payments – repayments that are much less than the value that they lent.     Well there has been some evidence, I just can’t remember the details, there has been evidence in regard to something in this Commission, I think, about these transactions, I don’t know whether it was about Eskom or Transnet where the transaction was in a currency that was quite unexpected.     I can’t remember.     I can’t remember but the question, when you saw it that your answer is, but whey did they agree to use that currency because, you know, that’s not what you expect them to do, I just can’t remember the details, yes okay.     And if the – say South African, the rand strengthens, that might or maybe not might, will benefit me but that doesn’t necessarily mean the lender gets prejudiced, is that right?     Yes but the lender remains in the same position that they were because it’s their currency that counts for them.     Okay, thank you.     So what was it within two and a half years they had increased from 35.2million to 265.5million?     I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, Dr Bloom seeing that you are a numbers person as I understand the position, an increase from 35.2million rand to 265.5million rand would be an increase of what percentage.     Okay, alright.     754 Percent increase?     In two and a half years.     Okay thank you.    In other words     In other words are we not dealing with a situation where two different people are asked to do the same thing?    But I think Mr Pretorius may be asking and that is part of what I also want to ask is once Regiments was there could they not do cover all of this or is this a part that they could not cover and therefore J P Morgan had to be brought in?    Hm.    That is possible.    Okay.  Is it something that you might be able to speak more confidently on after maybe reviewing more documents because it would be important to know if it is indeed a duplication in terms of work to be done or whether it is not?    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm    Hm.    Okay.    Okay.  Okay thank you.    Yes.    Before that just to follow this – so are you saying as you understand Transnet’s agreement with Regiments it was that – they would be paid for their services initially without any success fee.  There was no success fee mentioned because Transnet policy does not allow that.    Is that right?    So whether they had succeeded or not they would still have been paid, is that right?    In terms of that kind of arrangement.    Yes, yes.      So – but later on what happens is that Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi prepares a memorandum which recommends that apart from being paid what had been agreed which would have nothing to do with success or failure they must in addition be paid a success fee.    And you are saying that when one talks about the success fee in this context a success fee generally applies if the – if the basis is if you achieve your target you will be paid but if – this is what you will be paid.  But if you do not succeed you will not be paid anything.    So here we get a combination of the two regimes that is part of the point you make.    Yes.    Yes.  And one should normally choose one or the other and not have both.    Yes okay thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius I am looking at what you gave me that will not have the same page numbers or will it?    Oh okay.    Okay what is the page number Doctor Bloom?    06 – Mr Pretorius I only see a page with a 06 on the last page cover but what I have inside does not have 06..    Pages I have got 95.    I have got 95, 81, 77 I got 64.      Am I looking at the right thing?    Ja.    Yes.    Oh they…    They put the stapler there so it makes it difficult to see the page numbers.    Ja.  I think the – I think this…    Okay, okay.    Yes okay thank you.  Take this one.    Are you going to need this copy or not really?    Okay.  Will your junior need this one?    Ja maybe take that one.  Ja okay thank you.  I think it can be used if you know where the page numbers are or you get the staple to be on a different corner of the document.  Yes.    But – but is the point being made at 16.2 of the report the one you have just read or were you also making the point that at a certain stage the - t–e internal policy was amended in such a way that treasury was excluded?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  But – but your understanding is that that exclusion was not applicable at the time of this transaction?    Yes.    Yes okay.    Okay.  Okay.    Yes.  Yes.    Ja, ja.    Yes but I just want to say this before we – we adjourn.  We just have to keep our eyes on certain things that we are getting as we go along.  We have seen that in regard to the fees for this transactional – transactional advisory services an amount of 35, something million had been fixed but then the amount went up to more than 700% as I understand it 700% that is – that is very huge and earlier today and yesterday I was hearing evidence of similar things where – I mean we dealt yesterday with evidence that a supplier said if we do this for you Transnet it would cost R9 million but we know that ultimately it costs R600 and something million.  So here we have that kind of situation but we have heard I think in regard to Eskom maybe with regard to Transnet as well already situations where the risk capacity within the entity within a parastatal for certain work to be done but that work is given to and outside supplier in circumstances where at least so far we have not heard any evidence what was wrong with using internal capacity and from what you have said treasury here Transnet’s own treasury had the capacity and had people who were internationally acclaimed as good people for doing the – providing the services that were now being given to outside entities at huge amounts.      Yes, yes.    YEs.    Yes.  But at least the funding side there was proper capacity that could have been used.    Yes.  Thank you.  We…    Yes.    With all of these things.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No that is alright.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn.    You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Yes because that is not your area.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Just so that I understand that – that part.  Are you saying when one wants to – when one is dealing with fees for a Lead Manager and Debt Originator of a loan - in this context – one of the first things to know is what the capital amount of the loan is?    And depend – maybe depending on a number of things you might have to bear that in mind because the fee might be or a component of the fee might be linked to the amount of the loan?    Okay, alright.    I am sorry.  Before that.    The reference to the original capital is that the amount that ultimately gets granted as a loan or is it the amount that your client may have asked you to get as a loan but you might have got a lesser amount?  Reference to original what does it relate to?    That I want you to get for me?    Ja, 2 billion for example?    Yes.    So – so when the two of us are – when I am giving you a mandate for our purposes that is the original loan that you are talking about?    Original amount?    Yes.    Yes.  If - if you only succeed to get me 1 billion instead of two the – when we talk about the original it will remain 2 billion and the 1 billion you got would not be referred to as the original?    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    Ja.    Okay - to the extent that the term of original amount may still be used must we understand it therefore to refer to the amount that is loaned?    That is actually loaned?    Okay, thank you.    So what you have just said now is it another way of arriving – is it another way of determining a fee for transactional advisors such as Regiments?  In other words one way – are you saying one way of doing this is to say to a transactional advisor I want a loan for R2 billion.  You – you raise it and I will pay you X percentage of the amount of loan that you get me?    That is one way?    Are you saying therefore there is another way and another way is – is that the fee is calculated on a different basis and the different basis is you look at the repayments over a long period including interest?    Okay, thank you.    You – you mentioned a term for the regime in terms of which your fee is - as a transactional advisor – your fee is determined on the basis of the repayments.  I think Mr Pretorius has got the terminology already.  I have not yet got it.  Something yield to value or something.  What is that?    Yield to maturity?    So that – that refers – the yield part refers to your fee and maturity refers to the capital and interest over the period that repayments are made?    Oh that is quite convoluted – a convoluted way of – of putting it.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, so it is interest over that whole long period of repayment?    Capital and yes, okay.  Thank you.    Hopefully we will get there Dr Bloom.    Hopefully we will get – we will get there, okay. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    So …    If …    Before that Mr Pretorius.  If I want to distinguish between the two correctly I want to call them it is regime this regime that.  The one would be yield to maturity regime – I would imagine.  Would that be - would that be a good description?    And the other one you would call what?    Notional …    Amount?  Notional value (intervenes).    Notional amount regime?    So we can have those regimes?    Okay.  That might not suit you Mr Pretorius.  It is just for my own.    Ja.    Ja.    That is exactly what I am thinking.    Ja, okay.    Hm.    Well I am still on – on your question.  You – you say if one uses the notional amount regime the percentage should be what?    Smaller.    Yes and you say if you use the yield to maturity regime it should be bigger?    Smaller than if you use the …?    Okay.  Maybe if Dr Bloom can explain that to me why?    Oh, small in terms of – of the Rand – of the amount not smaller in terms of the percentage?    Okay.  I thought – I thought it was in relation to a percentage.  The percentage could be the same but because the amounts are different one is higher than another one the actual amount received would be different?    Ja, okay.    Hm.    Just repeat that about R102 billion.    Is based on the yield to maturity regime?    It is a yield to – ja.    Ja.    Is difficult, ja.    But you – you would be able to say I would imagine that below a certain percentage is - would be hard to get?    To get somebody who charge below a certain percentage and it should be possible to say it would be very extraordinary to find somebody who charges above a certain percentage?    So somewhere in between then you could have what you regard as more or less not shocking?    Hm.    Hm.    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.  The notional regime.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, on market conventions your point number two, market conventions and Transnet practices are to pay lead arrangement fees on notional and not on yield to maturity as Regiments did.  Market conventions wouldn’t that be what we talked about when we talked about norms in the market?     That is insofar as the lead arrangement is concerned and as far as the debt origination if I can call it that, and what’s the market conventions and practices or is that something that you are still going to come to?    Oh, you know I thought, you see on page we talked about that amount of R152million, R152,7million that they were, Regiments were to be the lead manager and debt originator and here on point 2 at page 13 you say market conventions and Transnet practices are to pay lead arrangement fees on notional and not on yield to (indistinct), I thought that what you meant is lead manager and debt originator are – can be two separate people or entities but sometimes it’s one.    But I thought what you meant was these conventions, market conventions and practices that you are talking about in bullet point number two on page 13 relate only to the lead management role as opposed the debt origination role, but you are now clarifying to say you meant a combination of both in regard to this transaction.    Okay now I understand, okay.    That’s the market convention and Transnet practice?    I’m sorry.    The Transnet practice is it always in accordance with market conventions, in the – here in what we are dealing with?  I’m just trying to understand if there is any particular significance in always pairing them, the market convention and the Transnet practice because if the Transnet practice is always in accordance with the market convention then all one needs to know is just the market convention.    Okay thank you.    But ultimately are we amending that 0.06 on page 13 to be 0.01?    For a different point?    You can – you will make that point in due course?    But here we can say 0.01.    Okay, alright.    That must be quite high.    Let me ask you this question then, it’s part of me trying to look at this with as much benefit of your knowledge as possible, would this be shocking to somebody who is familiar with the market convenetion?    Okay, thank you.    Actually when you say not in line you’re being kind to them isn’t it?  Way out of line?    Ja.    That is the overall point you make and then the other point is the one you have been dealing with I think is even if there was justification to give Regiments this work to do, there was no justification for charging the amounts that they charged, is that correct?    Now in terms of what you consider to be in excess of what the norm was or what they should have paid or what one could expect to be an advisor in their position, to have been paid for this kind of work, is there anything that you came across in terms of documentation that says to you, maybe they can come up with some justification or is it one of those situations where you are able to say, there is just no way in which anybody can justify this kind of amount for this kind of work.    Okay thank you.    Yes some witness told me about a floating interest rate, I think there is a floating and a fixed interest rate.    Mr Pretorius you talk about the previous month – oh previous because we have…(intervention).    Yes.    I was looking at 27 August…(intervention).     Yes you are right.    Yes.    Yes.    Maybe, I’m just – Mr Essa becoming controlling shareholder of Trillian happens in September and Trillian replaces JP Morgan early in October, no that’s what I wanted to connect.    Okay, alright.    I’m sorry before you do that and you must just tell me if this is something you come to deal with because it’s not really – it doesn’t have much to do with finances.  That memorandum that Mr Gama submitted to the BADC Committee, requesting the appointment of Trillian to replace JP Morgan, I’d be interested in the reasons that were given for that change. So – but this witness might not have forecast on that.    Yes okay.    And sometimes you have dealt with something many months ago in a Commission such as this and you can’t really remember and now you want to connect the dots as it were.     (Laughing) and that’s nothing.    Thank you.    So…    So that fourth bullet point on page 16 is the reference to loan – to club loan facility agreement then correct. From what you have just clarified in – I am getting the impression that – from the clarification you have given to Mr Pretorius to his question I am getting the impression that that agreement was the mandate being given by Transnet to Trillian to say our relationship and this is what you will do for us and this is what we will pay.  That is what that agreement was about and not about the actual loan.    Ye so I am just saying I am not sure whether calling it a club loan facility agreement is correct but maybe that it is I must just – but you say it is the authorisation – is their appointment to perform this job.    Okay.    In relation to the club loan facility.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja no that is fine.    18 November.    Ja.    You have – on 18 November 2016 Trillian is appointed     Hm.    Ja 18 November 2015 Trillian is appointed then you mentioned 23 September I am trying to look for that.    November?    23 November yes .    I am looking for that 23 November.    Oh.  Oh okay.    Oh okay so but 23 November is when they issue their invoice?    Or when the payment happens?    Yes okay.  Now are you then saying looking at the work that an entity performing the kind of function or doing the kind of work that it was appointed to do and the amounts involved and so on it could not have done work to justify that – the kind of amount that they issued an invoice for?    That is what you are saying?    That – the kind of work that would have been involved in doing what it was appointed to do to justify an amount such as – was it R93 million?  In your experience would have entailed – would have taken over how long in terms of – obviously could vary from one transaction to another    But generally speaking    Hm    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Is it possible that the work had been done by J P Morgan?    You cannot answer.    Or maybe would the position be that if there was any work that had been done already it would have been done by somebody else    That is as far as you can take that?    Ja by Regiments.    Ja okay.    So – so when you talk about work that had been performed by Regiments you – you – are you saying you look at the – you looked at the documentation and looked at whatever else you needed to look at in order to form an opinion and you are able to say that that work was actually done or must have been done by Regiments.  In other words is it a situation where you say look it is Regiments who did it or is it the situation where you say it must have been done by Regiments because the work was done but we know that Regiments was there?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.      Hm.    Hm.    But – and we will need to – to know you know compared to a team that you said Transnet had which was internationally respected from what I understood you to say.  So one could compare to say what was wrong with using internal people? Was there anything special in terms of the skills and expertise from Trillian and Regiments and so on?    And I am going to just ask one question relating to what you – we have finished.  In your involvement with NMS to assist them with the financial aspects of these transactions you have not have you – you have not had the chance to so to speak confront Trillian and whoever to say how do you justify this and hear what they have to say and you are able to say this is what they said and just maybe I can understand where they are coming from but this was wrong, this was not justified or whatever they say just does not make sense.    Yes.    Okay thank you.    So the fluctuating exchange rate that is something that the borrower would be concerned about?    But the lender would not be concerned about insofar as the – the repayments would be in the lender’s currency?    Okay and then in terms of the credit risk I guess that would be – would that be the lenders concern as well as the borrowers concern?    The borrowers concern from the point of view what if I end up not being able to honour the agreement.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja the – so I guess the more importantly is the lender that needs protection but I guess the borrower also does not want to be in that situation where they cannot honour.    Their agreements.    And then – and then the third one is financial costs also the borrowers concern?    Yes okay.  Thank you.    Yes it means you are guaranteeing against the risk almost?  You are protecting somebody against the risk?    But whether it is guaranteeing on something less than that we will get to hear in due course?    Okay alright.    Well will that still – is that still an elaboration on hedging because I just want to …    Finalise on hedging.    I do not know why I am associating the word “hedging” with like fencing off.    Fencing off maybe in that way in this context maybe it is fencing off the risk.  I am not sure but I do not know why I am associating it with that.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay, thank you.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes and of course I heard evidence - I do not know whether it was two weeks back - about a situation where - I think it was Transnet and I cannot remember if it was this transaction because there has been an overlap of evidence – where the initial arrangement was floating interest but then somebody came from Transnet at some stage and said no it must be changed to a fix rate …    But in that context the witness was – was criticising the introduction of a fixed rate and I think indicating that in the context of that evidence that introducing a fixed rate was going to put Transnet in a worse off position …    But I will – I will hear and we will try …    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    To Transnet ja.    Yes.    Ja.  I think you – you will just – the legal team will just have to – members will have to liaise with one another to see who was leading a witness who was dealing with that …    To see that it was not the same thing.    Ja.    Ja.    It could be.  I just cannot remember.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, okay thank you.    Ja.    And a swap being a form of hedging?    Hm.    Ja.    I am sorry but they may - the idea that there should be hedging may come from them or not really – from the lender?    Because they want some certainty that …    No.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Well what I was thinking and I do not know if it has anything to do with the example of an insurance that Mr Pretorius has been or used earlier.  What I am thinking is that - you know – a bank might insist that you must take insurance when you buy a car and they help you to buy a car.  You must take insurance and you cannot start driving it until you have taken insurance.  They just want to make sure that if something happens then they will be covered.  So I was wondering whether a lender in this case might be interested that you – you as the borrower is it take a swap – a swap or do some hedging.  So – because they want to be double sure that they will be fine or not really?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Arrangement?    Ja, okay thank you.    But – but before you do that …    A swap arrangement would be between the borrower and - like the bank - or who would it be between?  You were saying earlier on when the two parties discuss that is the borrower and who?    A - a third party?    Ja, okay.    Okay and usually that would be a financial institution?    Okay.        Well let us go back to the role players.    You have Transnet wanting to borrow R12 billion and then you have a consortium that is prepared to lend R12 billion to Transnet?    Okay.  They enter into an agreement in terms of which the interest rate that Transnet will pay will be a floating interest rate.  Is that right?    Yes.  Now Transnet becomes concerned about the – the fluctuation of the interest rate.  Is that right?    And wants to protect itself against that?    That is where the hedging comes in and the swap coming in as well as form of hedging?    Now normally would the lender in the main agreement – if we can call it that relating to R12 billion – the lender in that transaction would not be the one that takes part in the swap arrangement or would it?    In other words if I am getting the 12 million – R12 billion from you and there is a fluctuating interest rate that we have agreed and now I want to protect myself against the fluctuation of the floating interest.  I need somebody else to talk to or can it also be you?    Sorry.    It can be the same?    But what is the norm?    There is no norm, ja.    Yes.    So in other words I can – you can say to me well we are agreeing on a floating rate – floating interest rate in regard to this R12 billion but should you want a swap we can talk about that but that would be a separate transaction.    Is that right?    Yes an entirely separate transaction.  So in this case you have pointed out that Nedbank was – was a member of the consortium …    That was lending Transnet the R12 billion …    But it was also a party that was dealing with Transnet with regard to concluding a swap arrangement?    Okay, thank you.    Okay.  Sorry Mr Pretorius.  I just want to make sure I follow.  I do not know whether you made a mistake or I misunderstand the way you – you put it.  It was as if a concern would arise from Nedbank.    I thought it would arise from Transnet?    Yes, yes.    Okay.    Well I may have misunderstood but that is how I – I understood.    Ja, okay alright.  So the concern from the borrower?    Ja.    Yes.    But before you do that Mr Pretorius please do not forget the point you wanted to put.  I just want to follow this correctly.  You – you emphasised at some stage earlier that for a swap arrangement it is important that the two parties should have different views as to what is likely to happen with regard to interest rates?    And the more we talk about it the more I begin to understand why it is necessary to have that but you will talk more about that in due course but a swap arrangement would not be necessary – would it – for a borrower who before entering into the main agreement would have done his or her homework properly.  Is that right?    If you do your homework properly in terms of what is likely to happen in the interest rates in the years to come and you are confident of the assessment you have made.  You would choose whether you go for the floating interest rate or the fixed rate and you would then say because I am comfortable I do not need that – a swap arrangement.  Is that right?    Generally speaking?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Because when you go to – in this case – when Transnet having concluded its agreement with the consortium for the loan of R12 billion when it goes to Nedbank it then enters into a fixed term kind of rate.    Which it could …    Ja at – at whatever cost which it could have done with – with the consortium?    Of your evidence?    Yes.    Yes, okay thank you.    Oh, yes we did not talk.    Yes.    Yes.  I will – I will allow you …    Yes.    And not Transnet?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No, no thank you.  We did not talk about when we will end today but we normally end at four unless we have made other arrangements.  Today we are going to end at four but we are not done with Dr Bloom.  So we will have to continue on Monday.  Is that in order? I know there is a witness for …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Let me – let me just say I do not know what your plans are.  What I had in mind based on the understanding that at some stage you may have thought that Dr Bloom’s evidence would take one day.  I was thinking that depending on how much more time we need with him it would be good if we did not break the evidence but I do not know the other witness whether he is going to be here for a few days or he would have to leave.    Hm.    Yes.    Because I was thinking from my side – I do not know – I was thinking if we needed for example another two hours or three hours or how much more …    What do you think?    Almost a day?    Oh, okay.  No that – that is fine.  It is just that it would – it is a pity if we are going to have a long break.    This kind of technical evidence once you are in to it – it would be better to go on and finish but there are things that we cannot disturb in terms of     Next week’s arrangements.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Is fundamental?    To his evidence.    Ja.  Let us look early next week in terms of fixing the date when Dr Bloom would come back …    As soon as possible.    It should …    Ja.  It should    Oh, it – it can be sometime next week?    Oh, ja that – that would be very helpful.    That would be very helpful, ja.  Okay.  Then we are going to adjourn now until Monday.  Mr Pretorius you – I know you are not leading the evidence of the witness on Monday but do you – do you know whether he is likely to finish in one day or should we start earlier than normal?    You do not have any idea?    Okay, alright.  We - we will adjourn then for now and we will start at 10 o’ clock on Monday.  Dr Bloom thank you very much but you will still come back to continue with – with your evidence.  Hopefully it can be sometime next week before one forgets the – the part that you have given today.    Thank very much.    We will then adjourn. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair    We are ready.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mnyandu when we parted yesterday we had completed annexure – slide I am sorry – slide 27 and we now get onto 28.      Okay.  Okay Mr Mnyandu then you can lead us through slide 28 when you are ready.      It starts at 9134 Chair but that is the cover note.  The actual document is 9135.      If I may interrupt youMr Mnyandu my apologies.  We ought to have started on the assignment I think that Chair gave you yesterday.  Could we deal with that and dispose of it and then we can continue with your testimony this morning?    It related to the question of when the term relocation first appeared in this entire transaction.  Were you able to determine that?    Thank you Chair.  And in regards to the question about when the term relocation first reared its head you will respond to that having perused all other documents that do not form of the record currently and you will respond by way of statement?    And based on your answer then the Chair will determine whether it is necessary for you to – to return and perhaps – for some engagement on that statement.    Thank you Chair and thank you for that Mr Mnyandu.  We then can turn to your Volume 13 page 31 – 9134 and I think the Chair has located it in the file.    You may then lead us through it.    If you could just pause there for a moment Mr Mnyandu.  Again we always trying to keep track of the increases.  The last we had of increases was R669 as per the memorandum of June …    15    From Ms Mdletshe.    And that was the approval that was being sought from the acting GCE?    At the time.    Be kept as R699?    And that is at Volume 13 page 9111.    For reference purposes.  This memorandum comes a month after that approval.  I see it is dated 22 July 2015 at page 9137 the signature page.    So then since the approval of a cap of R669 million in a month according to this memorandum am I interpreting this memorandum correctly to understand that there was a further increase taking the total cost now to a new level of R719 million?    R719?    Okay.  I follow.      Before you proceed.  That last point what did you interpret it to mean?  That Transnet is holding cash of approximately R4 billion with a cost of carry of approximately 4% which provides support for taking advantage of the discount?    So the payment of this R649 – 7 million 50% upon signature and then over 24 months instalment would be payable out of that R4 billion?    As part of – which was part of the contingency % contingency for the…    1064 – thank you.  Please proceed.    I would like you to pause once again.  Are we to understand that paragraph 11 to mean when the R4.9 billion – when the R49 billion ETC was approved with the R4.9 billion contingency the contingency already made provision for the relocation?    And that appears in the – in which document?  Where do we do find that?    For the increase and in doing so as to what covers – what contingencies are catered for relocation is one of the items?    Okay.  Thank you.      Then another – if I may I am sorry to interject.  On read – on the reading of paragraph 12 particularly in respect of relocation of BT and CNR regard being had to the amounts the budget referred to in here cannot be the budget of the business case because that was the year previous?    And that could not have been a budget spelt out in the memorandum of Mr Molefe because that was in May 2014 and at the time the relocation cost at least insofar as CNR is concerned was not R647?    Yes for contingencies.    So my question then is – is there any document that reflects this budget as set out in paragraph 12 by Mr – by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe?    Yes.    Yes.    So we are seeing it for the first time in this memorandum?    Okay.  Thank you.    Million Chair.    Sorry Chair your microphone is off.    Indeed Chair.    Perhaps on that score then let us just clarify at least now did you make enquiries Mr Mnyandu from Ms Mdletshe - who is the author of this memorandum we just went through and as you say was the interface between Transnet and MNS during the course of your investigations – did you inquire from her whether she did receive the R9 million quote – original R9 million quote - from CNR …    And what was her response if you did?    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    And the Chair will recall that that R9 million – that quotation was first introduced by Mr Gonsalves.    We will go back to Mr Gonsalves …    Files and see what – how much of the answer - of the question we can begin to answer and to the extent that we still have a gap.  Then our investigators will be requested to see if they can close that gap.    We will determine that through the papers …    And the transcript and if the question was not posed …    We perhaps may pose it to Mr Gonsalves …    And to the extent necessary he will file a supplementary statement in that regard.    Thank you Chair.  Yes Mr Mnyandu we may – we may proceed.    Yes.    Can I just inquire at times under A at page 9131 - the section you just read – there is reference to “our”.  Do we interpret the “our” to be referenced to CNR and not our Transnet.  So it is not Transnet speaking here?    BT rather sorry.    So it is a – seemingly a direct quote from the BT proposal?    Thank you.   Thank you. Before we leave that memorandum I would like to take you back to page 9131.  At 9131 under the heading a, “Further Price Escalation”.  You read four items and at times it would appear that it is a direct - as you confirmed I think – a direct quotation from the BT proposal?    Now I would like to refer to the paragraphs    I under – but now this is what Ms Mdletshe as a drafter is saying – is informing.    Yes.    I am interested in the paragraph thereafter and I want to see whether you – you consider it in your investigations and whether you have got a clear understanding of it and if so to share    The highest known and the accepted offer – the lowest was 618 million which turned out to be the accepted offer?    I am trying to understand this 32 percent discount.  Where and how do I factor it in?  I do not if – unless my mathematics is failing me.  If you go to your slide 19 you will see the prices compared.    Okay.    Yes.    You now – you now want us to turn to …    We are back to …    The question Chair emanates from page 9131 of volume 13.    The volume at hand.  There is reference in that memorandum where it is stated that the B- Bombardier’s current price represents a total discount of 32.5 percent.    I then referred Mr Mnyandu back to page 19 of his slide which has shown us all BTs cost offers.    The highest coming in at 634 …    And the lowest coming in at 618 million.  It is against that background I seek an understanding as to where the 32.5 percent saving …    Is to be found accepting that perhaps I – I may have made an error in my mathematics.    Mr Mnyandu is attempting to answer that question for me …    Has referred us now to BB8C that is the slide file.    And he has referred us in particular to page 95.    That will be under 6 Chair.    Okay.  We have located TTM6.    Oh, okay. I was overly optimistic there.    Yes.    Yes.    To our latest.    It is 2.5 percent?    So I guess it is a question of the author will explain to us whether 32.5 percent discount is derived from?    Because that is what is communicated to the Acting GCE?    If …    Before we get there though was there any documentation you were able to come across in the course of your investigations that would support a claim of a 32.5 percent discount?    Yes.    Ja but – yes I understand but an analysis of that very documentation together with what we have before us were you able to establish definitively that this would – the negotiations have resulted in a 32.5 discount?    Okay.  Thank you Chair.    Chair it would be an arithmetic exercise really.    It is a calculator.    The first offer is 634.    The last and acceptable offer is 618 million.    Now one can work out on a calculator what that represents by way of percentage – the discount.    What I was trying to determine is – is there another figure we are missing.    That if we incorporate into the calculation will give us the 32.5 percent discount because whatever discount there may be from 634 to 618 is not 32.5, that would bring us closer to the 400million mark if it were.    We will Chair, it may be – instead of 32.5 it might be 3.25, we will do that calculation Chair.    And Mr Mnyandu you make the point that both the BT and the CNR memoranda to Mr Siyabonga Gama were approved on the same day.    So the costs of relocation as quoted by both were accepted by Transnet.    You may proceed then from there.    647 and 618.      Thank you Chair.    It is, as the Chair states, and the reasons perhaps might be advanced at a future date when the Chair has the opportunity to talk to some of the drafters and approvers of these memoranda’s.    Indeed.    You are now turning your attention Mr Mnyandu to the involvement or non involvement of TIA.    And I see at page 9147, which is the actual report, it is addressed to Mr Siyabonga Gama, the Group Chief Executive.    So it’s a report by Internal Audit for Mr Siyabonga Gama dated June 2017.  At page 9152, which is the signature page of that document, I see Mr Siyabonga Gama has signed it which means he became aware of his contents.    Understanding then that TIA – TIA’s involvement in this entire transaction was minimal to none?  Understanding from this report, that there is no confirmation that what you call gateway reviews were conducted at all relevant points or junctions.    Do you know what Mr Gama’s response or reaction to this report was?    So the – I see now where Mr Siyabonga Gama has signed it reads now, Group Chief Executive, and this is June 2017 and by this time had been a permanent appointee to that.    So when he says in the note, in a letter to AGCE, that’s Acting Group Chief Executive, who is he talking about?    Oh he’s speaking about himself in the third person?    Okay besides that note, do you know whether Mr Gama took any particular steps in regard to the process followed and the concerns raised here or recorded in any document what he proposes be done about non-compliance, which I think this report constitutes?    At 9148?    It was received on the 7 t h of June 2017 and it was coming from the internal auditor, is that right?    So then following on that, what one would expect from a Group Chief Executive is to engage with the conclusions and the consequences – the conclusions drawn at 678 by the internal audit and then to address himself to the consequences of the exclusion of internal audit from the process?    Is there any documentation that would reflect that he did?    Okay, are you aware of whether or not Mr Siyabonga Gama ever made any follow-up, either on this report or the note he makes on the report itself?    Okay, if that’s all you intended to highlight on the internal audit report, we are ready to proceed but I think the Chair might not – might want to have – might have a question or two on the report still.    Thank you.    Thank you.  That then leads you to MNS own findings.      May you proceed?    And then if I may just follow up on that Mr Mnyandu.  But if the RFP and the contract subsequently concluded says you – let us say the RFP you are required to bid for production of the locomotives in Koedoespoort or any other location in South Africa and read that as a complete term.  If it read that way one would expect that in calculating your costs as a bidder you would take into consideration that this site for production might not necessarily be Koedoespoort and might be another position in South Africa and you will have catered for that eventuality.  Would that be an unreasonable expectation?    But the issue being that it is not really a change per se if the RFP contemplated that the production place might be different.    It may make a difference.    It may result in an increase in cost or it may result in a savings.    Yes.    Indeed.    Then…    I will test that after the hearing whether he did guess it correctly Chair.  You may continue Mr Mnyandu.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Absolutely Chair.    Absolutely Chair.    But one thing we can establish already and based on Mr Mnyandu’s response to the Chair’s question if that was – that report was – PWC Report as contracted for by Mr Anoj Singh and that is the Group Chief Executive you suggest.    Group Chief Financial Officer.  We know from evidence adduced by Mr Mnyandu that Mr Anoj Singh was part of the negotiating team     Of the negotiating teams for the relocation.    So already one can – at least one member of that team was aware of the report [indistinct].    A very important member of that team    Absolutely.    Freight yes.    Yes we will close that loop Chair.    And for the record that structure is?    Thank you.    Chair.    I am done Chair.  That brings us to the conclusion of Mr Mnyanadu’s testimony before you Chair.    Subject of course to the filing and consideration of the supplementary statement in respect of the issues raised by the Chair.    At that juncture the Chair will make a determination whether Ms Mnyandu – Mr Mnyandu need appear any further.    Thank you Chair.    We will look into that Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    That has got value.    Indeed.    It is easier.    Chair    If I may on that we will give the affidavit a first shot we will see if it works.  Mindful of the fact that we do not want to make the Chair’s record unduly voluminous.  But if there is a…    The result might come with more 17 volumes and I am sure the Chair would not appreciate that.  But we will give it a shot Chair and if you permit us should we run into difficulties or…    Should it – if the affidavits fail to address the point that the Chair     Raises we shall revert Chair and we will consider other ways.    I will leave it to the two lawyers.    Indeed Chair I just need to check that both lawyers are here.    Yes they are Chair.    They both agree.    Chair we know we have encroached on the tea break somewhat but we are done.  The next witness is ready.    He will be led by my leader Mr – Advocate Pretorius.    I do not know if he would like to address you now or after tea when he takes the podium.    Then it will have to be after fifteen minutes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    So it is possible that someone within Transnet would have seen we cannot go out to market we have to amend the policy so we can employ external advisors? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair.    Thank you counsel.  Chair at slide 28 we now seek to take you through the approval process of the relocation costs.  In particular we deal with first a memorandum that was done by – compiled by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe in respect of the CNR OEM.  The memorandum was prepared on 22 July 2015.  It was a request for the approval of the relocation costs for CNR at an amount of R647 181 494.00.  Chair that is to be found in your Volume 13 at page 9135.      9135.    Yes we may Chair.    Chair upon reflection you will recall that we – the documentation we took you through yesterday and specifically a document contained in the Exhibit BB8[c] noted that there was email correspondence written to at least one of the OEM’s in relation to them having to put up a price for the Durban or factor in the price for manufacturing from Durban.  Now Chair we also took you through the fact that the agreements that were concluded on 17 March 17 did not make mention of the allocation of Durban as such.  And therefore as the processes morphed out and as discussions were had with each of the OEM’s it seems the word relocation reared its head during the course of those negotiations firstly by email correspondence – by way of email correspondence and for now we can say in relation to the memorandum done by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe requesting the acting Group Chief Executive at the time Mr Siyabonga Gama to approve the negotiation team.  However Chair in discussions with the evidence team of the commission we have requested an indulgence in order to confirm this fact, reassess on the documents on hand and come back to the commission in the statement.      I do Chair.    Chair I would like to say that we – I will deal with it.    When I deal with our conclusion.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is understood Chair thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Chair we would like to now read out the salient parts of the memorandum in respect of the approval for the costs of relocation for CNR?    Indeed Chair.    Chair it is addressed to Siyabonga Gama in his capacity at the time as acting Group Chief Executive.  It is from Mr Ravi Nair who was at the time the acting Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail which is the operating division that was concerned with the purchase of the 1064 locomotives.  The subject    He had left at this stage Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you.  Chair the subject read    Chair I stand to be corrected but if we go back to the memorandum that we dealt with yesterday.    To request the acting GCE Mr Siyanbonga Gama    To approve the negotiation team    The word relocation is mentioned.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Chair under purpose the    Confused.  Alright Chair.    And then under motivation number    No Chair.    No Chair.     a. “Inflation costs increased from R166 million to R204 million [increase of approximately R38 million.] b. Finance costs on forward contract increased from R81 million to R88 million. Increase of approximately R7 million. c. Interest on stockholdings which rather would increase from R16 million to R21 million [increase of approximately R5 million]. Therefore total project cost is an increase from R669 million to R719 million.  Increase of approximately R50 million.”    15    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    The …    The request was that it be kept at R669.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Insofar as it was advanced by CNR.  Indeed it is so Chair there was a further increase.    Yes Chair.    The new project relocation cost estimate amounts to R719 090 548.00.  On this price CNR’s offer – CNR offers a 10% settlement discount amounting to R71 909 054.00.  This results in a revised project relocation cost of R647 181 494.00.  Any further delays in commencing the project beyond five months will have further cost implications that will have to be taken into consideration.  The following payments terms have been proposed by CNR.  50% payable within 14 days of signature amounting to R323 590 747.00 the remainder being 50% payable in 24 equal instalments of R13 482 948.00. The “[relocation payment]”  Commencing the end of the first month that the project commences provided that the project is on track.  Therefore CNRRSSA  will invoice for 24 monthly instalments of R13 482 948.00.  Transnet is currently holding cash of approximately R4 billion with a cost of carry of approximately 4% which provides support for taking advantage of the discount based on the proposed payment regime.      What we understood that to mean was that there were monies which we understand to be part of the R4.9 billion contingencies that Transnet was holding and therefore would not have to request capital expenditure outside of the contract.      Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Alright.   “9.  Refer to annexure A for the final detailed proposal.  Budget implications.      The board at its meeting of 28 May 2014 approved an amount of R4.9 billion in contingencies as part of the revised ETC which means the estimated total costs.   11.  The contingencies budget were to following items.   a.   Capital spares beyond the warranty period.   b. Variation orders and options [such as electronically controlled pneumatic braking and wire distributed power etcetera]. c.   Relocation of the programme to Transnet Engineering’s Durban facilities.”    Indeed Chair.    Chair that would be in a document that has been presented to the commission.  It is a memorandum prepared by the then acting Group Chief – sorry the then Group Chief Executive Mr Brian Molefe to the board. It is dated 23 May 2014 and in it Mr Brian Molefe sought to rationalise to the board the justification for the increase.    Even though the word relocation in the memorandum does not appear yes the subject of allocating the two OEM’s to Durban is covered.    Under paragraph 12. The current status of the utilisation of the contingency’s budget is as    Indeed Chair.     Indeed Chair even though a specific amount was made out for contingencies as it were.    Ye.s    Apart from the first line item.    Which is set out as we have said in the memorandum dated 23 May.    2014 prepared by Mr Brian Molefe there is no other document that lists this budget.    It is seeing for the first time here.    Thank you Chair.  Chair then – if    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Indeed.    Yes Chair.    Million Chair.    Chair we have not been able to see anything that speaks to either a critique of the final proposal or the final amount or that justifies or details a support of the final amount which is being requested for approval.    Mentioned.    It is not dealt with Chair not mentioned at all.      Chair the best way to answer it even though we did not have proof of email correspondence that responds to the offer of R9 million the documentation that included that quotation of R9 million which is addressed to Mr Garry Pita and Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe was received from Transnet itself.  It was received in particular from the supply chain services personnel at Transnet Freight Rail.  When Ms Mdletshe became the interface for us to receive information that was required to be perused for the course of our investigation so the documents that we have perused came from Transnet.    Certainly it was received Chair.    No Chair.  I however would like to also point out that at the time that the quotation is sent was during the final stages of the negotiations.    Yes.    The R9.7 million …    Is received a week prior to the conclusion of the negotiations which were concluded on 17 March.    That is when the agreement was then signed.    No Chair.    No Chair.    Chair …    Chair I cannot recall with certainty whether that actual question was posed with her – to her - rather.  Let me say this for the record Chair that as for forensic investigators who are tasked with perusing certain documents, conducting certain interviews with personnel who were involved in a myriad of transactions you are tasked with number one, reading documentation and making necessary deductions.  You have to reach certain conclusions because it is not each and every witness who is going to be one, willing to speak to you in the first place but moreover be willing to answer certain questions that would in any event seem as though you are laying blame or placing responsibility on them.  The Chair will recall that in any event yesterday we informed the Chair that whilst Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe had first - who was the lead interface insofar as the collation of documents were concerned for MNS Attorneys might not have been hostile but when it got certain discussions she was.  So in explaining that I am trying to point out to the Chair that it is not each and every detail that would have been interrogated with her in order to reach certain conclusions and having said that I would go further but not speak out of turn.  In relation to the approval of these costs Chair you will recall that yesterday we took you through prior to getting to this an email sent by Mr Garry Pita on 10 July.  In particular he requested that not only should she compile the documentation for the approval of the relocation costs but that she should also get the sign off from Transnet’s Internal Audit Team.  The Chair will note from page 9137 which we have just taken you through that not only is it not signed by a representative of the Transnet Internal Audit Team but there is actually no signature line that was ever added to the memorandum.  Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Thank you Chair.  It is now necessary for us to move to slide 29 to take you through the memorandum prepared in respect of BT.  The memorandum was prepared on the very same day.  It is to be found at Appendix 15 which is contained in volume 13 of the Chair’s files at 9129.    9129 being the covering page and the document beginning at 9130.  Chair I will read the memorandum just like I did with the previous one.    “The purpose is to one, request the Acting Group Chief Executive (GCE) to a, note the final outcome of the negotiation for the relocation to Durban with Bombardier Transportation SA (BT).  B, approve variation order for the relocation to Durban to a maximum value of R618 457 125 with BT and c, sign off a letter to be issued to BT to accept their final proposal.” Below that it says “The Background”. “On 17 March 2014 Transnet acting through its Transnet Freight Rail Division (Transnet Freight Rail) entered into various locomotive supply agreements with CNR – CSR, CNR, GE and BT.  After negotiations which started in February 2014.  During negotiations BT and CNR were informed that they will use the Durban Transnet Engineering (TE) Facility for the construction of the locomotives which were allocated to them.  The Durban Facility and the move were introduced to both CNR and BT after the tender had closed and evaluations were done.  Number four, on 10 June 2015 the Acting GCE – Group Chief Executive – approved the team to negotiate the relocation to Durban with Bombardier Transportation SA.  Five, TIA was present at the negotiations and are in the process of finalising their report.”    It seems to reference BTs.    Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    “If the variation order is not issued by 24 July 2015 the value of BTs notice of company proposed variation order will increase by 20 percent.  BTs current offer represents a total discount of 32.5 percent.  When taking into consideration the indicated potential price increase of approximately 20 percent in instances where by the notice of company proposed variation or the VO is not approved by TFR by 24 July 2015 (validity of BTs offer).  The 32.5 percent is the sum of the 10 percent absorbed cost of further price escalation the above mentioned 20 percent increase price after 24 July and a further 2.5 percent discount given by BT.” The following payment terms have been proposed by BT in accordance with Section 1.2 of Schedule 1 (Pricing and Payment Terms) of the    Indeed Chair.    It is drafted in that manner but it comes from the letter sent by BT to Transnet.    Is communicating.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Chair it is not explained.    In fact if one has regard to EXHIBIT BB8 …    And at page 95.    Yes Chair.        Chair Ms Sello says in attempting to answer the question when I am actually trying to compound the confusion even more.    Chair this is a letter sent by Bombardier Transportation.  It is dated 7 July 2015.    It is the covering letter of what was the final proposal sent by BT which as we have explained to the Chair did not change materially but for what is recorded in the letter.    It is addressed to Transnet Freight Rail.  It is for the attention of Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe as well as    It is titled   Latest.    Oh, apologies.    “We refer to our latest notice of company proposal variation submitted to Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) as per our correspondence which has a reference of BT/TFR/C/15/0034 dated  April 2015. As discussed into our ongoing discussions …”    Oh described.   “…into our ongoing discussions Bombardier Transportation has endeavoured to minimise project impact from the change of TE Facility from Koedoespoort to Durban.  As a further show of good faith BT is willing to offer an additional discount of 2.5 percent.  In evaluating the discount please take into consideration that this reduction in reality is much higher due to the fact that since our first offer notice of company proposed variation in 2014 we have already absorbed the following    In reading this letter …    But even on BTs own account insofar as this letter is concerned on 7 July …    Which notes the final offer made …    There is no talk or mention of a discount amounting to 32.5 percent.    Yes Chair.    Indeed it is so Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    I would like to say to the Chair at this moment that as we said yesterday there is documentation sent by Bombardier Transportation towards the end of 2014 …    Which will be provided to the Commission which sought to be explanatory or letters that were explaining or expanding on the offers of Bombardier Transportation to Transnet.    No we were not.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair if one has regard to the fact that the first offer in September 2014 …    Is some R634-odd million.    A 32.5 percent discount …    Would be much more significant than the amount moving from …    634 to 618.    Yes Chair.    No Chair we did not do the exercise based on the …    32.5 percent.    Yes Chair    Indeed Chair.    Chair having taken you through the approval process followed we now deal with the involvement or the limited involvement of Transnet Internal Audit…(intervention).    It’s an aggregate amount of 1.2billion.    Yes.      It’s just under 1.3.    Of both OEM’s, yes Chair.      Chair, I’d like to draw your attention to the fact that we’ve said the 23 May memorandum prepared by Mr Brian Molefe, insofar as it relates to 4.9billion rand for contingencies it makes mention of the use or the allocation of Transnet Engineering Durban facility in order to stimulate, amongst other reasons, the economic trade of South Africa along the coast line.  However, there is no line item that speaks to a certain number that then budgets for the “relocation”.  However, Chair even if there was, our view, based on the findings we have come to and what one would expect from standard contract management protocol, even if it was, that an exact amount of 1.5billion rand had been set aside, that would not excuse Transnet and its officials from reviewing, critiquing and seeking a justification from each of the OEM’s for the costs.  One certainly does not work from the premise that there is 2billion rand in the kitty and therefore if one claims a billion, which is 50 percent of that I’m going to be comfortable with it.  It’s something that we considered and we came to that conclusion Chair.    Indeed Chair, Chair just as an overview we cover this in our report, the Transnet Procurement Procedures Manual which was applicable at this time of volume 3 2015 requires that for any contract negotiation or variation, that exceeds 50million rand as an estimate must involve the high value tender team which is Transnet Internal Audit who must undertake through each and every stage of such negotiation, what are called, gateway reviews.  You will recall Chair that when we took the Chair through the transcript of the meeting held – rather the meetings held with each of the OEM’s on 19 June 2015 there was a representative from the high value tender team or the Transnet Internal Audit team.  Chair we’ve got a report from Transnet Internal Audit dated 7 June 2017, it is found in volume 13 of page rather at page 9147, it’s not necessary to take the Chair through the report because in the slide we highlight the salient parts.  They confirm that they attended the initial meeting held - or rather meetings held with each of the OEM’s on 19 June 2015.  The report specifically records that the lead of the negotiations Mr Anoj Singh was the Group Chief Financial Officer at the time, requested that the bidders submit revised proposals that would explain their offers in more detail and the report also confirms that a follow-up meeting was then scheduled for 23 June 2015 for further negotiations.  The report also then recalls that unfortunately Transnet Internal Audit was not invited to subsequent meetings where the negotiations for the relocation costs then continued.  The report also makes mention of the fact that a representative of Transnet Internal Audit Ms Emma Moletsane was copied in the email correspondence of Mr Gary Pita on 10 July 2015, in which, as we’ve taken the Chair through this morning, there was a request that Transnet Internal Audit sign off on the – to use the word loosely, the prudency of the costs of relocation, having confirmed that the necessary gateway reviews were undertaken.  As we’ve taken the Chair through it, it is made mention of in the report that, that request for a signature – a review never came through to Transnet Internal Audit and therefore the report concludes by saying that, unfortunately the Transnet Internal Audit team is not able to confirm that, indeed, the process followed was in accordance with what is required by the Procurement Procedures Manual.      Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair it is actually at page 9152, apart from noting it, and it is dated that he noted it on 8 June 2017, he has scribbled a note and I’d like to read it into the record for the Chair’s benefit. “in a letter to acting Group Chief Executive on 23 July reference is made to the effect that the high value tender report is being finalised.  I would like that the Edge VT report is produced.  Further all information required for same must be made available to the CAE”,  which is for Chief Audit Executive, the Chair will see that next to Mr Siyabonga’s signature is the name Ms Mmathabo Sukati who was the Chief Audit Executive and she has signed.  Chair the letter that Mr Gama refers to in this regard can only be the two memoranda that we read for the Chair, for the approval of the costs, the Chair will remember that under background and just before motivation it notes that TIA, Transnet Internal Audit, was part of the negotiations and the finalising the report.    Indeed Chair.    He is referring to himself Chair.      In the third person.    No Chair.    We found no record Chair.    Indeed it is a She.    Yes we did ask but it was never received.  Chair I would just like to note as well that the note in itself and the request to use the word used by the Chair yesterday is strange.  It is strange for the reason that the report from Transnet Internal Audit records that in light of the fact that we have not been able to fully partake in the negotiations out of, not our fault, we are unable as the Internal Audit Team to provide assurance that the process was followed out in accordance with the spirit and purport of what’s contained in the procurement policy manual.    Chair this was in 2017 – it’s 7 June 17 it is something that we did not read into the record but if the Chair is able to, we’d like to turn your attention to page 9151.      Chair I would just like to read the conclusion.    Chair the first date – the first page notes a date at 9148 as 7 June 2017.    9148, apologies Chair.    Yes Chair.      Indeed Chair.       Yes Chair.    I beg yours Chair.    Chair he comments on the actual memorandum.    Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Chair can we take you to 9148.    The subject reads HVT.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair as we’ve said we haven’t found a letter of 23 July, it can only be, in our deduction, the two memoranda that were prepared for him in respect of BT and CNR respectively for him to approve the relocation costs.  We say so because in the memorandum, it is recorded that Transnet Internal Audit was part of the negotiations and is completing its report.    Yes they were compiled on the 22 n d and everybody that signed and recommended did so on the 22 n d, he signed them off the next day on the 23 r d.    Indeed Chair.    In order to try and…(intervention).    Yes Chair.     And we would like to take you to 9151.    The request was that we read for you, Chair, the conclusion.    There are three paragraphs, they read as follows, “TIA was not invited for subsequent negotiation meetings  where negotiations on relocation costs were discussed with the bidders in attendance as required per the high value tender methodology.  Paragraph 7, despite the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer’s request for Transnet Internal Audit to sign off on the memo that was to be sent to the acting Group Chief Executive for approval, Transnet Internal Audit was not provided with the memo or the outcome of the negotiations or the letters of acceptance of the proposals by the acting Group Chief Executive.  Finally, paragraph 8 records, based on  Transnet Internal Audits limited involvement in the process  indicated above, a formal report to indicate adequacy and/or effectiveness of the process undertaken in the Durban relocation negotiations could not be produced”.     Yes Chair.    One would expect so Chair.    No there isn’t.     No Chair, we are not aware.    Thank you Chair.  Chair prior to taking you through slide 32 I’d like to give you context as to how it came about that we instructed the people that we instructed on behalf of Transnet to conduct an assessment of the relocation costs and the negotiations.  Having formed a prima facie view on face value that the costs of relocation of both OEM’s were excessive we deemed it prudent to acquire the services of a rail logistics company that also is in the business of manufacturing locomotives and would therefore have the necessary knowledge on how much it would cost to set-up production lines in the coast.  We then instructed Loliwe Rail Solutions, a team led by Mr Kevin McGill of the company to conduct an assessment for us and provide a report on the final proposals accepted by Transnet in respect of the relocation costs.  Chair this is to be found in volume 13 on page 9446, what we have tried to do for the Chair in slide 32 is to summarise the salient findings made by Loliwe Rail Solutions as an independent expert as it were which supports he prima facie view or views that we held in relation to the relocation costs approved and accepted by Transnet and basically Chair Loliwe Rail Solutions, in their report come to the following conclusions.  That there was no relocation of either OEM, that the variation orders were inflated intentionally by the OEM’s and inadequately evaluated by Transnet prior to the conclusion and approval of the amendment of the contracts.  That there’s no justification for either the direct or the indirect costs presented by BT and CNR.  That it was improper for Transnet to have agreed to lump sums for the relocation.   The Chair will recall that when we took you through the memorandum of – in respect of CNR there was a request that CNR be paid an upfront payment 323million rand which is 50 percent of what had been agreed to.  That the approval of the direct and indirect costs was done without the presentation of valid and substantiated documentation and finally, that the process followed in the approval of the relocation costs was not in accordance with the standard contract management protocol.  Just on the last point Chair, we’d just like to draw your attention to the fact that when reference is made to standard contract management protocol it is not a drafted standard by anybody who approved and gazetted by anybody but it speaks to the norm in the industry of manufacturing, construction and  engineering and what it actually points out is to the fact that if there is to be a variation that the parties accept is going to increase in cost because in certain instances what only increases, is the duration of a contract or a project.  If there is to be an increase in cost then there is an agreed amount that is reached or rather reduced to writing and people or contractors alike then claim on proven cost, to say, this is how much we agreed upon, this is now what I’ve produced, here are the invoices related to the particular claim and therefore you need to pay me this certain amount.  Chair arising from our prima facie view as well as the findings of Loliwe Rail Solutions we then take you through our findings which is the conclusion of the presentation and note to you our recommendations to Transnet.    Chair without speaking out of turn because we have been advised by the evidence leaders.    That a witness from Transnet     Will come and testify as to the payments done.    We can confirm     That insofar as firstly CNR is concerned.    An invoice was drawn for an amount – drawn up for an amount of R368 million this is inclusive of tax.    At 14% at the time and it was subsequently paid.  The details in relation to payment will be as we say…    Expanded upon by a different witness.    Insofar as BT is concerned.    We can confirm that as at the date on which Transnet took the decision to stop making payments in relation to the two variation orders an amount of R248 710 000,00 had already been paid in respect of its relocation costs.    Indeed Chair.    Chair the first and the most obvious finding that we have made is that the relocation costs were excessive.  I would just like to add to that Chair that it seems Transnet communicated to both OEM’s that they would be located at a different facility as opposed to the Koedoespoort that had initially been proposed or spoken of.  It is not clear as to why Transnet then chose to lock itself into agreements that would necessitate the execution of variation orders.  As I say Chair it is not clear and we have not been able to find the reason for this but it was certainly not prudent to conclude the agreements on the basis of one aspect that is clearly not going to be beneficial for Transnet.  Chair insofar as the approval of the relocation costs are concerned we have found that the former Group Chief Executive at the time Mr Siyabonga Gama breached the provisions of Section 76[3] of the Company’s Act insofar as he was required to exercise fiduciary duties and to take particular care and be diligent insofar as the execution of his duties are concerned in that he authorised the expenditure of R1.2 – an aggregate amount of R1.2 billion without satisfying himself as to the cost analysis that had been done by his team that negotiated on behalf of Transnet or a third party that would have been appointed by Transnet.  Chair this would have been reasonably expected of a Group Chief Executive, a person in his position who had been with Transnet at the time for well over fifteen years.  Had served not only as the Group Chief Executive but had the knowledge and expertise experience of being the Chief Executive of the particular operating division that was making the acquisition in this regard.  We have found Chair as a result that a portion of the amount which unfortunately cannot be quantified and it cannot be quantified for a reason I will explain amounts to fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  Because Chair you raised a question earlier on and you requested that I deal with it before concluding the evidence.  It is accepted that the tender proposals were based on one understanding.  It could be accepted by two parties – there is no entitlement – but it could be accepted by two parties contracting at arms-length that as soon as you change something as significant as my location then my price might change.  As I say Chair if it has not been provided for in the contract that we have signed then it must be dealt with by way of a variation order.  It having been accepted it would then have to have been quantified properly. In this case we found that it was not.  When one reaches the conclusion that the relocation costs were unjustifiable and therefore excessive there is the incurrence by Transnet of fruitless and wasteful expenditure which is contemplated by Section 1 of The Public Finance Management Act.  Chair we have also found that the critical aspects of the advice that had been given by PWC during the beginning of 2014 was not carried through.  You will recall Chair …    Yes Chair.    Chair I would like to say instead of a statement that says they would have been.    I would qualify it by saying they could have been.    And I say that or rather we reached the conclusion on the basis that it could very well be    That we contract on the basis of R54 million per locomotive.    And your base price and everything that you have included into the tender proposal or the agreement reached.    Is actually reduced     By your location.    So it does not…    Yes Chair.    Correct.    Agreed in full.    Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Chair I am going to answer yes and no.    Indeed Chair.    Yes Chair hundred marks.    Thank you Chair.  As we have said we have found that the advice that was offered by PWC was not carried through in the negotiations.  The Chair will recall that the two points of advice that we gave evidence in respect of yesterday were that the OEM’s were to be requested to justify their costs.  And that secondly if the costs were going to be prohibitive then Transnet were to seek alternative measures where loosely used in the report of PWC additional costs would not be incurred.  And we reach this conclusion having regard even to the fact that there might have been those concerns that were raised initially in particular we draw your attention Chair and take you back to the email correspondences shared between  the – amongst the negotiation team members where Mr Laher writes to    Chair…    Chair we confirm that we were advised by Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani his transcript is one of the appendixes to our report on relocation that the then Group Chief Financial Officer was the one who spearheaded or sought the actual advice from PWC and that he came back to them with a report from PWC and told them what it said.  So certainly the negotiation team prior to the conclusion of the contract knew of the advice from PWC.    Group Chief Financial Officer.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Chair we have found that there was a breach of the PPM by the entire negotiation or negotiating team of Transnet in particular Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe having been the lead interface insofar as she failed to deal with the concerns that were raised to the satisfaction of her colleagues and in the interest of Transnet.  We have also found that the concluded agreement or rather the agreement concluded between BEX and CNR is a very suspicious one.  It brings into question and to sharp light the question of fraud and corruption which we get back to when we refer to our recommendations to Transnet.  We make the point in slide number 35 that as an SCS which is Supply Chain Services Official and the lead interface for the negotiations Ms Mdletshe failed to adequately make use of an important internal structure even when she had been requested by the Group Chief Procurement Officer.      The Transnet Internal Audit.    Thank you Chair.  We have found that as – we already been highlighted that all members of the negotiation team those who recommended the costs did not act in manner that would have been expected of senior officials within the organisation of Transnet in their respective positions.  Chair in our recommendations and as a first base principle which is something related to a point that the Chair has raised this morning on invoices.  We have recommended to Transnet that the two OEM’s be requested to provide a statement and debasement of the monies paid in respect of relocation thus far.  We have also recommended that Transnet consider the whole issue of the variation orders related to relocation within the context of our findings in Volume 1 and to expand on that Chair just to explain in our legal analysis of the variation orders we have found that if the contract itself is unlawful for want of compliance with amongst other things Section 54 of the Public Finance Management Act then everything that follows from it is unlawful.  And so in the judicial review application that must now ensue Transnet must seek a just and equitable remedy that also incorporates the consideration of the relocation variation orders.  As a measure in order to limit the exposure already suffered by Transnet thus far we have specifically recommended to Transnet that they stop making all payments in relation to relocation. And finally Chair in relation to the CNR and BEX agreement that I said raises sharp interest and focus in relation to allegations of fraud and corruption we have recommended to Transnet that they consult law enforcement agencies in order to take the matter forward.  And that Chair brings us to the end of the presentation.    But when you talk about Mr Mnyandu and Mr Sedumedi these are lawyers     Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRERSON:  About 1, - I think it should be about one more than that, both are more than 600million…(intervention).    Yes I am at 9148.   Okay, alright, thank you.

ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Well at the moment I am feeling okay but if necessary I will let you know Chair.    No those are old files.    You can set them aside.  I am about to hand up a new file.    Chair the evidence under the auspices of MNS Attorneys continues.  The author of Report 2B is Dr Jonathan Bloom and he will testify in respect of that report.  May I hand up his presentation which is EXHIBIT BB8D.    It is based on MNS Report volume 2B.  I understand that during the course of his evidence Dr Bloom will on at least one occasion refer to the report.    2B.    Yes.    That report is in the files behind you Chair.    Chair the annexures and the report are volumes 8, nine and 10 I am informed but you will not have to go there.  What you have before you is sufficient for present purposes.  Then Chair the evidence goes to an explanation and expert opinion of Dr Bloom - we will qualify him in due course – but as a precaution the legal team the evidence leaders in relation to Dr Bloom requested this week that the Secretariat nevertheless notify those persons mentioned of the fact that that evidence has been given.  That elicited a response from Nedbank and after discussions between ourselves and Attorney Gerhard Rudolph of Allen & Overy representing Nedbank there was a request to place a statement on record which if    Then Chair if I may by way of brief introduction explain or state what Dr Bloom is going to put before you Chair.  As you know the purchase of locomotives from China the 1 064 or part of the 1 064 involved a foreign manufacturer delivering locomotives across borders into South Africa.  Transnet could not pay for these locomotives immediately.  It had to borrow the money firstly off shore in Dollars and then later locally a syndicated loan in Rands in South Africa.  The contracts involved payments to China North Rail and China South Rail in Rands in South Africa.  The money loaned off shore would be in Dollars and exchanged across the border into Rands when brought into South Africa.  Further Chair the loan would not be drawn in one sum - at one time - but in a series of tranches or amounts over a period of time.  These are referred to as drawdowns and over this period of time obviously exchange rates which fluctuate and interests would fluctuate.  Inherent then in such a loan arrangement are risks.  There is the risk that the exchange rate could alter to prejudice the borrower – Transnet – or the other way around.  There are interest rate fluctuation risks that higher interest rates might have to be paid over a period of time if a floating rate loan was entered into.  There are credit risks.  There is the potential risk of Transnet – the borrower – being unable to pay the interest on the loan in some time in the future and there is what is known as and what will be referred to as a further related risk a contingent credit risk and that is the risk that Transnet might be unable to pay because of external factors.  A downgrade or a collapse in the economy or something that might have the result external to Transnet but also to Transnet that it could not pay the loan.  Those are all risks that are attached to the transactions that were entered into and what financiers have done in their wisdom Chair.  They developed a range of instruments to address these risks.  Some more complex than others and Chair the language attached to these risks derivatives hedging, contingent credit risks and the like is a foreign language and the purpose – one of the purposes – of Dr Bloom’s evidence is to facilitate an understanding of this so that our understanding can be used later in dealing with other witnesses and making submissions to you Chair.  So the evidence will seek to explain these financial instruments that are used to mitigate risk, hedging instruments.  The evidence will also show how these hedging instruments and the transactions related – Chair just to save you the trouble I have had this introduction typed out.  I do not know if you want a copy.    So firstly Chair the evidence will seek – this is at the bottom of the page - to explain the use of hedging instruments.  Secondly the evidence will seek to show how the implementation and use of these instruments were manipulated to benefit – to prejudice Transnet that should be – not benefit and to benefit third parties.  Thirdly to show how the financial advisors involved benefitted from these financial transactions and fourthly to place an opinion before you that in the view of Dr Bloom internal resources could have been utilised by Transnet making it unnecessary to outsource for these costly exercises.  Once this and other evidence is given Chair the legal team and its investigators are obviously not limited to the MNS mandate.  Our investigations and evidence will go further and we will seek to build a picture of who made all these decisions.  When were these decisions made?  Why were these decisions made?  Who benefitted from these decisions and to try and establish …    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    And in fact Chair what Dr Bloom will help us with is to point us in the direction of those questions that we should be asking and also begin to build up some picture of possible answers and then the investigation and legal team will build on those hopefully to present before you a picture which might form the basis of findings that you may make which go much further than just the transactions themselves.  Finally Chair in accordance with the directive you have given this week we will in the course of – of the next few weeks prepare an expert report in the normal form with expert qualifications and the like to present to you.    May the witness then be sworn.    No Chair it is …    Yes.    We have tried to avoid in the first part …    And that is not long …    The reference to any specialist term …    And at the appropriate time we do intend to do that.    Yes.    Chair and – and I must say that for someone including that is not used to these terms …    Very often what an expert would do …    Is be confronted with a question about the proper meaning …    Of a particular term …    And then use another technical term to explain it which does not really help someone in my position and I understand your position too Chair.    So we will – we will and with your assistance Chair to stop us …    When necessary we will attempt to clarify …    An understanding of these instruments.    Yes.    In this field I am prepared to accept that we start from scratch.    Of course we do.    It is just a different language.    Dr Bloom first up would you tell the Chair of your qualifications and Chair in this regard may I refer you to the green divider at the end of your bundle?  You will see there an abbreviated CV.  You must …    Dr Bloom with reference to that would you please tell the Chair of your qualifications?    And would you tell the Chair please of your experience in the field about which you are to testify?    Your experience.    You will tell the Chair of the various financial instruments that financiers use and institutions use to mitigate risk in transactions such as the loans involved in the purchase of locomotives from China?    Do you have experience in studying these instruments?    Alright.  We will come to your actual work …    And what you learnt from that work during the course of your evidence but the question I am asking is a more general question.  You have - and I may ask it again when the particular opinion that you express is relevant – but do you have general experience in the study and understanding of the use of risk avoiding instruments …    In financing?    Okay.  You were part of the MNS Team that studied the transaction involved in Report 2B?    Over what period of time have you been working on this project?    Right and what was your brief in sum?    What is LOI and MSA?    Alright.  You have already introduced a word in the foreign language in which you are an expert – hedging.  Let us leave that for the moment.    But for the moment financial instruments used to mitigate risk.    And I have in my opening mentioned these briefly and you will deal with them in detail in due course?    As I understand it your evidence here deals only with the part of that part of the locomotives transactions involving China North Rail and China South Rail?    Right and as I understand it you have examined how the purchase of these locomotives were firstly financed.  Is that correct?    And you have also examined how the risks associated with the transaction - the loan transaction in particular – were dealt with.  Let us just put it that way for the moment.    If we may then go to your report and deal with what we have placed on record by way of introduction more methodically.  At page 2 you have an introduction.  Would you just take the Chair through that please?    Okay.  So before we proceed even before it enters into any transaction Transnet appointed advisors to assist it in obtaining a loan and determining how that loan would work - as I understand it?    Right and that transaction advisory contract was awarded to McKinsey in July 2012?    Tell the Chair of how the Consortium was initially composed please because we will see in the course of time the development of a transfer of the work to particular institutions which are central to the investigative work of the Commission.    You are at page 3?    Then let us go to page 4 and we begin to see changes in who the transaction advisors are.    If you could just bear with me.    I am just concerned that the progress on the screen is not as it should be.    We have wrestled control …    We have wrestled control from others over the screen Chair.    So we will take responsibility for any errors.    Yes.  That is – that is it Chair.    I hope it has been sorted out.    I am told it can.    I understand that Chair.    It was entirely in order to …    Take control of the screen.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    I can assure you that that would be very difficult with Dr Bloom.    One would have to first learn a new language.    Yes we are Chair.    Alright.  Can we go to page 4 please?  Just explain at a very high level what happened to the sequence that you outline here …    And particular the composition of the financial advisors.     And then what happened?     Just a comment, and I’m not sure that you’re equipped to deal with it, but ordinarily when entering into arrangements of this sort and appointing transaction advisors in such an important series of transactions, one would imagine conflicts of interest would be dealt with before the appointment of the consortium?     And then if you would go to page five please, there has been evidence and there will be more evidence concerning a session that took place in February 2014 and the proprietary in nature of that session but without going into any detail would you just tell the Chair please what happened then?     So if one reviews at a very high level, the sequence of events, in relation to the appointment of transaction advisors, one will see that initially Regiments was not part of the consortium but over a period of time in successive steps came to be the transaction advisor.     And the details of the manner in which this happened and any implications for our own investigations and evidence that, that might have been the subject matter of other evidence.     What does volume 2 (B), that is the report that you authored I understand it.     What does volume 2 (B) provide?     And that would be transactions related to the borrowing of money to finance the purchase of locomotives.     And the financial instruments used to mitigate against the risk involved in this loan transaction or these loan transactions.     So if you would just go to the second bullet then on page six and tell the Chair what your presentation entails.     When you say CDB loan, what is that talk of?     Right before you go on, the initial arrangement was that the loan entered into to finance the purchase of the locomotives from China would entail a loan from he China Development Bank in the amount of 2.5billion Dollars.     Then there was the change of mind and it was decided that only 1.5billion rand would be loaned from China, from the CDB.     And that another loan would be entered into which we’ve called the Club Loan or which was termed the Club Loan.     That was a loan entered into between Transnet and a syndicate of lender, principally.     For the amount of 12billiion rand.     And then if you would go over the page to tell the Chair what else you’re going to deal with.     Alright so when I borrow money I pay interest to the lender.     If – well in any situation whether it’s cross border or local those interest rates, as we know, fluctuate.     And what does – why is that a risk?     Right and then the second sub-heading there, fluctuations in the exchange rate, you will also deal with that.     Why is that – well as we know that would only be a risk if the lender is outside the country and the borrower is inside the country.     You’ll have money crossing borders and exchange rates.     Why is that a risk?     So if the exchange rate moves against the borrower or to prejudice the borrower it could find itself in a position where it could feasibly no longer afford to repay to the foreign lender.     Then the third category of risk is credit risk and you talk of two categories of credit risk what are those?     Volatile.     Volatile.     As I understand it and by way of summary Dr Bloom, in this case and in many other cases, the foreign lender for example the China Development Bank says, if you want to borrow money from me, I will lend you money in Dollars but you repay me in Dollars.     If you have a problem with the exchange rate, then you must deal with it.     And the borrower then, in South Africa, might be faced with a situation where the rand weakens it has to, in effect buy Dollars to make a repayment of the loan from time to time or repayments from time to time and might find itself in financial trouble or difficulty in repaying the Dollar amount     Due to circumstances beyond it’s control, correct?     So what it says is, I have a substantial risk, just arising out of fluctuating exchange rates, they may move against me, right I must insure myself against that risk and that’s what we’re going to attempt to deal with in part of the evidence that you’re about to give.     Alright, and you’re also going to discuss the charges that the service providers charged for their services in relation to these transactions.     You say in the second bullet in – or on page seven, and you’ve described how the services were initially to be provided by McKinsey Consortium and subsequently Regiments, what in sum were the services, if they were contracted to provide.     Right, so they would advise on how to obtain finance, capital raising you call it.     How those negotiations should be conducted and the final loan agreements should be structured.     And how Transnet should deal with the risks that you’ve talked about so far in your evidence.     What insurance policies you need and how these should be structured, I use the word insurance policy very loosely but it gives us an idea of what the third tranche of advice was about, that there are – that’s all there’s no real coincidence between an insurance policy and a financial instrument used to mitigate risk and we’ll clarify that in due course.  You deal on page eight with fees at a very broad level and you’ll go into more detail later what do you say there on page eight, will you tell the Chair please.     Or no success fee you use the word success fee later.     That’s fees for Regiments.     Yes somewhere in new regulatory instrument within Transnet there is a provision that advisory services of this nature, in other words, professional advisory services, even in financing should be charged out an hourly rate, effectively, are you aware of that?     And just on the face of it, to advise on a limited number of loans and a limited number of financial transactions to mitigate risk, 265million seems an extraordinary amount.     And you can say that from your own experience?     But you’ll deal with that in your evidence?     So if one looks at the information you’ve set out in the table on page 9, one can compare the total capital loaned by Transnet and the advisory fees charged by Regiments and actually paid by Transnet.  Could you tell the Chair of that please?     Just to revert to the make up of the 28billion rand, there was an initial China Development Bank loan of 2.5million rand only, right – 2.5billion, billion rand, sorry I have a cold so it may not have come across correctly, 2.5billion rand.     Sorry 2.5billion Dollars, only 1.5billion Dollars was actually utilised and then another loan replaced the 1billion Dollars that was the 12million rand Club Loan.     Right on page ten you deal with what you’ve termed irregular success fees, please…(intervention).     On page ten you begin to explain some of these – or some components of these increases because there were various increases that happened over a period of time and you deal with some of those in detail.     Please tell the Chair what happened in April 2015 please.     Alright we’re now back in April 15, as I understand the recommendation or the memorandum motivating approval of BADC dealt with the appointment by confinement and Chair has been told about confinement appointments of JP Morgan.     And they were to do two things, one they were to assist and advise Transnet, mitigate against the risks inherent in these loan transactions.     But also to lead and underwrite the equivalent syndicated ZAR loan of 1.5billion Dollars.     Right, so it was risks and advisory services in respect of the loan itself.     And then there’s also a contract extension to 265million, the 35million had by this time already been extended on occasion you’re not dealing with that.     But you’re dealing with an increase of 166million which allowed the full amount to reach 265million.     And that Mr Ramosebudi said to the BADC let’s give them a success fee or a performance fee.     And you’ve stated that, that wasn’t allowed in the original contractual arrangement.     What did the BADC – isn’t there a duplication here.    Or we dealing with different loans?    Right.    J P Morgan and in relation to Regiments?    No, no what – what transaction advisory services are the subject matter of the contract extension?    Right.    Right.  Let us stay with the insurance analogy for the moment.  We going to ditch the insurance analogy in due course but the insurer who insures against risk must have the capacity – the financial capacity to meet its obligations.    And you say that is why J P Morgan was considered and appointed as the for the moment insurer?    The risk mitigater counterparty.  Right.  But you say that Regiments already had a presence in that arrangement?    To J P Morgan?    So Regiments had a presence in both these series of arrangements?    But what did BADAC decide then after this recommendation was put before it?    So J P Morgan then was appointed with Regiments in the wings to deal with the risk mitigation aspect of this group of transactions that you are going to talk about?    And who was the lead underwriter – the leader and underwriter of the loan, the loans involved or the 2.5 – 1.5 billion dollar loan?    But Regiments was already in the picture because of the transactions you have already described.      Okay.  As the Chair has requested perhaps a thorough analysis of the agreements and arrangements.    Between Transnet and its advisors will be included in your final report.    That we will present.  But on the face of it a question that arises and I am not sure you can answer it now or it has been answered to date is there just seems to be a duplication in the recommendation by Mr Ramosebudi if one has regard to the wording you have used in your presentation.  Because if you look at the first bullet J P Morgan was requested to be appointed on confinement to lead and underwrite the equivalent syndicated rand loan of 1.5 billion dollars and it seems that the same appointment exists in the second bullet and had already been made in terms of the arrangement you have already described?     Is that correct?  Alright.  Then if you would go over the page please to page 11 you there deal with the success fee or performance fee and you make a comment, what is that?    Okay but there are two points you make.  The one is that the Transnet policies do not permit the payment of success fees.    Or performance fees.    Alright.  They are presumably too subjective and too random and incapable of precise definition.    Yes but in this case the success fee was just one component of a much larger fee?    It is not as if Regiments took any risk?    They just got an added success fee as a bonus or thank you?    But anyway you say that – you say two things I think or you have already said two things.  One is Transnet policy does not permit success fees.    And you also say that the original contractual arrangement did not permit a success fee?    Okay and then the second bullet what do you say there?    Then you make an important – then you make an important observation Doctor Bloom in the second bullet on page 11.  What is that?    Right.  And as I understand it and you may say this elsewhere it was not – it is not only your opinion the capabilities and expertise that resided within Transnet had been recognised externally as well.    What do Transnet policies say about that?    You talking of report 2B now.    Yes the same page numbers have been put in.    And they are in the top right hand column.    Alright Chair     Yes if one has the two pages in front of you Chair.    So if one jut turns it sideways that – the other way Chair.  So you have – you have unable to read the one page next to the other page.    If you look at the top right hand corner.    You will see the pages there.    Ah yes Chair we changed.    Chair can I assist?  Can I give you another copy?    Which is not – where the page numbers are not obstructed.    Page 6864.    Ja I know it.    I have been given another copy Chair.    Perhaps we could take that one back.    Alright.    Alright.  Doctor Bloom you have just quoted from the report which has in turn quoted from original policy documentation of Transnet.    In your final affidavit your final expert report we will obviously have to refer to the original document in force at the time these transactions were entered into.    And what you saying in sum is that where specialist units existed within Transnet there was an express policy prohibition against going out to the market for those same services.    So we are past one o’clock but perhaps if I could just finish this Chair.    So are you saying that that exclusion of treasury or the – let us put it a different way which is more accessible to us at least.  That the provision in Transnet policies which would have prevented going out to market was removed certainly in respect of treasury?    And that was relevant to further transactions that you are going to deal with?    Is this a convenient time Chair?    Chair may I just say     That we will in the report deal with the sequence.    Of appointments     And we will also deal with the sequence of cost escalation.    But they are also dealt with in report 2A.    Which is     Not within the province of report 2 B    But we will do it in any event.    Chair is this a convenient time?    Thank you Chair.  Dr Bloom before we deal with the contents of page 12 of your presentation.  I would just like to take step back.  You will recall your evidence that in respect of certain advisory services the McKinsey Consortium was the original appointee?    A series of events occurred the result of which was to introduce Regiments to larger chunks of the contract until eventually it ended up as the sole service provider for what was originally McKinsey’s contract.  Correct?    The question arises any – in any of those steps in which Regiments took an increasing part of the overall function contracted out by Transnet were proper procurement procedures followed?    No I just highlight that Chair to point out …    That that is part of evidence 2A but we will incorporate it in the report …    2B.    Volume 2B of the report but my instructions are that …    No procedures …    No procurement procedures …    Or open tender procedures were followed.    In each of those steps.    You have also told the Chair Dr Bloom that from 35 million – the original contract price – to 265 million – the – at least a final payment although it appears there were more which you have not dealt with in your report – several steps took place between the 35 and 265.  Correct?    One of them was an increase of what you refer to as the success fee?    Of R166 million.  You have investigated how that fee was calculated and with your experience and knowledge in the trade as it were you are able to give an opinion to the Chair as to how that was made up and whether that is within reasonable parameters or normal acceptable parameters.    That is the task we are going to do now.    So you say in the first bullet on page 12 that the invoice for R166 million excluding VAT was made up of two amounts.  What were those amounts?  We are on page 12 Chair.    And what do you say in the second bullet there – second principal bullet there on page 12?    Well let us – before we go there.    You have experience in the financial industry.  Correct?    And you have told the Chair that you have – and you must say yes because a nod …    Will not be picked up – and you have told the Chair that included in your raft of experience is risk management – financial risk management and the fees charged therefore.  Is that correct?    Right.  So you are able to make – pass a judgment on whether fees charged are out of the norm or within the norm and you are able to say what the norm is.  Am I correct?    Alright.  So what is the norm?  How is a fee for a Lead Manager and Debt Originator for a loan made up?    Let us deal with the first one – the amount of money.    What is that amount?    The original capital value loaned?    So the first term of art – we will get to hedging later but the first time of art is notional?    In any loan it is the original capital amount of that loan excluding interest?    Okay.  So that is notional.    Of course said there were two matters to bear in mind when one deals with the amount.  You have told the Chair that what one does when one calculates a fee is one has an amount and one applies a percentage then to that amount.  So my fee for example would be one percent of that amount?    Now you have also told the Chair that one could use the original capital value of the loan – notional – as the amount to which one applies the percentage?    But you could use something else.  What is that?    Is that always the case or does it depend on the agreement between the parties?    Let us not go to the percentage.    The Chair is just talking about the notional or the original amount of the loan.  Is it always what is mandated or is – could it be what loan was actually received?    No, but now you have said two things to the Chair.  So let us go back a step.  When you talk about a fee you talk about an amount of money on the one hand and a percentage applied to that amount of money.    Right.  So let us leave aside the percentage applied for the moment and let us just look at the basic amount of money to which you apply your fee.  The Chair asked you that amount of money is it what I as the borrower want from you the lender in my mandate to the loan provider.    Or is it what the actual loan capital amount is?  So the Chair postulates a situation where I could get to Regiments and I could say listen I want a R2 billion.  You come back or Regiments comes back to me and says sorry you cannot have 2 billion but I can get you 1 billion, right.  What is the figure on which the fee is based?    Okay.  So Chair I am afraid …    I hope that clarifies.    Right.  Now the – we are still in the amount of money box at the moment or category rather.  That – one amount that can be used to apply a percentage is the actual amount of the loan.  There is another amount that could be used.  What is that amount?    It is capital plus interest?    Now as we know from bond repayments if I take the capital amount of the bound that I have to pay and I add the interest I end up paying more than double for my home.  If I buy a home for R1 million and I take the full amount of capital plus interest I end up paying more than R2 million for it.  Is that correct?    So the yield to maturity as you have referred to is a far higher amount - much higher amount – than just the notional original capital amount?    Now I can choose either.  Correct?    Yes.    Right.    And what – sorry.    Okay.  Let us just …    Capital plus interest repaid over the full period of the loan you are going to refer to as yield or yield to maturity?    Right and we will always refer back to the underlying substance of the terminology when we go through your evidence.    So there are two choices.  I can use the smaller amount – notional or – and that is the industry norm you say?    But also it is not unheard of for parties to agree that the larger amount – the yield – is used?    Alright.  Now …    The next step.    No it suits me absolutely.    Except as with lawyers …    Financiers – it is not notional at all.  It is actual.    You can be forgiven for doing so but we will take it step by step.    Alright.  So you have two base amounts.  One the smaller amount – notional – or the bigger amount – yield or yield to maturity?    One applies a percentage to either of those amounts to determine the fee?    So I can say - and we will get to the actual percentages – I as the transactional advisor to you Transnet I want 1 percent of the smaller amount or one percent of the larger amount?    Do not get complicated now.    One would image however that there are also industry norms about the amount of that percentage or the size of that percentage one applies.  Is that correct?    And you are aware of those?    And you are going to tell the Chair about those in a moment but just at a conceptual level if we may – notional level – sorry – conceptual level just at a conceptual level one would imagine that if one is using the smaller amount the percentage would be bigger?    And if one was using the larger amount the percentage would be smaller?    What happened here?    There is a diagram on slide 12 Chair which attempts to explain this.    It is on the page that you have before you.    Smaller.    Within a range which is the market norm.    Smaller percentage.    Yes.    So by way of example if there is a loan of R100 1 percent would be R1?    That is notional.  If at the end of the day I finally end up paying R200 but I still want 1 percent what am I paying?    R2.    Alright.  So let us – let us deal with your diagram or the diagram that we have discussed if we may.    Which – but you have translated them to Rand?    Okay.    Right.  So in actual fact the two – the R166 million - at least in large part - fee was calculated as you have set out here.  It was based on notional.  Well that is going too far too fast.    I am sorry.  We start with a notional.  That is the basic amount of the loan – original capital?    Right.    So that is capital plus interest over the full period of the loan?        Well let us what the norm is first.  The norm would be - if you are going to use R18 billion what is the industry norm in relation to the percentage that you would apply to R18 billion?    (Intervenes) if you take the lesser amount you could achieve between 0.2 and 0.5 percent.  So that is the right hand column?    Is the norm?    Now please tell the Chair if you used the yield - the higher amount – the R102 billion what percentage could one apply as the norm?    Alright.  So if we want to – let us just have this picture reflect the norm for the – to start with because the right hand column reflects the norm.  Correct?    So in that box underneath ZAR102 billion if we want to see the norm let us put 0.01 percent.  Correct/    Okay.  So we now have a picture Chair if you are going to use the bigger amount …    If you want to be more or less within the norm …    Of 102 billion you would use a factor of 0.01.    If you were going to use the lesser one 8 billion – 18 billion – one would within normal parameters use 0.2 and 0.5 which is a far higher percentage …    Than 0.01.    Okay.  We are on the same page so far.    What did Regiments do?    Alright but let us take it step by step.    A norm which you know - from your experience and in your opinion that you are giving to the Chair – the norm is if you use the higher amount you use a lesser percentage?    If you use a lower amount – the notional – you use a higher percentage?    And you are saying to the Chair what Regiments did was they used the higher amount and a higher percentage?    So let us just summarise there.  You have a higher amount and a lower amount as the base on which you apply your percentage to calculate a fee?    If you use the lower amount the norm says you can use the higher percentage?    If you use the higher amount the norm says then you must use a lower percentage?     If you use the higher amount the norm says then you must use a lower percentage, logical.     What Regiments did was to use the higher amount and a percentage beyond market norms.    Is that correct, alright and you explain that then on page 13.     And you say that the fee Regiments charged .15 on yield is equivalent to .85 on the notional amount of 18billion, right?     And if one goes back a page you will see the norm there is .2 to .5.     And if you do the math they were .85 if one bases it on the notional amount of 18billion.  In short what you’re saying is that it was beyond market norms.     Let’s pause there, because  you have two sources of information on which you base your expert opinion, right.     The one is your own experience in the financial industry, financing industry, correct?     The other is your examination of what happened historically in Transnet?     And against the norms produced in the industry and produced in Transnet itself was the Regiment’s fee within those norms or outside of those norms?     Both, both the Transnet practice and industry norms?     If you go to the third bullet.     Okay if you just go back.     Right, and when you say market convention is to base the fee calculation on notional, a smaller amount.     You’re saying that there may yet be exceptions?     And if one uses by way of exception the higher amount then the percentage should be much lower?     Logic.  Alright so what do you say then in the third bullet, if Regiments was to use notional?     So you take 18billion which is the original capital amount.     Market norms say you must charge .2 between .5% on your calculations they charge .85 which is beyond the norm and that is a substantial amount you say.     Right the next bullet you say if however Regiments were to say, as they did, we don’t want to use a smaller amount, we want to use the larger amount.     The larger amount being 2billion as opposed to 18billion.     Then the percentage fee that the market would ordinarily dictate would be what?     Well here you say in the fourth bullet 0.06.     I’m afraid you lost me there and I’m sure the Chair followed you to the letter, let me take a step back if I may, in the fourth bullet you talk about market convention and Transnet practice, I would imagine in telling the hair what market convention and practice was you are referring to an external norm, do you follow what I say?     So what would that external norm be, if one was to apply the yield to maturity, you told us that a minute ago on page 12.     Alright so in fact we should correct the fourth bullet, if we’re talking about market convention and Transnet practice, rather than your complex calculations.     Well it’s not from that perspective, it’s the words in bullet four.     Okay, so can – would you be comfortable if we took 0.06 out, I’m sorry to – my apologies for setting your calculations aside, we’re talking about external convention and Transnet practice, now whether it’s external historical facts you say that would produce a figure of 0.01.    Can we go to the next bullet.    Sorry Chair.     And they had a skilled treasury to guide them in this regard.    Yes, as I understand you’re comfortable with that?     Alright.     And in fact did Regiments charge    On the higher amount, yield.    Now was that within market norms?     Was it slightly out or ...     Well correct me if I’m wrong, it’s 15 times the amount?     Of course the question that we will ask in due course who made these decisions, why did they make them, when did they make them and for whose benefit, we begin to deal with those question in future pages.       Right, so in the sixth bullet you come to a conclusion and what do you say there?    Well one way of looking at it is 15 times more than it should.     And you’ve put an estimate on that, we needn’t go to how you calculated that because we’ve got enough maths to do as we go along.  What is your – in your opinion the overcharge estimated to be?     Alright let’s go to the last bullet you qualify everything that you’ve told the Chair up till now and if you do the math there’s an overcharge on your estimate and in your opinion of 90million rand.    But what is the point you make, finally on page 13?    Let’s just summarise to there, the analysis that you’ve done up to now to which loan did that relate.  Remember we had the 2.5billion Dollar split into 1.5 and 1billion, right and then we had further amounts.  When we’re talking about the 12billion Club Loan that you talk about on page 14, you have told the Chair that the 1billion Dollar portion of the 2.5billion was shelved.    And it was – what was – it was replaced with a 12billion rand which was then, presumably more or less equivalent to 1billion Dollars, not really but almost, the 12billion rand replaced the 1billion rand, portion of the 2.5billion.    Now that was a loan raised domestically, in South Africa.     Fromm a syndicate of lenders.    We’ll talk about that in due course.    Alright you deal with that loan on page 14.  If you could just tell the Chair of those facts by way of background that appear on page 14.    We know that out there in the market place interest rates fluctuate.    Interest rates are determined in various ways, we have the repo rate which is determined by the Reserve Bank but it varies from month to month almost.    Right but in any event if you enter into an agreement with a floating interest rate, you pay a rate that is undetermined, fluctuating and unpredictable.     And you’ve told the Chair that, that’s sometimes risky.     For the borrower at least.    Okay what happened on the 12 t h of May 2015 in relation to the Club Loan?    Right, were Regiments involved in some way?    Okay what happened then on the – we go to page 15 on the 27 t h of August 2015?    As parts of the lender?    Who were they?    And then what happened on the 1 s t of October 2015?    The BADC?    Okay now Trillian come onto the scene.    A month before or in the previous month, September 2015, you deal with this in the last bullet of the next page but let’s fast-forward there for the moment…(intervention).    So 1 October JP Morgan moves off the scene and Trillian enter the scene.    For the Club Loan.    Yes sorry so that’s on 1 October.    But something happened that is significant for our big picture Chair.    A month before or in the previous month and that is dealt with in the last bullet on page 16.    And that is contained in the volume 2(B) report, what happened?    So Trillian enter the scene in October 2015.    In the previous month Salim Essa about whom we are here, a substantial amount, in due course became the major shareholder in Trillian?    Let’s go then to page 16 if we may, what happened on the 17 t h of September 2015? DR JONATHAN ZOHAR     (indistinct) must I pause there or…    Yes that’s correct.    The first bullet on page 16 you say what happened on the 17 t h of September 2015, what was that?    Noted chair and it will be in the comprehensive report, I take that point Chair.    I believe that, that memorandum is part of the 2(A) report but I understand that when one has a sequence of events as has been presented one wants the detail in that   presentation.  It doesn’t help to have to go to other bundles to find out what one wants, so I understand your concern Chair and we will meet that concern.     Yes, well Chair you only have to deal with hundreds of thousands of pages at the end…    We understand Chair I don’t want to make light of it but it’s a real issue.    So you were at the first bullet on page 16 describing the sequence of events.    Now this is the agreement between Transnet and Trillian it is not the actual loan itself?    No well we know from your later evidence that the load was actually signed on the 23 November.    2015 but we getting there.    Right because that date is important when compared with the events that occurred in December    Let us not go there yet.    In relation to the loan concluded…    A few days later.  It may be that that is actually the title of the agreement but we will check.    And perhaps in brackets in the report we will     Describe it so that there is no confusion.    Alright and then in the last bullet you say what you have already told the Chair that a month and two months prior to these events Mr Salim Essa enters the scene through Triallian?    Right let us move to page 17 where you comment on the fees charged by Trillian.     Now let us just     Establish this.  Trillian is appointed in terms of an agreement dated 18 November 2015.    We know that and you will tell the Chair in due course in a different context that the loan for which it was appointed was entered into days later?    In fact a few days later?    Five days later.    And given that its appointment is finalised contractually on 18 November 2015 what happened in that very same month?    Alright so let us just look at the time sequence because that is instructive in itself quite apart from anything else.     It is appointed in November.    On the 18 t h.    Right.    The agreement is entered into on the 23 r d the actual loan agreement for which it is appointed to advice.    And arrange.    Right five days later.  In the same month it issues an invoice for R93 million for being the lead arranger for that loan.    Just having regard to the dates and in your opinion is it likely or probable that they actually did any work?    2015 Chair.    2015.    No 23 – so I am sorry Chair 23 November.    The same month, five days later.    That loan for which it is appointed to arrange and advise is actually entered into.    You will not find it yet Chair.    It is yet to come in a different context.    But not only can you express an opinion I understand Doctor Bloom by reference to the time periods and it would seem that that would accord with common sense and at least to Chair’s legal experience and my own legal experience and the legal teams legal experience but you actually looked at the documentation?    It is not as if you making your conclusions just based on the timing?    So what do you say in the second bullet by way of summary having examined the documentation?    Why do you say that just in summary?    Alright that is your second point.    And that had already been done you say?    And this is all part of the report 2A am I right?    You make – you draw a conclusion in the last bullet on page 17 what is that?  This is your opinion.    Remind us.    That leaving aside whether Trillian was actually that.    Alright.  Let us move on then to a new topic and here we are going to talk of risk management and your opinion and regard to how the risks that you have told the Chair existed in relation to these loans were managed and what financial devices or financial instruments were used to address this risk?    But as the Chair says we have got to take a step back and explain what hedging derivatives risk management is all about?    Yes.  That will be our task Chair.  I would like to heed the request of the Chair that before we start dealing with these specialist terms we actually explain them.  So if we may just deal for the moment with the second bullet on page 19.  Right?    In respect of the China Development Bank loan the 1.5 billion dollar and the club loan the R12 million club loan, syndicated club loan raised domestically right.  There are certain risks that the borrower undergoes.  You lending or you borrowing rather huge amounts of money – billions right.    Right you borrowing money from China – China Development Bank.    You borrowing the money in dollars.  You bringing it to South Africa converting it to rand, correct?    When you repay you take your rands and you convert them to dollars so the exchange rates both on the receipt and repayment of the monies?    And the risk that you have told the Chair about is the fluctuating interest rates?    You take out insurance.    For the moment.  We will ditch that analogy soon.  For the moment it is good enough.    The second one?    That is where it is attributable to Transnet?    So let us leave page 20 for the moment and go to page 21.  In explaining the terminology we are going to concentrate on firstly the club loan, the R12 million domestic club loan.      And the risk that is addressed in this diagram and in your further evidence is the risk of fluctuating interest rates.    Alright.  So let us start – Chair on page 21 with the right hand diagram.  Okay.  There you have a lender that is the club.    And you have the borrower at the bottom of the page Transnet, correct?    And you have the content of the loan.  We will learn as a matter of fact because we are only wanting to understand terminology which you are going to now use frequently in your evidence.  For illustrative purposes but we know that at the end of November 2015 Transnet enters into a loan agreement with the syndicate to borrow R12 billion on a floating interest rate, correct?    What is the risk attached to that type of agreement?    So if Transnet at the borrower – as the borrower says look I have now borrowed R12 billion on a floating interest rate I have no idea well research institutes can advise but never with certainty.  I have no idea with any certainty what that interest rate is going to do and I therefore am at risk.    So what does it then decide to do?    Alright but before we go there let us just explain a term.  Let us leave derivatives out of our terminology.    At least for the moment.  Transnet says I want to find a way using financial institutions to deal with this risk.  I want to mitigate the risk or I want to ensure against the risk and I use that term very broadly and soon we will not use it anymore.  I want to hedge my risk.    So what does hedge mean?    So let us just deal with one issue that I think is important to deal with because it becomes important later.  You can never guarantee the interest rate in the right hand box unless you enter into a fixed rate agreement.    Now the decision of whether to enter into a fixed interest rate agreement or a floating interest rate agreement is something you are going to deal with in due course.    But anyway what happens here is that Transnet decide to enter into a floating interest rate loan – R12 billion – a lot of money, right?    It cannot ever guarantee what the interest rates are going to be it is at risk.  So what it does it says I want to protect myself against the consequences of what I have done.    Alright.  So whilst you can never guarantee an interest rate what you can do is say if things do not turn out well for me I can at least put in place another financial arrangement separate from this to mitigate the adverse circumstances of the decision I made to enter into a floating risk – floating rate arrangement.    Alright so what is important because we talk about swops?  Right you talk about swops.  Noting is swopped.  That original agreement on the right hand side remains the same.    Throughout your obligation to pay a floating interest rate remains.    So when we talk about swops we are talking about something entirely different from that word might indicate?    Okay.  Right so let us go to the left hand…    Alright so…    Alright.  Hedging broadly speaking as I understand it is what you have described as the act of using financial instruments to deal with your risk?    More particularly to protect yourself against the consequences of you having entered into a risky arrangement?    Right.  So hedging is the broad term used to describe the taking out of financial insurance as it were?    So if the hedge protects.  A financial instrument called a hedge would also protect?    But a swap is one example of a hedge?    Swap is one way in which you can hedge your risk?    Or protect yourself against risk?    Right.  The question arises of course which we deal with later is why this risk should have arisen in the first place.    But we will come there and that is in fact a central part of your evidence?    In fact the question arises if you are now going to spend a lot of money hedging your floating interest rate risk why did you enter into a floating agreement in the first place?    Because Chair you will learn that mere weeks after entering into a floating interest rate loan of 12 billion Transnet commits itself to the spending of hundreds of millions of Rand to put itself in the position it would have been in a worse position but on a fixed rate basis.    Correct.    Well …    Well you will hear Chair …    That this insurance policy arrangement …    This hedging arrangement in a form of a swap …    Was really very harmful to Transnet.    It lost a lot of money but that …    We are getting there in due course.    But we will get there Chair.    We will get there.    At the moment we are just at the level of principle.    Okay. You wanted to say something.    Do not confuse us please.        So at the moment we are just describing the hedging instrument.  The fact that it turned out to be a poor instrument which caused even more loss to Transnet.  We will deal with in due course.    But for the moment Chair we have hedging as the utilisation of a financial instrument in order to mitigate against your risk.    A swap is a form of hedging.    And we are now going to describe what a swap is.    So when one hedges – and in this case enters into a swap arrangement one does not swap anything with the original lender.  Your obligations remain fixed?    One can put a wall around that right hand box.  That stays the same?    So the lender consortium are sitting happily in their offices in Sandton knowing that they are going to get their return - whatever the interest rate might be?    And you remain liable to pay it?    But what …    And I do not want to stay on the point for too long or dwell on it but you have already told the Chair that a lender may require a borrower to mitigate the risk of a downturn in the economy for example?    So that is an exception to the rule that you have just put out?    Yes, alright.  So let us get back to the box on the left hand side if we can.  We now have Transnet saying I want to find someone who I can deal with to mitigate my risk of having entered into a floating rate loan of …    R12 billion and those parties Transnet on the one hand and the party that Transnet will deal with are called counterparties?    In the – in the terminology generally applicable …    In the circumstance.    And then the term is used elsewhere but here that is what the term is …    For both parties?    And we know that in this case Nedbank was the counterparty?    And Transnet was the party seeking assistance or seeking insurance or seeking to enter into a swap arrangement to mitigate its risk?    Right.  So explain to the Chair Transnet says oops I am at risk.  I need help.  Correct?    It goes to Nedbank and says I want us to enter into an arrangement called a swap?    Which will protect me from the risk that I have entered into.    I want you – Nedbank – to insure my risk.    How is that achieved?    Sorry – may I pause?    If one was to extend – this is where the insurance analogy fails, right.  If I was to insure against any risk for example my car being stolen I would pay a premium determined by actuaries and determined by the insurance company and if the event occurred I would be compensated for the loss of my car?    That is not how it works here?    Okay.    Okay.  Let us deal with that second leg.    Sorry may I interrupt you here?    When Transnet goes to Nedbank and says please I want to enter into a swap arrangement to protect me against the risk because I am scared that they are going to go very high and I am not going to be able to pay, right.    Transnet wants a situation that it wants to pay a fixed rate?    So having entered into a floating interest rate agreement it is now going to pay a lot of money ultimately as we will learn to achieve a situation where it is going in effect when all the books are balanced pay a fixed rate?    So what is a swapped is the cash flow arising out of a floating interest rate with a fixed rate.  Now that maybe going too fast.  So you have got to unpack that slowly please.    The point that the Chair raises is for our purposes a very important point because if you look at the left hand side of the diagram – the left hand box.  Counterparty Transnet and counterparty Nedbank enter into an arrangement completely separate from the static arrangement on the right hand side – the loan.    Nedbank as counterparty to the swap arrangement has nothing to do with the consortium of lenders in the right hand box.  It is an entirely separate third party?    Yes but …    Notionally – and I am sorry to use that word because I am now using it in the correct sense – notionally they are separate.    Correct?    And the transaction in the right hand box remains intact?    Nothing is swapped in or out.    Correct?  In the left hand box however it is an entirely separate financial arrangement with entirely different financial obligations that are not dependent in anyway on the financial obligations in the original loan agreement in the right hand box?    Okay.  So we are dealing with a separate arrangement with not separate parties but Transnet with a different hat on.  It is now protecting itself against risk?    And a counterparty who is entering into an arrangement to deal with Transnet in that aim?    And the aim in this case in swap arrangement which was a hedging instrument would be for Transnet to be in a position where it knows and has certainty about the interest rate it will pay.  In other words    In other words akin to a fixed interest rate?    Alright.  So you tell us then please how this deal is structured and how it works.    Sorry – you said they would pay the interest.  You must be careful here.  They are not paying the interest that arises from the agreement between the lender and the borrower in the right hand box.    They are paying a fixed rate.    Not the fixed rate.    The fixed rate belongs …    No, well – they are paying a fixed rate negotiated between Nedbank and Transnet?    They are paying an amount equivalent to a fixed rate?    But let us not get into that detail.    It is important Chair in an entirely separate transaction.    Alright.  So just to summarise.  In the right hand box of this diagram on page 21 Transnet has borrowed R12 billion at a floating interest rate.  Those obligations remain fixed for the duration of the loan?    Transnet sits down however and thinks about what it has done and says but I think interest rates may go through the roof.  They may go to such a high level that it is going to put us in financial difficulty.  Correct?    So it says I need to find someone – a counterparty – in this case Transnet to enter into a financial arrangement to hedge my risk.  Correct?    It then sits down with a counterparty Nedbank.  Now Nedbank on the other hand (intervenes).    Then I was wrong.    Yes.  Transnet sits down …    And says – did I say Nedbank?    Late Friday afternoon.  I could easily have said …    Alright.  Well let us – let us not argue that point (intervenes).    Yes.  The borrower says look I have entered …    I have - now I am thinking about it.  I have entered into a loan arrangement with a floating interest rate.  What if interest rates go through the roof?  I better protect myself.  So it goes to counterparty Nedbank and moves into a discreet separate transaction using a swap as a hedging instrument.    Right and it says to – Nedbank on the other hand say your fear may not be so real.  I will insure you, right?    I will let you pay me the equivalent of a fixed rate and I will pay you floating rate.    Right.  So if interest rates go through the roof all you have to pay me is the fixed rate.    I will pay you the floating rate and then you can pay your lender.    So Nedbank also takes a risk now in this hedging?    Right.  So let us just talk about the insurance policy – the hedging – the swap – for the moment.    At huge costs.    Yes.    Chair it is 4 o’ clock and I do not know what your arrangement are (intervenes).    But I just what to highlight two issues …    If I may at this stage?    You have raised a very important point …    Which is fundamental to the evidence to come that within days of entering into this floating rate agreement Transnet is entering into the swap arrangement on the basis of a fixed rate.  The second point is the fixed rate in the swap is much higher than the fixed rate it would have entered into on a market loan and the added point is the only party benefitting here - the only parties to benefit from this arrangement are the service providers who are arranging these swaps.    Not Transnet.    It is all at the cost of Transnet.    So Chair the question arises is why was it done in by this way.  By whom was it done for whose benefit and those are the questions that arise in this testimony and hopefully will be answered in full by the end of the …    The Transnet testimony as whole.    Monday we have a witness …    Who must be called on Monday.    So it will have to be fitted in after that and I will discuss it with you Chair having discussed it with the legal teams planners.    The planning is rigid around that I am afraid given the travel arrangements …    Health and planning …    But maybe …    Chair …    Almost a day.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Correct.    Chair and we will when we resume review this particular point    We will make sure that we understand …    The terminology to allow us then to …    Refer to these concepts …    As we do frequently.    Because these – this swap arrangement …    Hm.    Is fundamental to …    A point that the witness will make.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    It will be next week.    Given availability.    Yes. Yes, Chair.    Yes it would.    Hm.    Yes two days have been allocated to the witness.  10 o’ clock would be in order. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Jonathan Zorah Bloom.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    (duly sworn, states)    Thank you Chair.  I hold a BCom Degree with majors in statistics and finance from Stellenbosch University.  An Honours BCom Cum Laude from the same institution.  A MCom Cum Laude from the same institution.  A PhD in Business Management with the Corporate Finance Specialisation from the same institution.    That is right.    Correct.    From Stellenbosch.    Yes.    All the degrees.    No.  Unfortunately there is no cum laude for a PhD.    Chair I have had the opportunity to – to consult on various financial matters to financial institutions in the Financial Services Industry.  Also from a finance point of view in the Development Industry where – where Stellenbosch I held the position as Professor of Real Estate Investment and Financing and the idea behind that was that we – we prepared students for a chartered financial analyst qualification and I was part of the team that did that.  So for the last 22 years although I was part – at Stellenbosch at that point in time as well I had the opportunity to consult in the industry and ja.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  I – I investigated as part of this assessment the – the various instruments used and unpacked them to understand what Transnet did or what the service provider that assisted Transnet did in the execution of these instruments.  So the focus was essentially on the instruments used to hedge the risks related to the financing.    Yes.    I do Chair.    I do Chair.    Correct Chair.    Chair since September last year and it continues.   My brief consisted of several components.  It started off by looking interestingly enough at the local content contributions and assessment thereof of the – of the OEMs specifically the China North Rail and China South Rail Locomotive local content.  It moved to understanding the advisory services that were provided through an LOI and an MSA.  In other words (intervenes).    The Letter of Intent and the Master Services Agreement that was actually testified to in this Commission by Mr Sedumedi in volume 2A and then after that I moved over to understanding how the – how several transactions were introduced in the financing of the vehicles and how the hedging of those – of the – of the risks associated therewith was – was done.    Okay.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  Chair this is a – this is a prelude to the – to the actual work but it is necessary to provide the context in what – in which the work that I did actually happened.  So the presentation deals with Transaction Advisory Services and as Mr Pretorius indicated it refers to 232 diesel locomotives from China North Rail and 359 electric locomotives from China South Rail.  So as – as part of the introduction Transnet appointed Transaction Advisors in 12 to provide it with a Transaction Advisor Services related to the acquisition of 1 064 locomotives and Transnet awarded at that time the Transaction Advisory Contract to the McKinsey Consortium in July of that year.  The scope of the contract was amended from time to time.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    The McKinsey Consortium Chair was led by McKinsey Incorporated - the South African branch of the company.    Page 3.  Correct Chair.  Comprising of McKinsey Incorporated as the main bidder, Letsema Consulting as the co bidder and then several sub-contractors - Advanced Rail Technologies, Nedbank Capital, Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs – ENS – (indistinct) Young Incorporated and (indistinct) Capital.  Sorry Chair.    Chair you are correct.    Chair …    On 22 August 2012 Transnet raised a conflict of interest between Letsema and (intervenes).    No problem.    Well Chair the…    No we dealing with the 1.5 billion CDB loan.    Only that loan in respect of these…    In relation to Regiments that is the 265.5 million.    That [indistinct].    Yes I understand.    Correct Chair in other words they were – you – they were paid to do that work under the transaction advisory contract.  In other words that was not the – and it – there was no reason for the need to – to engage in a success fee arrangement.    Chair that is - that is a duplicate – that could be a duplication.    The – that is possible yes.    Chair yes I can maybe just add.    To enlighten that point.    That in this transaction when J P Morgan was appointed when they started this Regiments was their supply development partner.    So they were part of J P Morgan and then they were – it appeared that they were still doing other work and being paid. So what the arrangement between Regiments and J P Morgan was I am unclear about.    But it appears that they did not have the in terms of hedging the – or in terms of mitigating the risks Regiments could not do that part of the exercise because J P Morgan had a very strong balance sheet.    And in order to have sufficient financial muscle you would need a firm such as them.    So I will look into that Chair.    And come back to you.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    As the supply development partner yes Chair.    Correct.    It appears so.    Chair they decided BADAC or the – decided not to appoint J P Morgan to lead and underwrite the US dollar 1.5 billion loan.  In other words that one – one recommendation that was made to this committee was removed at that point.  So only – the only thing that J P Morgan was – was mandated to do in terms of this approval was to essentially hedge or mitigate the risk related to that loan.    That is correct Chair.    Well Regiments – Regiments arranged that in terms of or they – they were – they – because BADAC did not approve J P Morgan’s appointment for underwriting or lead and underwriting that was taken over by Regiments.  And the under – the – who underwrote …    Correct this was in addition to the work.    Correct.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair as we – as mentioned previously no success fee Transnet does not permit success – the charging of success fees so no success fees should have been charged or paid as services performed as part of the transaction advisory services for Regiments as they had already been appointed and this issue will be dealt with separately.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes Chair it is a – it is essentially about what percentage you want if I can put it that way and what is the amount that a percentage is being applied to?  So yes it – from a success fee basis it is a question of you take risk if you doing it on that basis.  In other words if you are not successful in terms of what your mandate is then you do not get paid.  If you are you do get paid.  But that was not Transnet policy.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Correct.    Yes Chair that is true.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    As part of their transaction?    Correct as part of their transaction advisory fee.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.  As you correctly pointed out the success fee is on top of the advisory fee.    For which they have already been paid.    Correct Chair.    Chair in 2014 when the – the CDB loan was being negotiated and concluded Transnet had a – or Transnet had a funding team that included three highly experienced funding managers and an analyst.  Between them they had cumulative experience of in excess of fifty years in fund raising in most capital markets.  So as a consequence one begs to ask the question why was it necessary to engage an external party to do the work where the expertise and capacity existed within Transnet at that time.    That is correct Chair.  Yes because there is – the people that were – if I can put it this way the – the treasury department with – and aligned with the funding team were recognised and we will see that later as well in a survey as being one of the best treasuries in the world in 2010 which – which points to the fact that that would not occur if the necessary capacity and skills was not available within the institution.  So yes that – it just – one just wonders why was this particular situation allowed to occur.    Chair in terms of the Transnet procedure procurement procedures and procurement manual the PPM by leveraging third parties to lead an under – to lead, arrange and negotiate the CDB loan while having a full capacitated internal debt raising team.  And I would like to Chair if I may refer you to a page in the – in the report.    2B.  Report 2B it is page 6864 on the left hand – the left hand page.    06864.    Otherwise I can…    Chair if I could assist?    Yes you are.    6864 yes Chair.    Okay.  Thank you Chair.  Okay it is on the left hand – in the left hand page on that double page.  Paragraph – I would like to refer to 16.2 which is – which is amended Transnet Procurement Procedures Manual version 3 dated 1 June 2015.  And I would like to refer to the first paragraph which is 16.2.1. and just read it by way of explanation?  Chapter 8 of the said manual refers to the identification of strategic specialist units but what is interesting is that in this particular manual in the amended one the treasury is not included as a strategic unit.  And therefore in 8.3 that refers to the compulsory utilisation of specialist units the manual states the    Except for the fact that in this – as you can see this was in June 2015 and that was prior to – so this was changed then when it came to further ana – further utilisation of internal units.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair as a – in other words that – that would have permitted if in terms of the PP manual as amend – PPP or the PPM    PP manual as amended that would have resulted in them having – having the ability to go out to the market.    Because the strategic units such as treasury in this case is excluded.    That is correct because this was 14.    And this was – this was 2015    Correct.    But Chair it will become applicable when we proceed further that is why I have highlighted it here so I can just refer you back to that section 8.3    Yes from the 1 June 2015.    That is correct Chair.    It appears to be so.    That is correct Chair I think what is important just to note is that we are specifically talking about the funding side.    We will still get to the     Use of the treasury when it comes to the mitigation of the risk instruments.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I am – I am unsure about that.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Okay.    An amount of 152.7 million  - 0.8 million – for Lead Manager and Debt Originator services related to the CDB loan and Chair there were two other amounts which are combined in the second bullet which refer to assistance Regiments purported to provide for certain of the hedging instruments that we will discuss later. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Correct.  So there were – there were specifically two of the instruments that we are going to discuss through the testimony that relate to fees or relate to that particular component of the 166.    The one based – where it says based on my financial (intervenes)?    Okay.    (No audible reply).    Yes.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.   Okay. Chair there are two components.  It is normally a value.  In other words the – the amount to which the percentage of the fee – the percentage that is – that is the fee is calculated.    Yes.    That amount could also be two components depending on – on what decision is made.  The first component would be on the – on the capital value.  In other words for instance if you are applying for a home loan and you take – and it is R1 000 or R1 million or whatever the case may be and somebody is taking a fee which is a percentage.  It would be a percentage of that.  That is the capital value.    Correct.  It is also referred to in the trade as notional.  The notional value.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Chair that is …    No it is fine.    Chair that would be per agreement.  In other words if – if I was for instance sourcing a loan for you we would agree that this is the amount of the loan and that would be …    That is correct.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair because that is what you are looking for.    So that is – that is my mandate.    That is correct because that was – that what was not part of the mandate.    The mandate was 2 billion.    It is about the – it has got to do with the agreement between the parties because what might happen is that the percentage changes.  If I …    No, with all the fees.    It would be – it would be on the loan that is actually received because that was what you were able to achieve.    Correct.    That is correct.    It will be 1 billion.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair that is a – that is an amount which includes an aggregate of all the repayments made over the full term of the loan.  In other words it includes all the costs in everything that is involved with – with regard to that loan.  It is referred to yield to maturity.  That is just the term for it but it is a - let us put it.  If I can put it another way – it is a much higher value than what we were referring to as the notional value of the loan in the previous example.  So this is – this is the amount that is repaid in aggregate over the full period of the loan.    Capital plus interest and over the – over the tenure but there is – yes we can leave it there.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.  Can I …?    Chair yes.  It depends on what agreement is reached between the parties …    But the norm in the industry is a percentage on the notional value not on the higher value.    That is the – that is the norm.    That is yield to maturity.    Yes Chair.    Chair the yield …    I think rather see the – when we talk about a yield …    We talk about the interest rate.    That is applicable over – over the entire period that is to maturity …    Over the entire tenure of the loan.    So …    Plus all the capital.    No Chair you are doing well.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes it is used but it is – it is more the exception to the rule.    Very much so Chair.    Notional.    Value.    Or notional amount is right.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.  Normally …    Okay.    Yes Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair if we can maybe look at the numbers that will be – that will be adequate for the explanation in - on slide 12.  If we …    Yes Chair because the value – the notional value – is a lot smaller if one wants to put it that way - than the yield to maturity regime.  In other words it is a much smaller number because remember as we discussed the yield to maturity includes all the repayments and all of that over the maturity.    That is correct Chair and that is what why the percentages become important.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Two.    Chair the diagram relates directly to the R1.5 billion loan from the CDB on the …    Yes correct.    So let us start with the - with the right hand column if we can.  The notional over there is R18 billion.  So in other words that represents the US$1.5 billion loan from the China Development Bank that in Rand terms it is 18 billion.  Just by the way Chair this is the information that Regiments used in the calculation of their fees.  So that we can just align as well.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    This is – this is merely by way of example that the notional is included here because the way Regiments did the calculation was on the yield to maturity.  So – so essentially if we can move then to the - the left hand portion of the diagram the yield – the yield to maturity of that $1.5 billion loan was R102 billion.    Over the full duration maturity.    So the R102 billion …    Is the yield – it is the yield to maturity.    Correct Chair.    What happened then was Regiments took …    Chait that – that differs what – what the market is – what the market dictates and – and who you are talking to and whose prices – whose pricing you are comparing with who etcetera.  So to say these – this is exact – this is what the percentage would be is – is almost impossible.    Correct.  So …    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  So in the – at the time when these transactions were ongoing the – the basic rates that one could achieve or the percentages, fees that one could achieve in the market was between more or less 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent.    (Intervenes).    That is correct Chair.    That is correct at the time of the transaction.    Chair that would be about 0.01 percent.  It would be 0.01 percent or less.  This is not what is stated over there but …    But Advocate Pretorius has asked what the norm is.    So if we compare what is stated over there 0.15 percent …    To what the norm would be which is 0.01 percent …    This is 0.14 percent more.    Ja.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair, yes.    Regiments applied 0.15 percent to the yield to maturity which is a rounded figure of 102 billion and if I may the – if you do that calculation then you would get to the 152.7 billion – ag – million that you – that is stated at the top of the slide.    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct.     That is correct Chair even – if you want to you can compare the – the lower percentage of on the notional side.  In other words the 0.2 compare that to the 0.15.  It is only slightly less …    But the basis on which it was applied was substantially different.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Correct Chair.  So then on the 22 September of that year 2015 the recommendation to replace J P Morgan with Trillian was submitted to the GCE and the appointment as indicated on the previous slide was approved BADAC on the 1 October 15.  On the 18 November of that year the club loan facility was signed by Mr Daniel Roy of Trillian, Mr S Gama was the acting GCE at the time and Mr Garry Pita who was the acting GCFO at the time.      I understand that – I am not a hundred percent sure on that item Chair I just need to check.      Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    So Chair in November.    Sorry.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Correct.    Chair Trillian for the work that they purported to have done issued an invoice to Transnet for a figure of R93 million inclusive of VAT which they as I said purported to have rendered as lead arranger for the club loan.  And I would like to just clarify even if they did not do the work which I – I will further talk to a bit later Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    Correct.    No Chair.    I am unsure about …    I am unsure about the date Chair but it happened in November should it – I am assuming it would have been around that time.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair …    Chair it would have been months because if you recall.    This was a syndicated loan.    And there were five parties.    Involved.    So you would need to enter into agreements, loan agreements will all those parties negotiate with all those parties.    Etcetera, etcetera and loan negotiations    Is not a – is not an overnight process.    It takes time and a number iterations    And so on.  So from a timing perspective these just do not add.    Chair I cannot answer.    If the work was done was J P Morgan.    That is correct Chair.    Yes by Regiments.    Yes.    Yes.    Not at all Chair.    Well that the appointment of Trillian was irregular that is the first point Chair.      Because Trillian were not the party that did the work in this – given the time frames and everything like that they were not the party that could – that did the work it was Regiments that did the work.    Correct.  And that is why it is irregular.  In other words they were invoicing for work that they did not do.    Correct by Regiments in that context and that is why Trillian could not have done the work that they charged for.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.  What – if one takes – looks at the situation from when the deal was signed in other words on the – that Advocate Pretorius was referring to the 23 November for the club loan all the work that preceded that would have been done because the contracts and the loan agreements etcetera would have been in place.    So somebody would have – somebody must have done something.    But it could not have been Trillian.    Now Chair the R93 million invoice that was submitted to Transnet by Trillian purportedly as part of transaction advisory services was – was – appears fraudulent, irregular, unjustified.    And notwithstanding was – the work that was paid – or the money that was paid to Trillian for not doing the work and they further flouted Section 8.3 of the Procedures and Procurement Manual as we have discussed before.    Which is the necessity to use specialist units within Transnet with the necessary capacity and skill and this is – remember we are talking about a loan here so it would have been part of the debt raising department so that was the – that was available that skill was available to use. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    No Chair not in my opinion.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Chair I have had no engagements with any of the parties.      Except for Mr Ramosbudi but this was when I started the process in September as I indicated previously.  It was an initial discussion to try and get an understanding of how things fit within the treasury but also in terms of certain – of the transactions but that was only one engagement and there was no further.    Correct.    Correct Chair. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Chair in the context of the transaction there were three risks that were addressed or that were – were mitigated.  The first one had to do with the exchange rate. In other words the borrowing of the – the US dollar funding from China and converting that into South African Rands and then repaying them in US dollars that related to the CDB loan.    Correct.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.  You want to try and remove the risk by – by using the instrument.      You take out insurance correct.    Okay.    The second one has to do with the possibility or the probability that there could be default of interest payments that are attributable to the borrower that is called – Chair that is called credit risk.    That is attributable to Transnet correct Chair.  And as Advocate Pretorius also indicated previously this particular instrument that was used here had a contingent component and that meant that there was a further risk mitigation that had to deal with potential circumstances that are beyond the control of Transnet for example certain economic events as we said down grading and those types of events that could – that could cause interest rates to increase significantly and could place liquidity pressure on the borrower.  So it is – this is a mechanism to try and cover that.  This is a – that type of instrument is a very difficult instrument to understand and we will see later Chair that that instrument was actually Transnet would not have had the ability or the capacity and the skill to be able to do that.  That is why J P Morgan were involved with that particular instrument but we will see that later.  And the last one Chair has to do with the interest rate movements and this was only applicable to the 12 billion club loan.  So it is important to understand that there were no interest rate risk mitigation that was considered for the – or for the CDB loan but that would have been – that was covered in the exchange rate as well.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes Chair that could also – it has got – there is a flip side if you like to that.      And that could mean that this was a requirement     By the lender.    Because that protects by – by introducing this instrument    You would be protecting the lender.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    This is specifically the borrowers concern Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is right Chair.    Correct Chair.    Well the risk lies more with the – with the borrower because the interest rates depending on the environment within which one is functioning, the economy etcetera may result in interest rates increasing significantly placing further liquidity pressure on the borrower so entering into a floating rate or a variable rate regime would be – would – that would be the risk that would be associated therewith.    That is correct Chair.    Well then it can enter into a risk mitigation measure which is called an interest rate swop which is the left portion of the figure.    Ja.     Correct Chair.    Hedge means – very, very simply put Chair hedge means that you taking the risk away or you removing the risk from a potential negative situation but in order to do that we will get to that it costs money.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.  That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair that …    Chair that is not – that is actually a very good analogy.    Because that is essentially from the borrower’s side what you want to do …    You want to protect yourself so let me take this money and enter into an arrangement that is going to take any risk out of out.    So if I wanted to almost seclude myself in a sense if I can use that …    As an example.    Then I am going to put a hedge around me.    If I can …    Relate to you on that Chair.    Thank you Chair.    That is correct.    That is right Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    No I think Chair …    No, I will – I will not Chair.  I think the – I think you are referring to Mr Mahomedy …    Of Transnet …    I think I am – my testimony is going to unpack …    A lot more - the figures and numbers that he …    Referred to and with certain updates as well.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    No Chair.    Not necessarily.    I think it is – it has got to do with – it has got to do with the ability of the borrower to meet his obligations.    So in – and also to remove risk which gives them certain – then gives further certainty in the …    In the context.  So it – it is not necessarily that it would come from the lender as a – as a requirement …    But if - if you take a view or if Transnet were taking a view on – on interest rates then that would be an important consideration …    In the decision to either fix or to enter into a floating agreement.    No Chair.  No you are absolutely right.    In this particular context …    It would mean that the lender would – would cover his risk …    With risk in the interest rate that is charged.    So a higher interest rate would mean I perceive more risk …    In the person who is borrowing this money from me.    The – the converse of that …    Is the - where the borrower says listen but I am a little uncomfortable with what potentially could happen going forward in the next year or two or whatever the case maybe …    And that I need to do something about that to protect my cash resources.    It is a – it is very much a cash flow and a cash flow issue.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is possible.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is right.    Yes Chair.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair there is normally – let us – let us look at …    Yes of course.    That is correct Chair.    No.    There is – there is a second leg to it.   Okay. Chair when the two counterparties come together and start discussing the whole or the potential of entering into a swap arrangement then they would – because we are dealing with interest rates and we are going to be dealing with that a lot through the testimony I would like to use that as the analogy.  In other words both parties would have different or should have different views on interest rates.  The one is saying interest rates are going to go up.  The other one is saying interest rates will go down or will stay – or will stay more or less stable.  So you have to have the two opposing views to enter into such a transaction.  Now when it comes to the …    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Okay.  So Chair …    Yes Chair.    And a party a financial institution.    A third party.    That would be interested in becoming a part of a swap agreement.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  In this particular instance they were also part of the lending.    (Intervenes).    Correct.    That is right.    That is correct Chair.    No.    Correct.    That is right Chair.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    So Chair because there are two parties the one – the one is to pay – because Transnet wants to enter into the fixed rate in other words or assume a fixed rate on the - in this particular context.  They would pay the fixed – the interest using the fixed rate to the counterparty Nedbank.    They are paying the fixed rate.    A fixed rate.    Ja.    In this context.    Correct.    That is right.    And Chair Nedbank would do the same.  In this particular case they would be paying the floating rate.  So – so they – they would have the view that interest rates would remain stable or might increase slightly or whatever the case may be.  So that would as I – as I indicated previously they have to have opposing views in what – how interest rates would move but what is important to understand it says there pays the floating rate and – and Transnet pays the fixed rate.  The – they do not literally pay the rates to each other.  They would – they would – because there is a – we are talking about an amount.  The one – you would calculate the amount using the floating rate and you would calculate the amount using the fixed rate and you would substrate the from each other and depending on how the move – the interest rates have moved only the net portion – the net part of that amount – would be paid to either or one of the – either of the parties.  Does that make sense?    Okay.    Correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair that …    It can be the same Chair.    It can be the same.    Correct.    No there is no norm in that regard.    It depends on the transaction …    And it depends on the parties involved.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair they do if – if the – the rate – the floating rate starts to increase then it is to the benefit of Transnet because remember they said they – they worked on a certain floating rate.  So if that – if floating rates start to edge off or rates start to edge up then – then that would be to the benefit of the – of the party that is paying the fixed rate.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair that …    Absolutely right and that is actually …    A fundamental part of the testimony …    That we will get to.    Correct.    That is correct Chair and as I said that would be – that is going to be a fundamental part of - of how …    Of the evidence and the timeline.    That we are talking about.    Thank you Chair.    Pleasure. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Certainly Chair.     On the 22 n d of August 2012 Transnet raised a conflict of interest between Letsema and Barloworld, it was based on this conflict that Transnet advised McKinsey or the McKinsey Consortium to consider the replacement of Letsema.  At the date of the appointment McKinsey Consortium excluded Letsema and it was replaced by Regiments.     That’s correct Chair.     And then subsequently Regiments would also replace Nedbank and Utu who were a consortium on their own or a partnership on their own, due to the conflict of interest as a member with the McKinsey Consortium and this occurred on the 19 t h of October 2013.     That’s correct Chair because typically you would ask the consortium members, do they have any conflicts of interest and it – and then that would be – in other words they wouldn’t be able to participate as a consequence so yes, you would sort that out, or you would address that right in the beginning.     Absolutely Chair, it’s all part of…(intervention).     Correct it’s all part of the procurement process and the evaluation.     Yes Chair on the 5 t h of February 14 McKinsey purported to cede their rights and obligations to Regiments for the transaction and that related to the 1064 locomotives and what is important in this context is that Regiments was now responsible for the whole of the advisory services.       That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     It provides a technical analysis and comment of the transactions, the regular transactions concluded by Transnet on the advice of transaction advisors.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair that would be a typical situation to…(intervention).     Correct Chair.     Chair the presentation and the work as well entitled the services and analysis of the services rendered by the transaction advisors, principally Regiments and he fees paid to them, that’s the first part.  The second part, the loans that Transnet concluded to purchase the Chinese locomotives which covered, and I think this is important to provide context because this is actually where it starts, a requirement existed for a loan of 2.5billion US Dollars to finance the Chinese locomotives that we are talking about…(intervention).     It was the loan that was sourced from the China Development Bank in China and that was for an amount of 2.5billion.  What happened, subsequently, is that, that loan was split into two portions, 1.5billion that was drawn down as Advocate Pretorius also indicated in the introduction and a further 1billion that was reserved as a facility that Transnet could draw on should the need arise.  There was – just related to that 1billion rand facility Chair, there was not – there were no commitment fees that Transnet paid and we will see later that, that was shelved in favour of, what is the last bullet on that slide, in favour of a 12billion syndicated South African Rand Club Loan.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair the – what else is assessed is the risks associated with the loans and the processes to mitigate them and there’s specifically, as Advocate Pretorius also indicated, there’s specifically three type of risks that we are interested in and that are applicable to the transactions.  The one refers to interest – movement in interest rates…(intervention).     Correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Because Chair, what can happen is, is that you borrow money at a certain rate which is fluctuating, which is variable and if interest rates increase it will increase your cost of borrowing.     Yes Chair.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     As we saw, the money that was borrowed was from the China Development Bank which was 1.5billion Dollars, that money had to be transferred to a South African bank and it arrives here in Dollars and because the contract with the OEM’s for the payment of the vehicles is in rand the money – the Dollars had to be converted to rand.  So if the rand starts to weaken then the cost of that borrowing also increases because they would want their money back in – the repayments on that loan they would want it back in Dollars.  So that places the borrower of the funds at risk.     That’s correct.     The first category is the …(intervention).     Chair I think basically what it boils down to is, that when the lender, especially a foreign lender finances something in a currency other than their own, then they would expect to obtain the repayments on that loan in the currency that they lent that, in other words US Dollars.  So they wouldn’t be worse off if I can put it that way, the risk shifts entirely to the borrower because the borrower is expected to pay in Dollars and therefore, in this particular case if the rand had to weaken substantially that would result in a tremendous cash outflow for the borrower.     That’s entirely correct Chair in other words – but they would never do that because they wouldn’t take the risk.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Char.     Yes Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair, in other words you’ll be paying less because the rand is strengthened so it’s working in your favour.     That’s entirely correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair related to the raising of the finance, in other words accessing the finance for the acquisition to also deal with the – or structuring the deal in other words the negotiation of that loan and other advisory services relating to the mitigation of risk.     That’s correct Chair.     Correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair it – as previously discussed by other witnesses an initial contract for the advisory services was fixed at an amount of 35.2million, and it’s important to note Chair the words in parenthesis or in brackets where there was no performance fee payable.     That’s correct no success fee however, the role of Regiments expanded so did the fees payable to it but if I could continue, the contract value increase, in other words the capped amount of 35.2million…(intervention).     Correct Chair, in December 2012, increased to 41.2million in February 2014, increased further to 78.4million in April 2014 and by July 2015 the amount that was paid to Regiments was 265.5million.  Just by the way Chair, these amounts exclude VAT or tax.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair that’s correct and that is also the norm that advisory companies or firms charge their staff out is at a hourly billable rate.     Yes Chair it is – it does appear to be excessive.     Yes Chair, especially if – it would be very difficult to – you would have to have a tremendous number of people at very high rates working on that contract for an extended period of time to get even close to that number and as a consequence that is – that appears extremely excessive for the purposes.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair in rand terms the 2.5billion Dollars that we’ve been talking about translates to 28billion rand.  If we take the fee paid to Regiments, the 265.5million, excluding VAT that would represent about – almost one percent of that loan amount and as said this is well above the capped fee of 35.2million which is, as indicated, that is quite excessive.     Correct Chair, Dollars.     Yes Chair the 12billion.     Chair if you give me one minute I’ll tell you.     Chair that would imply a difference of 754 percent.     Correct Chair.     Correct.     Correct Chair.     That is when – Chair that is when Transnet’s Group Treasurer, Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi submitted a memorandum to the Board Acquisition and Disposal Committee of Transnet BADC (indistinct) for inter alia, the following two points. The confinement of JP Morgan to hedge the financial risks, in other words to mitigate the risks which referred to interest rates, credit and currency and – which emanated from the 1.5billion CDB loan, that was then back into South African Rands and there’s a second part to the first bullet there Chair, that refers to also lead and underwrite the equivalent syndicated ZAR loan of the US Dollar.  In other words, that is to arrange the loan for 1.5billion Dollars, it’s the same – so the one is to hedge the risks or to mitigate the financial risks and the other is to actually negotiate the loan. So there are two points in the first bullet.  In the second one, to also motivate the contract extension of 265.5million, the number that we’ve just spoken about for the appointment of Regiments Capital for an advisory or an Transaction Advisory Service and to support the Transnet 1064 locomotive transaction.  It sought to justify the extension of the contract by proposing a success fee of 166million and we’ve heard previously Chair, that success fees and performance fees were not permitted.  So this seems to be a bit irregular.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     No.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Correct.     That’s correct.     Correct, ja.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s right Chair.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Yes Chair well beyond market norms.     Yes Chair, so as was indicated by Advocate Pretorius the 0.15% which we know of on the yield, is equivalent to the 0.85% on the notional value, which is the R18billion that we've used.  The second point refers to the market conventions and Transnet practices to pay lead arrangement fees on notional and not on the yield to maturity as Regiments did or claimed.     That’s right.     Correct yes.     That’s correct Chair.     Outside of those norms.     Yes Chair that’s correct.     So that is what we’ve been discussing, so the – based on market norms or conventions the fee would have been charged of 0.2%, between 0.2 and 0.5% on the notional value.     That’s correct Chair.  In other words the fee that is payable is calculated on the notional value and not the yield, that’s what’s the norm in the market.     This was a – it depends, lead manager and debt originator is in this particular case a consolidated term if I can put it that way, so it was – it depends on if you’re the lead manager you are the debt originator in certain cases, but the, what we’re referring to here is their – Regiments requirement or the Regiments that acted as the lead manager and debt originator for which they’re claiming this fee.     That’s correct Chair.     100% correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     So if we assume that the market norms or we accept that the market norms in that period of time were between 0.2 and 0.5% and if you look at the first bullet Chair the equivalent, in other words in the 0.85% that’s what one would be comparing this with, which indicates that Regiment’s charged excessively higher fees on their notional equivalent than what the market norms were.       Correct.     Correct Chair, I didn’t calculate it but if one just subtracts the 0.85% from the 0.5% one gets a good indication.     Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.       In the region of 0.01% in other – ja I said previously.     Okay let me explain that now it’s – what happens is if one reverses the calculation so if we want to compare something, so what I did in terms of the calculation I said if the market norm is between 0.2 and 0.5 and I took the average of those two, which is then 0.35 and I compare that, if I take that percentage as an assumption and I compare that to what the – what would that be, in other words I’m doing the calculation in reverse, so how much percenta would that be on the yield to maturity, not the 15 basis points, 0.15% sorry Chair, that Regiments charged but if through market conventions then it should have been 0.06% and 0. – ja.     Yes Chair.     0.01%.     No Chair the – what that 0.06 represents is not the – yes from that perspective you’re right.     Correct, that would be if the fee was based on yield market convention and Transnet practice it would dictte a percentage of 0.01%, that’s right.     Correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    Yes Chair Transnet as far as I understand and in the discussions that is what they do, they would use market norms and conventions in order to price certain transactions.    That’s correct Chair.    I’m comfortable with that Chair but I think we shouldn’t lose sight of the 0.06% ...(intervention)     For a different point.    I will come back to it.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    0.1 ...(intervention)     0.15%.    No Chair.     From – if one compares 0.01% to 0.15% it doesn’t sound like a big difference but on a very large amount it makes it a substantial difference so that’s why ...(intervention)       That’s correct.     Yes Chair.    I believe so Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair that Regiments charged a fee that is not nearly in line with market convections and Transnet practice.    Yes it’s way out of line Chair, that’s correct.    Yes Chair.     Chair based on – and these calculations as I indicated previously are based on the data that Regiments used in their calculation of the fee, so if you look at it from the perspective of they charged 152.7million and you use what they did and you convert then they’re overcharged by 90million, in other words 152.7 minus the 90 is what the fee should have been based on the data that they used but that, as we’ve determined that is well beyond market convention.    Correct Chair.      Chair this relates – the last point is the that Regiments should not have been paid any fee for this work because as we determined previously, there was sufficient capacity and knowledge and skill within the Transnet Funding Department or the Debt Raising Department as it was then to perform the required function.  So in my opinion there was no need for Transnet to actually outsource this function to an external party.   That’s correct Chair.    Chair I never came across any documentation which purported to indicate that, you know, that there was insufficient capacity or that this – these are the types of fees that could be charged for the nature and the scope for the work that was being done.    Correct Chair.    Yes Chair the 1billion Dollar which was shelved in favour of the 12billion Club Loan.    That’s correct Chair.    Correct.    Yes.    Chair as we’ve discussed the 1billion portion of the 2.5billion US Dollar CDB loan was shelved in favour of the 12billion syndicated Club Loan.  What is important just to note, which we haven’t spoken about yet is the duration of that loan, in other words how long will it be till it gets paid off, which is 15 years and that it was concluded using a variable interest rate or what we term – if I can introduce another term Chair, the floating interest rate which is the same as variable interest rate on the majority of our loans.    That’s correct Chair, we’re going to talk about that a lot.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct.    That’s true.     Chair on the 12 t h of May, JP Morgan was named as the preferred bidder to lead, arrange and underwrite in other words we can see those – we can take those three concepts as one if you like for now, the Club Loan and there was a letter issued and signed by Mr Anoj Singh where he indicated to JP Morgan that they would be the preferred bidder for this work.    Regiments was the supplier development partner of JP Morgan as indicated previously and they were part of that process.    That is when Eric Wood who was the CEO of Regiments and Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi the Transnet Group Treasurer, they agreed to conclude the 12billion Club Loan and there are five parties that participated in this syndication for that loan.     Correct Chair.   Nedbank that contributed 3billion, the Bank of China 3 billion, Absa 3 billion, Old Mutual Finance 1.5billion and Future Growth 1.5billion.    The Board Committee dealing with this process…(intervention).     BADC, approved the memorandum approving the replacement of JP Morgan with Trillian in respect of lead arranging and underwriting services for the loan.    That’s correct Chair.    In order for Trillian to participate in the – as part – in the transaction and also to become a service provider, Salim Essa became the controlling shareholder in Trillian in September 2015.    Correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    That was when the acting GCE, Mr Gama submitted a signed memorandum to BADC requesting the appointment of Trillian as the lead arranger of the Club Loan thereby replacing JP Morgan.  A couple of days later, on the 22 n d of September…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, so the first entry of Regiments into the Consortium was to replace Letsema?     Well beyond market norms and you tell us by how much you estimate that to be on page 13, so if you would just take the Chair through page 13 please. 
BLOOM: This was then prior to the…(intervention). 
DR JOATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct.
