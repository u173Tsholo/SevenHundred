CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Are you ready?    Thank you.   Yes.    Zondo.    Not Zuma.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  The other aspect which may be needs consideration may be whether before I make any decision if I have to make a decision whether the President who has the power generally speaking to amend the terms of reference whether if he is apprised of this issue and the facts whether it might be within his power to decide whether he amends the terms of reference in such a way that I do not deal with that issue.  I just mention that because subject to what I will say just now ordinarily the President would have the power to amend the terms of reference of a commission at any time.  And the current terms of reference specially have a provision that says; I hope my recollection is correct; it says the terms of reference may be varied or amended.  Now I think there is something to that effect in the terms of reference.  I hope I am not confusing it with the regulations.   Of course in certain respects this commission is not a normal commission in the way of how it came about.  Ordinarily a commission comes about because the President makes a decision on his or her own based on whatever information has been placed before him or her to make a decision to establish a commission.  But in this case the then President as far as I recall was not just against the commission being established but the courts had to be approached to compel him to appoint a commission and the idea of a commission did not come from the President it came from the former Public Protector and the former Public Protector in her remedial action effectively prescribed how the commission should be established in the sense that she said the Chairperson must be appointed by the Chief Justice.  One of the issues I had to consider after I was appointed was that ordinarily I would have preferred to sit with other people and not alone and be in a panel for a matter such as this.  But there was a complication because the question would arise how those people would be appointed because if they were simply appointed by the President you could have a situation where the President appointed two other people whose decisions could be a majority if we did not agree and I could be the minority and then the public could have certain concerns because the Public Protector did not say anything about other members being appointed.  So there were some complications so the question may arise also whether if any appointment is to be made how it is to be made of anybody.  Is it a matter that should the current Public Protector have a say as the successor to the previous Public Protector?  Should the Chief Justice have a say?  Should he not have a say?  So it is not all very easy.  So there are those issues but while not decisive the fact that the two persons who are directly affected oh well actually three have all said they have absolutely no problem that I hear all the evidence.  That is an important factor.  But as you say it might not be decisive.  It may well be that given the fact that one this commission has very limited time to complete its work and the evidence of Mr McBride and the evidence relating to Law Enforcement has been adjourned two times it may be that one should look at a practical way of dealing with this and it appears to me that the suggestion you make may well be a useful one and the practical one.  Namely that I do not make any decision – final decision now but I do hear the evidence and maybe as you say maybe invite you know the public and maybe I could consider maybe in writing legal professional bodies to brief counsel to come to address this issue so that I hear other submissions but it may well be that a consideration also should be given whether there is any role that should be played by the President in regard to the issue.  So – so I am inclined to once say I am not making any final decision that I might have to make earlier if it is really necessary.  But two, I – we continue I hear the evidence and in due course an announcement maybe would be made as to exactly what is to be done in relation to inviting the public to make submissions and or the GCB or the Law Society or all – and other legal professional bodies to maybe make some submissions and then we take it from there.  I – what do you say to that, is that …?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay, thank you.  I know that there is legal representation for one of the persons – one of the [indistinct] mentioned.  I assume that they have not indicated any desire to make any contribution.    Yes, okay.    But Mr Ngcukaitobi.    Oh, they are not aware of it?    Okay.  Maybe let us hear Mr Ngcukaitobi, do you – you were still anyway to place yourself on record.  You can take this opportunity.    And say whether you have any contribution or you have anything to say or whether it is something you have not considered.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Not at this stage, okay.    Not that is fine.  Thank you.    Oh.    Oh ja, because on the – it might be that it is a limited number.    Well maybe let us – we – because I will continue and hear the evidence for now until I have made a decision if I need to until some other time when the matter has received more consideration and maybe heard from other parties – other parties as well.  I do not think that there can be – I think one could have a situation where one hears as long as you have not made any decision.  I am sure that you can always if you become convinced that you should not make a continued change or make a decision that you are not going to proceed to the stage of making any finding.  So I think I would go along with the suggestion that we will – I will hear the evidence and the matter will continue to receive attention and at some stage I will announce what is to happen.    Yes, thank you.    Yes.    Hm.    Thank you.    What happened Mr Pretorius?    [Intervenes].    Hm.    Yes.    This is now EXHIBIT 1?    Oh, okay.    Yes, I have got it.    Well I have found it, but the page on which it is, is not marked.  So I cannot tell you what page it is.    Hm.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I guess that to the extentness of it, it would be more accurate to say some of them were just Acting National Commissioners but others were fully appointed.    That’s quite high isn’t it over such a long period?    So what this means is that at least on what you have been told there were thorough investigations, involving 45 cases during that period 2010 to 2018, they were referred to the prosecution authorities and there’s been no successful prosecution at all.    I just wanted to say what this doesn’t tell us and probably we will be told in due course, is whether, when it has had a number of successful prosecutions, zero whether we’re dealing with a situation when no prosecutions have taken place altogether or whether every prosecution that has happened has been unsuccessful so we’ll get to that information in due course.    Okay.    Thank you Mr Pretorius we are ten minutes before the tea break maybe we should take the tea break now and then we start with the evidence after.    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Thank you.  Let us get them to place themselves on record please?    Good morning.    Okay.  Okay.  You may or may not have heard the – what was said on Monday when an application was made for the adjournment of the hearing of Mr McBride’s evidence to today but your client will have the period prescribed in the rules within which to make an application for leave to cross-examine should he choose to apply and all attempts are being made to make sure that every implicated person will be afforded enough time to assist their situation and apply for leave to cross-examine should they wish to do so.  So the fourteen days mentioned in the rules is not shortened at all and where people are not able to make their applications within that time they do have the opportunity if they have got reasons for not having been able to do it within that time to apply for condonation and such applications will be considered on their merits.  So every attempt will be made to make sure that every implicated person is treated fairly.    Yes.    Yes thank you.    Thank you.    Yes.    Okay, no that is fine.    Ja okay alright.    Okay let us do that.    Good morning.    Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry the North West one is?    Yes I got that one.    Motswenyane?    Okay.    Yes thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Oh okay. ADV JOHAN EKSTEEN   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Secretariat.    Okay.  No thank you, thank you very much.  Steps will just have to be taken by the legal team and the secretary to correct whatever errors or defects that may have – that some of the notices may have suffered from.  Yes thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  And maybe to the extent that it may be necessary maybe the legal team for these people Mr Eksteen maybe they can formalise by way of a letter send something to the secretary if they have not already done so to say these are the issues.    That we would like to be rectified.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja okay thank you.      Thank you.  Registrar.    Well before we start Mr McBride I just want to say to you I thank you for coming forward to assist this commission when you have knowledge of matters that you believe fall within the terms of reference of this commission.  As you know as everybody knows I have been appealing to heads of departments, government departments, heads of parastatals past and present and heads of various sections or units to please come forward and other people and I appreciate that you came forward.  You might not have needed any appeal to be made you may well have intended to come with or without an appeal but I thank you that you have come forward and to assist the commission.  Thank you very much.    Yes.    There are two signatures there I guess you mean the one above his name?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay thank you.    Mr McBride as I understand your evidence – part of your evidence – that you have given in regard to the – to Crime Intelligence it is that you have instances where there has been resistance to giving information to IPID when IPID has certain investigations to conduct and as I understand in some cases you might be able to go further and say not just resistance but actually attempts to frustrate those - the investigations.  Now is that happening or has that been happening despite the    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Thank you, you may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Before you do that Mr McBride do you know whether that statement that you and Mr Pillay released is in one of the bundles or if not that you can still get a copy?    Can be found, yes okay I think it would be helpful to – if it can be found.  Do you have a recollection of around when it was when you and Mr Pillay released that statement.    Okay no that’s fine.  Thank you.    20 Mr Pretorius, I think you said 25, it’s 20 March.    Oh your one has already been corrected, okay.    Okay no that’s fine.    Yes, okay alright.      Well maybe before you proceed Mr Pretorius I just want to have clarification on this you said something like the immediate effect was I think to make IPID dysfunctional but I just want to draw your attention because that seems to me to suggest that whatever those people did who were effecting these transfers or were making decisions on these transfers and suspensions and so on that it did result in IPID being dysfunctional as opposed to saying their intention or motive was to make IPID, to render IPID dysfunctional, but whether they succeeded or not might be something else, I just want to check what you have in mind when you articulate that.    Okay, no that’s fine, I think from what you have said and later on you can elaborate if you want to, from what you have said at least I get the impression that at some stage there may have been an effect up to a certain level of making IPID dysfunctional.  Ja, okay, thank you.    Okay, we will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    But is the position that it is an article based on the statement and not the statement itself or is it the statement that they released?    Or you might need more time to have a look at the contents I am not sure.    Yes and – okay but you can confirm maybe tomorrow morning after you have read it to – once you are sure.    Okay alright.    Let me just ask this before the next question from Mr Pretorius.  I just want to understand what part is a crime or supposed to be crime?  Would the position be that only the SAPS for example may repatriate undocumented foreigners or would the position be that it is either – it should either be SAPS or certain officials of the Department of Home Affairs and if it is done by somebody else then it is illegal or is the position that somebody must give an instruction that they must be repatriated and in their absence of an instruction from a particular official then the repatriation is a criminal offence?    Yes.    Okay.  Okay thank you.  I guess it must be that it is not everybody who can just identify somebody as an undocumented foreigner and drive him out of the border or get his or her friends to say let us drive them out it has got to be certain people who are authorised?    Okay.    Can I just ask this Mr Pretorius before you proceed?  When you were given the file or the report whatever you were given in regard to the rendition case when you wanted to be updated on the high profile cases.  You have said that you – you have said that one of things that you picked up was the involvements – involvement of SAPS.  Now I – was that – did you pick that up from the documents or is that something that Mr Ncuba told you or is it both?  In other words from the file or documents could you tell that SAPS had been involved or and or was it the investigator who told you?    Yes.    So in the verbal reports you were told about the involvement of SAPS but when you saw the report there was also something to show that SAPS had been involved?    Thank you.    It is generally not their function?    Hm.    And what the elements were of the crime?    Did you get an answer from Mr Khuba and whoever else were briefing you when you asked what the elements of this crime were that you are recommending that these people be charged with?    Just to make sure I understand you correctly when you said at the beginning of your evidence on this issue that you picked up or were briefed to the effect that there had been involvement of SAPS.  Was reference to SAPS confined to Crime Intelligence or were there people from SAPS outside of Crime Intelligence as well who were involved?    Okay.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Hm, but in terms of investigation it was Crime Intelligence that was involved?    Okay, thank you.    Maybe – I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I was going to ask this question.  Maybe it belongs after you have – you are done but maybe we should deal with it now.  Just so that we understand, your understanding of what it is that they were alleged to have actually done that was referred to being “rendition” what was it?  Were they alleged to have falsified some documents or instructed people to falsify documents and then apprehended those people, took them in a car and tried to take them out of South Africa?  Just the actual acts as you understood them that was referred to as “rendition” what was it?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Alleged involvement?    Okay.    Hm.    That.    Yes.    Okay.  No, now - now I understand.    And you said that on your understanding generally doing investigations and carrying dockets is not the normal function of Crime Intelligence?    Hm.    Yes, okay.    Before Mr Pretorius asks the next question just to make sure one follows the sequence.  So you arrive at IPID after your appointment?    You call for a briefing all high profile cases?    One of them is one referred to as the “rendition case”?    Which, which – in which the suspects were General Dramat and General Sibiya.  You get given the briefing.  In terms of that briefing you are made to understand that there is already a docket that has been sent to the NPA.  You get that briefing and in due course you brief the Minister and you get – you get concerned when you get the briefing about certain features of this matter and at a certain stage you then ask Mr Sesoko to effectively be the one to whom Mr Khuba would report about this matter.  At the time – at that time you have been told by Mr Khuba that there was further evidence or further documents that he wanted to be added to the docket that was at the NPA.  Is that correct so far?    Yes.  Now as I understand the Act and I have not read the whole of it and from what you have said I saw that there is a provision that the Executive Director must refer matters that require criminal prosecution to the NPA or relevant authorities for prosecution.  So now at that stage when you were briefed did you get to know whether what had happened namely the sending of the docket to the NPA that represented the referral of the matter for prosecution and whether did you also get to know whether it had been referred by the Acting Director who was before you?    So am I correct that from what you say your understanding is that that docket was sent to the NPA.  Advocate Mosing is from the NPA?    Was sent to the NPA without it being signed or sent by the Acting Executive Director?    Mr Sesoko?    Yes, but your understanding is that he would have had to sign it normally before it was sent off?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So Mr Sesoko was – was overlooked in terms of having to play his role in that docket or reports and then from what you heard the Acting Executive Director had played a role and said Mr Sesoko should not be involved?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, but in terms of the Acting Executive Director having signed.  I assume there would have been a place for her to sign.  You do know that she had not signed anywhere or you are not sure?    Okay.    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Where you need to, you may refresh your memory by looking at the statement.    So in terms of this, maybe second report, if we can call it that, that you signed, so Mr Khuba had, had a role in terms of investigating or looking further into some of the issues that you had raised and he had then prepared a report and that report had been looked at by Mr Sesoko who was his supervisor and then at a certain stage it came to you and effectively all three of you signed it, is that right or maybe only you and Mr Seseko?    Minor things.     Yes, but am I right to say in the end, on that report one could find the three signatures?    Okay, alright thank you.   Or was it one of the dates where corrections were to be made?    Yes.    Is that 9th April, it can’t be 9th March obviously?     Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes it reached a conclusion different from the one that had been reached by the first report or, if we can put it that way    Yes the first one said prosecute.    And your one did not recommend prosecution.    Okay.    Although you say that you – although you were concerned about saying the second report exonerated them would it be correct to say the basis for your conclusion not to recommend criminal prosecution was that you could not find any evidence that they had committed any crime?    Ja okay.    Yes.    You are comfortable if one includes effectively rather than if one simply says exonerated them, if one says it effectively exonerated them, you are comfortable with that?    Okay thank you.    Did you say that the first – that Mr Khuba had signed the first report docket, he had?    Okay, alright.    I’m sorry may I just interrupt you Mr McBride, I may have missed something, there was a team of people who came to ask questions about certain matters, Mathenjwa was one of them, Kruger was another one.  They are coming to ask about questions, did you connect with the Minister of Police at that time, or not really?    Oh they were in the reference group?    Oh okay now I understand, okay thank you.    Was it like a good sounding board so to speak?   A very common sense approach...(intervention).     And when you say he had gone public is that through his spokesperson or apart from what the spokesperson said he also may have said something publicly.      Would it – I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, the documentation that you gave to the Minister pursuant to his request, was it in the form of the file or docket that IPID had?    Yes.    Oh now is that because the original had gone to the NPA, I see you said – you say you were to keep a copy of the copy that you sent to the Minister, where was the original had it gone to the NPA?    Yes so as far as the NPA is concerned would the position be that when they received the report that you signed their file or docket would have both, what we referred to as the first report as well as the second report or was the first report withdrawn when there was a second report?    That they had?    What had happened to the first report?    The first report?    Oh so certainly from you he only received the one that did not recommend any disciplinary or (indistinct) criminal prosecution?    If he did have – if he did have the first one, he certainly didn’t get it from you?    Yes but you say – you say you are not sure or are you sure whether Mr Khuba had retrieved, from the NPA what we have been referring to as the first report and I don’t if that’s accurate, whether it was a report, you don’t know or you do know that he had retrieved it?    He did not?    Okay.    Not even by Mr Khuba?    But would it be correct to say that whoever may have been aware of both reports would have been aware that the one signed by Mr Khuba only could not be – could not prevail over the second one firstly because the second one was also signed by Mr Khuba and it was reaching a conclusion that was the opposite of the conclusion of the first one but in addition the second one was signed by Mr Khuba’s supervisor as well as the Executive Director now?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    No, no they could choose one and that is the second one.  Because the second one was signed by the Executive Director.    And for all intents and purposes there was no indication it was not complete is it not?    Ja they could not choose the first one for some of the reasons that you have articulated but anyone aware of the two if he had to choose it could only be the second one.      Ja.    Ja.    Okay thank you.    Did the Minister ever send you a letter acknowledging receipt of the report you sent to him as far as you recall?    Yes.    Exists okay.    So would the – would the report to go with your letter would it have been delivered by hand as opposed to being posted or sent by courier or you do not know?    Yes and then signed {indistinct].    And it would have been delivered to the office of the Minister?    And you say you do know that there exists somewhere a written record that they received the report?    That is the Minister’s office?    Do you have an idea around about when it would have been in 2014 when they received the report, the Minister’s office received the report?    If there is a document that might help you feel free to have a look.    Of November?    Yes.    Yes around 27th or…    November?    Ja.  And the – the announcement that General Dramat was suspended, when did that become – when was that announced publicly in relation to the Minister’s receipt of your report?  Are you able to remember?    Oh so that is about three weeks or so after the Minister’s office had received your report?    Yes.    Oh okay.    Of receiving your – the report?    But certainly from what you say when General Dramat received the Notice of Intention to suspend him from the Minister your office had delivered your report to the Minister’s office?    And when the decision was taken to suspend General Dramat the report had long been delivered to the office of the Minister?    Yes and you do not know how and whether he may have any – had any other reports?    Yes.  Yes.  But you say that the announcement or the spokesperson of the Minister said that the reason – said that the suspension of General Dramat was based on a report of IPID recommend – making a recommendation to that effect or something like that?    Okay thank you.    Maybe I should…    Yes.    Yes.    That is now 2015?    Yes.    He had been – he had been where?  The Minister is here can you come and see him?    Oh was this a political rally?    Oh okay alright.    Before you get there going back to the meeting you had with the Minister where the rally was.    Are you saying he asked you about a number of cases.    And did you brief him on those cases?    Okay alright.    Now you earlier on talked about Ngobeni being Provincial Commissioner, is that Provincial Commissioner in KZN?    Yes okay.  So in relation to KZN was it just the case of Commissioner Ngobeni that you were briefing the Minister on or there was – or was there another KZN matter?    Okay.    Okay.  Okay.  Now when the Minister said your comrades in KZN will not be happy with this was that generally in relation to the KZN matters on which you were briefing him or was it in relation to a specific – one specific matter maybe of Ngobeni?    Yes.    Okay you may continue you were saying that he said your comrades will not be happy and then what happened in terms of the discussion?    Hm, hm.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Yes no that is fine.    Yes.    Now when you met with the Minister at the rally in Cape Town you had said something to him about the General Dramat matter namely that they would have to – there was going to be a clamp down but my understanding and you must tell me if my understanding of your evidence is correct is that on that occasion the two of you did not discuss details about it, is that correct or did you?  In other words did you tell him why you were saying that, what your view was about his decision and so on?    So it was not a case of maybe we must find another time to discuss it or – my impression earlier on was that it was like there would be another time to discuss it that is not what was arranged?    Okay.    Yes.  Okay.    Okay.    Hm.    Thank you.    I was – I was still to – going to ask what was this Reference Group – where was it coming from, was there a policy on which it was based, was there a statue on which it was bases, was it a statutory provision thing or was it just an informal group of people that the Minister had put together on your understanding?    Well one of the witnesses who has given evidence here I think did make reference to this Reference Group of the Minister of Police I think it was Mr or Advocate Muofhe who was advisor to Minister Ramatlhodi.    He says – he said he was invited to part of the Reference Group and so I think it is the same Reference Group.    If I am not mistaken.    Yes.    Hm.  Okay thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius maybe this is a – the time to confirm with Mr McBride that if it is fine with him and everybody we could go up to five o’clock subject to a break in five minutes time, would that be fine with you?    Yes.    Okay.      I think you might have to repeat I am not sure that he understood what you were asking?    Oh, oh yes.    I am sorry – I am sorry.  I guess that you – you had no choice but to tell the public what the position was because now the Minister through his spokesperson had told the nation that his decisions to suspend General Dramat was based on a recommendation of your organisation and as head of the organisation if that was not correct you had – you had an obligation to put the record straight?    Or not?    Hm.    Am I right that in your earlier evidence you also said that you understood from Mr Khuba - and I guess he will confirm if he gets called – you understood from him that when Mr Ntlemeza was putting pressure on him to send the docket to report to the NPA he said that report that was to be sent to the NPA was what was holding his progress back or something like that?    Is that - that is what you said?    Yes, okay.    Yes, but you were being told this after your appointment as?    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    I think so.  It is four minutes past.  We will take a 10 minutes break, but we will return at quarter past.    We adjourn.    You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Thank you and just to maybe wrap up on something we dealt with earlier, you told us that in relation to the office of the Minister there does exist somewhere something in writing that is proof that they received your report and when they received it.  In regard to the NPA is there a similar proof available in terms of when they would have received your report?    Okay, okay, thank you.  In the end it might not be an issue but it might just be important to know who received it when in relation to events that may have happened after.    Yes, well I think to the extent that you might know that certain documents within IPID may exist that might assist the Commission or might assist you to assist the Commission speak to the Legal team of the Commission, and the investigators, I’m sure that can be sorted out, thank you.    Did you say 1225?    Yes in terms of the date you referred to the stamp that must be the date when it was filed in the High Court I would imagine but at page 1247 which is the last page of the affidavit there’s another date there isn’t it, in terms of when it was deposed to?  19th June is the date that appears there, 2015.    Ja.    The additional information was contained in separate documents, it was not a question of amending any sentences in the report that had been – in the first report was it?  In other words if there was a docket that was sent to the NPA which contained the first report if there was a docket or whatever it was that contained the information that was sent what was done was just to add more documents without physically changing anything that was in documents that had been sent before, is that right?    Yes.    Okay, alright.    So we have referred from time to time to a docket that was sent to the NPA.  The docket would basically have been a file, is that a right?    And ordinarily would a docket that would be sent to the NPA include statements from witnesses, plus a report from the investigator or a report containing the opinion as you say or would the report containing the opinion be separate or be sent separately or they would all be sent normally at the same time together?    Yes, okay.    Yes, but normally they would be sent at the time, the report and the evidence, the docket with the evidence?    Yes okay, but what would otherwise be in the docket would be witness statements, is that right?    And whatever exhibits may be – might be there?    Okay thank you.    What paragraph is that?    27.      Oh yes.  Maybe tomorrow we should start at half past nine again or nine o’clock.    Oh.    You have other matters.  Ja.  Your – what is your current assessment of whether we will finish tomorrow?    It is not pressure – it is not pressure on anybody I just want to assess whether we should put in more time or not?    Ja.    Ja.      Okay we should start at ten to give you that little bit of time in the morning?    Yes.  Yes.  Okay alright.  We will adjourn and then tomorrow we will start at ten o’clock.    We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Chair the…    Proposed order of business today is firstly to deal with the matter relating to the evidence of the witness to be called Mr McBride who is present.  The second will be a relatively brief opening statement introducing the evidence to be given regarding Law Enforcement Agencies as you were informed last week two witnesses will be called before the Eastern break and then after certain other evidence the Law Enforcement Agency evidence will be resumed and I will outline the nature of that evidence and give some background to that evidence after we have dealt with the matter related to the evidence of Mr McBride.  Chair so to deal with the first issue first may I hand up to you a bound copy of the documentation forwarded to you last night which is relative to this matter?    Chair the witness to be called for the remainder of this week at least is Mr McBride.  He will testify to a range of matters and a range of disciplinary hearings as well as inquiries.  One of those inquiries was chaired by Mxolisi Zuma who is your younger brother.    Oh Zondo sorry Chair.    I actually wrote that.  My apologies Chair.  In any event Zondo Juniior is your younger brother; he chaired an inquiry involving a person other than the witness but who is implicated or not implicated involved in the chain of evidence that Mr McBride will give.  The issue then arises Chair as to whether you as Chair should in those circumstances hear the evidence of Mr McBride or whether he should hear that part of the evidence implicating Mr Zondo Juniior.  Given those circumstances Chair of which you were made aware you directed that all persons involved be given notices that this issue would arise.  Notices were then given to Mr Zondo Juniior; were given to Mr McBride and to Mr Sesoko who was the subject of the investigation and disciplinary matter chaired by Mxolisi Zondo.  All of those three responded to state that they had no objection to you Chair hearing the relevant evidence.  So there is no issue raised let along objection raised by any person directly involved in this evidence any potential outcome of the evidence that you will hear.  In your bundle Chair just behind the divider you will see the response to the notice given by Mxolisi Zondo.      At page 2 of that notice or the response to the    So whilst that is not decisive of the issue clearly Chair it is a factor that in determining the way forward you will take into account.    After that Chair are two communications from    So from those directly involved there is no issue raised at all.  On the contrary the statement is made that the issue of conflict does not really arise at least in the view of Mr Mxolisi Zondo.    However Chair because this is matter not only of personal interest to those involved it is a matter of public interest.    The legal team through one of its members made a thorough investigation into the applicable law and the applicable facts and that submission is before you which you have no doubt had an opportunity to read. May I just refer you Chair to the first part of the submissions which are the submissions of the legal team as mandated by the team to the drafter of this document but not unanimous and I will give you an alternative view in due course.  The first few pages deal with the law in relation to bias or perception of bias when that should arise and when it should be dealt with.  The authorities relied on here deal with matters where a judge sits as a judge.  A judge that will determine rights finally and I will deal with that issue again in due course.  But in paragraph 9 on page 6 the proposition is made in this memorandum. “Later the court sets out the following principled approach which proposition must find application even where a judge presides at a commission or tribunal.” And this is the South African Rugby Football Union case of which you are doubt aware    That could happen in one of two manners Chair.  Either the recusal if considered could be for the whole of the Law Enforcement Agency evidence, it could be for the evidence of Mr McBride or just that portion of the evidence involving Mr Mxolisi Zondo which is one paragraph.  In fact a few lines in one paragraph Chair.    The point is stressed in paragraph 14 on page    Have stated their position clearly and they range from an expression of faith in your hearing the matter and making whatever findings you need to make to the contention raised by Mr Mxolisi Zondo that because there is a written record the matter does not arise.  So the alternatives – having said that Chair the matter is one of public interest and a way must therefore be found of leaving the door open for anyone who can claim an interest in this issue nevertheless and notwithstanding present circumstances still to come forward and we will deal with that issue in a moment as well Chair.    So there are really three options Chair.  Does the Chair recuse himself from presiding over the hearing when Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko testify?  Secondly does the Chair recuse himself from that portion of the evidence that deals with the disciplinary hearing over which Mr Mxolisi Zondo presided?  The third option should you recuse yourself at all given the attitude of the effected parties none of whom seek his recusal?  The proposal that having considered all the submissions made that are before you is somewhat of a compromise between the second and the third and I will come to that in a moment.  Then Chair there is a technical examination of the legal framework.  The conclusions reached certainly after examination of all involved are that given the legal framework governing the commission you Chair do not have power to substitute yourself.  Your appointment and any substitution is beyond your jurisdiction Chair.  The suggestion is then made that possibly the regulations should be changed by the President to allow the President to substitute for that one paragraph of evidence.  That in my view is not an appropriate solution it is just too complex and too drastic a remedy to deal with the issue of one paragraph of evidence of Mr McBride.  And then the third is to hear given the – given the response of those directly involved; their submissions; the other factors that I will mention in a moment is to hear it subject to one caveat and I will present that to you now Chair.    Chair considering the nature of the evidence.  The nature of the evidence is an opinion about conduct of Mr Mxolisi Zondo in a disciplinary inquiry where he chaired that inquiry.  That record is available.  That hard evidence is available.  The nature of the evidence to be given by Mr McBride is an opinion.  Those facts can be tested and conclusions can be drawn.  The second is that the proportion of that evidence to the evidence of Mr McBride as a whole it is minuscule.    It is not something that is essential to the – in our submission Mr McBride may differ but in our submission it is not something that is essential to the points that Mr McBride wishes to make before you Chair.      There is no objection to you hearing that portion of the evidence or stated apprehension of bias and importantly Chair you sit as an investigator.  You do not sit as a judge.  You make recommendations in accordance with your mandate.  It is not a final determination of rights.  It may affect reputation importantly but that is the extent to which it goes.    And then finally for what it is worth you will hear the submissions of the legal team and you will decide whether to be guided by those submissions or not.  So the proposal that we make before Chair having regard to the extensive research and presentation done on behalf of the legal team which I have gone through briefly with you and which you have no doubt have had an opportunity to peruse last night is you hear the evidence.  That you make no findings on that particular potion of the evidence at this stage.    That at a stage either prior to or after the evidence has been given you invite any concerned person of the public because it is the public now that may have an interest to make submissions to should they be so minded and then you make a final decision on what should be done about that piece of evidence that you will have heard thereafter but if it is to be adjudicated by someone else that will not have cause any prejudice to any person.    So subject to an invitation to the public to make submissions to you Chair at any stage regarding the propriety or otherwise of you hearing the evidence we submit that you hear the evidence but make no findings on it until that process has been concluded.    Chair just a few remarks.    Firstly the issue at stake regarding the disciplinary inquiry conducted by Mxolisi Zondo is at best and Mr McBride may disagree but in our assessment is that best a collateral issue.  It may be Chair that in the course – due course you decide you do not need to make any finding because it is not central to the terms of reference of the commission.  The purpose from the legal team’s point of view of Mr McBride giving evidence is not an assessment of the correctness or otherwise of the findings.      That is the first issue.  The second issue Chair which you highlight now is the legal framework under which we are operating.  It is complex and it is unique.  The Commissions Act which governs the operations of this commission as well as the regulations are one set of legal issues.  The other set is the report of the Public Protector and the judgment of the full bench of the High Court in Gauteng – North Gauteng which determined the manner in which this commission was to be managed and the manner of your appointment in particular was dealt with in that judgment Chair.  Now to – there are two issues that arise there.  Firstly a general proposition of law bearing in mind all the legal framework under which this Commission operates is that one cannot divide up.  You have been appointed Chair to Chair the Commission, it cannot be divided up between various judges let alone one appointed by yourself to substitute for you in assessing the evidence in regard to that collateral issue.    But the – despite the very thorough research contained in the memorandum it maybe that.    It would not be within the powers of the President to amend the terms.    Of reference or regulations to contradict the court judgment.    Because that is decisive in the manner in which you are appointed.  So it is a very complex matter Chair.    And obviously it is a matter around which no error can be made.    So there idea that it be carefully considered.    That any interested party particularly.    One of those parties that had been involved in similar litigation.    In the past who may have been involved in the High Court matter be given an opportunity.    To comment should they so wish.    It may be they do not wish Chair.    So they so wish.    But in the meanwhile we proceed.    To this debate, no Chair.    But in fairness.    They – they are not aware of this issue.    No Chair.    There are other Counsel present Chair.    I have not been informed of that, but I am now informed that there are two other Counsel present.  I do not know if they are directly representative of the interests of the parties directly involved in this issue.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Chair and on that basis then the submissions made and the research done which informs the memorandum before you from the legal team will remain of relevance.    Chair the next matter for today is a brief opening statement.    Which will introduce issues relevant to the cluster of evidence and the group of witnesses who will testify in regard to Law Enforcement Agencies.    And we would like to take the opportunity to introduce that evidence to you.    Chair for the benefit of the public we may just say at the outset that the Law Enforcement regime in South Africa is both vast and complex and in order for the evidence to be understood in its proper context it is necessary to describe for the purposes of the Commission - yourself Chair and for the public – how Law Enforcement is constructed and how it is intended to operate in this country post 1994.  Chair we [intervenes].    We are dealing with.    Technically issues Chair.    Which caused the delay in starting at 09   But hopefully they have been dealt with.  We can go to page 1.  Chair the – do you have a copy of the?    Presentation before you?  No, it is a – it is not in that file Chair.    It is that document there.    On page 2 of the document by way of introduction we outline the institutions which operate under the general rubric category description of Law Enforcement and the institutions that have been established to combat corruption in South Africa directly are the following.  Firstly there is the South African Police Services.  There is the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation.  That is the Hawks.  There is a unit called the Special Investigations Unit which I will deal with in due course.  Three is the National Prosecuting Authority, perhaps the most well-known of the Law Enforcement and Corruption Investigation Units and prosecution units.  There is the State Security Agency and there is the Asset Forfeiture Unit.  Those institutions are supported by a number of other institutions and what is before you Chair is illustrative not necessarily complete in all its facets, but there is the Auditor-General an body which will investigate accounts, finances, various Government – Government related institutions.  There is the Department of Public Administration which plays its role.  There is the Public Service Commission.  There is the Public Protector’s Office, State Attorney and there are others as well.  The next slide may seem complicated and it will be broken up in due course, but the point for the moment Chair is there is an elaborate and comprehensive network of interrelated institutions whose intention was in their establishment and in the execution of their duties to detect, combat and prosecution – prosecute corruption.  Those all operate under the auspices ultimately of the Presidency.  Parliament plays its oversight role.  The Department of Justice is a separate department under which for example the National Prosecuting Authority and the Special Investigations Unit operate.  The police to the left is again a comprehensive and complex set of structures and institutions which involve a number of sub categories of organisation that I will deal with in a moment.  Governance, finance and the intelligence services are also intended to play their role in detecting, preventing and combatting prosecuting corruption.  So Chair for the moment it is not necessary to understand this complex diagram.  It is there for one simple purpose.  That the statutory and constitutional framework within which vast – vastly resourced and vastly people bodies operate to deal with corruption is a matter of fact and I will deal with the various sections of that in a moment, because ultimately Chair the question will be asked this vast organisational structure funded and peopled as it is why is it necessary for this Commission to be here in the first place if that system in all its resources and complexity was operating properly, we would not be here and that is the question that we will address.  Whether that is a valid statement to make in due course.  We could deal with the next slide Chair which breaks down that overall picture.  If one deals with the police under the authority of the Minister of Police and the Deputy Minister of Police you have the South African Police Services.  Interposed between the South African Police Service and the Ministry is the Commissioner of the South African Police Services.  He is assisted by Deputy National Commissioners and Provincial Commissioners.  Crime intelligence is something different from the other intelligence agencies of which we will talk in due course.  Crime intelligence falls within the police.  We will give evidence about the operations of crime intelligence in due course.  It is separate from the South African Police Service but still within the framework of organisations that reside under the Commissioner of Police.  There are various institutions or organisations which reside under the South African Police Service heading.  Those involve crime investigation services.  That is the general detective services.  Commercial crime, organised crime, specific investigations and family violence and child protection.  Those units all reside under the South African Police Service.  Also under the police category is the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation.  The DPCI or commonly known to the public as the Hawks.  They conduct serious commercial crime investigations.  They deal with serious organised crime.  They deal with priority crimes, specialised investigations.  The SIU – I am corrected is the Special Investigating Unit and not the Special Investigations Unit but I will come to them in a moment Chair.  Now at a stage there existed an Anti-Corruption Task Team.  I will deal with that in a moment but that for the moment was organisationally in the position that it is there under the DPCI or the Hawks.  That became dysfunctional at a stage.  Precisely why will be interrogated and evidence will be led before you.  Prior to 12 then on the right hand side of the screen was an institution called the – I think it was called the Independent Complaints Directorate.  Anyway it is no longer and was replaced by the organisation which you will hear about in due course – IPID, the Independent Police Investigation Directorate.  That organisation Chair resides under an Executive Director which reports in limited facets only to the Minister of Police.  I will come to oversight in a moment but is essentially independent.  Its functions like the DPCI or the Hawks have been a subject of two Constitutional Court judgments which will be referred to evidence – in evidence in due course.  Essentially the purpose of the legislation which governs the Hawks and IPID stresses their independence and the relevance of that and how this has come to affect the evidence that you will hear will be dealt with in due course.  Again if one regards this organisational structure as merely a part – just go back one – as merely a part of the overall Law Enforcement governing structure of our post – well our democratic Constitution, organisation, structures all residing under the Constitution and the legislation which I will also deal with in a moment one will see that the structures we have just dealt with under the heading police are but a part of the overall Justice and police structures meant to deal with amongst other things of course corruption.  If we may then go to the justice slide.  Again a vast organisational structure residing under the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development and at another level it is Director-General.  Perhaps I better go back Chair to deal with oversight specifically in relation to the police.  IPID in particular is subject to the oversight of Parliament in various committees.  Crime intelligence also residing under the police is subject to the oversight of the Inspector General of Intelligence which in turn is subject to the oversight of Parliament.  So not only is there a hierarchy of authority governing crime intelligence, the South African Police Service, the Hawks and IPID which reports then to the Minister of Police, but there is also provision for Parliamentary oversight and other oversight.  That is the system that will be interrogated in evidence.  We may return to Justice then.  There are two principal bodies which reside in the Department of Justice.  The first is the Special Investigations Unit.  Chair I will deal with a number of specific bodies in due course.  For the moment just the overall picture.  The Special Investigating Unit – Unit resides under the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development and his or her Director-General.  The NPA – the National Prosecuting Authority – similarly resides within the Justice framework.  Originally as you will know Chair there existed a Directorate of Special Operations, the Scorpions which was disbanded in 2009.  We will deal with that issue in due course in evidence as well.  It was reported into or was part of the National Prosecuting Authority.  Notionally at least, but not organisationally the Hawks replaced but we have dealt with them in the previous slide.  The NPA is headed by the National Director or Public Prosecutions.  There is a dotted and a direct reporting line to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development.  Now the NPA and I may deal with this in more detail in due course is peopled by some 4 500 investigators and staff.  Under the Directorate of National Public Prosecutions one has a Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit, a Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit, a National Prosecuting Service and a Priority Crimes Litigation Unit.  I am going to deal in some detail and not for a long time but in some detail with the PCLU because it will be the subject of direct evidence in due course.  The National Director of Public Prosecutions is organised principally on a regional basis and the authority – I am told – for making decisions in relation to prosecutions in particular – particular prosecutions devolves in the Provincial Directors of Public Prosecutions.  The Asset Forfeiture Unit resides within the National Prosecuting Authority.  Again a vast way resourced.  Perhaps not as well-resourced as it wishes to be - it is in fact understaffed – financed organisation specifically intended to deal with crime and to deal amongst other things with corruption.  I will come back to some aspects of that slide in due course.  Then the next slide deals with the intelligence part of the overall framework.  The intelligence structures reside under the Minister of State Security.  There is a State Security Agency which is an organisation or entity that comprises the two previous entities which were dissolved in 2009 and merged into the State Security Agency.  That is the National Intelligence Agency on the one hand and the South African Secret Service on the other.  The State Security Agency is accountable to the Inspector General of Intelligence and subject to Parliamentary oversight.  There is a domestic branch to the State Security Agency and there is a foreign branch.  Its operations too will come under scrutiny in the evidence to be put before you.  Then collateral to that structure of course one cannot ignore the finance structures in Government and in the Executive residing under the Minister of Finance where we have the accounted General.  We have the South African Revenue Services and we have importantly about which evidence will be given the Financial Intelligence Centre.  Of course at some level the governance in employment administrative and the discipline at least insofar as disciplinary prescripts and framework is concerned reside elsewhere in the organisational structure and then finally at the top in oversight role and an accounting role we have the Presidency and Parliament.  Reporting into Parliament and to the National Assembly we have the Auditor-General and the Public Protector and we have also Parliamentary Oversight Committees to whom for example the Inspector General of Intelligence would report.  Chair if I may before I go on just deal in a little more detail with the Special Investigations Unit.  Now the role and function of the Special Investigation Unit is not always clearly understood.  It is not a prosecuting arm of Law Enforcement Agencies.  It is an investigative unit.  Its primary mandate is to recover and prevent financial losses to the state caused by acts of corruption, fraud and maladministration.  Its role in the main we are told is to investigate and recover losses to the state as a result of fraud and corruption.  Where criminal activities are uncovered in these investigations those are then referred on to the National Prosecuting Authority or if necessary elsewhere.  Sometimes to the Hawks.  The SIU is staffed as an investigation unit by lawyers, forensic investigators and experts maybe called upon from time to time assist it.  Engineers, quantity surveyors and the like but its investigations feed into civil recovery and feed into prosecutions on the basis of referrals out.  So the SIU is really an investigative unit investigating fraud and corruption.  It is peopled we are told and the – this may be subject to some correction by approximately 500 legal and forensically skilled personnel.  If I may mention the PCLU, if we can go back to the slide please where the PLCU appears and if I may just ask – bear with me Chair.  It is necessary to.    Yes, I am sorry.  The page numbers are not here in this version, but it is the Justice slide Chair.    The Priority Crimes Litigation Unit is an interesting unit because its role and function relevant to the matters being investigated by this Commission are of some importance.    It resides within the National Prosecuting Authority.  It is one of the principal structures there.  This unit came into existence by way of a proclamation under the then President Mbeki on 24 March 2003.  If I may just quote from that proclamation. “Its intention was in particular to manage and direct the investigation and prosecution of crimes contemplated in the implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court at 2002.  It was to deal with serious national and international crimes which include acts of terrorism and sabotage committed under the Internal Security Act, high treason, sedition, foreign military crimes committed by mercenaries or such other priority crimes to be determined by the National Director.” So clearly Chair this unit was set up to deal with a specific category of crime.    As described in the proclamation of an international flavour informed by international statute.  However we know and you will hear evidence in this regard that the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit was peopled under the authority of the National Director of Public Prosecutions at the time with a number of prosecutors and investigators and it was this unit that investigated and sought to prosecute the Minister of Finance at the time, Mr Pravin Gordhan.    For the payment – the pension pay out payment.    The previous Deputy Commissioner, Mr Ivan Pillay.  Mr van Loggerenberg, all of SARS, Mr Robert McBride whom you will hear about of IPID in, Innocent Khuba of IPID, Matthews Sesoko of IPID, a previous state prosecutor Glynnis Breytenbach, Paul O’Sullivan and the secretary of Paul O’Sullivan.    They were all prosecuted or sought to be prosecuted.    Or investigated under the rubric of the International Security Crimes described in the proclamation.  We will investigate whether this was a deliberate manipulation and distortion of the mandate of the PCLU and a misuse of that body.    To conduct investigations for which it was not intended and we will ask questions around that and seek to address the issues arising out of that.    That is one example of the type of evidence that we will be leading in due course.   Before going on to the slide we’re dealing with personnel beginning with the arrangements under President Kgalema Motlanthe I would like us to deal with two other issues of some importance ultimately.  Our country is signatory to two international United Nations prescripts, the one is the United Nations Convention against Corruption, by which we are bound because we’re a signatory constitutionally to that.  That Convention against Corruption was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 31 October 2003, and South Africa became a signatory to that Convention and therefore bound by it in 2003 where it was formerly ratified then on 22 November 04.  In addition there are others but these are the two which we wish to mention now, there’s the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime to which South Africa is also a signatory and which has been ratified on 14 December 2000 and February 2004 respectively that is a Convention that was entered into in November 00 by the United Nations.  The legislation that we will deal with Chair to one degree or another in relation to the police is the South African Police Service Act, the NPA, National Prosecuting Authority is governed by the National Prosecuting Authority Act, there’s a separate Act governing IPID the Independent Police Investigative Directorate Act, there’s the Witness Protection Act, there’s the Intelligence Services Act, there’s the Financial Intelligence Centre Act and the Asset Forfeiture Unit is dealt with by a separate legislation. If I may just give some preliminary numbers to illustrate – if we can go back the first slide please, second slide, this vast network is as I’ve stated, well resourced and well populated.  Visible policing is managed by approximately 103 000 members of the South African Police Service there are 40 000 detectives in the South African Police Service, the Hawks DPCI comprise approximately 2 500 personnel, Crime Intelligence approximately 9 500 personnel and Protection Services 7 000, the National Prosecuting Authority approximately 4 500 personnel and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate 400 personnel.  So it is not small not incomprehensive and not under-resourced although not ideally resourced on our instructions, and Chair we return to the basic question and we’ll come to that in a little more detail later why is this Commission necessary to be sitting and why has it been able to do what it has been able to do in eight months of its evidence thus far when we’ve had this framework, resourced and peopled as it is for over 10 years, in fact up to 20 years in different forms.  That is the essential question that we will be addressing in a little more detail. If I may go then to, just identifying individual persons in authority with in this structure at various periods of time.  These slides are not put up at this stage, at least, to draw any conclusions, let alone any negative conclusions but merely to place people in particular positions and particular lines of authority when you hear them refer to evidence in due course.  The Minister of Safety and Security under the presidency of President Kgalema Motlanthe between 2008 and 2009 was Minister Nathi Mthethwa, he occupied that position at that time.  At the same time the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development was Minister Radebe and the Minister of Intelligence about whom some evidence will be led was, at the time, Minister Siyabonga Cwele.  The next slide deals with the position under President Zuma and again like with other evidence questions will be raised around appointments and dismissals and their significance, if any to what occurred under the watch of the various Ministers but between May 2009 and February 2018 one had three Ministers of police, Minister Mthethwa, Minister Nhleko and Minister Mbalula. The regime under the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development and the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, there was a change in 2014 when two departments were merged, Minister Jeff Radebe and Minister Michael Masutha and then the Ministers of State Security in turn, Minister Cwele, Minister Mahlobo and Minister Bongo.  National Commissioners and Directors General then during the same period May 2009 to February 2018 the National Commissioners of Police who will be, at least, referred to in evidence were in those respective periods on the screen Mr Cele, Ms Phiyega, Khomotso Phahlane, Lesetja Mothiba and Khehla Sithole.  The National head of the DPCI, and you will ...(intervention).     Yes Chair indeed Moghlane and Mothebe were acting during the periods reflected, thank you.  Then the National Head of the DPCI or the Hawks and this is – this list of personnel is directly related to evidence that will be given over the next few days for the period 2009 to 2014 the position was occupied by Anwa Dramat, he was replaced in an acting capacity by Berning Ntlemeza and later in an acting capacity by Yolisa Matakata and finally by Geoffrey Lebeya who is there in a permanent position at present.  The Director Generals of – or Directors General of Justice and Constitutional Development are listed in the next part of that slide, the Directors General of the State Security Agency, some of whom will be giving evidence or at least one of whom has given evidence, that list of personnel includes Mr Makathuka, Mr Dlomo in an acting capacity, Sontho Kudjoe, Arthur Fraser and Yolisa Jafta who is presently occupying the position in an acting capacity. Then the National Directors of Public Prosecutions are listed there, they will also be the subject of direct evidence Chair between 2007 and 2009 Mokotedi Mche, Menzi Simelane between December 2009 and October 2012, Nomgcobo Jiba in an acting capacity 2012 to 2013, Mxolisi Nxasana October 2013 to May 2015, his demise to put it gently will be the subject of evidence in due course, the appointment of Shaun Abrahams June 2015 to August 2018, Silas Ramaite in an acting capacity, August 2018 to January 2019 and the present incumbent of the post of the National Director of Public Prosecution Shamila Batohi.  I’ve just been correct Chair that Mr Ntlemeza,  Berning Ntlemeza was appointed as the head of the DPCI during the period 2015 to 17 in a permanent capacity, I’m told but we can clarify that position in due course. Chair you would have been informed by this very rapid and perhaps too superficial overview of the law enforcement structures which inter alia govern investigations into and prosecutions of corruption and fraud that the Scorpions, the Directorate of Special Operations was disbanded in 2009 and its instructive onto look as we will in more detail in due course at the statistics in relation to the Scorpions.  Our investigation team inform us that by February 2004 the Scorpions had completed 653 cases comprising 273 investigations which resulted in 380 prosecutions.  Of those 380 prosecutions 349 ended in convictions representing an average conviction rate of 92%, that was the record of the Scorpions from inception to 2004.  It is a matter of record, and this comes from official documentation, Chair, that during 2007 alone the Scorpions achieved a conviction rate of 94% on 182 cases brought to court.  In the first half of 08, shortly before its demise the Directorate of Special Operations arrested 71 suspects, ceased contra ban to the value of 6.6million rand and compensated crime victims to the tune of 6.8million rand. That organisation comprised of approximately 500 members nationally and was disbanded in September 2009. Chair for the moment these statistics are illustrative only of a trend and will be researched and presented to you in more detail in due course but the question which will be asked is, firstly, have the law enforcement agencies post 2009 been able to match that statistic in investigation and prosecution and secondly why was it necessary for the Directorate of Special Operations to be disbanded, what was the motive for the disbandment of an apparently functional operation to what may be the result of the evidence replaced by an apparently dysfunctional set of operations.  Then we had an important body at one stage, Chair, called the Anti-Corruption Task Team, this was a multi-disciplinary task team established and intended to investigate and deal with, through prosecutions, corruption.  It was established after Ngotolo? in January 10, it was mandated by the then President that the cluster comprising the Anti- Corruption Task Team, comprising justice, crime prevention and security create such a team to fast track the investigation and prosecution of cases of corruption.  It was also mandated to investigate, seize and restrain assets and prosecute approximately 100 people who had accumulated assets through illicit means of at least 500million – 5million sorry 5million rand.  A delivery forum was set up to develop, prioritise and operationalise the plan and the first step was to task the principle stakeholders within the cluster, the Police Services, the DPCI that’s the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority and the Special Investigation Unit to achieve its aim. Its mandate is specifically dealt with in the next slide there may be evidence about that later but what is interesting about this task team is it ultimately became dysfunctional and was abandoned with very little success at all.   The information that we place before you Chair at a very high level is that, to an extent at least between 2010 and 2014 the task team was indeed achieving its mandate.  In 2015 the NPA removed prosecutors from the multi-agency work group, court cases collapsed and there was an exodus of other principle stakeholders.  Why and on what basis the National Prosecuting Authority in 2015 stepped out of the task team is a question that we will address in due course in evidence but what is apparent that between 2014 and 2015 again, something that was functional became entirely dysfunctional.  Key personnel were redeployed and the presidential mandate, as directed in 2010 fell into disuse.  In 2018, however, the Anti-Corruption Task Team was renamed the Serious Corruption Offences Unit and it was dealt with by Serious Corruption Investigation component of the Hawks and that’s where it resides in an attempt to resuscitate it at the moment.  The next slide deals, Chair with some statistical information, again this is illustrative at best, it doesn’t pretend to be final and accurate but it does serve to illustrate trends and to raise questions which the legal team, together with the investigators will be asking and will seek to answer, ultimately when the totality of evidence regarding law enforcement agencies is dealt with. The Anti-Corruption Task Team between 2010 and 2015 received, we are told, 148 priority cases.  The approximate value of the cases received and that value is, one presumes the scope of the alleged crimes involved in money terms.  The number of convictions in priority cases, apparently one and the number of convictions resulting in non-custodial sentences where accused did not go to prison 80.  The SIU, Special Investigative Unit matters referred to the NPA, you will recall that, that has been introduced in a previous slide, a total of 686 to the best of our information at present matters were referred to by the Special Investigations Unit to the NPA during the period 13 to 2018.  The approximate value or coverage, monetary coverage of those matters 11billion rand, not one of those have been successfully prosecuted of the 686 cases, to the best of our information and we’re subject to correction but for the moment we assert a trend. The Financial Intelligence Centre sent 215 suspicious transaction reports as reported to them to law enforcement agencies, there has been one report back from the law enforcement agencies to the Financial Intelligence Centres.  The last column deals with corruption cases referred to the National Prosecuting Authority by the Kwa-Zulu Natal Government between 2010 and 2018, this is not an overall statistic, it’s a specific statistic which will be dealt with in the evidence.  45 cases referred to the National Prosecuting Authority by the Kwa-Zulu Natal Government in the period 2010 and to 18 in value in excess of 5million rand and where we are informed by the investigators, the perpetrators or the alleged perpetrators have been identified in very detailed forensic reports, have resulted in zero prosecutions.  For the moment...(intervention).     Well Chair, 45 cases referred to the NPA by the Kwa-Zulu Natal Government between 2010 and 2018 no successful prosecutions, we are informed that they were thoroughly investigated supported by detailed forensic reports, at the very least calls for explanation before any final conclusions are drawn.  The Financial Intelligence Centre 215 reports...(intervention).     Correct Chair, that evidence will be placed before you, it will be subject to investigation, it will be subject to further questioning but that is prima facie what the case is and what the evidence will be.  For the present, Chair, if one may just summarise the slide – well if we can go back to slide 1 and it’s ...(intervention).     Again I stand subject to correction but my information just gathered is that no prosecutions have taken place, let alone successful prosecutions.     But Chair the – to the extent that this is correct, firstly to the extent that it may indicate a trend if one looks at that organisational structure under our constitution peopled as it is and one looks at the statistics, the outcome of that structure and its operations Anti-Corruption Task Team 148 priority cases, one conviction, the SIU referrals 686 no results, the Financial Intelligence Centre 215 reports, one report back and of course the specific example on the right-11 APRIL 2019 – DAY 81  hand slide.  So for the present Chair we ask the question, and in fairness to all concerned it is a question, are these statistics accurate, we will place evidence before you, to the extent that they may be slightly subject or subject to slight adjustment, the trend remains.  The question is, is that prima facie there’s a case to be or there’s a question to be answered, is this trend not very disturbing and very worrying and is this not a matter that requires the immediate attention of this Commission and perhaps those that can manage the situation in due course.  So Chair, for the next few days the evidence of Mr McBride will be given, his evidence will deal principally with IPID, the Independent Investigative Directorate under the rubric of the Police Force.  General Booysen will also give evidence and he will deal with other aspects.  Various other members from the National Prosecuting Authority, the Hawks, Crime Intelligence and IPID will be called in due course to address the questions that we’ve raised in very general terms here.  That evidence will relate to a number of sub-topics that will be the removal of persons from positions of authority including investigative heads of units and staff by means of transfer by arrest, disciplinary processes and the use of the media as a means of discrediting certain personnel and that evidence will be given.  Whether dismissals, firstly and appointment secondly, were designed deliberately to weaken the structures that have been placed up before you. Also will be dealt with in evidence is alleged undue and unwarranted promotion of officials including nepotism.  Thirdly we will address the issue of whether senior police officials and high ranking political office bearers were, in essence, protected actively and passively through non-prosecution by what happened during 10 to 2018 and before at the hands of the structure which you have seen.  We will talk about the unjustified withdrawal of criminal cases linked to politically associated individuals, we will also deal with the alleged abusive state funds including the abusive of the Secret Service account for procurement of safe houses, vehicles and overseas travel and other benefits for beneficiaries who were not entitled thereto lawfully and we will also deal with the abuse of the Criminal Investigation Agent Programme.  Also dealt with as a sub-category is the means used to classify documents to prevent them ever being used in prosecutions and the refusal to declassify that documentation.  That is some of the detail which will be covered in evidence to come but the essential question, if I may refer to it once more in summary Chair is, you’ve seen the organisational structure in its fullness, the question is whether law enforcement agencies were manipulated deliberately and weakened deliberately to protect high profile persons or persons in high office in government.  We will ask that question and seek to answer it and further to prosecute selected persons, government officials or members of the executive to achieve the same end or that, whether that was done in order to further the aims of corruption and state capture.  Chair if I may just finally qualify what we have said by way of opening, firstly the statistics put up a provisional subject to correction but in our view they illustrate a very disturbing trend which needs investigation and final assessment by this Commission.  Secondly, Chair, at the moment we are asking questions we have not determined that there are any answers except that there appears to be a very disturbing need to ask these questions and to answer these questions.  The evidence is subject to scrutiny not only by yourself but by those interested parties who will cross-examine, that by way of opening Chair.     Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS   INQUIRY RESUMES    Thank you Chair.  Chair before we proceed with the evidence I am told that there are number of counsel who wish to place themselves on record as representing parties.    Chair if I may just add one small piece of information on behalf of the secretariat who issued the notices there was an earlier email that was indeed sent but somehow it did not reach its destination.  I am not sure why if may be that it was an outdated or incorrect email address.    But I will at that and try and address the issue accordingly.    The witness in the – Chair down there at least – oh I am told that there is another councillor who wishes to put himself on record I was not informed of that before but…    But if you can afford the opportunity Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Just to add to that.  I am not sure whether any correspondence or communications have been addressed to this secretariat.    In regard to these issues.    But I have made a note of them.    And I will raise them with the secretariat and deal with them accordingly.    Yes.    I certainly to the best of my knowledge at least have not received any communication.    Of that sense but…    Given the administrative burden that the secretariat has to deal with those communications are useful so they can be dealt with timeously.    Chair may Mr McBride be sworn?    Thank you Chair.    Mr McBride before you and for the benefit of the Chair you have Exhibit Y.  Exhibit Y is made up of four bundles Exhibit YA, YB, YC    Right if you would go to page 33 please?  Do you have it?    Whose signature is that on page 33?    Yes.    Right and you on the face of it attested to this affidavit on the 13 February 2019, is that correct?    Since then your status has changed but we will deal with that in a moment.  If you would go back to page 1 please of that document?  Is this your affidavit?    Are you satisfied that the contents are true and correct subject to some minor amendments which we will make in due course?    The amendments Chair of minor nature but they will be included as is the current practice in a supplementary affidavit.    Which we will seek to deal with…    Such matters as are necessary and may emerge in evidence.    Mr McBride your statement says that you are or were in February at least the Executive Director of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate?    Your status has since February changed what is the position now?    Okay.  Your curriculum vitae is attached.  We need not go there insofar as the Chair may wish to ask you questions.  He may but it is known that you do have political affiliations historically, what is the relevance because I know you hold strong views about this for the purposes of your evidence, what is your attitude to the relevance of your political affiliations to your history with IPID and your evidence today?    Would you tell the Chair a little of IPID the Independent Police Investigative Directorate?  What is its function?    Is it governed by any legislation?    Under which Ministry notionally at least does IPID fall?    Now the powers of the Minister of Police and powers afforded by the constitution or the constitutionality of the powers afforded by legislation have been the subject of some litigation which recently came before the constitutional court we will deal with that in a moment but very briefly the constitutional court we will learn in a matter in – of which you certainly have knowledge and were involved.  The powers afforded by the constitution and legislation of the Minister of Police are limited.    And the constitutional court has we will see and we will refer to that judgment in due course emphasise the independence of IPID?    Under your watch how important was it and why is it important that IPID be independent?    Apart from the uncertainty related to your present status, for what period were you the Executive Director of IPID?    Oh is that from 2014 to 2019?    How – during your watch how large or what was the staff compliment of IPID?    And of that staff how many investigators were there?    And I understand that the staff compliment including investigators of IPID are spread and located in all provinces?    And the head office of IPID is in Pretoria?    Alright.  To whom would you as an Executive Director report both strategically and functionally?  If you could explain the distinction between the two reporting lines of which we are now aware to the Minister of Police on the one hand and to Parliament on the other?    SCOPA?  The Select Committee on Public Accounts?    Is there a Portfolio Committee to which you report?    And how often are you required to report to that committee?    The IPID Act if we may refer to it as such came into effect I understand on the 1 April 2012?    Is your budget accounted for separately from that of the police budget?    And IPID succeeded the former Independent Complaints Directorate, am I correct?    Would you for the benefit of the Chair and other interested parties just try and give some practical examples of the work that IPID is mandated to do?    Alright if we may then turn to Exhibit Y Annexure A on page 34 of bundle YA.  Page 35 that is the Independent Police Investigative Directorate Act.  For the sake of completeness I would like to refer to you certain sections of that Act and as your responsibilities will become the subject matter of your evidence in due course if we could refer to Section 7.      That highlights or stipulates rather the responsibilities of the Executive Director.  Section 7.2 what does that provide?    And Section 3A/    If we could just pause there because it is important in relation to the independence of IPID.  Who appoints the Executive Director?    Alright.  And apart from the appointment of the Executive Director all appointment subordinate to the Executive Director are made by whom?    And I take it that that is one of the mechanisms utilised to ensure the independent of IPID from other Law Enforcement Agencies and particularly the South African Police Service?    Perhaps we should go there because it is    Those provisions are relevant to the Constitutional Court judgment to which we will refer later.  Then Section 7.4 having conducted its investigations in relation to conduct of members of the South African Police Service what happens to the investigation and who determines the outcome of the investigation?    Section 7.4 then reads   And it seems that there should be a record of all such notifications to the sitting Minister of Police of any referrals from IPID to the NPA.  Correct?    If we can go then to Section 24.  Section 24 deals with the investigative powers.  Again these will become relevant later in evidence.  Would you perhaps please read Section 24.1 and two onto the record and make any comment you wish in relation to those sections?    To summarise although IPID is there to exercise oversight over members of the South African Police Services.    Investigators who are seconded to IPID or who are employed by IPID have police powers in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act?    If we could go then to Section 28 which is on page 46 of Annexure A.  Section 28 delineates the matters of the type of matters that are to be investigated by IPID.  You have mentioned some.  The complete list is there in Section 28.  Would you read those onto the record please?    Before we move to the regulations insofar as they may be relevant do any or does any other Law Enforcement Agency have the power or does any Minister particularly the Minister of Police have the power to control or exercise any influence over IPID investigations?    In paragraph 7 you say that there are regulations which govern amongst other things the duties of investigators.  Would you tell the Chair please what investigators must do in relation to investigations and the reporting of the outcome of their investigations please?  Again this is a matter relevant to your evidence.    If I may refer you to page 61 of Annexure A to your statement.  Sorry it is Annexure B now.  We have moved to Annexure B which is apparent from page 57 are the regulations governing the operation of IPID.  Do you see that on page 57?    We can go to page 61.  Regulation 5(3)(i), if you would just read that onto the record and make any comment you wish to in that regard.  I suppose we should read the introductory portion of the previous page next to    If you could just deal with that please.    Now this deals specifically with deaths, but in relation to other matters investigated by IPID do similar provisions apply/    So if an investigator conducts an investigation what is the reporting line and brief?    Before we leave these general matters there is another matter about which I would like to ask and obtain information for further evidence that will be led.  We know that Crime Intelligence falls within the South African Police Service organisation?    And we know that IPID may investigate conduct within the South African Police Service?    Am I correct that IPID has the power to investigate conduct within Crime Intelligence.    We will lead evidence in due course concerning conduct within Crime Intelligence but in the course and conduct of your duties as Executive Director of IPID did you come across any particular problem with relation to your investigations into Crime Intelligence and if you could tell the Chair briefly about that please?    Mr McBride was this an isolated example?  Was it more than isolated?  In other words could you just give the Chair some indication of how often this occurred?    This is the point I wanted to get to.  I am sorry for interrupting you.    To deal with that particular aspect of evidence.  Were these reported to your oversight institute that is the Director General of Intelligence and what happened as a result thereof?    Mr McBride without asking you for a definitive answer in relation to statistics in relation to a successful or intended prosecutions do you know of any successful prosecution – criminal prosecution – arising out of the circumstances to which you have just referred the Chair?    Right.    That is 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act?    We may just summarise that point you just made.  It is that people who may not independent or impartial in relation to a particular mechanism used to restrict the flow of information in particular classification of documents is entrusted with that very duty.    So if you – let me put it another way.  You are investigating.    In your IPID capacity misconduct within the police.  Documents are classified.  You – your evidence is to obstruct the free flow of information to IPID.    In order to breach that barrier you need the permission of the very organisation that you are investigating?    Alright.  If we may then move onto page 3 of your statement where you give an overview of the nature and purpose of the evidence that you are giving from a factual point of view.    Yes please.  Just deal with the points you make on page 3 from paragraph 9 and following.    If we may but before you go on Mr McBride may we just highlight two features of your evidence.  You have told the Chair that there is a general issue that you wish to address and that is the weakening of an interference with oversight bodies and the… (break in audio – sound engineer taken ill) INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you Chair.  Mr McBride you were about to tell the Chair of your response to the potential criticism of your evidence that you have a personal axe to grind as a result of your treatment over the past year or so, and that it doesn’t really fit within the terms of reference of the Commission, which is investigating the effectiveness of the law enforcement agencies including oversight bodies and dealing with State Capture, corruption and fraud.       If your evidence which you will give indeed is accepted by the Chair one might ask the question why would anybody be interested in weakening or hollowing out or reducing the effectiveness of an oversight body such as IPID, whose interests would it serve?     So now Mr McBride you will relate to the Chair those circumstances which you personally experienced which together with other information which you have learnt over time has led you to draw the conclusions  that you have drawn and will draw at the conclusion of your testimony.     Was there any response to the statement of which you’re aware, public response or official response?     You will deal with that matter expressly in t detail in due course.      So in paragraph 10 you say that you will explain your suspension on 25 March 2015 and you will also deal with ...(intervention)      To be corrected Chair in a supplementary affidavit, the correct date is 25th.     What is the correct date?     We will deal with that appropriately Chair.     You say you will also deal with  suspensions and transfers of persons other than yourself, just explain that in very, very broad headline terms to the Chair please.     You will give detailed examples at the end of your statement?     But in general you are saying that appointments, dismissals, transfers had a particular effect on IPID, what was that effect?     Yes if I may just request that we leave that issue to where you will deal with it in detail but basically what you are saying is that statistics were manipulated.     But we will come to that if we may in its proper time, I don’t want to prevent you from dealing with it at all.  Your suspension was lifted ...(intervention)      Your suspension was ultimately lifted, is that correct?     Was that on the 6th of September 2016?     And you had then been suspended for approximately 18 months?     What led to the lifting of your suspension?     And what, if I may just interject there, we will come to the judgment of Bosielo, AJ in due course, in detail, but what informed that judgment and the principle that underlay the reasoning in that judgment was in fact the independent of IPID from the Police Department hierarchy, including the Minister, am I correct?     Right.     You refer in paragraph 12 again just in general terms and perhaps we should keep it at that level because there will be further evidence from those involved, to others who suffered the same fate or the same attempted fate as you did, just names those people please?     The criminal charges that were brought against General Sibiya and Dramat against your IPID colleagues who were involved with you in the narrative that you are about to relate and yourself what happened to those charges ultimately?     Alright, we will come to the detail in due course, if I may just keep to the scheme of your statement which is at this stage just an overview of what you will testify to.  In paragraph 14 from your own knowledge or observation in your position as IPID head you mentioned as contrasted with the prosecutions that did take place or attempted prosecutions that did take place, and we’re referred to some of those in the opening statement before the Chair, there were prosecutions that did not take place which you say ought to have at least found their way to the court at some stage.  Just highlight those please for the Chair.     Alright those are some examples that you have to illustrate the point that you’re making.  In paragraph 15 Mr McBride you say  in my view that both the prosecutions and the non-prosecutions to which you’re referring is the modus operandi that has been used to capture law enforcement agencies including the National Prosecuting Authority and has led to a weakened criminal justice system, that’s your conclusion.     And the purpose of your evidence and the evidence of others is to ask the question to the Chair and for the Chair to make findings and recommendations in regard to the issues is to whether the facts to which you and others will testify support that thesis or do they not support that thesis?   If we may then move to a new topic, DCJ I am told that it’s almost one o’clock, the next paragraph will be quite a lengthy topic with a long exposition I am sure.    Thank you Chair.  Mr McBride before the long adjournment you spoke of an article that you presented to the media in I think in May 16 it is that you authored together with Ivan Pillay and Anwar Dramat, do you recall that?    Would you just look at the document now being shown to you please and identify that?  We can then add it to the bundle and paginate it and refer to it later in your evidence if the need arises.      Is that the article?    Yes.    Yes we will deal with matters which arise from this article in due course to the extent necessary and to the extent not already covered by your existing evidence.  But as long as you have identified it we can then add it to the bundle.      Can you assist the Chair there please?  Is this the statement you released?    Or you – yes.    So the question is, is the report before you a complete and accurate reflection of your statement or is your statement different in some respects?  And if you could just have a look at it overnight and tell us tomorrow morning?  Thank you.    We are at paragraph 16 of your statement Mr McBride.  Would you tell the Chair of the circumstances referred there by way of background to what you have to say later?    Right what were – what was the central allegation in the so called rendition matter and in the progress report which you say was issued before you arrived at IPID?    Right did this progress report include any recommendation in regard to Messrs Dramat and Sibiya?    Right.  What…    So we know thus far Mr McBride that prior to your appointment as the Executive Director of IPID in 2014 a report already existed?    An IPID report?  Well that is controversial. Let us just – let us just say a report?    No I would just want to summarise.    And you can comment at the end?    This report recommended that Messrs Dramat and Sibiya be criminally charged, do you recall the offence or the alleged offence?    You have got it in paragraph 16 and you can refer to that.  The last line.    Right.  This report then would have been prepared under the executive directorship of your predecessor?    Who was that?    Right.  At the time what positions did Messrs Dramat and Sibiya hold respectively?    And …    Dramat left office or was removed from office in 2015, am I correct?    Who replaced him?    Alright.  And General Sibiya what happened to him?    By whom?    Right.  You were appointed Executive Director then on the 3 March 2014 you say in paragraph 17, is that correct?    What did you do on your appointment relevant to your evidence?    Right did you receive that briefing?    Before you go there can we just clear up one detail or two details.  Messrs Ncuba and Sesoko are going to feature in the evidence and they will ultimately possibly also give evidence.  Who were they – what positions did they occupy?    Within IPID both of them?    Yes.  You drew certain conclusions initially from these briefings well what you were told over the course of the ensuing months is of relevance and we will deal with that in detail in due course.  But your first observation having been briefed is what you were about to tell the Chair.    Alright.  We perhaps going a little too fast surprisingly into evidence which is later in your statement.    Now you have stressed to the Chair the statutory framework and the various judgments to which you will refer that emphasise the importance of the independents of IPID.  Not only is it important but it is indispensable to our law enforcement system.  You have given that evidence.  What function would criminal intelligence then which is part of SAPS and part of the regime over which you have oversight, what function would criminal intelligence then have in preparing such a docket in conjunction with or for IPID?    A second issue arising from what you have just told the Chair may become important later when we talk of certainly the Workman’s Report and your views on the Workman’s Report.  At the time of your first briefings you say they took a week or so?    Where you were given verbal briefings.    You say that you were told that certain information had to be added to or supplemented to an existing file/report/docket, what was the position?    Alright before you go on.  Just to revert to one point which may become important.  The information was to be added to other information already in the possession of the NPA, am I correct?    Does it not follow therefore from what you were told that there would have been a report already in possession of the NPA because otherwise it could not act?  Am I correct, am I not correct?    Right.  A docket containing certain information?    Because you know that in – I am sorry.  You know that in the Worksman’s Report which we will deal with in due course.    It was found that you did indeed have knowledge of what has become termed as the first report?    Yes we may return to that issue.  Did you reach any conclusion at least initially in relation to what existed in the case file at that stage?     You deal with that in paragraph 19.    By this you mean the rendition as we have called it?    Thank you Mr McBride.  You say then in summary you are appointed.  You are told of an investigation conducted with the assistance or at the behest of Crime Intelligence.  We can clarify that relationship in due course.  You interrogate the facts and you reach a certain conclusion which to put it at its highest is an issue of doubt around the validity of any conclusions that might have been reached albeit on an initial basis?    Alright.    What did you then direct having received these briefings?  You deal with that in paragraph 20 of your statement.    Right.  Did you then assess what needed to be done after your briefings?    And what did you decide needed to be done?    Did you direct further investigations be conducted?    You deal with that at paragraph 20 of your affidavit.  Briefly could you detail what further investigations were in your view necessary to be undertaken?    At the stage you received your briefings had the relevant cellphone records being properly and comprehensively analysed?    What did the analysis of the cellphone records in view show?    Alright.  Your answer may not explain to people who have no knowledge of the detail precisely what happened but you refer to three persons who made claims about the whereabouts of General Sibiya on the crime scene or at a particular time.  What time was this?  What occasion was this?    At issue was whether General Sibiya knew of, was involved in or was present at the “rendition operation” and its execution.  Correct?    So his whereabouts were important?    Okay.    Just one fact which emerges from your answer now the key witnesses in relation to the involvement of General Sibiya were from Crime Intelligence?    And the investigation was being conducted at least in part by Crime Intelligence?    We may have to deal with some detail in due course but I understand and this is just to place Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba on the scene.  Did you give Mr Sesoko any task?  Remember the reports had been given to – careless use of word on my part.  I am sorry.  The briefings had been given to you by Mr Khuba.  Correct.    I am sorry.  Did he have a rank?  Perhaps I should give him due recognition.  Was it Mr Khuba or did he have a rank at the time?    Alright.    Well let me not bother then.  Mr Khuba gave the briefings to you?    Sesoko in your view should he have been involved?    Right.  Did you then task Mr Sesoko with any mandate?    Thank you.  The Chair referred to the provisions of the Act and if I may just place on record again Section 7(4) of the IPID Act    Although we do know that matters may be transferred through other channels and we will try and find that as well.  You yourself have told us about that?    Right.  The further investigations and the review did they lead you to a conclusion different to the one that had been referred to the NPA previously?    Sibiya?    Alright and in respect of General Dramat what was the outcome of the further investigations?     Right, because in some and in summary you say that as far as General Dramat is concerned the evidence was, as I understand what you’re telling the Chair now, was simply that he was invited to discuss the matter and after the event congratulated certain police officers, that was the evidence.    In any event as I understand your position is that after the briefings, after directing further investigations you concluded that the elements of the crimes with which or in respect of which there was an initial proposal General Dramat and Sabir be charged could not be countenanced.     What happened then on the 18th of March 2014 in respect of these matters?     We’re at paragraph 21.    Right so that report was dated the 18th of March 2014 according to your statement.    Or is that the date of issue does it differ from the date of finalisation and signature?    Perhaps go to page 227.    Page 264, does that help you?     It seems that you signed it on a different date?    What date was that?    So it would have been issued then after your signature, am I correct?    So the 18th of March 2014 is incorrect and we should replace that with sometime after 9 April 2014?    Thank you, in any event apart from that, is it correct that a report under your signature was issued to the NDPP firstly?    And secondly as you’ve indicated would be the case, that report effectively exonerated Messrs. Dramat and Sibiya?    Alright two issues, firstly your use of the words, effectively exonerated perhaps then should be rephrased I don’t want to get into a semantic argument, you’ve put your position clearly we will just amend that and put...(intervention).    Alright.    Well for the sake of completeness and accuracy we could go to page 264 and under the heading “recommendation” in paragraph 8 of the report signed by you on the 9th of April 2014 you could perhaps read the recommendation onto the record.    Then paragraph 22 you deal with the involvement of the then Minister of Police Minister Nhleko in the matters related to the issuing of what you call the final IPID report in paragraph 22, please explain what happened there?    Sorry with what explanation?    Okay.    IPID’s spokesperson or Ministerial spokesperson?    Yes.    Sorry just before you go on had Minister Nhkleko gone public in relation to the reasons for the suspension of General Dramat?    And importantly what was the justification given in the public statement?    Yes, what you say was not correct?    Ultimately...(intervention).    You refer to the first or ‘provisional report’ in inverted commas surfacing, was that a leak to your knowledge?  Was it an authorised release of the first report?    Alright so what I…    So what I understand from your answer is that there was a level of intrigue somewhere you do not quite know where?    Alright.    Yes but I return to my question Mr Mc Bride.    The provisional report.    Or the first report you say surfaced in the press?    Was that an official release by an – by a person authorised to release it to the press or was it what we now know the term ‘leaked’?    Alright.    Thank you Mr McBride.  The contents of the provisional or first report and of the final report signed by you will be dealt with in due course in a little more detail.  But to summarise thus far you came into office, you were told of an investigation labelled the rendition investigation.  You directed certain further investigations take place and that the original information be reviewed.  And you signed a report then in April 2014?    That was submitted – and that report was submitted to the NDPP?    In December of the same year then General Dramat was suspended it seems on the basis of the provisional report and not on the basis of the final report?    Right that is the implication at least of your evidence.    And in public through his advisor perhaps the Minister relied apparently on the first or provisional report to justify the suspension of General Dramat?    Ultimately as a result of what you have described what happened to General Dramat?  Was the out – what was the outcome?      Is that Minister Nhleko?    15th of?    What was the Pandey case?    Alright.  When – yes I side tracked you I am sorry.  Please continue.    I had asked you and you had intervened with this evidence in relation to the ultimate fate of General Dramat arising out of these incidents.  I am fast forwarding just to explain to the Chair the context and outcome.      What happened to Dramat ultimately?    And who replaced him as head of the Hawks?    Alright.     It may be termed an irony but as I understand your evidence and the facts the law IPID is there is investigate the police?    And what is happening with the Reference Group is that the Minister has set up a different inquiry to investigate IPID, is that right?     Mr McBride would you look please at paragraphs 23 and 24 and just tell the Chair of the contents thereof so that we can wrap up at least this part of this part of your statement?    Yes.  If you would just look at your statement at paragraphs 23 and 24.    Just in part summarise as in part introduces new facts but it wraps up the evidence that you have just given.    Just would you put that on record please?    Just before you go on we will come to that issue in due course because that is the subject matter of the Worksman’s Report which is a matter of some controversy between yourself and Worksman’s and we will deal with that in detail.  But the first point is that the Minister justified the suspension of Mr Dramat on the basis of the provisional first report and your response was that the Minister was wrong because there was a proper second report signed by yourself.    Is that correct?  And you say in paragraph 23 that the provisional report prepared by Mr Ncuba was indeed incomplete because it did not consider all the evidence in its totality in particular exculpatory evidence?    And then you say in the last sentence of paragraph 23 that the first report was signed only by Mr Ncuba and in terms of IPID regulations indeed we now know the Act and standing operational procedures all final reports must be countersigned by the investigator, supervisor and you say in the statement the approving authority prior to referring the case file to the NPA, is that correct?    Right.    Right and the approving authority referred to in the last line of paragraph 23 is yourself?  Is that correct?    You say in paragraph 24 as you have said now you publically contradicted the statement by the Minister and clarified that Dramat and Sibiya had been exonerated.  You use the word exonerated there.  I presume you mean affectively exonerated by the IPID investigation and then the Minister accused you of fraudulently altering the IPID report?    You deal with that in that sequence.    And then you were suspended?    Chair there will be direct evidence of that conversation.    Is this a convenient time for?    A 10 minute adjournment?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  You refer to certain public statements in paragraphs 23 and 24 Mr McBride, I presume that you will be able to assist us to find those statements?    My understanding Chair is that there is, and if I remember correctly in our submission of papers and urgent application at the High Court and Constitutional we would have annexed all of those issues.    Thank you Chair.  Mr McBride just to refer to certain to statements made under oath by Mr Khuba the document at page 1225 of Bundle CYC what is that document?    Yes Chair.    It’s perhaps appropriate to deal with this affidavit at this stage, although it is possible that Mr Khuba will give evidence, the full story from his point of view is set out here and I’m going to refer you to certain paragraphs if I may to see what you say about those paragraphs.  I understand that this is Mr Khuba’s affidavit in the matter where you challenged your suspension and it’s the affidavit which finally came to rest in the halls of the Constitutional Court.    You go to page 1226.    I presume it is correct as appears from this affidavit and from your evidence to date that Mr Khuba was in IPID an official in IPID long before you came onto the scene at IPID, correct?    He says in paragraph 5 on page 1226   In paragraph – he may explain the delay of a     And it appears from paragraph 6.2 that your predecessor, Mr Beekman, instructed Sesoko, the then Acting Chief Director of Investigations at IPID to initiate an investigation, correct?    It then appears that Sesoko appointed Khuba to head the investigation, but it seems that shortly after that appointment both Sesoko and Khuba were instructed to hold off the investigation apparently on the instruction of the then Minister of Police, Mr Nathi Mthethwa, do you see that?    It was only about a year later during October 12 that a Colonel Makangwe from SAPS Crime Intelligence Gathering Division came to Sesoka’s office at IPID and at that stage it appears that in the intervening period Crime Intelligence, or the intervening year to which we’ve just referred, Crime Intelligence were indeed investigating the matter, is that your understanding of what happened?    Makangwe handed over the docket that Criminal Investigation Gathering – or sorry – Crime Intelligence Gathering Division had opened into the renditions matter and advised, according to Khuba in any event, advised Sesoko that an investigation had already been conducted by Crime Intelligence Gathering – sorry Chair – and that the matter was not being handed over to IPID on the instructions of the Minister of Police Mr Nathi Mthethwa, is that your understanding of what occurred?    Khuba continues to say that shortly after I began my investigations I briefed Mbeki on the case and informed her that I would consult with Seseko in the course of the investigation.  Now Mbeki was as you’ve told the Chair your immediate predecessor Executive Director IPID, correct?    He says that is Khuba says that it was common practice to consult with your immediate superior, is that your understanding of the practice within IPID?    You’ve said so.  Khuba continues to say as the National Head of Investigations at IPID Sesoko was ordinarily consulted and briefed on all national investigations.  Khuba continues to say in paragraph 6.6 on page 1228, to my surprise Mbeki categorically instructed me not to work with or discuss the investigation with Sesoko.  Mbeki instructed me instead to collaborate with Makangwe from CIG, that’s Crime Intelligence Gathering, in the conduct of the investigation and to keep this collaboration secret.  This was the first and the only time that I’d received such instructions about an investigation.   Now to the extent that the facts in paragraph 6.6 may be found to be correct after all the evidence is heard by the Chair is that circumstance or are those circumstances unusual or questionable?    Apart from it being unusual Mr McBride may I ask you would it be proper or lawful for the IPID director, and I know I’m asking for your opinion but from your personal knowledge and experience for the Acting Director Executive Director of IPID to instruct an investigator not to report to his superior but rather to collaborate in secret with someone from another branch of the South African Police Service, particularly where the witnesses were from Crime Intelligence themselves?    In paragraph 6.7 Khuba continues, he says   Paragraph 10 on page 1231 of Khuba’s    Right then he refers in paragraph 11 and following to the report of January 2015, what you’ve referred to as the first or the provisional report.  In paragraph 13 he says, well in paragraph 12 he says – just bear with me a moment Chair please – he says on 20 – if I can go back one paragraph to    Towards the end of the 2013 Mosingh started insisting that I finalise my investigations and give him the report.  My sense was that he    Right but you do know, as I understand it, that there was dissatisfaction that the 2014 report was incomplete, that was your own view?    And that certainly from your part you directed that the docket be supplemented with outstanding evidence, is that correct?    It’s perhaps appropriate at this time to make a point that you made to the investigators, there’s a distinction as I understand it between the report that IPID would produce and the evidence contained in any file or ultimately in any docket.    It’s common cause that the final report, or second report differed in content from the first or provisional report?    Was the evidence contained in the docket ever altered?    Right.    It is important to clarify the – in the Werksmans’ report there’s evidence of changes to certain documents whether that is a change to the report or to documents contained in the docket we will clarify in due course when we get there, but it’s important that we go there and you get an opportunity to deal with that.  However as I understand what you are telling the Chair is that nothing was removed so that the original statements would have all been there, or the original documents would have all been there?    Because the report is what, as opposed to the evidence?    Let me put it this way is the report evidence?    Continuing, sorry Chair.    We will return to the statement in due course when dealing with the Werksmans’ report Mr McBride but for the present at page 1232    And then in paragraph 14.4 he says   Paragraph 14.5 he says   Right, he was the so-called eye witness I understand, is that correct?    Through the sms invitation?    Okay, alright.  In any event he says in    Page 1234.    Paragraph 15.    The first sentence.    Is that correct?    To your knowledge?    And in fact you managed and directed that further gathering and analysis of evidence, is that correct?  After the January 2014 report or certainly after your briefing in March.    Is you go to page 1266 you will see the Annexure to the affidavit of Mr Ncuba.  It is a communication from Anthony Mosing of the NPA to Mr Ncuba dated the 28 February 2014.    The subject is Response to Questions posed    Yes.  Indeed because that was still in the process of being collated.    And that is the point made in paragraph 15 by Mr Ncuba as I understand it?    We will deal with the remainder of the evidence of Mr Ncuba in this affidavit either indirectly through yourself when we deal with the Worksman’s Report or directly from Mr Ncuba himself if and when gives evidence.  So for the present if we may return to your statement.  If we can turn to Annexure E at page 143.      This is an application to the high court Gauteng Provincial Division to interdict your suspension and to obtain interim relief, is that correct?    That is certainly in Part A.    And Part B is to set aside your suspension on various grounds?    Amongst those grounds on page 145 is that the apparent empowering provisions empowering the Minister of Police to suspend you or remove you from office as Executive Director of IPID would be unconstitutional?    That is eventually what the constitutional court found?    Although it was found that the matter was not urgent and you were not afforded interim relief, is that correct?    In that affidavit at page 161 you deal with the matters related to the independence of IPID we needed traverse them again in any more detail, do you see that?    And in – on page 163 you say in paragraph 37   And then in paragraph 45 on page 166 you    The constitutional court made no finding in respect of that allegation as I understand it?    In paragraph 27 you speak of a circumstance that occurred before your suspension.  Perhaps we should just put matters in their proper context.    Paragraph 27.    When, by whom and how were you suspended?    Minister of Police?    Who was that?    I am sorry just be – let us take it a little more slowly if we may and step by step.  You have told the Chair that you were suspended?    The grounds for your suspension you say in paragraph 26 were summarised or stated as being based on two contradictory reports emanating from IPID concerning the rendition saga, is that correct?    So am I to understand correctly you were confronted with the allegation or fact that IPID had issued two contradictory reports?    And the inference was that the second report was somehow falsified or prepared fraudulently, is that correct?    In order to achieve a certain aim?    That is the subject matter of the Worksman’s Report which we will deal with in due course.  But on this basis before your suspension you wanted to approach the Portfolio Committee. May I just ask is there a difference between the Portfolio Committee on Police and the Study Group that you referred to or are they the same thing?    Yes that is how we understand it.    For the purpose of your evidence in paragraph 27 which entity were you seeking to address and which entity was chaired by Mr Francois Beukman, the Portfolio Committee or the Study Group?    Right.    Right.    If I may just intervene there Mr McBride we dealing here with the Portfolio Committee which is enjoined by Parliament to exercise oversight and your evidence here is relevant to Parliamentary oversight.    Over what was occurring here.  You asked Mr Beukman for an opportunity on behalf of IPID before your suspension to address the Portfolio Committee.  What was Mr Beukman’s response?    Sub judice.    Correct.    Alright.  You then go on to say that quite contradictory to the approach adopted by Mr Beukman in regard to your request Mr Mhleko in fact did address the Portfolio Committee, is that correct?    Right.  Before you go on perhaps that is a convenient time because we are at five o’clock Chair.    May we compromise at half past nine?    Chair I have other matters to attend to.    My current is that we will not.    Yes I do not feel the pressure of more time Chair.    I do feel the pressure of having to make a forecast.    Chair the…   Thank you Chair I would be grateful.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV TEMBEKA NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes.   Thank you Mr Chair. My name is Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.  I am with Ms Hanna Taouk.  We act for Werksmans Attorneys.    It is the first time we have got to know about the topic.    And we would obviously like to make a contribution to assist the Commission.    But not at this stage Mr Chair.    Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MAHLTATSI:  Good morning Chairperson.      My name is Phillip Mahltatsi from the Johannesburg Bar.  I hold my rooms at Pitje Chambers in Johannesburg.  Chairperson this morning I am appearing or representing Mr Shaun Abrahams who is the former National Director of Public Prosecution.  Chairperson he indicates that he only received the Rule point – the Rule 3.3. Notice yesterday so as a result we have not been able to properly consult.  So as matters stand obviously everything will then be dependent upon the evidence that will be led during these proceedings from which then we will make an election whether or not we choose to apply for cross-examination because I have only had a perfunctory reading of the affidavit of Mr McBride at this stage obviously without having consulted with my client I have not made an election as to what happens next.    Thank you Chair for your indulgence.  In fact before I then stood here I spoke to my colleague Mr Pretorius SC.    Who has given assurances to the effect?    Thank you Chairperson. 
ADV JOHAN EKSTEEN:  Good morning Chair.      My name is Johan Eksteen from the firm BDK Attorneys.  We are here to represent quite a few of the implicated persons Chair.     The first one is Lieutenant General Phahlane.    The former acting commissioner.  The current provincial commissioner of the North West Lieutenant General Motswenyane.   Lieutenant General Phahlane the former acting commissioner.    And then the current provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Motswenyane    That is correct Chair.      As well as Major General Mabula.      And Brigadier Ncuba.    It is also during the implications of General Mabula there is various members of the North West team that has been implicated who have not been received any notices but we are here to …     To represent them.     There was just one aspect Chair that I brought this morning to the secretary’s attention that the notice that was issued to Leiutenant General Motswenyane.     Was indeed defective because it was issued to her husband.    It was only realised after it was served on him.     That it is not for him but for her.     Because the problem here is Chair is that all of these persons that we represent needs to approach the state attorney.    For authorisation.    That they be represented by us and by council.    At a later stage.    And if there is a defective notice clearly that would not be granted.    So therefore I – were here on Monday as well.    I know about the indulgence that…    The Chair has explained.    This was brought under the attention of the …    Implicated persons; they are satisfied with that and we will abide by it. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record?     Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?     Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?     Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth and if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.     Thank you.    All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct sir.    Okay.  24.1   Yes.    Indeed that is.    Thank you.  In terms of 28.1A   Absolutely not Chairperson.    In – in terms of the regulations the investigator must submit the relevant evidence to his supervisor which ultimately will become the Provincial Head of the Executive Director before it is signed off to the National Prosecuting Authority.    Yes, I have it.    Yes.    Thank you Chair and it reads as follows   Absolutely.    It is to the – if it is within a province and it is initiated in a province or delegated to a province to deal with it would be the Provincial Head who then signs it off for submission to the National Prosecuting Authority.  If it is initiated at National or in certain circumstances covers more than one province it would come to the Executive Director ultimately and signed off for submission to the National Prosecuting Authority.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Absolutely sir.    Thank you.  Chair to be accurate any request for information from Crime Intelligence except for a brief period is generally met with resistance and very often Crime Intelligence will resort to speeches, classifications of documents in Contravention of the Policy on Minimum Information Security Standards which forbids the usage of classification to cover up maladministration or criminal conduct and as an example I can give.  In an investigation of abuse of state resources a senior officer who was not entitled to make use of an official SAPS vehicle made use of such a vehicle and it was reported to us and we investigated.  Upon the investigators requesting the log book of the vehicle to ascertain the days and number and stated purpose of usage it immediately became a classified document.  As to who classified the document for what purpose and when upon query telephonically investigators were told well that is also classified and this has resulted in a matter which on classification which is before the High Court to deal with this issue once and for all because this issue will bedevil future investigations including investigations where there are Commissions of inquiry.  As legislation and penalty and sanction for spurious classifications will go – continue to go unpunished.    Chair it is not isolated.  It is the general pattern including even cooperation.  For a brief period there was cooperation from the Acting Division Commissioner of Crime Intelligence Mokushane who had instructed people to cooperate with us in terms of the law but that was only for a few months.  Generally there is a problem and to – there is actually what we call in IPID a “blue curtain” which I think firstly the – the South African Police Services one of the oldest organisations in South Africa if not the oldest and as such it has old customs, traditions and practices and that generally makes any organisation resistant to any change.  In particular for a long time there was – there was not any effective oversight over the South African Police Services in its various forms and developments.  The result is that there is an instinctive resistance to any oversight or query or to hold account.  It is particularly so within Crime Intelligence which has part of their mandate as with other countries the cultivation of sources, informers and in the context of dealing with organised crime who are generally secretive to be able to infiltrate these criminal syndicates that they are required to have some element of secrecy.  That is – is understandable and that is the purpose of the usage of the Secret Service Account of Crime Intelligence.  More often than not even before my appointment to IPID there is evidence and history of cases where there has been rampant abuse and a sense of impunity in the exercise of the usage of the Secret Service Account of Crime Intelligence and that also goes towards the classification.  So there is what is termed in auditing “limited assurance” or “no assurance” given to how funds are spent, whether there is value for money, whether they spent correctly or they have been abused fraudulently.  It is – it is not transparent at all.  There are a number of cases which were initially handled by DPCI and then jointly between ourselves and DPCI and one of those cases off the top of my head is involving a case where a prosecution of the Former Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence had to be stopped midway because there was a refusal to do declassified documents.  What is ironic about that and indicates the frivolity of that decision is the fact that the same evidence that was suddenly classified for the criminal case was used in a disciplinary to get one of the co-conspirators dismissed.  So the evidence has been – it is out there in public but it is for a technical matter.  On a number of cases we have even written to the Minister – the present Minister - to assist with the declassification process upon which we were sent to the Inspector General of Intelligence who has the mandate to look at any document and [intervenes].    My apologies.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.  In terms of the lack of clarity or if I can venture to say the wilful lack of clarity and classification and resistance to oversight the IPID and Inspector General of Intelligence decided to sign a MOU to ensure cooperation between the two bodies which have oversight roles over Crime Intelligence and from IPID the wider SAPS.  Out of the MOU – the MOU made provision for a task team – a joint task team to look at matters in particular abuse of the fund and corruption within Crime Intelligence.  As such I am confident to say that a litany of corruption was brought to our attention through the collaboration with the Inspector General of Intelligence.  It also became known to me that the Inspector General and even previous ones have written what they call a “certificate” on the state of affairs of the use of the Secret Service Account and none of that was taken seriously in terms of consequence management for officers who were involved in that.  For example some people would in charge of an urgent network and then according to the allegations and evidence and knowledge from collaboration of the IGI would then employ members of their family as agents and draw off a salary or an agent fee or source fees from the Crime Intelligence Fund.    No sir.  At this point I have – I have no knowledge of a prosecution.    Chair that cooperation which should be forthcoming has been in many specific especially senior police ranks being resisted, being.    Obstructed.    There is a willingness to cooperate for lower ranks.    And to assist but the moment it reaches a certain level there is resistance.    And very often we have to resort to Section 205 summonses.    To obtain information.    And in a very recent one which is emanating from 17 it is claimed that the issues in which we require information about and namely in this case what was the purpose of a meeting.  It is – there was refusal to give it to us and then we applied for a 205.  It was granted and a number of senior police officers then went to the High Court to oppose the 205 hearing that was imminent.  It was about to happen.    That is correct.  That is a matter of litigation at the moment.  Where even from the side of the Inspector General of Intelligence on that matter and other related matters the Inspector General has provided an information note to the Minister of Police that none of the matters that were raised in the information note that I had sent to the Minister of Police on these classification matters if declassified holds any threat – will not cause any threat to sources employed by Crime Intelligence nor for the security of the state and in fact from the assessment of the Inspector General of Intelligence that the matters referred to appear to be about procurement only and the activities constitute maladministration and possibly criminal activity.  So we have even gone to lengths to have joint workshops at the insistence – instance and coordination of the IGI with Crime Intelligence and IPID to resolve the issues of mandates and we have discussed these issues.  We still have not had joy.  There is a kind of impasse by legislation and by practice where the person to declassify would be the head of an agency and the agency in this case in terms of the Intelligence Oversight Act would be the Head of the Service.  So the Act makes it quite clear that in terms of Crime Intelligence it will be the Divisional Commissioner.  Yet the practice in SAPS is that power is assumed by the National Commissioner.  Whereas the Act is quite clear that the National Commissioner for this purpose is to – his responsibility is to deal with administration and financial issues as it relates to Crime Intelligence and that the Head of the Service in terms of the definition is the Divisional Commissioner.  Yet there seems to be a reluctance by the Divisional Commissioner to utilise his powers to declassify.    Sorry.    Ja.    Yes sir.    Indeed sir.  That is the – the problem we experience regularly.    Should I go ahead?    Okay.  The purpose of my evidence before the Commission to assist the Commission is to express my own personal experiences as Executive Director of IPID what I observed and what evidence brought to light a number of litigations, court cases, judgments have indicated and led me to firmly believe that there was an attack on anti-corruption institutions and that my suspension on 25 March 2015 was part of that process to take control of independent anti-corruption bodies and remove the heads by suspension, spurious disciplinaries and then to supplant them with compliant people who would not carry out their task diligently and in particular.    At that stage Chairperson it was – it was not clear cut.  It – there was an explanation briefly as to who said what and how people were implicated.  Later on the same discussion took place about a month – two months later with the National Director of Public Prosecutions in a meeting between him, Mr Sesoko and myself just discussing the case after we had handed the case over to him in April.  So it was just soon after that and kind of brain storming what really is this funny creature which is called “rendition” for South African Law and what does it mean and so on but to answer your question Chair I did not get a clear answer.  Rather I got a description of the sequence of events as alleged.    Yes Chair.  If I can put it this way already I was under the firm belief that already the – the investigations independent and integrity has been compromised.    At the initial stages.    Thanks Chair.  In essence I requested that all the evidence must be reviewed and that all evidence that must now be acquired be processed because of the issue of the integrity.  I – I was nervous of the involvement of Crime Intelligence.  Already at that stage Crime Intelligence did not have a – a good public image if I can put it that way and then the usurping and the secrecy involved immediately got like I say I got my guard up, ja.    In terms of the investigation Chair it was only Crime Intelligence involved.    In terms of the suspects I cannot remember at which stage I realised that but the suspects were all from DPCI.    And a number of others who received – sorry to go into the detail – who received messages were from other divisions of SAPS but.    They were implicated only because they received SMS.    Success SMS.    That is correct Chair.    Yes that is correct [intervenes].    That an entire review of all evidence including that which was obtained before IPID received it.    Yes that is correct and I – I stated that in my information note to the Minister on 9 March.    It was the extent to which the identified suspects could be implicated and that would require the factoring of the cellphone records analysis but also to look at in terms of review I cannot remember specifically what I had said then and how it evolved later into – to what it was but briefly it was to review evidence in existence particularly because of the contamination and the fear expressed and concerned by the chief investigator who was Mr Khuba.    My understanding at that stage the cellphone records had been obtained and before I arrived the cellphone record analysis had been obtained and hence Khuba had requested the docket from Advocate Mosing to include this additional evidence in the docket.    As far as General Sibiya is concerned in contrast to what at least three Crime Intelligence Officers had stated namely that he was on at least three scene – three different scenes.  The cellphone records analysis showed that General Sibiya was not on any of the scenes and if I remember correctly Khuba told me that he even 205’d the private phone of General Sibiya and both phone recording – records analysis were consistent with each other but were in contradiction to the evidence that was contained in the statement by Crime Intelligence Officers.    It was during the – the tracking down and arrest of the Zimbabweans who were wanted in Zimbabwe.    Hm.    His whereabouts were important, but I would prefer if – if it is in order Chair that we break, break it down to, to arrest rather than the blanket “rendition” definition.    In terms of the – Chair in terms of the word “rendition” it is only what I know in the American context.    And that in the South African context it would not be allowed as described by media.    And reports of fiction about what “rendition” entails.    My understanding is that even based on the allegations.    Made by Crime Intelligence.    General Dramat’s association with the series of events was that he was informed by a Crime Intelligence Officer who was at the border.    That Zimbabwe officials want to come and see him.  They are looking for suspects.    So that is General Dramat.    The next link of General Dramat to the series of stuff is that he allegedly congratulated officers for the arrest of the Zimbabweans.    So it is two issues that link him to it.    He also was amongst those who received automated bulk SMS’ indicating successes.    So if I remember correctly.    That is the sum total.    Of General Dramat’s.    Involvement in this whole saga.    General Sibiya’s involvement was a – was at a scene where suspects were arrested and assaulted on three different scenes.    So after I was informed that General Sibiya could not be placed on any of the scenes in my own mind then it was – then it means that the three witnesses from Crime Intelligence placing General Sibiya on three different scenes cannot possibly reasonably be true and it just made me even more suspicious.  So, ja so Chair that is.    The sum total of their involvement.    In the whole saga.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.  My understanding.    And I still have the understanding.  It is not their function.    That is correct.    He was the Acting Provincial Head.    Ja.    Yes and one of the issues there Chair if you would allow me was that he had been told by Acting Executive Director Kuki Mbeki not to involve Sesoko in – in the investigation.    Absolutely sir.  He was the head – the National Head of Investigations and he was the direct supervisor to Mr Khuba.    Yes.  In – both Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko I directed that Mr Khuba must report to Mr Sesoko all developments in the case and that Mr Sesoko must oversee the process of review.    Yes sir.    Yes sir.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.  What had happened between the period of Mr Beekman’s resignation and the appointment of the Acting Executive Director at the stage in around November 2013 when I had been nominated for the post subject to approval by Parliament according to what I – I was told was that Ms Mbeki had actually stopped coming to work.  In fact I never ever met Ms Mbeki and Mr Khuba at some stage I do not know whether it was initially indicated to me that there was pressure placed on him by Advocate Mosing to bring the docket in December already and he had indicated to Advocate Mosing that the procedure is that the Executive Director must sign and that Advocate Mosing was still insistent that he gets the docket to him as soon as possible.  Later on I found out that during December, November or December 2013 prior to the docket and the recommendation report reaching Advocate Mosing there was other pressure place on Mr Khuba by General Ntlemeza who was Deputy Provincial Commissioner in Limpopo where Mr Khuba resided and the two of them knew each other from police work and investigations within the Province of Limpopo and I was not made aware of it in the first engagements with Khuba.  At some stage later on when he – he explained sequence of events in further detail.  He indicated that General Ntlemeza and he can answer for himself when he – if and when he testifies - had said to him that he is holding up his progress by taking long with the report.  So for Khuba he was under pressure to get whatever he had in the docket and whatever conclusions he had come to at that stage in the absence of additional information that was outstanding and possibly and now we know exculpatory evidence been included in the docket and been factored in and considered and that is how it came to be that the two factors - the unavailability of Ms Mbeki and the pressure placed on him - to deliver the docket with the recommendation report to Advocate Mosing.    Yes sir.    That is correct sir and in addition it was also not signed by the National Head of Investigations – the Acting Head of Investigations.    That is correct Chair.    That is – that is correct sir.    Because in this instance Khuba is the investigator.    He has to take it to his supervisor.    And his supervisor was Mr Sesoko.    So it would have to be cleared corrected.    Before it is passed over to the Executive Director to sign off on it.    To get it to the NPA.  So that process was purposefully omitted.    By the instructions.    Of Ms Mbeki.    That is correct sir.    And consequently it was not in terms of procedures.    And accepted practices of IPID.    At the stage when I was briefed I was – I was not aware but I subsequently became aware that she did not sign.    And only Mr Khuba signed.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct.    Chair at the time when the finalised recommendation report with a completed docket and I say completed docket advisedly because even as recent as 2016 whilst we were still out on suspension and that whole, entire docket had been given to another investigator officials of NPA had requested additional information.  So even in terms of what we believed was a completed docket and quite conclusive there was still additional information which is the normal process in terms of where there is a case and some elements missing, but at the time when we – when the report was given to me to sign off on as per the – the recommendations made by Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko they – there was a conclusion that one of the DPCI members who had not provided any version but there was evidence to indicate he was involved in the irregular documentation for repatriation was recommended to be prosecuted and to be disciplined.  Other generals which included the present Head of DPCI and I do not remember – I remember a General Tauke.  I remember a few other generals names mentioned.    General Sibiya.  General Sibiya was – I think the wording that was used at that time of the final report was the evidence that he was on the scene or involved could not sustain a prosecution.    In terms of the analysis as I recall it was to the effect that whether General Dramat received a phone call from the Crime Intelligence Office at Beit Bridge we do not know what the conversation was about.  There was an instance of a meeting which I forgot to mention earlier of General Dramat and the Zimbabweans Police Officers.  If the meeting did take place there are no minutes kept.  We do not know what was discussed and on the SMS’ received by General Dramat there was no response to them in fact one of the success reports did not even go to General Dramat.  It allegedly went to his personal assistant.  There is no evidence and even if my understanding was even if all that was alleged mainly by Crime Intelligence was correct it would not constitute the elements of a crime, so that was the answer to my initial question when we received the final report.    The purpose of me stating this and emphasising it is whatever is said in any report the NPA takes the final decision based on the evidence in the docket.    That is correct sir.  That is correct.    Thanks Chair.  That is correct yes.    Ja.    Hm.    No, absolutely Chair.  We had to.  We were also stung and dumbfounded by the allegations against us.    And what became clear as the Minister not acting in good faith and the Minister on a path that has been decided and later on – I am sorry Chair.  Just to go into – later on I become aware of that the conversation of the previous year of Mr Khuba and General Ntlemeza in Limpopo.  I also become aware that at the time of 2014 if – December the same day that – I might be a day or two out.  The same day General Dramat receives his notice of intention to suspend General Ntlemeza    That is correct.    That was in November/December 2013.    That is before even the first report now reaches Mosing.    Yes that is correct sir.    That is correct. 
CHAIR:  So would the position have therefore been that if after the additional documents had been sent to the NPA you removed the additional documents that came after what would have remained with the NPA would have been exactly what they had had before the addition of the documents?
