CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody.    Yes.      Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.    The file containing the statement of Mr Garth Strachan will be marked Exhibit CC36.    Good morning.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Well from what I have been told what the Minister is supposed to canvass something that appears to be quit narrow.  I am wondering why two weeks is necessary when from what I have been told she would have been ready today except maybe some commitments and so on.  Do you really need two weeks?    Hm.    You cannot say?    So you cannot say whether you need two weeks or one week?    How long has the Minister known about it?  She has known for some time.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So she has been working on certain files?    Which means it should be easier to finalise an existing draft.    Okay.    I am inclined to rather give you a week and if you really get into difficulties in complying then you approach and then I can consider giving you more, is that fine?    Yes so…   Let us say you will try and – or you file or finish her statement or affidavit on or before Friday next week.    If you really run into difficulties then you approach the commission.    Okay thank you.    Yes I am sorry this letter from the State Attorney.    Is it anything that I need to know about now or I can read later?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Are you ready that …    He be – that the oath be administered or affirmation.    Ja.      Thank you.    Thank you.    I think I know how…    How …    Why this is a SABS mark look like – looks like.    I am sure that is not one – the one.    I mean one sees it in all – in many products.    But I…    I do not know…    But I do not know if we need to see it.    Ja because…   Yes unless we anticipate that there will be some disputes about whether certain boxes were SABS approved.    Or they will be some dispute?    Yes.    And there will be some dispute about whether …    A particular mark is a SABS mark.    Oh okay.    Then that is fine let us see it.    Do you want to…    To give them a chance to get it while you – we continue.    Ja they must look for it and so when you go back to them they must have it ready.   So there has got to be testing in order to have certification?    Oh okay.    Okay.    Okay.    In fact there is not even an imitation of a SABS mark, is that right?    That – that sounds strange to me.  I hope I understand it correctly.  The South African Bureau of Standards is the authority that by law has been given power to certify goods and products to meet certain standards – to be meeting certain standards.  It sets the standard as well is it not?  Set the standards and then certifies that those goods or products – whether those goods or products meet that standard.  Is that right?    Yes.  So when I see South African Bureau of Standards mark on any product then I have the comfort that because I have high regard for the South African Bureau of Standards and knowing that it is an authority that performs this certification job in terms of the law I have the comfort that then the product must be fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.  But my understanding was that only the South African Bureau of Standards can put that stamp on a product and that when I see that mark I say it is the South African Bureau of Standards who have satisfied themselves that this product has got all the [indistinct] and the fissures that are required or this product when it meets the required standard.  Now from what you say – you have said I am getting the impression that somebody else – a company, an entity can put the stamp, the SABS mark on its product on the basis that intheir view that product meets the SABS standard.  Did I misunderstand something?    I have misunderstood?    Let us - let us go back to the example of that bottle in front of you.  If I am - if I manufacture a bottle and I bring it to SABS and ask SABS to certify it and put its mark on it.  I do not know whether they put its mark or they authorise me to put their mark on it but basically I go through that process and everything goes well. Is the position that the way this works is that once you have so to speak certified a sample then you give me authority or permission to go and manufacture other - other bottles of the same type and I undertake to manufacture them in the same way as the one that you have seen and make sure that it has got same things that it - the one I gave to you had and then if I am satisfied that I have made it in thatway then I do not take it back to you.  I put your mark on it.  Is that how it works?    Yes.  Maybe let us take it further.  I am trying to understand to what extent the system is open to abuse. From what - I think for some reason I took it that each bottle or product that has got a SABS mark has gone through a SABS certification or testing process but on - on reflection probably that is impossible to - to happen. I mean millions of bottles could not have all gone through SABS process.  So - so - but if once I give you that bottle and I say I intend manufacturing bottles exactly like this and when I sell them I want them to carry a SABS mark.  It seems to me from what you are telling me that certain things must be in place. Laboratory and you talk about academics and the industry blah, blah, blah.  You - you would then after testing provide the certification but the certification gives the manufacturer in this case of the bottle the right to put the SABS mark on all its bottles.  I assumethat are made like that one and then when - when they are sold they are sold with - with that mark. Now I am wondering whether if as the business person I am supposed to do that.  Obviously one should assume that I will have an interest to make sure that my business has a good name in the market.  That these bottles which carry the SABS mark are really of quality and - and I do not have a situation where maybe some are not really up to that standard - the SABS standard but I am wondering whether if I am established. Everybody knows that my bottles have got the SABS mark but I run out of ingredients that must be used in order to be - manufacture this bottle.  Instead of using five that are required.  I use three but I do not want to send out to the market bottles from my company that do not have the SABS mark because my company is known to only sell bottles with the SABS mark and then I - whether I - I can put the SABS mark. I can cheat in other words cheat the - the public.  Put the SAPS mark.  Even though this batch of bottles maybe do not actually meet that standard.  Whether the - the system allows that to happen or not.    Yes.    It would not be SABS role to from time to time during the term of licence that it has given to a manufacturer to use a SABS mark.  It would not be its role to from time to time pay surprise visits to the manufacturer’s laboratory for example.  Just take samples.  Check whether there is no cheating in the sense in which I have made to sayokay bottles are made in the same way that they are supposed to in terms of what was tested. So that that is the threat that a manufacturer has of being caught if he sends out bottles with a SABS mark which do not deserve to have a SABS mark.    That somebody else might be able to talk about?    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, okay.  No thank you.    Did you say page 13?    Okay.    It is the red numbers on the right hand corner …    Of the pages.    Yes.  After the yellow …    Divider.    Yes.    Do you want this to be admitted or not yet?    Hm.    The lever arch file containing or marked SABC Policy bundle will be marked EXHIBIT CC35.    Yes.    Hm.    Dr Mutuvhi?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No that - that is fine and to the extent that Ms Swanepoel …    May have to be called.    There might be no need to delay too long …    Calling her …    Because her evidence would cover a very narrow …    Issue.    So it may well be that within the next two weeks or so we might consider finding a space for her …    In the morning maybe from nine to 10.    So we will need to look at that.    Okay.  No that is fine.  We are therefore going to adjourn the proceedings for the day but we will continue on Monday.  I think at Monday it is - we have one or more witnesses - to two witnesses for Estina if I am not mistaken.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay, alright.  We will adjourn then and resume on Monday.    We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good morning Chair. Good morning Chair.    Thank you.    Chair I beg leave to hand up the properly paginated bundle for this morning.     Thank you Chair.  That will – may it be entered into the record as Exhibit CC36?    Thank you Chair.  Before we deal with the witness Chair just if I may just hand up a letter that has been received from the office of the State Attorney in relation to the witness Minister Ndlodlo that was going to come this morning.  Minister Ndlodlo is represented Chair.  I would like Ms Gcilishe to put herself on record.  Thank you.    Chair there was a point when the Minister was indisposed.    I think that – that period then we felt that we needed to give her enough time to recuperate.    After that yes.  And – but he – she has been very cooperative.    Yes thank you.  And we – in fact she has actually sent the commission her draft. Every time she worked on a draft she sent those to the commission.    She has yes, yes Chair.  We have those.    Yes. Unless she wants to extend her scope Chair and deal with other matters.  Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Chair the witness this morning is Mr Strachan the evidence of this witness…    Yes Chair.    No Chair no you may read it later Chair.    Yes thank you.      Thank you.  Chair this witness’ evidence is relevant in the sense that SABS Chair would recall has been mentioned as being one of the stakeholders by Mr Jansen Van Vuuren and also yesterday’s witness Mr Roy Kruger that SABS South African Bureau of Standards was – is part of the stakeholders that had to work on the set-top boxes.  His evidence also becomes relevant because the nextwitness that we are going to call when the Chair allocates us additional time Doctor Boloka actually deals with local content and those are matters that SABS deals with.  For that reason therefore Chair I would like you to receive his evidence before that of Doctor Boloka.    Thank you.  Oh sorry Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes may he be sworn in?  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr Strachan you have a document that is placed in a presentation file in front of you and it is marked Exhibit CC36, do you have that?    Yes if you page through there you will – on page 1 of that their names Garth Strachan is that your statement?    Oh sorry your microphone is off.  I beg your pardon.    No you answer to the Chairperson.    Yes.    Thank you.  And then if you could please turn to page 5 of that statement.  Is that your signature that appears on that page?    Yes.  Did you make this – are the contents of this statement first true and correct?    And you made this statement at the request of the investigators of the commission?    Yes thank you.  Could you just for the record place your qualifications please?    Yes.  If you could just try and speak up a little.  Yes.    Or maybe just – ja – that should workthank you.  You are currently occupying a position as acting Chief Executive Officer of the South African Bureau of Standards, is that correct?    And that is normally referred to as SABS?    Yes.  When were you appointed to this position?    Yes. 2018?    Yes.  Could you just tell the Chairperson what was SABS role – you do make that point in your statement that you are appointed after the active role of SABS had taken place.  So your evidence is based on the documentation and the evidence that you have received from those who are responsible for that role, is that correct?    Yes. Now could you just tell the Chairperson what is the role of SABS generally?  What does SABS do?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Just to remind you that you answer to the Chairperson.    Yes thank you.  Yes.  Could you just – let us just deal with the local content aspect?  So what is it that SABS usually looks for when it says that I am going to test for local content, what is it looking for?    Yes.    Thank you.  And insofar as the set-top boxes is it correct that even with those SABS was tasked with theresponsibility to certify those set-up boxes that are going to be supplied to the various households?    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  And I am aware of the fact that today you are not going to be talking to the specifics because a technocrat from your department will come and deal with matters that relate to which companies were tested for this and which companies were compliant and all of those.  That type of details is going to come later.  Am I right?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes thank you.  Then you deal with the monies and the setting up of the laboratory in paragraph 4 of you state – in paragraph 4 of your statement and you say you were allocated by the Department of Communications an amount of R26.3 million.    Yes.    Yes.  And just as a – just to clarity on what – if one says this – one sees a particular set-top box which is something that we are going to deal with later and that person sees it and that person wants to see whether that is SABS approved you – the team has just put up some pictures to show what your SANS approval would look like.  Could you just put up that demonstration please?  Thank you.  Is that – sorry Chair could you – that – is that a – sorry.   Just that one.  Would that be a SABS one?    Yes how it works.    Yes Chair.    Okay.    No.  Oh yes Chair but…    Yes it does.    Could you just have a look at the one that will have your mark please?    Chair it is going to be…    It is going to be…    It is going to take a second Chair.    Oh but if you do not need to see it then there is no need.    That is the point.  That is the point Chair.    Yes.  There is that – that is the point.    Yes thank you.    They were approved.    That is correct.    Yes.    Alright.  The second one?  Is it not coming through?      No Chair if it is a problem.    Well – we continue okay.    Thank you Chair.  Okay.  So then you – in paragraph 4 you also deal with the fact that the laboratory itself it is now losing staff and it is underutilised and could you just tell the Chairperson what could be the reasons for this lack of enthusiasm to actually utilise and use the laboratory and what would the result would be in terms of products maybe that do not go through the laboratory process.    Yes.  If a product carries the – made in South Africa stamp or manufactured in South Africa stamp is that an equivalent of what you would expect to be – to have at least gone through the SABS standards testing?    No.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  Just what I had said I – relating to the question that I – if that product has got Made In South Africa and you do not see it – or do you see a SABS mark there?    Yes thank you.  And then lastly could you just…    Yes.    Yes thank you.  And then in the next one we just showed that where it is – it has the SABS approval would it come up in that way?    Yes.    Yes. Thank you.   Thank you Chair.  Thank you and then in - as you have already testified to the obligations but maybe just to - to emphasise one obligation in terms of the MOU that you referred to at page 13 that deals with the obligations of SABS insofar as the set-top boxes are concerned.    Page 1-3 yes Chair.    1-3 - page 1-3 on the right hand corner.  Okay.  13, okay.  Are you there?   Yes.    Yes.    Thank you and then there is Clause 9    And you have attached that feasibility study as Annexure B.  It appears Chair at page - from pages 32    And then   Maybe …    “Audit reports and certificates which will be provided by SABS for applicable audits.” And then maybe those are the most relevant ones to the - to the discussion that you are having this morning.  Am I right?    Yes.  The witness before you yesterday Mr Roy Kruger linked the manufacturing or these set-top boxes within the country to job creation.  Now can I ask whether the fact that now the factory itself is becoming - where you have to test these products is becoming redundant and do you have any idea of how - where themanufacturing of the set-top boxes is happening but if you do not then you can just tell the Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    You have 1.6 at paragraph …    Paragraph 4.1.4.    Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  That - that is the evidence from this witness.  Thank you.    Chair I beg leave to hand up EXHIBIT CC35 which I meant to hand up.  It is - it is the SABC Policy bundle.  It deals with the DTT Policy, the changes to the policy - the various policies from 2008.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.  May it be admitted so that the next time when we come we know it is already part of the exhibits?   We - we have marked it policy bundle.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Mr Chairman that with your leave would then bring us to the end of today’s proceedings because we were thinking of having two witnesses which is the one witness that could not attend today and we will approach Chair for another allocation because Chair you would recall that on the very first day when we started we had placed various boxes of material before you. We have not dealt with that material.  For instance the evidence of Dr Boloka who is going to deal with specific contracts and point out the irregularities and unlawful awards of those tenders.  That evidence will have to come in the next session.  The evidence of Mr Zikode who is the Forensic Auditor for the SABC who has covered over a hundred investigations. We have - he has placed most of those before you.  those are the ones that were - were placed on - on the first day when we started but we are - now he is doing a second exercise of simply selecting the ones that are really crucial for placing before you.  Instead of dealing with the hundred and - over 160 investigations and then thirdly Chair you would recall that the evidence of Professor Mutuvhi who came before you last week …   Is supposed to come back and also …    Fhatuwani Mutuvhi.    Yes, yes.    She is supposed - he - I beg your pardon.  He is supposed to came back and deal with the actual Auditor-General’s findings in - relating to some of the tenders.    That evidence as well Chair we would request that it be allocated in the second session …    Of the proceedings.  Then we have other witnesses that are lined up but we will provide you with a memorandum latest by Monday …    Of who those witnesses are, what are they going to be talking about …    But of course there is just two witnesses that - who are going to come and - and discuss - who have not yet given us statements but have being promising to give statements …    But now have changed tact.  One of them now seeks legal representation.    Then we would just ask that Chair that those be directed to - to submit their statements by …    A certain date, yes.    Thank you.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Issue, yes.    Yes.    For her.    Yes Chair.  We will - we will do that.    Yes, thank you Chair.    Yes Chair but I think the evidence leader for Estina was here this morning.  I think there might be just some …    Some changes in that line up but I …    Yes, but I think …    She is going to come as soon as we adjourn.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:   Good morning Chair.    I am Advocate Unathi Gcilishe I appear with Advocate Terry Motau SC.  Advocate Motau is unfortunately not able to come this morning; he does send his apologies.    Chair we were brought on brief yesterday in this matter and we seek time to consult with our client for the purposes of assisting with the representations that will be made.      It has been agreed with the evidence leaders that we be granted a two week extension for the making of the necessary submissions.    Chair we have not yet consulted with the Minister that is being arranged for the upcoming week.    Therefore I cannot really state…    Ja.    No we – we … we think two weeks is reasonable in the circumstances Chair but I cannot say anything less than that would be sufficient.    That will be fine Chair.    Thank you.    That will be Friday the 20 t h.    Okay we will do so Chair.    Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your name and full names for the record?    Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give today will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please say, I truly affirm?    All rise 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Garth [indistinct] Strachan.    I truly affirm.    I do [indistinct].    Yes.   Yes Counsellor.    I beg your pardon.  Yes Chairperson.    It is Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    I hold a Master’s Degree in Science and Public Policy from London University.    Sure.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    In June 2018.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson.    Chairperson the South African Bureau of Standards is the only national standard body in South Africa mandated in terms of legislation the standards acts which are set out in my statement in order to undertake broadly speaking full functions.  That is the setting of South African National Standards which are eitherstandards which are home grown or which amended from the international standards organisation which we are a member of.  SABS also undertakes certification to a standard which is a process at the end of which any company which requires certification is issued with a certificate and then the company being in possession of a certificate is able to place what is called a SABS mark on its product which ensures that that company – that product purchased by any member of public has been certified to a national standard which can be a product or a systems certification.    And then SABS operates testing laboratories which test in a variety of ways but in this context they test to a certification.  So if a product requires testing for any characteristic then that product is tested by our laboratories.  And the fourth element of the SABS legislative mandate is to undertake local content verification on behalf of the government of South Africa for which SABS has established the requisite capacity and accreditation to undertake local content verification to a standard.  In this case the standard is SANS, SANS 1286.    Ma’am that would be a summary of the legislative mandate.    I beg your pardon.   So if I may Chairperson go back slightly.  The Department of Trade and Industry under the Preferential Public Procurement Finance Act and its regulations designates products for local content to a threshold depending upon the capabilities of South African industry to produce any product.  In some cases it might be 100 in other cases it might be 30%.  And the National Treasury issues an instruction note to all South African entities when they are undertaking tender and procurement processes to ensure that those designated products are procured in keeping with the National Treasury Instruction Note, the DTI designation and the SANS 1286.  SABS is then requested to undertake local content verification of the companies which would be providing goods to the state and that local content verification is undertaken to SANS 1286.    In some instances a standard can be referenced in a piece of regulation and in that case the state is – must ensure that where a standard is referenced in the regulation any product provided to the state has – carries a SABS mark.  In other words it has been audited and certified to a local content threshold.    Ma’am if I may SABS in an MOU with the Department of Communications and the Department of Trade and Industry was mandated as I set out in my statement to undertake amongst others to undertake conformity assessment of set-top boxes.  And it established a laboratory and the capabilities to do that.  We do not as a 3B Public entity carry a compliance mandate.  In other words we cannot say to Department X you have to come and test or the companies that are supplying you have to come and test.  We carry out the mandate of conformity assessment.    And my understanding is that the policy as originally conceived referenced the SANS 862.    Ye Ma’am I can speak to some of it.    But a detailed technical evidence would need to be advanced by an expert in the field.    Which might be an auditor for certification or a laboratory engineer Chairperson.    Chairperson the original memorandum of understanding between the Department of Trade and Industry which is the SABS shareholder, the Department of Communications and the SABS agreed upon a sum of R30 million to be transferred to the SABS by the Department of Communication.  In order to establish the capacity in other words the equipment and the capability in other words the requisite technical staff to be able to test to the requirements of the SANS 862 and SABS did that.  SABS never spent – never received R30 million it received R26 million.  Nevertheless the requisite capacity and capability was establish in order to test set-top boxes.    To the SANS 862.    Ma’am – Chairperson that is not a SABS mark.    That is unequivocally not a SABS mark, a SABS.    Ja.    Chairperson a laboratory housed at the SABS tests to certification in other words if it is – if there is a product which is being certified in an audit process that certification can include testing.    Not in every instance but certainly in many products.    If I may give an example Chairperson.    A bottle of water – the company would seek a certification for the bottle of water and the durability of the glass or the characteristics of the bottle or the chemical composition of the water could be tested to the certificate.    But there is another form of testing which is customer specific requirement testing Chairperson where a customermay bring testing – bring a product for testing including for example to be able to meet the conformity requirements for the exporting of a product into another jurisdiction.  So the laboratories do not only test to certification they would test for other reasons.  But to specifically answer the question a laboratory which in this case costs R26 million to set up and which incurs recurring operational costs in the form of maintenance the payment of the staff and so on and so forth depends upon the volume of testing which passes through and I can say that there has been a very low volume of testing in the laboratory specifically set up for set-top boxes and in fact we have incurred significant losses which we estimate in the time available to be R1.8 million and the viability of the laboratory is in serious question and the administrators are contemplating closing the laboratory since it is not viable and in the total revenue of the institution only a small fraction is from the public fiscus the bulk of the revenue arises from a commercial payments for standards certification, laboratory services and local content verification and consignment inspection.    Oh no Chair.    Made in South Africa is unequivocally not a SABS mark.  Remember that a SABS mark is a certification to aparticular standard whether it is a standard in this case 862.    Or a local content standard which is 1286.    Chairperson there is definitely no SABS mark on that display.    Yes Chairperson.    Chairperson the middle stamp is the SABS mark and it is the customer view on whether or not that product has been certified by SABS.  The manufacturer is in possession of the certificate which enables the manufacturer to stamp the mark on the product for sale.    Or distribution.    Yes Chairperson.    Chairperson that is absolutely correct.    Please bear in mind that certification or certificates expire.    After three years.    And therefore companies are required to renew.    The permit.    The certification.    And then auditors or re-audit the company.    Where there is testing required there might be testing.    And they are re-issued a permit.    Which allows that company to stamp the product with the SABS mark which is a mark obviously of high quality to the requisite standard.    A standard would differ in by product and sector of the economy.    Ja.    Chair if I failed to communicate that adequately I apologise.      No company can voluntarily use a SABS mark unless they have been through a certification process and being issued with a certification which allows them to use the SABS mark.  We must of course be mindful that there might be certain you know cases where companies may use the SABS mark illegally because they have not renewed the permit in which case SABS conducts market surveillance and if there is a company that is using the SABS mark illegally we would approach the company and the courts to ensure that the illegal use of a SABS mark is - is stopped immediately.    Chairperson broadly speaking correctly but if I may add in order to secure certification of the bottle in our example you would have to purchase the required standard.  In other words and developed in a process involving industry, industry experts, academic, scientists in what is called technical committees which either develop according to South African conditions a home grown standard or they adapt an international standard belonging to the International Standards Organisation but a manufacturing company would purchase a standard. The test - the certification process is carried out by SABS which is suitably qualified and accredited auditors going to the plant or factory which produces the bottle of water to ensure that the production accords with the requirements set out in the standard.  If the product in this case the bottle of water in the standard also has to have certain of its characteristics tested then the SABS laboratories would test to the requirements of the certification. At the end of the auditing process the compliance report would go to an authority within the SABS which ensures that due and process has been followed and the company is issued with a certificate which enables it to stamp its products for the duration of that permit that certificate which is three years with a SABS mark. At the end of the three years in order to ensure that there is conformity assessment is robust that the company in this case wouldnot have to repurchase the standard but they have to renew the permit and undertake for the next phase of the ownership of the SABS mark another certification which may involve auditing and testifying. So this is not a situation where you get a certificate and for the rest of time you can use the SABS mark.  It is a very specific set down internationally process that you have to follow.  SABS is then accredited by the South African National Accreditation System an agency of Government and in many cases international accreditation authorities that come to SABS and check that our systems our auditing our testing and the enter process meets rigorous requirements of the certification process.  I hope Chairperson that answers the question.    Chairperson if I may answer in this particular manner.  Remember that a SABS mark is a voluntary process.  It is a mark of conformances to a particular standard.    If a standard is referenced in a piece of legislation because there are health safety and other concerns thenanother institution of the state the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications comes into play.  They may use the testing capabilities at SABS or other test houses to ensure that that company and agricultural - agroprocessing products can apply or health and safety products of one kind and another and NICS is not the only regulator. Remember there are many other regulators.  If a standard is referenced in a regulation then it is absolutely critical that the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications comes in - into paly and they have the responsibility to ensure that it is not just a question of a - a golden sample but that there are regular checks on the conformity of that compulsory specification. If I may give you an example.  The Department of Health and the National Treasury purchase condoms.  The legislation and the tender documentation references the standard in the - in - in law and therefore in those instances the - the SABS mark is a mark also of quality which can be tested against from time to time and is tested from time to time but the SABS mark in itself is a - is a voluntary mark. Unless a procuring department or a regulatory authority says we are procuring from the private sector and the condition of that procurement is that the product must carry a SABS mark.    To the best of my knowledge Chairperson no but it is an area where …    We - we could provide further technical …    Clarity to that …    But to the best of my knowledge no.    I beg your pardon.  Which page?    I am not.  Sorry.    Oh, oh okay.  I beg your pardon.    I beg your pardon.    I beg your pardon.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes Chair …    Yes Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson to the very best of my knowledge SABS has honoured all the obligations to the MOU signed between the Department of Communication, the DTI and the SABS.    We do not because it is not our mandate.    It is a Department of Trade and Industry mandate.  I can say without fear of contradiction that local manufacturing is as set out in numerous Government documents unequivocally a generator of not only employment but it has multiple other economic spill overs, skills creation, supply development and so on and so forth. Please bear in mind of course that a SABS mandate is to certify and test to a standard and we are not in a position to force a Government department to insist that public sector procurement is conformed to the standard.  That is a policy matter of Government.  We provide the certification and the laboratory testing capabilities which we did to the terms and conditions of the MOI.    The fact that there has been so little certification and testing to the capacity that we established is beyond our remit.  I can say that three companies went for local content verification.  Remember there is a separate standard and both - all three of the certificates have expired and since 2015 11 companies have had tests undertaken on their equipment but that is not the certification. They can come for other forms of testing.  We can provideyou with detail of what they came to test for.  It maybe for example that they were testing for an export destination to a different standard but in the time available we do not have that information other than 11 companies came and in four years that is simply not capable or that kind of revenue and passing through the laboratories is completely unsustainable for the existence of a testing facility and as I said we have incurred costs of 1.8 million.    1.6 I beg your pardon.    Ja.
