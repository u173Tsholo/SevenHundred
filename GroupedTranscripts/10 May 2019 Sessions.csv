CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Good morning.  Are you ready?     Okay you may proceed.    48?    Thank you.  Yes.    I am sorry extended on varia tions means what?  Extended on variations, what does that mean?     Hm.    Oh that it was extended.    Oh yes. Okay.    But basically you mean it was extended?     Ja okay alright.    Is the reference to third file reference to Exhibit BB2.1.C?    Okay.    Okay.    And what is the page?      1086?    Thank you.      Let me just take you back to this issue of variation and extension.  Technically variation might be correct when you mean extending but normally or rather I associate variation with an amendment of     The contents of the agreement.  Okay.  So I just want to confirm that wherever in this document there is a reference to variation should I read it as extension or sometimes variation is used to mean something other than extension?    Yes.    Yes.    An extension.    Oh oh     Oh oh okay so…     Oh so so variation might be more accurate in that context.  That is not just an extension of time?     It is also a variation of the price?     Effectively an amendment of the price that must of necessity come with the extension of time?     Yes.  Okay. Alright.    Yes.    That is R3.8 billion hey?     Thank you.    So this contract started in 2010?     And it is still ongoing or has just ended?     YEs.    This year?    So it – it went on for ultimately about what nine years?    Ja.  Originally it was meant to be five years.     But there was a provision for a possible extension?      Ja okay.    So this is one of those contracts which were dealt with during the period when the board was getting involved in the award of certain tenders?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.      Well let us talk about that a little bit before you.     Move on and – and it takes us to something that we discussed a little bit yesterday namely that if management has a right to take a view on a tender on various factors and – but their role is to make a recommendation and the body that makes the final decision is higher up generally speaking the higher body would be entitled to take a view different to that of management on any of the factors, is it not?  Generally speaking.   Yes, yes.  Therefore when a higher body takes a view different to that of management on any particular issue or factor that on its own ought not to raise eyebrows but it just depends on everything else.    On all the circumstances of that particular tender whether it should raise eyebrows.  But one of the factors that may legitimately be taken into account in saying should this raise eyebrows or not is the expertise that management may have on a par ticular issue knowledge expertise and experience vie a vie knowledge expertise and experience maybe of the body that decides.  If it is a – if the subject is about some scientific technical thing and management consists of a committee of scientists and I a m sitting on a higher body and I am a lawyer I am going to be very careful to go against the view of scientists  in a field where they are the experts.     But it does not necessarily mean that I am going to rubber stamp their view.    I may still question and sometimes I might show them that maybe they did not attach proper weight to a particular factor or they might even change their view but what I should not do is basica lly disregard what they are – the view they have expressed.    So I am just going back to it – to this point which we discuss yesterday simply because you – you just mentioned that you had a certain difficulty with the fact that the board looked at an issue that you had looked at as management.  And my question goes back is.     Of course they are entitled to look at…     The same issue that you have looked at and they are entitled to take a different view. The question is whether their view weighed against your view is such that it should point to something.     You would go along with that?    Yes.     Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, okay.    Yes, yes.    Hm    Ja which dealt with these issues.     Yes.    Response    No I…    No I think that last part which you say is an important factor because if the one view is fully m otivated and the opposing view is not motived at all or very – or motivated very insignificantly you know it is something to look at.  Yes but I think I understand your position.  You say it is not the principle.     That you have a problem with it is the facts of the case.    And the fact that at Transnet there was as I understand you a rule or policy against what you double dipping.  Okay thank you.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm, hm.     Hm. MR PETER STEPHEN    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay just to complete.  Management recommended that Gijima be awarded the contract after the consents or reservations that management had had – had been mitigated through engagement with Gijima.   But the board did not go along with the recommendation of management and decided that the contract should be awarded to T-Systems and largely and if not exclusively their reasons were based on certain risks that they articulated, is that rig ht?    And then Gijima lodged a complaint?     Okay, alright thank you.    In the meantime I can ask whether the – this second submission for confinement meant that there were going to be two submissions before the BADC for confinement – one to Mitsui and the  other one to China Rail or whether the first one was effectively withdraw?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    A dilution of …    The praises that had been heaped on Mitsui.     Ja, okay.    I am sorry.  I thought that was D.     D for Doris.    Ja, okay.  D for David.  D for Doris, okay.     Okay.  So that is 11 …?    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja, you may do – do that.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Well I am just still thinking about this point about poor planning and urgency.  You know – for what it is worth.  I think you – you understood the point…    When we had the discussion yesterday.  I mean if – if the Commission’s administrative wing was supposed to bring something to my attention to say I must please convene a certain urgent meetin g to deal with a certain situation because if I do no convene that meeting and a certain decision is made we are going to – we will not be able to sit in this venue from next week and the commission will have nowhere to sit and I think that the administrative wing should have told me a  month ago.  I cannot say I am not going to convene a meeting because you people had poor planning.  You should have told me last month.     I am going to say you should have told me la st month but now that this has happened I must convene the meeting …     Because we cannot afford not to sit next month - next week because we will not have …     We will have no venue.    So I deal with the poor planning but I recognise that there is urgency because - for example – the lease is expiring over the weekend.    So the meetings that are set – the hearings that are set down for next week and the other week will not take place if I do not meet with the landlord and say the administration has really been poor in planning.  They should have brought this to my atte ntion but now they have brought – they should have brought it to my attention much earlier but they have now brought it.  Can we do something?  I cannot say I am not going to meet with the landlord because they should have told me last month.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is right, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Because of that ja.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.  Okay, no that is fine.    I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Volmink.    When the BADC – that Board Committee – dealt with matters such as this – you know – this request for confinement would they have the benefit of somebody at that stage - I know the recommendation that you expressed going forward.  Would they call for somebody with some more knowledge of procurement from within  Transnet and say you know there is this request give us some advice.  What is your view?  You know - is this in compliance is this not in compliance with the prescripts and policies or would they rely on  the relevant Executive members of management or CEO and so on?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  So - so they would have at the meeting available to them such a person?    Yes.    You do not know?     Yes.    Yes.    Would attend, yes.      Would attend, okay thank you.     I guess that since we’re looking – we’re talking about quite a high number of contracts that were awarded to McKinsey, I think your statement says about eight.    I guess that you might not have just paid, you k now, the school fees, you must have taken them to university as well so it had to take long.        Okay we’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at half past eleven, we’re adjourned.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us proceed.    Thank you.    Did you – did you say from Gijima?    We long past Gijima?     We long past Gijima.    China South and Mutsui, Mutsui.     That is where we are.    Oh we are past that as well.    Oh ja.   Oh we are at McKinsey ja.  Okay.     Hm.    I am sorry.  I am on BB2.1D, is that the wrong lever  arch file?    That is the right one?     Page 1    Oh.    I think I was on 1242.  Yes.    Yes.    The one at the bottom?     Ja.    It does not create a contract?     And everybody should know that.     Hm.    For open tenders.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes but confined to those      Hm.    Hm.    Evaluate.    The supplier later.    I mean what – what point would – would it serve to evaluate whether the supplier is the right kind of supplier if you have already concluded a contract?     Hm.    Hm.    Ja they had made their points and.     And – hm.    That is back to the statement?     Yes.    Was that directive prompted by knowledge of the response to Ms Cindy Felix.    What was her surname?     Felix, Felix.    To Ms Felix email.    It was prompted by that?     And do you know whether Mr Anoj Singh would have seen the directive quite soon after it was circulated or issued or is that something you do not know?     Was a member.  Yes so…    Yes so – so he – it was to be expected that he would see it?    Ja.  Okay.  But after there was no change of attitude in the – on his part after the issuing of this directive in relation to payments to this entity?     You are not aware.    Okay, okay.  Alright.    Was it the same transaction?     Was it the same transaction these four confinements?  Did they relate to the same job?     Okay.    And they were given over     A few days.    A four day period.    So it is over a very short period and relates to effectively the same project?     Same project.    And to the same entity.    Well we will see in the end whether the finding will be that that is what happened but on the face of it it does seem that these factors that you have mentioned could support what you are saying.  I mean the manganese one and the NMPP one were done on the same day.    Is that right?    3 April 2014 why were they done separately?     And then the iron ore one had been done two days earlier.    And the coal one had been done one day earlier than the iron ore one.    So those factors may well support what your proposition may be.    Were all confidential confinements dealt with by one functionary say the GCEO or the BADC or were they dealt with by different bodies?    Oh okay.    So that principle still applied?     Okay.    Ja.    Yes.  A confidential confinement in effect meant that only one functionary person or body would decide it and there would be no multiple stages of involvement by different peopl e?    Yes.    Yes.    Authority.    Yes.    Ja, okay.    The – you told me yesterday that the original source of this concept of confidential confinement came from delegated authority from the Board.    Yes.  That is where came …    It came from originally and – you know – you had to put into a policy …      And so on.  I do not remember whether I asked this question yesterday but was it provided in that original delegated authority or was it – was there a provision that said under what circumstances a contract or job could be classified or could q ualify as confidential – confinement could be regarded as confidential?  You told us yesterday and today the grounds in terms of policy - the grounds for confinement.  You may confine a tender if one of the following grounds exists.    Whether – was there a similar thing that was put up by the Board when they came up for the first time with this concept of confine – confidential confinement?     Yes.    No guidelines or grounds that were given.     And who was given the authority to declare or decide that a particular confinement would be a confidential one?      Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    It is quite clear from what you – you explain that it meant it was not to be dealt with by different bodies and Committees and functionaries who otherwise would deal with it if it was not a – a confidential confinement.  So – so in effect would it be correct that it was therefore to be taken as confidential between the originator – the author – and then the …     Approving body?    It is – it is quite a strange thing in a – in a State Owned Entity.  Somebody says there are certain contracts which will be regarded as confidential but we are not saying which ones – you know  – what are the …    Criteria for confidentiality and if so and so classifies it as confidential it can come to us and then it does not have to go through other people and we will – we will then decide if we approve or not …    And then – and that could entail a lot of taxpayers money.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.     Did you ever get to know who exactly came up with this concept or is there something that you really do not know apart from that it came from the Board?     Ja, okay but it came from the Board, ja.    Originated from the Board, ja but other than - the confinement is what was considered to be confidential but once the tender had been awarded the tender itself was not confidential.  Is that right?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And at that stage it is not – it is not confidential.    It is very strange.    So it – I wonder whether it was designed to avoid a situation where lower management and other bodies would say no this is not confidential and it would be difficult for the approving authority to keep on overruling them because they may have wanted to – to treat those as confidential but management saw nothing suggesting …     Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.     Hm.    Motivation.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, body.    Ja.    Poorly motivated …      Yes.    Hm.    So – so it was a way of ensuring that cer tain confinement requests were no subjected to the normal scrutiny that the policies and procedures of the company required requests for confinements to be subjected to?     That is what it was about?     And it was not about keeping secret the amounts relating to the tender because once the confinement had been approved there was nothing secret about the ten der.  The tender would be dealt with as a confined tender but nothing confidential at that stage.     Normal procedures?    So – so it seems that the idea was to ensure that such requests for – certain requests for confinement of certain tenders were taken out the normal scrutiny of mechanisms and bodies within  the company?    Okay.    Thank you.    Mr – Mr Mokoena.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja, confidential.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    They could have simply said certain contracts – certain tenders that require confinement will not go through the normal route before reaching the approving authority.  They will go from the originator straight to th e – to the approving authority.  In effect they could have said that.  Is it not because there was nothing – if there was nothing confidential about these things then all – all they wanted to achieve is simply that from the originator it should come straig ht to the approving authority.  It should not be subjected to …     Scrutiny by other people.    No, no, I accept that.  We are on the same page.  I am simply saying if one accepts that there  was – there was no basis for classifying them as confidential …     And that the whole point was that these – these requests for confinement should not be subjected to normal scrutiny by various bodies because they  wanted to only certain people or certain bodies to approve them.  Then all they needed to do is to say certain requests for confinement will come straight to us or to the GCEO or to the B …    BADC.    BADC.  Then we would have had the same thing.     Namely there is no scrutiny …     And they decide themselves.    Ja.    I am sorry.  You said that you had to incorporate his new procedure or requirement of confidentiality into the policy?     After the Board had put it into a delegated – delegation.  When you put it into your policy documents what did you put as the grounds on which it could be initiated.  In other words what did – what do you do?  Did you put in some grounds or  did you just do what the Board had done.    But you said in the delegated authority there were no  grounds.    Hm.    Ja.  No there cannot be a ground.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.  So you just took what was (intervenes) authority?     Ja.    Okay.    So it was like a performance bonus?  If they – if they had done such a good job that there was an increase in revenue then they would get extra …     Extra payment?    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.     No, thank you.  Thank you very m uch Mr Volmink for coming forward to clarify the experiences that you found at Transnet with regard to these particular transactions and your understanding of the procurement prescripts applicable to Transnet during the times of these transactions and if a  need arises you will be asked to come back, thank you very much you are release.       Thank you.      Ja.      Yes we will not sit on Monday and Tuesday we will resume on Wednesday.  I was thinking that we should try, next week to start earlier than normal to try and – if we can recoup some of the time that we will have lost.  We might not be able to recoup all of it, do you – are you able to indicate whether there will be any difficulties from the legal team if we start early on Wednesday?      Yes.      Do we have an idea how long the next witness is likely to be on next week?      In two days, okay maybe let’s start at 10 o’clock on Wednesday if we need to change we’ll announce.  So on Wednesday we’ll start at 10.      Yes, we’ll then adjourn for today, we adjourn. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair.    We are ready.    Mr Volmink yesterday when we parted ways we were just about to deal with the T-Systems with particular reference to page 48 paragraph 105 of your witness statement.     Could you please proceed dealing with those issues there?    It is page 48 Chair.    48.    And how many variations are you talking – are you referring to?    And those were between 2010 and 2019?     And for that period no services went out on tender?    During that period no services went out on tender.  It was all extended on variations?     Yes.    Yes.  Then may I refer you then to…     Mr Volmink may I then refer you to Exhibit BB2.1C.  Chair that should be the third file with particular reference to page 1086.    1C yes.    So that at least it becomes easier.     Chair to locate it.    The page number it is page 1086.    Yes Chair.    Mr Volmink are you there?     Yes could you please identify that document for us?    Yes.    And can you then take us please through those several variations and extensions that you alluded to?     That was the initial amount?    And subsequently?  You can take us through the variations then?     Would that also include the variation of the scope of what was inten ded to be performed?    Yes.      And the second extension?     And the initial amount value which was R1.9 billion it now became R3.8 billion, am I correct?     And the third?    Yes.     Page 1088 Chair.    And the fourth one?  Page 1089 that is where you find the fourth one.    On page 1090.    And the entire amount pursuant to those extensions or variations was an amount of R4.9 billion.     That is the point Chair.  May I then refer you back to your witness statement paragraph 106 on page 48 and we can continue with the evidence from there having now painted the context to the Chair.    Yes.  You may then proceed to deal with the events relevant to Gijima.    And would this be an instance whereby the risk factors are only raised at a later stage when they were in fact dealt with by the management adequately but they are raised in order to not grant the award to the [indistinct] bidder?     Following from the Chair questions of  clarification.  You are also giving this evidence against the background of a number of transactions that suffered the same fate premised on this risk factors whereby a preferred bidder who was being thoroughly  assessed just simply being ignored and another entity being awarded the tender, am I correct?     And that is why – that is why you are raising these issues specifically?     Let us proceed to deal with specific facts in order to at least you know place them in it proper context.  You may then proceed to tell us what happened?     And did Governance also agree with  what National Treasury was saying?     But what was then the advice or the recommendation of Governance?     And what ultimately happened to that tender?    So it was only after all those interventions that the Board then d ecided to do the correct thing?     Yes.  Now from page - 113 paragraph  113 page 50 you are now dealing with the acquisition of the 100 locomotives?    Can you please take us through it?     Yes and then what transpired when you have – after having reviewed and assessed you know the two confinements?    Yes.    And that was the justification why not –  Transnet was not supposed to go out of – out to tender on a – on an open fair competitive bidding system?     Yes.  However three months down the line there was …    Yes.    Yes.  If I may refer you to EXHIBIT BB 2.1D.  You can now ignore C.  We are now going to D.     If you go to page 1196.    1197.  This will be …     D for …    For Doris.     On page 1197 Chair.    97.    Could you identify that document for us Mr Volmink?    And he is the one who was motivating the award in favour of Mitsui?     Yes.  Now if you – while you are still opening that memorandum may I also refer you to page 1223 and could you please identify that document for us?     But this one a different entity was – was motivated for?    Now did you have an opportunity of reading both these memora ndums?  Are they different in any manner?     May I now refer you back to your statement – EXHIBIT BB 2.1A …     And page 51 and take us through paragraph 116 and onwards?     On page 52 Chair.    You may proceed from paragraph 116.4.     But let us – let us deal with the effects of these numerous confinements.  What they meant was that a party that was never subjected to any tender process a name will be mentioned and an award will be given to that entity?     Yes.    Exactly.    In this regard there were only two memos.  The first one motivated Mitsui?     And the next one motivated only …     Yes.  That is the point that – yes.    You may proceed then.     Yes.  Just clearing those bases, fine.  Then we can proceed Mr  Volmink to deal with the McKinsey confinements.    Chair they are from page 54 paragraph 118.     Yes take us through the grounds of confinement as you discuss in paragraph 1.5.     Mr Volmink just before the tea adjournment you were still taking the Chair in relation to paragraph 131 of your statement please continue and summarise what you are saying there?    An email that you want us to – that you want to complete with?    Yes back to the statement Mr Chair.     Yes.  And yesterday you did educate us about what you termed the confidential confinements and you had an exchange with the Chair whether – does that conform with the principles of the [indistinct] Section 217 of the Constitution and whether can one justify that within the principles of open competitive transparent tender system?     On page 65.    Yes.    It is a strange concept Chair very complicated and complex.    Firstly a confinement in its own means that it is not open …     It is not an open competitive tender.  Secondly it is confidential.    You conclude Mr Volmink on this concern that you are raising how McKinsey was treated throughout.  You do so in paragraphs 151 and 152.    And paragraph 152?    (Intervenes).     You are dealing with a further concern which is the gap analysis.  Can you explain it to the Chair and take us through what you sought to convey in relation to that concern?     Yes and you conclude your statement with the last concern that is the remuneration model.     And they were paid those con tingency fees?    It is page 1398 Chair.  Would that b e the one Mr Volmink?    Page 1398?    Yes.  Now finally Mr  Volmink you have dealt with a number of transactions.  The Neotel Network Services, confinement of the CCTV, the award of the IT Data Service Contract to T-Systems, the 100 locomotives transaction to China South Rail and the McKinsey consulting the confinement that you have taken us so eloquently through.  What do you make about these contracts?  What do you make about the conduct giving rise to the issues that you have raised to – before the Chairperson?  Could you ascribe this as sheer incompetence or lack of understanding of the applicable prescripts?     Chair that is – that concludes the questions for Mr Volmink.      Thank you Chair, Mr Pretorius will address you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Good morning.    No it is um – I use the term somewhat interchangeably.    Chair this document is a document which was initially prepared by our Group strategic sourcing function one of the units within the procurement department.  It was a report which was delivered to SCOPA the initial intended date of the presentation was for December 2017.  That engagement finally happened in January of 2018 and the document has just been updated to reflect events that have occurred     The contract.    Is on page 1088.    Correct Chair.  The fourth one the motivation that is stated in the document is that Transnet had requested this extension for the commencement of what I refer to as disengagement processes from T-Systems.  It is not the kind of contract where – when the contract ends the service provider moves off and the new service provider comes in immediately.  There is a process of disengagement.  In fact if recollection – if my recollection is correct the  contract made provision for a six month process of transition and disengagement and treasury only approved a three month extension which was then the fourth variation.  And then the fifth variation …     From 106 the point we simply make is that Governance was involved in the reviewing certain of these addenda and was also then quite involved in advising the board to reverse its decision to award to T-Systems and to award to Gijima.    That is correct Chair.  They had delegation of authority.    Because if management and I am not saying management is always right I mean.     Put forward    That is correct Chair.  This is hardly an isolated    We have seen other cases in the past where    Risks are invoked at the eleventh hour    As a reason to overlook bidder A in order to go to bidder B.    The – the PPM does say that risk can be taken into consideration.    In order to    And to award to what appears to be the deferred bidder.    Yes thank you Chair. So what they happened is that Gijima lodged a complaint to the Transnet Procurement …     The complaint was then received by the Procurement Officer of the Procurement Ombudsman it is one of the functions which I have to oversee within the organisation.  But because it implicated the accounting authority there is a national treasury prescription that when a complaint implicates the account ing authority it must not be investigated by the organ of state itself it must be referred to National Treasury.  And that process was followed.  National Treasury considered the complaint and ultimately came to the conclusion that the proposed award to – or the award in fact that had been made to T-Systems was invalid and that Gijima should be awarded the tender.    Governance agreed with the conclusion that the tender was invalid  – um sorry that the tender award to T-Systems was invalid and that the tender had to be awarded to Gijima.  So we shared that conclusion.  We held slightly different views on how risks ought to be eval – technical dif – differences that we had which perhaps we do not really need to delve into.     Well when Governance considered the matter produced quite a comprehensive memorandum on the matter as well spelling out the various risks and how it had been mitigated and we then made the following recommendations which are contained in paragraph 110 …  ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA    And we recommended that Transnet abide – the first recommendation is Transnet must abide by the ruling taken by National Treasury.  Secondly that T-Systems should be invited to make representations on how – on Transnet’s proposed decision to abide the – the ruling of National Treasury.  We felt it would be important to invite – represent - T-Systems had now already been awarded the tender and our proposal was well let us withdraw it and we thought that a procedurally fair process would be to at least invite representations.  The third aspect of our recommendation was that  Transnet who should proceed to make the award then to Gijima following a judicial process to set aside the award to T-Systems.  We were conscious of the rule against self-help and so and we thought it would be better to follow a judicial process rather than simply withdrawing from one and awarding to another.     Chair I should perhaps just say that he views that we had expressed were also confirmed by senior counsel.  We had sought the opinions of Advocate  Sibeko and Advocate Ford and they were in large measure in agreement with the views that were – were expressed.  Chair ultimately what then happened is after much deliberation the Board then took a resolution to set aside its earlier award to T-Systems and Transnet then approached the High Court for an order declaring its earlier award to T-Systems to be invalid a nd a direction that it be allowed to award to Gijima.  The matter was initially strongly opposed by T-Systems but after some preliminary skirmishes they withdrew their opposition and the matter was then set down for hearing in the Johannesburg High Court o n 12 December 2018 and the court essentially granted the order as prayed for by – by Transnet and I have attached a copy of the judgment in the papers (intervenes).     Correct Chair.    Correct.    Chair I – I was asked by the investigators to look at this confinement of the – of - for the acquisition of 100 locomotives that was initially confined to a company called Mitsui Africa Rail Solutions or MARS for – for short - and a second confinement where the initial proposed award to MARS was now completely ignored and a second confinement was then motivated for the award of the very same tender to China South Rail or CSR and I was asked to reflect on – just on the rational as contained in the confinement documents itself.    Yes.  So Chair in essence I say in paragraph 113 and following that the initial motivation was made in October 2013.  I said in my initial statement that it was submitted by Mr Brian Molefe but upon further consideration of the documents I see he did not sign that confinement.  Hence in my amended statement I simply make the point that a submission was made rather than but apart from that minor change the point that I make is that this confinement described in glowing terms the virtues of Mitsui – MARS.  Why we should award to Mitsui Africa Rail Solutions and for example  Chair I point that in paragraph 114 there are a number of sub paragraphs.  It says there that these MARS locomotives they were I think for the Class 19E - it is a particular class of l ocomotives.  These MARS locomotives are known they meet requirements and the prototyping is not required.  They have done this before.  It goes on to say that the confinement to MARS was required for purposes of standardisation because MARS had done a numb er of these tenders and a number of the locomotives before.  That there were MARS facilities that were readily available for immediate production.  Lead times would be kept to a minimum and also there would be significant savings.  Across the page on page 51 the virtues of MARS are further extolled by the individuals who submitted the memo and it says there that the Mitsui models were operating optimally and in fact exceeded their design parameters that we do not need to train new – to train our drivers on any new model because they have been trained on the Mitsui model.  So they also speak about extensive socio economic benefits that would be as a result of the award to Mitsui including job retention at Transnet Engineering and job creation and ultimately t hey said it was not in the interest of Transnet to follow – to award to anyone else.  So in essence what we see …     Is a motivation to – to confine to MARS based on what were depicted as outstanding qu alities that – that MARS had.    That – that was the basis for – for the confinement.  That is correct.     But then correct …   Correct Chair. This MARS confinement served at – at a Board – at a meeting of the BADC which is a Sub Committee of the Board which is entrusted specifically with procurement matters and I was not at that meeting.  I have no personal knowledge as to what transpired who said what at that  meeting.  All we know from the record is that three months after this initial MARS confinement had been made there was now a second confinement.  This time to award the tender to China South Rail and no longer to – to Mitsui and I have also attached a copy of that confinement to the papers.    D, sorry.  Let me just put C away.  Yes.    I think it is the later Chair.  I think the first one was effectively withdrawn because if one looks at the contents of the China South Rail confinement the – there it is said that Mitsui’s quality and all the various aspects that were firstly p raised in the first …    Confinement.    They say no Mitsui is …     Not up to scratch.    Yes.    That is correct.    1196 or 1197?    Chair this is a submission made by Mr Brian Molefe the then Group Chief Executive of Transnet to the Transnet Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee – the BADC –    That – that is correct Chair.    This is a – a submission from Mr Brian Molefe to the Transnet Board of Directors dated  21 January 2014 which has the same heading as the earlier – earlier    Correct.  This is now the CSR.    Chair the documents – the two memoranda are essentially - the substance of it is almost identical.  Where it differs is where the virtues of CSR are now extolled in the second memorandum whereas the qualities of MARS …     Are highlighted in the first …     The first document.    Yes.    Chair in paragraph 116 and following  I simply highlight my – how I deal with my observations of these confinements as I was requested to do by the - by the Commission – the Commission’s investigators and what I say in paragraph 116.1 is that the confinement to China South Rail firstly invokes urgency as a ground for confinement and as we disc ussed yesterday urgency is something that has to be dealt with immediately because of a potential crisis that is looming and I make the point that three months had already elapsed since this earlier confinement to Mitsui which was also based on urgency – by the way – and no steps had been taken to procure any locomotives during that time and I question whether this matter could genuinely be urgent if no action had been taken but I think more significantly the second point that I make is that this memorandum it misquotes the PPM and perhaps Chair if you would allow me.  It is a very short clause from the PPM that I just want to read into the record.    In paragraph 116.2 I say that the    There is still an urgency …     To be dealt with …     And it can be relied upon …     As a confinement …     Bu you must deal with the individual …    Who has created the crisis …     But when this was tak en to the Board at the time they felt strongly that bad planning could never be an excuse for confinement and they deleted the reference that has been  underlined here.    So I think the point is that …     The rule which they had now relied upon …    Is not the – it is a non-existent rule.    I think furthermore Chair …     I make the point in paragraph 116.4 …    Yes.    Ja.    We have to deal with it.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  I am very fully appreciative of what you are saying Chair.     That also motivated …     The – the inclusion …     Of that clause the sentence …     That was underlined.    Management felt that if you are dealing with a genuine emergency …     Then we cannot close our eyes to the fact that     There could be an operational …     Implosion …    As a result of not …     Obtaining a particular.    Let us deal with that perhaps on a confinement basis.     Sometimes with a heavy heart one has to …    Agree to these things …     And – and discipline the person …     But let us acquire the …    The product.    If I recall correctly …     The Board’s concern at the time was these self-created urgencies and how easily it gets invoked as a reas on not to follow a procurement process.  There was a view that the system had been subject to abuse – considerable abuse …     Maybe the pendulum swung …     Quite far …    Onto the one side …    But I think that …    That motivated the exclusion of the (intervenes).    In paragraph 116.4 I make the point that certain grounds for the confinement that are set out now in the CSR memo were identical to the Mitsui memo.  It is as if the grounds for confine – there was like a cut, copy, paste exercise done from the grounds of confinement for MARS and put into the CSR.  Now they also    It is slightly – it is slightly more complex than that.  So an entity would be recommended as for the confinement.    It has to be approved by the person with delegated authority …     But it is still a tender process.  So an RFP would then be issued to that one or sometimes one or two or three however many entities are listed in the confinement.  Submissions must be received.  It must be evaluated.  It must serve before  the Acquisition Council.  I think the fundamental difference is that it is not an open invitation to - to any – any bidder to (intervenes).    Only Mitsui.    Only CSR.    Yes, yes.    I also point out Chair that the CSR memo now refuted the very qualities that had earlier been stated about    As far as the McKinsey confinements  are concerned Chair …    Chair I – I say in paragraph 118 that …    Yes.    Chair if memory serves me correctly the ADC called the Group Chief Supply Chair Officer …     To attend …    Their meetings …    And to – I would imagine that if there were procurement process related issues …     They would look to the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer to say …     Is this correct or not correct.    Correct Chair.    Whether that person as present when these matters were discussed …     I cannot say …     But usually …     The Group Chief Supply Chair Officer would be present …     At - at these discussions.       Chair the combined value of these various confinements came to about 1.6billion and with some amendments and increases to scope of work and value to about 2.1billion.       It did not go out on open tender, it was awarded by of a confined tender process.        And I say that because in the PPM which is our manual of how these things are to be done it, in fact, cautions that because confinement is a departure from an open tender process it must be dealt with, with great “circumspection” and it warns – just lower down in that paragraph I say that the PPM also warns that the misuse of confinement has the potential to entrench monopolies and as such is at odds with the imperatives with the new growth path which was one of the flagship government polices at the time.  I make the point, Chair, in paragraph 122 that our procurement procedures required our delegated authorities to be vigilant against the creation of monopolies and at face value any company who has received work by  way of a confined tender process over a two year perio d with eight awards being made totalling 1.6billion, on the face of it, that seemed to create a monopolistic situation.  What I also highlighted is that there was some awareness even on the part of the Group Chief Executive about the dangers of monopolies so when certain of these confinements were brought forward – I deal with this in paragraph 123 there is a submission that served before the Acquisition Council at one point and it contained the following paragraph, which you will find in italics towards the end of paragraph 123 and it says,  “during post-tender negotiations the GCE raised a concern that Transnet had been awarding business excessively to McKinsey and Company and as a result this will expose Transnet to insurmountable risks should any unsavoury circumstances occur”, And at that point a decision was made to award part of the business to Deloitte’s, but even that ended up in being cancelled and the award was made to McKinsey.  So I think, in essence, despite the earlier concerns and awareness that we could be dealing with a monopolistic situation the award proceeded, nevertheless on all of these things.       We could have paid for many universities Mr Chair.    That is correct.  Thank you Chair.  The point that I was addressing before tea relates to the second ground for confinement where it was said that the services are highly specialised and only obtainable from Gijima.  What I say in paragraph 131 is where the PPM…     Sorry my – my apologies Chair.  What I – what I…    The point that I wanted to make is that where this ground is dealt with in the PPM it says that when this ground D is relied upon proper consideration must be given to the public interest as well as Transnet’s interest. In other words it conveys the notion that it is n ot sufficient for Transnet officials to consider the fact that the services are highly specialised and can only be obtained from McKinsey.  I make the point that there is an overwhelming public interest in open, fair, competitive tendering processes and th e avoidance of monopolistic situations.  And had that requirement of the public interest being taken into consideration as well when that ground D was considered I think it would have pointed us away from repetitive confinements to McKinsey when the public  interest in fact required  something else.    Yes.  And if you may please go to page 1342.      Chair perhaps just for purposes of chronology it may be better to start with the first email which you will find further down in the annexure.     Chair if we can start on page 1344.      Right at the bottom.  And it is dated    That captures the essence of what she was saying which in my view captures the internal controls absolutely correctly.    Well then Chair we have another email from Mr Edward Thomas now in response to the email from Cindy    And all it does is to say you have permission not to issue this RFP    For open tender     Is a process which mirror s the open tender process.    But confined to those two or one or however many.    Well precisely Chair because even if it is a confined – a confined tender    Yes.  Chair I then just I make the point there that there should have been no confusion about this to begin with because in our procurement rules in the PPM of the 2013 version which applied at the time there was a provision which I quote    And I do not propose to read the entire directive Chair save to say that this directive explained to Business that a confinement – a confined tender process is still a tender process and that no one should jump the gun.  That everyone should wait until the tender process is completed be it a confined tender process or an open tender process.  There should be no engagements with a bidder until that process has been completed and only after the relevant delegated body has made the award only then can one engage and issue letters of intent and contracts can be concluded etcetera.  And that is in essence the contents of the directive that was  issued.    Yes.    Yes it was she raised not only Cindy but other people in the supply chain community came to Governance   and said you must address this issue because we are being asked to make payments while tender processes are still underway.  And that is when we issued this to the entire organisation.     Chair it is addressed firstly to all EXCO and extended EXCO members of which Mr Anoj Singh was a member.    They relate to the award of different aspects of what is broadly the McKinsey confinement.     A four day period.    Yes Chair.  Um and I conclude that point over the page where I just say  that the rules around parcelling in Transnet states the following and I am on page 63 of my statement.     But it would not go through any of the    So it would come from the author of the document …     And be received by the approving  authority ….    With no intervening …     Levels of scrutiny.    Chair I then state that on paragraph 149 I make the point that all of thes e levels of review are bypassed and then in paragraph 150 …    On page 65 …     I say that   It was in the DOA framework, yes.    Ja.    (Intervenes).    Ja.    Chair there were no guidelines contained in the DOA framework.  I think there was simply a line that said when the – when it is confidential …     It can be considered by the final approval authority without directing it to the lower levels of authority.  So there was in essence to answer your question there were no guidelines.    No, no.    The origin – the originator …     Of the document …     Would for various reasons state why he thinks it is confiden tial.    It would be taken to the final approval authority.    Who then review it and if the approval authority agrees that it was confidential it would be signed off.     And the (indistinct).    Exactly.  That is how it would be understood.    (Indistinct).    Ja.    Well that is exactly the danger here Chair that …    As we have seen in some of these instances that I am talking about …     This concern is not an abstract …     Academic concern.  It is rooted in the real experiences of the organisation.     Has been removed …     By the current Board but it created huge risk for the organisation at the time.     I honestly cannot – cannot say this individual or that individ ual and (intervenes).    But we know that it came – it originated from the delegation (intervenes).     Yes and I think that in itself is an oddity …    Because it is confidential up until the confinement is approved …     But then you must still issue the RFP to that bidder.    It must still be received.  It must still …     And that – that part is not - is not confidential which is – which is a further …     It is very strange.  It is very strange, ja.    Confidential about it.    Well there is a provision that directs the lower level bodies …    As to what they must consider when approving a confinement and it does say there must be a robust review …    Of the grounds of confinement and the motivation for the confinement …    Before it is taken to …     The final approval body.    The intention Chair is that poorly justified …     Or unjustified…     Motivations either for confinement or whatever the case maybe …     Whatever the ground of confinement may be…    And if it is poorly motivated …     It would be dealt with at that lower level of review.    So that we do not have to  burden the final …    Approval body …     With a poorly motivated …     Submission.    That was the underlying rationale but if you took those reviewing bodies out of the equation …     Well then it just goes straight through.    Yes Chair.    That – that - it seemed to me that was the underlying motivation.    Covering the normal …    Yes, yes.  That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    And Chair the …    I – I – ja, so it is almost a – you know- a deviation within a deviation.    Confinement is a deviation.    Why still have a …    A confidential confinement and the point that I was making is that apart from this anomaly of the principle  if one looks at the substance of the motivations there is nothing that strikes me as even remotely confidential about what is contained in these memoranda.  For instance it talks – it says that there are declining revenues and declining volumes and (indistinct) and a risk and that McKinsey is ideally placed to help us to implement various projects but why they could not have followed a normal confinement process – I mean that – I think on any reasonable interpretation and reading of these confinement memos it certainly does not appear that there was anything not even an iota of information is contained that would convince a reasonable reader that there was grounds for confidential – confidentiality.    Yes.    Chair they could have said that but the difficulty would have been that the same risk still e xists where it goes from the originator to the final approver whether you call it confidential or not without that critical middle layer of review.      Ja.    BADC.    DC.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes Chair I – I then just conclude that portion by saying that the added difficulty with using confidentiality  is that it was sometimes quoted as a ground for confinement itself whereas our rules on confinement only recognise four grounds – urgency, sole supplier, standardisation and what I refer to ea rlier as the school fees clause where there is highly specialised things and – those are the four grounds of confinement.  Confidentiality can be cited as a reason not to take it through the reviewing process but we see that sometimes confidentiality is even quoted as a further ground for confinement which I – I think was incorrect.  Chair I am …     Yes.    Well Chair we had some debates about - about that and if memory serves me correctly the debate was resolved that on the basis that the grounds as stated in the delegation of authority would be incorporated into the policy.  There was some concern – if memory services me correctly – about over regulating or over prescribing what may be considered as confidential grounds or no confidential grounds.  So it was – it was left somewhat open even in the past.    Yes.  So the only ground…     Is confidential – is that if it is confidential …     Ja.  So …    So the ground …    For bypassing all of these delegated bodies …    Would be if some – if it is classified as a confidential …    Confinement.    I think in essence it was – it was …    Completed as such.    I think it is – I (intervenes).    The same point in 152.    Chair I point out in paragraph 153 and following under the heading “gap analysis” – I say that a National Treasury issued an instruction which would have been applicable to some of these McKinsey contracts and the instruction I have annexed as Annexure PV48 which you will find on page 1389 and what this instruction says Chair is that a consultant may only be appointed after a proper business case has been done and a – what is referred to as a gap analysis – has been done to confirm that Transnet does not have the requisite skills or the resources in place to perform this work.  In other words it must be confirmed that in the – there is no one among the 50 000 employees who work for Transnet that there is expertise of this nature and that – and there needs to be a proper motivation for that.  There is a passing reference to that in some of the McKinsey confinements but no proper gap analysis was done to show – and that is a mandatory requirement.  It is not nice to have.  It says that the organ of State must conduct such a gap analysis before it can proceed to appoint a consultant and I could not find evidence of such gap analysis.    That is correct Chair.  The last  aspect which I deal with in my statement relates to the remuneration model that McKinsey sought to implement and the McKinsey contracts made provision for two kinds of fees Chair.  The first is the so called fixed fee component.  So they would say to do preparatory work or to do whatever there is - our fixed fee is that and then they would have what is referred to as a contingent fee component.  This was usually related to McKinsey sharing a percentage of any increase in  revenue which would come about as a result of their efforts.  So if I take – let us say – the coal or the manganese contract if it could be established that as a result of their interventions that revenue had increased by a certain amount there would be a predetermined percentage that would be allocated to them over and above the fixed fee that they had signed up for.    Extra.    Ja.  I suppose one could regard it as a performance bonus of – of sorts.    Yes.  Now – now on the face of it Chair I was concerned that this contingent fee arrangement was not  aligned to National Treasury’s instruction on cost containment which in fact there is an instruction that directs  that fees for consultants will be subject to certain prescripts.  You cannot – a consultant cannot charge you whatever and I think I may even have attached a copy of that - of that instruction.    1398 if you just bear with me.  I think it is a little bit earlier.  Chair if you turn to page 1389 you will find a copy of the cost containment instruction …     And if you turn the page to page 1390 …    And if you look at paragraph 4.2.    It states the following   Chair the difficulty then – well let me say that we then engaged with National Treasury on whether the use of contingency fees could be a basis for remunerating consultants and the Accountant General responded in a letter to Transnet dated 25 June 2014 and perhaps I should turn to it Chair.  It is Annexure PV49 which is the last annexure in the – in my bundle and …     1398.    And he responds to various questions that we had posed to him and under the – in paragraph 7 under the heading “Use of Consultants” the Accountant General quotes that paragraph 4.2 of the instruction which I have just read w hich says what the prescriptions are for remuneration and then Chair he says the – he said the following.  “The above mentioned documents merely provide the tariffs that PFMA compliant institutions may pay  consultants and these tariffs are not related to additional revenue or earnings – if any – that entities may realise or benefit from their appointment.” And it seemed to open the door to the possibility of a contingency fee arrangement and I think on – on the basis of this letter Transnet proceeded to implement the contingency fee arrangement.     Chair I have sought to give a candid view on the compliance with prescripts that – that was followed and if the – if the rule that was no followed if it was an obscure highly complicated difficult to understand provision then I – I would be more inclined to think that there could be just innocent bungling but Chair if we look at the rules around how confinements are supposed to be done the principle that you cannot pay someone before you award a tender to them - all the other breaches that I have dealt with over the last two days Chair it is not deeply complex principles that were no followed and  it – it suggests in my view an – an element of either gross negligence or wilfulness in – in not following the transactions.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.    Chair this section of my evidence deals with an award of the IT Data Services tender initially to T-Systems which was then subsequently withdrawn and awarded now to Gijima.  I will take you through what I say in paragraphs 105 and following Chair.    Chair so I point out in my statement that during January of 2010 Transnet entered into the initial agreement with T-Systems for the provision of IT data services.  It is a critical  service for Transnet’s operations.  Effectively it enables access to all critical IT data pertaining to the rail operations, ports, pipelines, personnel, a range of functions that Transnet requires in orde r to operate effectively and efficiently.  I then say that after that initial tender was – the contract was entered into a series of variations or extensions in value to that contract then occurred.  And I explain those variations in one of the annexures w hich I would like to take you to.  It is not directly germane to the issue of the award to Gijima which subsequently followed but I thought just for context I would like to give the commission a full sense of the history of the matter.     There were in total five variations.     That is correct.    Sorry?    It was extended on variations but parallel to that…    The new tender process was being evaluated and awarded and so on.     To extend the contract.    Or varied in the sense that     And the value.    Exactly Chair.    I am there Chair.    Subsequent to January 2018.    Chair what the document then reflects is that the initial award to T-Systems was a five year contract with an option to extend for a further two years.  So the option was incorporated into the initial contract which was to run from 1 January 10 to 31 December 2014 with a total initial contract value of about R1.9 billion.     That is correct.    The variations then were as follows Chair.  Firstly the first variation related to the exe rcising of that two year option.    No Chair it would be the former meaning that…     Wherever we refer to variation     It is an extension.    In both time and value.    So it is not just the time extension.     With the time extension would be a value [indistinct].    Yes Chair.    Correct.    Precisely.    Sometimes that may well be.  It would be extended.    Ja.    I was then referring to the first variation Chair which involved really the exercise of that two year option that I had referred to earlier which then extended the contract from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.  There were various reasons given for the exercising of this – of the option.  Some of the m I  will mention briefly.  In essence Chair it was said that the Transnet had contracted Gartner to review all the current services that were being received from T-Systems to develop a new strategy.  To issue a new set of specifications.  The RFP had to be  written and the motivation that was given was that we – that two year extension was required in order to complete that part of the work.     The second extension was for a further period of nine months from 1 January 2017 to 30 September 17 I refer that is on page 1087 just the following page.  And what it says Chair is that the nine month extension was requested to enable Transnet to finalise the new IT data services procurement e vent which was now ready at the adjudication stage.  So it had progressed but it had not yet been completed and a further extension of both time and value was then requested.    Correct Chair.  With all the extensions there was a significant value extension as well which now stood at R3.8 billion.    The third extension…     That is correct Chair.    Chair the third extension …     And – and what it related to was an initial request actually for twelve months for – to enable Transnet to essentially extricate itself from the unlawful award that had been made to T-Systems and to award the tender to Gijima as was initially submitted by management.  But there was a process of litigation that had unfolded and the concern was that the litigation process would not run its course within a twelve month period.  Eventual ly National Treasury approved the extension but not for twelve months.  They only granted an eight month extension during which time I think there was considerable attempt as I say for Transnet to extricate itself from this initial tender award which I wil l deal with in more detail in a short while I am just giving an overview of the various reasons for the extension.     Is on 1090.  This was for the period 9 September 2018 to 8 March 2019 a nd there has been no further extensions after that date.  So that was the last extension.     That is correct Chair.    Yes.    As currently it is no longer ongoing.     The last extension was – it expired on 8 March 2019.     That is when this contract ended.    Ja.    Five years.    Correct.    Yes so now if I can focus more directly on the award to T-Systems Chair.  In paragraph 107 and following I state that during November 2015 Transnet issued this RFP to the open market for the supply of IT data se rvices and T-Systems responded and Gijima responded and a few others responded.  After quite a drawn out protracted tender process a recommendation was made by management to award the tender to Gijima.  Having said that I should also point out to you Chair  that my understanding is management did have some misgivings during the evaluation process about Gijima.  There were various commercial and also technical concerns that management had raised and they were not at first in favour of the award to Gijima.  Bu t after extensive engagements with Gijima management came to the conclusion ultimately that those risks  had been adequately mitigated.  Based on the view that the risks had been mitigated they made the recommendation to award to Gijima.  What I then go on to say is that during February 2017 the board took a decision not to award to Gijima based on those risks that management had earlier dealt with and to award it to T-Systems.    In terms of the delegation of authority framework .    To make those decisions.    That is precisely the difficulty that Governance had with this entire transaction.  The risks had been highlighted at an earlier s tage and as I testified in the view of the technical and other experts who assessed the matter they were satisfied that the risks had been properly dealt with.  What then  happened is…     Yes.    Generally speaking?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Precisely.    Ja.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    Chair I am – I am in large measure in fact I am in – I am in total agreement.    With the – with what you say.   Because I – my evidence should not be understood to mean that I am of the view that the board is bound by recommendations of management.  It is a board for – it is called the accounting authority for a good reason.  That is the body that must ultimately make its decisions.  My difficulty does not lie with the principle of the board.    Arriving at a different conclusion.     But Chair my concerns firstly is that when these risks were properly evaluated at an earlier stage at the functionality and the commercial gate and the bidder passed that threshold for functionality then in fact we – our own procurement rules in Transnet warns against this concept of double dipping where someone was properly and fully assessed at any earlier stage and then under the guise of a risk evaluation those very issues are now revisited.  And – so I think that is the first concern and the second is just the rationality of it.    But in this particular case there was  quite a comprehensive motivation     To the board which dealt with all of the issues.    And one does see a detailed logical     Analysis on the part of the board.     As to why it held a different view.     No.    Precisely.    That is…    Incident.    It says it must be a material risk such that it can cause severe prejudice to Transnet if it were not properly taken into account.    So the principle I have no difficulty with.    But it is the opportunistic use of risk.     Not award to a bidder X    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    A complaint.       Chair I – with regards the McKinsey transactions I’ve also been asked to comment on the grounds of the confinement to McKinsey I make the point in paragraph 118 that over a three year period  2012 to 2018 there were at least eight contracts that were awarded to McKinsey consulting for various consultancy work.       All eight followed a confined tender process and I – a summary is contained in the bundle in the Annexures but on the next page Chair, on page 55 paragraph 1251 to 1258 I summarised these confinements.       Chair I highlight various views which I have of the confinement starting with the entrenching of monopolies.       Chair in 1. – sorry in 125, I just again quote what the – our internal grounds are and I say that these confinements relied on two grounds, urgency firstly, I mention that as ground A) in paragraph 126 and ground D) which is that services are  highly specialised and largely identical to work previously performed and I just want to engage for a few moments on both of those grounds, whether they were justified in the context of the McKinsey transactions.  Under urgency Chair, it is stated that the ground for confineme nts are urgent based on certain revenue related risks.  It was stated that EBITDAR is at risk and there’s a need to deliver on MDS, the Market Demands Strategy which was a flagship programme of Transnet at time and it states that if we don’t get these serv ices we could place the whole MDS at risk. Now as I testified yesterday, the grounds for urgency is that it must be a genuine unforeseeable urgency and I say in my statement that the PPM contemplates that the situation that gave rise to the urgency should not be anticipated and should therefore be genuinely unexpected and I question whether the revenue risks that were highlighted were genuinely unexpected.  A revenue risk is not something which Transnet would realise now, one sees declines in volumes and declines in revenue usually over a period of time and I certainly don’t think that, that was unforeseeable.  On the second ground which relates to the fact that the services from Mckinsey are highly specialised and largely identical to work which they previ ously did.  I say the following in paragraph 130 of my statement Chair, I say that, “all the confinement memos justified the confinements to Mckinsey on the grounds that it would result in wasted time and money.  It was stated that a new service provider w ould have to acquaint itself with Transnet’s pricing strategies, capital programme, overall MDS, whereas  McKinsey already had that knowledge” and ground D) does make allowance for a situation where I can confine to someone on the grounds that it’s a highly  specialised service and I just want a bit more from that person based on what they have done before.  We, in Transnet we refer to it sometimes as the school fees, the school fees clause. We say we have paid the school fees of this consultant he has come to learn all of our shortcomings, our difficulties, our systems and we want him to do an extra bit of work but if we have to go out on tender, I must pay the school fees now of another person whose having to re-learn all of these difficulties.  So in an appropriate case, I think there is justification for such awards, in fact I think the first few McKinsey transactions – the first two or three, I was – I supported that at the time, I thought there was a justification for it based on this school fees clause b ut what we have here Chair is that it is now said that McKinsey has all of – they’ve got – they’re proprietary iron or demand and supply model and they’ve got proven toolkits for negotiation and the like and the point...(intervention).       Correct.    Sorry you asked?    Oh.    Yes I think we had also past…     Past there.    I think we are now with McKinsey.    I think I meant to say McKinsey.    And there can in my view Chair be no distinction between the public interest and Transnet’s interest as a public body.  Chair I then deal with another concern which I p icked up and that is that in a number of instances payments were made to McKinsey even before the tenders were awarded.  So the tender is still underway and payments are being made.  And I deal with that in paragraph 132.    Yes.    Gladly Chair.      It is an email written by the then procurement manager Cindy Felix to Mr Edward Thomas     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  With respect I think the contents of this second email – the contents are patently incorrect.  A confinement when one gets approval to confine     It does not create a contract at all.     I would imagine.    But you can now issue the RFP to this one or two or three or however many you have confined to and then what follows     And the contract gets concluded at the end of that process.    It is unheard of that one can conclude a contract first and then     Evaluate later.    I have never heard of suc h.    It must go through a rigorous evaluation process.    If that bidder does not make any of thresholds let us say for functionality or local content that bid der is excluded, the bidder falls away.  But if I already have contract in place I really put the cart before the horse and I think that is exactly what  happened in this instance.    It – I think that is then just a follow up email where the staff is told that look Eddie has now informed us that there is no breach or deviation and payment must now be made.  I think that the staff felt that they no w had no alternative.    They have made their point, they have stated their position.    But someone higher up in the food chain had instructed that the payment must be made and I think the impression that one gets is under protest the payments then flow.     And that is what I deal with on – in paragraph 134 yes.    In paragraph 135 I say that on the 9 April 2014 well before these RFP’s were issued the Group Chief Financial Officer who was Mr Anoj Singh at the time wrote to both McKinsey and Regiments and requested them to “mobilise a McKinsey led consortium” he says to have initial discussions with our teas.  But we know now from what we have seen it was not just discussi ons.  They were mobilised to do actual work and – and I think that for me is a fundamental breach of process.  As a result of this Chair we actually felt the need to issue a further directive to Business.  And I deal with that in paragraph 136 the directive itself I think is attached as PV46  which…    Ja Felix.    Felix.    Yes it was Chair.    But he would have.    That he would have seen it.    I am not aware that there has been any.    Change.    In paragraph 137.     I simply say Chair that it was most irregular to engage McKinsey to commence work before the tender process and I say that it creates the impression that the confinements to McKinsey amounted to little more than an Ex post facto exercise to justify the award of Business that had already occurred.  Why go through the pretence of a confined tender process when in fact the teams are already on the ground doing the work?  And it just creates the impression in my mind that this was Ex post facto justification for what had already happened.    This is now still on the McKinsey contracts.  I am raising a further concern that I have with the contracts Chair.  And it relates to what we refer to as parce lling of transactions.    Well in essence what it means is that you cannot break up a transaction into smaller value components to bring it to a lower level of delegatio n when in fact if you take the cumulative value it should go to a higher level of delegation.  It is even dealt with I think in our code of ethics where it is stated that it is considered an ethical breach to unbundle a transaction into smaller components in order to avoid higher levels of authority and scrutiny.  Now I raise that in the context of the McKinsey contracts because I say that over a period of four days and that is from the 31 March 2014 to  the 3 April 2014 when I reviewed these confinements I noticed that the former GCE Mr Brian Molefe approved four confinements with a combined value of R619 million.  Now Mr Molefe had delegation to approve confinements but only up to R250 million.  Each one of these four falls under 250.  So the first one is 1 30 million.  The second one was 239, the third one was 150 million and the fourth confinement was 0 million.  So viewed on their own they would have fell within his delegated authority.  But viewed cumulatively it should have been referred to a higher level which is the board acquisition and disposal committee.    Chair?    So the coal contract.  The coal contract to McKinsey was to appoint McKinsey to help us to improve our efficiencies on the coal.  But the iron ore contract which is the second one was also geared at enhancing efficiencies, increasing revenue.  The third one which was the manganese contract had the same essential characteristics it was about how we can get McKinsey  to help us to improve on our productivity and so on and the NNPP contract.  So they – they in essence relate to the same scope of work.      Four days.    Yes.    Essentially the – exactly.    And …    And to the same entity.    Yes.  And it seemed to me Chair at face value that this amounted to an unbundling of these contracts to fall within the delegated authority of the GCE.     Ja.    That is correct.     Ja.    Two days earlier.    One day earlier.  That is my concern.     Paragraph 141. “The rules around parcelling says that when the full scope of work is known at a  point in time requirements may not be deliberately split into parts or items of lesser value in order to keep the transaction within a particular delegation of authority level or to keep it below a particular threshold or a person with higher levels of de legation.  This is considered parcelling and will be regarded in a serious light as it amounts to non-compliance with procurement procedures.”   So I think the rules around that were clearly stated in the company at the time.    Yes.    In relation to McKinsey Chair I  indicated yesterday that a number of these confinements were classified as confidential.  And I will come back to that aspect in a moment but first let me say this that because confinements is a process that is – that has great potential for abuse where g rounds are relied upon that are actually – that should never justify confinement. Various safeguards and levels of revue were built into the process and I mention that it has to start with the operating division.  The end user department has to motivate for the confinement.  It then has to go to the operation division CPO, the acquisition council and the Chief Executive of that operating division and then it comes to Group where it again has to undergo various levels of revue from the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer and there was even a practice although not uniformly observed that Governance had to review these as well.  And I  said yesterday that when a confinement was classified as confidential none of the safeguards applied.  So it sailed past all these reviewing bodies and would have gone straight to the GCE.  And…     It would depend on the value.    So…    That principle still applied.    Reviewing bodies.    That is precisely the case.     Thank you Chair. 
VOLMINK: And must not involve a reconsideration of the very factors that were earlier evaluated.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Can you now move on to d eal with the McKinsey confinements?      And this all eight were on confinements?      And what is the value – the total value of these confinements?       All that did not go out on tender ?      Yes now from paragraph 120 you express certain views about the justifications that were contained in the confinement, could you please take us through them?       Yes.      On that university note, I see it’s quarter past eleven.    Thank you Chair.    Not Gijima.    You mentioned Gijima.     Yes.  May I then take you to Exhibit BB2.1D for David?    In order to substantiate what you are saying in paragraph 132 you then place re liance on a number of emails starting from page 1342 onwards.  Can you please take us through the emails?    You can follow the chronology that suits you know the version.    That is the right one.    Yes.  On page     1342.    1342.      That captures the essence.    And then what happened after she  have now dispatched that email?     Despite that analysis that really showed that the process was incoherent at that stage and there was no contracts in place at that stage?     Can you take us from page 60 paragraph 133 onwards?    And 135?    Chair it is on page 1353.    You conclude on that topic Mr Volmink on page 137.    Paragraph 137 yes.    And from paragraph 138 you addressing a new topic.  Take us through it?     What does that – what does that mean?    And to the same entity.    Yes.    Can you tell us then what did this also entail in relation to McKinsey?  
MR PETER STEPH EN VOLMINK:  Thankfully the concept of confidential confinements …  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Chair the next witness for Transnet is Mr Mohomedy he won’t give evidence today because we are adjourning early today.     And I understand that Monday as well as Tuesday the Chair and others are otherwi se engaged and that unless you decide otherwise Chair we will begin on Wednesday once more at 10am with Mr Mohammed, his evidence for Transnet.      Well there’s two issues the availability of the witness and the evidence leader that can always be arranged.     The other, however, is that the legal team are involved in other tasks so it reduces that time but if the programme permits, then certainly our preference would be for the normal hours but if your concern is to make up time, then we shall just have to start at 9.     Two days and I’m informed by Mr Mokoena that if we start at 10 on Wednesday and Thursday we will finish Mr Mohomady in two days.     Thank you Chair.
