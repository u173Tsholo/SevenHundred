CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    U?    A?    U8?    Yes.   It is just that the eight is not there.  There is File 9.    Ja mine is not – it is marked Volume U File 9 of.    But it is Exhibit U.    Exhibit U8.    Okay, okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    YEs.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    YEs.    Yes.    YEs.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    U got 5?    The files which are here do not appear to show on their spines that any of them includes Mr Ephron’s statement.  There is one which is – which contains the statements of Mr Mashego and Mr Bester.   Then there is Exhibit U2.  It does not – oh then it shows that the statement inside is that of Mr Naga.    And then there is Exhibit U4 it just says File 5 of on the spine.  Then there is Exhibit U4 that has got the statements of Van Der Riet.    Magwaza that us all.    Ja.    YEs.    Yes.   Ja.    U2?    YEs.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. Ja.  Okay, okay.  No thank you.  Now is Mr Ephron’s statement included in the same bundle where we have got Mr Naga’s statement or have we not find it – found it?    About it.    Okay.    Ja.    Ephron – yes.    We might not need…    Okay, okay.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.    Ja.    YEs.    Thank you.      Thank you.    What is the page?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well I am sorry Mr Opperman let – let me get first to where you want to make the first amendment or correction.  I am at page 253 on the spreadsheet and maybe would help me by telling me in relation to which month – against which month that item is?    Oh okay, okay.      So do we – do we cross out 33692?  Just tell us once again Mr Opperman.      What is the number that should be reflected there instead of 13833692,75?    Oh.   Oh okay, okay thank you.    Do you want us to say 13.3 million I see you have got plus minus before that?    Oh plus minus 14 million.    Okay.  I am changing to say plus minus 14 million.     That was the first correction that you wanted to make?  I thought you wanted to make another correction as well Mr Opperman?    I am sorry let me just get there.  What paragraph, what page?    H’m.    Is that paragraph 16?    Of – at page 3 of your statement?    Okay alright what should be changed there?   For undersupply?    So the first sentence should read   Oh okay.  Eskom.  So imposed becomes recorded    Recorded penalties based on the undersupply of coal?    Based on the undersupply of coal.  Okay I have got that.  Is there another correction you want to make in the statement?    That is all okay thank you.    Okay.    To Brakfontein ja okay.    Yes I see it is quite – seems to be quite a nice division of work.    Well it is because of your assistance.    Yes.    I am sorry.  I take it that what you mean is you arrive at the same outcome?    Total but the method or the means by which you arrive at it might differ in some way from the method that may have been used by those who calculated and came to the same amount, 2.1 billion.  Is that right?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.  No that is fine.    Is that the; is that what comes after the bullet point with liaise with power station?    After Eskom?    Yes.    Should be suppliers?    Okay, thank you.   Yes.    Ja, thank you.    Will everybody please switch off their cell phones.  Okay.  Yes Mr Maleka.        Before you actually do the – or effect the set-off would you have communicated to them your conclusion that penalties have to be imposed or they would only see when they see how much you are paying them that month?    Okay thank you.    And when you have advised, when you would have advised them of the imposition of a penalty in a particular month and they didn’t agree with you and therefore there was some issue would you go ahead and effect the set-off in regard to that month or would the implementation of the set-off wait until there is some resolution in regard to that particular month?    Of a dispute.   So the dispute could be handled in due course but you would have effected that set-off in the meantime?    I guess it follows that if you had effected a set-off in a particularmonth but a dispute arose or was still going on and later on you were persuaded that you were wrong you would then reverse that.    Ja, okay.    Yes, yes.    Was it 131, or not really?    Yes.    You think it’s Mr?    Ephron, okay, thank you.    Yes.    Crossed out ...(intervention)     Okay.  I’m just making a note amended by the 3rd Addendum, is that right?   Sorry?    Yes, yes delete it, not amend it, delete it.    Thank you.    So does that mean that Eskom did produce a draft but it was not the two parties did not reach agreement on the draft?     Oh, okay.  So you didn’t produce draft.   Okay I thought you sought to qualify that.     Thank you.    Is that the report at 198?    Okay.    Yes before you proceed Mr Opperman if you go back to that first bullet point at page 193 where he explains how all the coal gets degraded is degraded the correct word?   If what he was saying was correct would that have meant that there should be no penalty if that was correct?    Yes.    YEs.    Yes.    YEs.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    Yes sure.    Yes.  I guess you – this might be the convenient time?   Or you wanted one last question?    Okay alright.    We will take the tea adjournment until half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes you may proceed Mr Maleka.   Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    What page, I’m sorry?    Okay.    {Coughing} excuse me.  Well you might have to just clarify the position with regard to your position with regard to this R2.1 billion because when you talked about it for the first time earlier this morning the first answer that I think you gave to Mr Maleka’s question or his question may have been based on the understanding that you did not agree with that amount.  But you subsequently said as I understood you that you had no problem with the amount of R2.1 billion but there was some other issue and I cannot remember whether it was the method of calculation.  I think I did ask you whether your issue related to the method of calculation or the means by which theyhad arrived at that amount.  You gave a certain answer and now I hear that you say you do not have a problem with that amount. I think you say now again but I saw something here also – ja in paragraph 47.    You specifically – well the first line of paragraph 27 you say   Maybe before it is read let me ask this question Mr Opperman.  Let us go back to the position when you either heard or saw for the first time that Mr Christo Kruger had reached the total amount of R 2.1 billion in his calculations.    Okay.  I take it that at a certain stage you familiarised yourself with how he came to that amount, is that right?    And in doing so you got to understand that he interpreted theagreement in a certain way, is that right?    You interpreted the – you agreed with his interpretation?    Okay at that stage what was your attitude to the outcome of that calculation namely R2.1 billion?  Did you take the view that his outcome was correct?    Yes.  So if you were the one who had been asked to make the calculation instead of Mr Kruger being the one who was asked what is the total that you would have arrived at on your own understanding of what was to be taken into account and what was not to be taken into account in calculating the amount?  What was the amount that you have come to?\    So and did Mr Kruger do something different in regard to that item?    And you excluded it?    You would have excluded it?    And when you calculated you excluded it.    Correct.    Now as far as you are concerned was he wrong to include it?    You do not know?    But from what you say it seems clear to me that you took a view that I cannot remember what you said it was that should be excluded in the calculation, what was that?    Ja the sliding penalties.    Sizing penalties.   Ja you took the view that they should be excluded from the calculation?    Yes but Mr Kruger took the view that they should be included.    Yes that – because of the different views that you both took you did not come to the same conclusion – outcome, is that right?  He came to R2.1 billion, you came to about 700 and something million rand?    So now I do not understand why you would then in the light of this still say you agreed with his amount of R2.1 billion when your view was there was something he took into account which took him to that amount, that total which in your view should not be taken into account.  Why do you say – why do you say you agreed with his total of R2.1 billion then?    But it includes what you think should be excluded, is it not?    But as I understand it and you must just tell me if there is something I misunderstand.  As I understand what was being calculated was the total amount of penalties.    That Eskom was entitled to.    Okay.  Now I take it Mr Kruger was asked please calculate for us what we are owed as Eskom in terms of the total penalties?    He came to the amount of R2.1 billion?    By whatever method he came to that amount?    Now if you were asked or you asked or you decided to calculate the total penalties that Eskom was entitled to is that right on your own?    And you arrived at R700 and something million, is that right?    Now let me ask this question before I allow Mr Maleka to continue.  But what was your answer and maybe what is your answer now also as to what was Eskom – what penalties as a total was Eskom entitled to at that time in your view?    I am not sure if I am any better – I am any wiser.   But I let you continue.    Yes.    Were you consulted about the R250 million?    Yes.   Yes it is.  Thank you we will take the lunch adjournment and resume at two.  We adjourn.    You may proceed Mr Maleka.    Yes I do, yes.    Just repeat the last part.  Would you?    SN, is that the spreadsheet?    Oh, I think my Registrar put it somewhere.  Zondi where is thatspreadsheet.  Did you put it in?    Okay.  I have got it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, I remember the figure.  I cannot see it now, but I think you may proceed.    I will find it.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Million.    Is that; are we back?    To the other file?    Oh.   Okay, 253 you said?    Okay.    Yes, I have got it.    As you say yes and so on or no Mr Opperman just make sure that the mic can catch your words so that it is recorded.    Thank you.   No that is fine.    I just wanted to say I am still not sure about the issue that we discussed earlier about where Mr Opperman stands with regard to the R2.1 billion versus 700 and something million, but I guess we have spent more than enough time on it.  I will.    Read the transcript and see.    What the position is, ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.  Well of course I guess the other point you may have been seeking to make is also that if he had been consulted and assuming that the relevant authorities sought to give due weight to his view on the amount maybe it is unlikely that they would have settled at the low amount on which they settled.    So they might not have insisted on 2.1 billion, but at least maybe they would have insisted on his figure.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  No that is fine.  That is fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    That is fine.    Hm.    Okay.    Ja.   Ja.    No that is fine.    258?    Okay.    Is that the correct page you gave me?    Hm.  It is GJ?    Is it 19?    Okay.  Yes.    So it was – was it making things easier in terms of quality and to the detriment of Eskom.    Yes.   So previously it was 15%?    15 so in which case under that regime the penalties would start accumulating earlier, quicker.    But now no penalties will accumulate until 20% at least has been exceeded.   Yes.    Why the inconsistency?   No I’m saying Mr Maleka is asking why the inconsistency, why are Glencore and Tegeta treated differently by Eskom in regard to this issue?    The final approval was Mr Koko, according to the last page of the memo, Ms Nteta was the requestor and Neo Cholanco was a supporter, Nkosi Simbuweni was a supporter, Mr Matshella Koko was the approver, okay?    Ja.   No that’s fine.    285?    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Opperman the way he looks at me it’s as if he is saying well come to my rescue, why must I speculate.  I think Mr Maleka don’t force him to speculate.    Ja no I think let him not speculate.    Yes that’s when I say articulate your answers so the microphone can catch and record your answer Mr Opperman, I know it’s been a long day, but when younod the answer is not recorded.    Well you were kept in the dark about the 4th addendum for a long time, when you say this guarantee was never provided to Eskom what are the chances that you might not know the true position, it might be there but you have been kept in the dark about it as well also.    Sorry?    Mm, but in terms of chances you would say probably the position isthat it’s not there or you are not able to indicate in terms of what’s possible or what’s probable?    Yes, but in terms of your work chances are that if it was there you would have seen it or you are not able to go that far?    Yes, but if you wanted to know whether it’s there you would have a way of finding out wouldn’t you?   Okay, Mr Maleka I don’t know whether you want to do anything about that?    Or you may have your other ways.    You have, okay no that’s alright.    Okay, alright yes.    I’m sorry is that the one on 302 because I don’t have a letter on 300, I’ve got a divider and then Annexure JG026 and then a letter at 302.    Hang on, no I’m sorry I do have thank you.    Yes I think that’s the one.    Yes.    Yes I’ve got it.    108?    Yes I’ve got it.    Yes.    What page?    Thank you.   Thank you.    Mr Opperman will have to come to our rescue.  Did you see that Mr Opperman.    It looks like Eskom is threatening to let us stop – make us stop.    Yes no, no we should continue.    No we must continue.    It was compiled and signed by him and two others also signed.   Okay.    Well I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Opperman.  Let us go back to the first sentence and see if there is a problem understanding it.  Forget about the fact that there are two verbs that follow each other in there, consider and decide.  Probably one should read it like this.  Should Eskom decide to implement the existing agreement Eskom would have to charge Optimum shortfall coal supply penalties in the regionR585 million.  Does that assist at all?    Okay.    I see you nod.    Okay I have got it at 326.    Have I got it?    What begins at 348?    Oh.    Oh, okay.    Have you got it Mr Opperman?    You are permitted Mr Maleka.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I found it.  Mr Opperman you were making some point while I was looking for page 35.   Oh, okay.    So Mr Maleka it looks Ms Hofmeyr is very good with figures.    I found it.    Ja.    What was the paragraph in the statement again?    So we cross out three and insert five?    Yes.    Oh, we should simply add.   So we do not change anything in paragraph 83?    Oh, okay.    Yes.   I am sorry Mr Maleka.    You are referring to paragraph 4 of this agreement under which there is a reference to Clause 8?   Ja, okay.    Yes.    Hendrina.    Ja.    Yes.    Actually would it be correct Mr Opperman to say in regard to exactly that point that Eskom ought not to have allowed Tegeta to supply coal to Arnot when it could supply coal sufficiently to Hendrina?    Yes, do.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Just repeat that last statement.    It was clear.    Yes.    Well before you answer Mr Opperman you were saying something and Mr Maleka said let us not go there.  Now some evidence had been heard by this Commission from other witnesses you mentioned that does not that is not intended to suppress your evidence in case you have knowledge of something that might be inconflict with what another witness says.  So if it is something that you have personal knowledge on and you are able to say it even if another witness has said something else you can say it.  So I just do not want.    You to have any perception that maybe you are not allowed to say something just because another witness said something else.  He did intend to say that.    So you can go back to his question.  Mr Maleka I think you did put a question.    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I just wanted to make sure.    Okay.    Oh, okay.    Yes.   I think he is asking whether you have anything that you want to say in regard to those paragraphs because from his side he doesn’t think he wants to ask you any questions about what you say in those paragraphs.    You said Mr Opperman when you were required to sign in regard to this payment, this prepayment, you were reluctant, why were you reluctant?  What made you reluctant?    In terms of what was before you at that time was there any reference to this payment being a pre-payment, in other words the documentation that you had infront of you at that time did it reflect that this was a prepayment?    Yes, is that part of what made you reluctant or not really?    Yes, so you knew that there were no services or there was no coal that had been provided for which this was payment?    Yes and that worried you.    And the documentation that was given to you after you asked for more documentation what documentation was it again?    And up to that point or rather was it – or how often did you at Eskom within your portfolio did you have to deal with prepayments, how regular was that, or how regular is, in the sense of how often would it happen that you come across a situation where prepayment had to be made?    This was the first time?    And after that has there been another one?    Ja.  And obviously you were concerned that there was something irregular about this, or not really?      Because there were no services that had been granted, that had been given to Eskom and there were no, there was no coal grant given to Eskom forwhich this was payment and this is something that had never happened in your entire time when you were working at Eskom that should have worried you as this is something that is probably not regular and not correct?    When you were provided with further documentation that further documentation did not remove the fact that no goods or services had been provided to Eskom for which this was payment isn’t it?    That remained to be the – that remained the position?    And still it was a first time after many years that you are working at Eskom that this was, you had been asked to do this?   Were you concerned in any way that you might by signing you might be allowing yourself to be party to something irregular?    But if you gave, if you were party to a transaction in terms of which a supplier was to be given a prepayment of this size and something happened and then Eskom didn’t get any value then there would be a problem isn’t it?    There would be a problem and as a manager it would be part of your duties to look after the interest of Eskom in that kind of situation to say you don’t want Eskom to be put at great risk for that kind of situation isn’t it?    Yes, but did you raise with your – the person senior to you that you talked about it to say but why should I sign this thing because there seems to be something irregular here and so on, did you put your concern at that level?    And what did he say about this concern?    You can’t recall, and what was is name again?    Sorry, Mazibuko?    Oh okay, thank you.    On Monday, okay.    I think on – except on Wednesday when we will start at nine every day next week we will start at nine thirty and we will finish at four thirty.  Going forward we might increase that time to starting at nine and finishing at five because there is still a lot of work to be done.    Yes, so Mr Opperman we will come back on Monday.    Okay on Monday we will start at nine thirty.    Yes okay, so we are going to adjourn for today and we will resume on Monday at nine thirty.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 11 MARCH 2019
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chair.  Today we will be presenting the evidence of Mr Opperman.    Should we finish in time we will immediately get to the evidence of the next witness who is Mr Bester.    Chair before I ask Mr Bester to take the oath may I indicate what documentation we will utilise to present his evidence?   The first is the bundle comprising his statement which is marked U8.    8.    U8.    Yes it is the very bundle before you Chair.    Well I am not too sure why mine is marked U8 yours is marked 9.    Yes.  It is File 9 but …    But U.    Yes.    Chair if I may quickly orientate you and other interested persons about the contents of that file.  You will see that it begins with an index.    And the first part of the index is the statement of MrOpperman.    It runs from page 1 to page 18.    The statement is fairly short by size only.    But it is extremely voluminous in terms of content and substance.    So we will take a bit time to canvass the contents of thestatement.    And what follows thereafter are annexures.    Described through acronyms GJ01 up to GJ039.  They begin from page 19 up to the end of page 440.  What we asked the administration of the commission to do.    Is to separate each annexure with reference to the file divider.    So that it will be easier for you to simply jump into…    The divided annexures.    Conveniently.    And we asked your Registrar to bring along two additional files because there may be some elementary …    Yes.  The first one Chair if I may remind you is the statement of Mr Clinton Ephron who testified on behalf of Glencore.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    All of those files except the statement and annexures to Mr Naga?    Which is U2.    Will be used later by Ms Hofmeyr.    Can I ask you just to lift up.    U2 and put it conveniently next to you.    U2 yes that is the statement of Mr Naga.      We will refer to that file and we will do so when we deal with Mr Opperman’s evidence relating to calculation of penalties. Because you would recall that Mr Mokoena took you through.    The various calculations.    And you asked a number of questions.    And Mr Opperman for his sins.    Fundamentally differs with that calculation.    And he will begin to answer some of the questions raised with Mr Naga and Mokoena about it.    But is this a simple problem of miscalculations or under calculations     And where is the correct intent on that score.   It is not.  Ja but you should not be concerned by…    Its absence for now.    Because what we are going to do is to cross-reference.    But we will …    We might not need it.      I may have to read them out to you.    And indicate where the cross-references would take place.    Chair subject to any further introductory remarks.    Or queries you may have I would ask your registrar to administer the oath.   From Mr Opperman.    Mr Opperman good morning and welcome.    You like me speak a bit softly can you make sure that your voice radiates through the microphone so that all of us can hear you.    Yes.  Can I just begin with formalities?  Before you there is a file which has been submitted to the Chair as Exhibit U8.  And that file begins with your typed statement which you made under oath correct?    Can I ask you to go to that statement and go to page 18.     Can you confirm that the signature at the top end of that statement is yours?    And that is – your statement bear a signature of a commission of oath which you took on the 27 February 2019?    And where did you take that oath?    Witbank?   Emalahlene?    Yes.  Mr Opperman you have had an occasion to read and re-read the contents of that statement, correct?    Do you confirm that they reflect the truth as far as you are concerned and to the best of your knowledge?    Is there any aspect of the statement you would like to reflect on, change or modify before we start with the substance of your evidence?    Alright can you take us first to the body of the statement which deals with penalties as far as …   Yes.    Yes.    Page 9 Chair.      And you say you want to make a modification with reference to paragraph 47 and you have drawn our attention to Annexure GJ18.  Chair you will find that from page 252.     It is that spreadsheet which has different colour codes.      What in that annexure would you like to reflect on?    Yes.    Yes.    That is the sum total of the penalties as calculated and contended for by Glencore at the time?    When there was a debate between it and Eskom about the quantum of the penalties?    How much do you want to change amount?    13.8?    Statement.    So that 16 needs to reflect 13.8 Sir.    So Chair if you can go to page 9 of the statement and go to paragraph 47.  The second last sentence of that paragraph refers to plus minus 16 million.  So Mr Opperman you want us to strike out that amount and replace it with 13.833 million?    Yes.    Well we will get to it in due course but you correct it is plus minus.  We will not hold you to the precise or exact figures.      Alright Mr Opperman the second part of the formalities I would like to deal with is your confirmation that you are currently employed at Eskom?    You confirm in your statement that you have a long history of employment at Eskom and that you started at Eskom fairly early.  When did you start at Eskom?   At Kendal?    Alright.  And you rose through the ranks to become a plant manager?    When was it?    And which plant were you managing at the time?    Was it still at Kendal?    Okay.  You then mention that at some point you movedto Hendrina Power Station?    Alright.    Oh I see I misunderstood your statement then.  So you say you worked in the primary energy division of Eskom?    As what?   And in that position what do you do in relation to the various power stations owned by Eskom?    Can you mention those power stations by name that you were responsible for?    The two power stations that you must have managed that I will deal with in detail in the course of your evidence are Hendrina and Arnot.  In relation to Hendrina when did you begin your management responsibilities particular insofar as they relate to the management of coal supply?    Yes.  And my understanding is that Hendrina procured coal from Optimum Coal Mine?    So that your commencement of the management responsibilities would have coincided with the appointment of Mr Clifton Ephron as the Chief Executive Officer of Optimum Coal Holdings which at the time owned Optimum Coal Mine.  Do you know Mr Clifton Ephron?    Have you come across him in the course of your functions and duties?    Alright. Chair we will get to the interface between the two of them in due course.      And in relation to Arnot when did you commence your management functions and duties?    More or less.   2016?    We will get to how Tegeta was contracted to supply coal to Arnot and we will do so in detail.  But from your perspective and from the moment you became involved in the management of coal supply from Tegeta can you give us a snapshot of how Tegeta supplied coal to Arnot Power Station?  We will get to the details but just to give us some snapshot of how the relationship worked?   Yes.    I have read your statement and it becomes clear when one reads it that there was not a long term supplier coal agreement which before the Chairperson have often been described as the Coal Supply Agreement.  In other words there was no long term coal supply between Eskom and Tegeta for the supply of coal to Arnot Power Station, correct?    Yes.  DO you know anything about Brakfontein which was supplying coal to Eskom?   Yes.  Chair Mr Hofmeyr will deal with the evidence of Mr Opperman insofar as it relates to Brakfontein.    She has assumed the title of responsibility in relation to that contract involving Tegeta.    Yes Chair.  I wonder how you are able to cope with so much files, so much information when we have divided a team – our team acrossdifferent topics.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Opperman can I then take you back to your statement in the context of what you have just told us about your management responsibilities.  I would like to highlight some of them beginning from page 1 of your statement, paragraph 4.  I am going to skip paragraphs 1 to 3 but you are welcome to deal with them if you think I have omitted something of significance to your evidence.  Are you there?    Are you happy that we should go to paragraph 4?    Yes.  Now I would like to highlight some of these functions and duties.  And the first that I would like to pick up is from the first bullet point.  You say part of your duties is to determine and get approval for short, medium and long term coal supply.  First thing first what period do you describe as a short termsupply?    So anything less than three months would be short term?    Okay.  And then what do you cover in that medium term period?  How should we understand it in terms of months?    As ten years.  So anything from one year to ten years would be a medium term, correct?     Oh ja no we working with your experience.      Because you are the one who describes your responsibilities in that way.  I am not suggesting that there is a rule book we just working from your experience.  And long term supply would be generally the CSA that we have looked at?    Yes.  The one that we have the longest period for is the thirty years contract relating to Hendrina.    Ja if I – I think if it is correct it is going for thirty-five years now.    Yes.  And then you say that in regard to those periods type of supply contracts you have to get approval.  Where do you get the approval from?    Yes.    Yes.  Chair you have heard the evidence of Mr Nada I am going to repeat it but I would just like you…    Mr Opperman to inform us about your role in that approval process.  What do you do to get that approval as the coal supply manager of these power stations what do you do?  What physical do you do in order to facilitate that approval process?    I suppose what I want to establish from you is this that there will always be a need identified by a power station about its requirements relating to coal supply, correct?    YEs.    Yes.  Do you play any role in the identification of a need?    Alright and once the need has been identified and quantified then there will be a process for giving effect to it through a process of either procurement of coal from different coal suppliers or through some short term agreements.  Correct?    Do you play any role in the process?    To give effect to the procurement before the agreement?    Alright and once the formal procurement process has been completed there will be an execution of an agreement between Eskom and a supplier?    Do you play any role in that regard?    Well look at what you say in the second bullet point.  You say that one of your responsibilities is to manage commercial and legal aspects of existing Coal Supply Agreements.    Yes.  That is a short hand for compliance obligations by suppliers?    And Eskom and that is a heavy responsibility, because often than not there is always a continuing dispute between Eskom and its suppliers relating to coal quality and coal quantity supply issues.  Correct?    Yes.  Just take us through what happens on the ground about how these disputes arise and how do you yourself become involved in trying to resolve these disputes.   Yes.  You have given us a bit of detail there.  I would like to understand where do you fit in, in that detail, you as Mr Opperman.    So you manage that whole scheme of detecting short supply and imposition of penalties arising from short supply?    Yes and the same thing will be the case and it will be your responsibility when it comes to coal quality supply concerns that require imposition of penalties by Eskom?  In other words you will play the same role?    Indeed.  So you take responsibility for identifying the nature and extent of coal quality problems and you take responsibility for the calculation of penalties that Eskom will impose and I understand that although you yourself may not do the mathematics you take final responsibility for the numbers arising from the mathematics?    Yes.  I understand.  There will be what do you call, coal scientists from Eskom who would go through the coal quality problems.  There may wellbe even your Finance Division who will look at the numbers and come to you with some number and you agree to implement the number?    Yes.  Other than yourself doing all of those things relating to the two mines that you manage and we know that one of them is Optimum Coal Mine would there be any other person who would do the calculations relating to penalties?    Yes.  Mr Opperman let me give you some indication of why I have asked you these questions and your responsibilities.  The Chairperson has said a lot about the calculation and imposition of penalties relating to Optimum Coal Mine which ultimately led to the declaration of hardship and business rescue of Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd.  You are aware of that history.  Correct?    And ultimately the amount that was sought to be imposed in the beginning.  I am talking about June 2015 was in the order of 2.5 billion.  Are you aware of that amount?    Yes and finally when Optimum Coal Mine was taken over by Tegeta the amount reduced to 255 million cash payment.  Are you aware of that history?   Yes.  Those are the two points or the penalties.  In your statement you make it quite clear that you disagreed with the first leg of the penalties.  We will get to that part of your evidence, but you confirm for now that you disagreed with the calculation of the penalties of R2.1 billion.  Correct?    Yes.    Yes, but.    We will get to the details on how the calculation was done, but as far as you are aware you came to the conclusion that a justifiable amount of the penalties that Eskom could lawfully impose on your interpretation of the agreement was in the order of 720 million?   I understand.    Yes.    Yes.    Up until April 2013?    And on that calculation you came to that number of R720-odd million.  Correct?    Ja.    Yes.   Yes.    And that is really the point of the questions.  That you do one calculation give your role and official responsibilities in Eskom.  You arrive at one figure.  Someone else does a calculation, arrive at a totally different figure.  I would like you when we get to that point of your evidence to give some explanation of the differences, if any.    Okay.    It was the same figure?    Okay, thank you.  Then I can take you back to your statement and reflect on some of the responsibilities that you outline on page 2?  You say and I am reading from the second bullet point at the top of page 2 that you manage coal quality in terms of the CSA.  Correct?    And so in that debate around coal quality issues that will be your management responsibility?    Alright and then in the fourth bullet point from the top you say, you also identify and manage coal supply and cost risk.  Can I ask you toexplain to us precisely what do you do in that regard and I am interested in the management of the cost risk?    Okay and to re-orientate you on the facts in this case relating to that official responsibility you are aware that coal supplied to Arnot from Optimum Coal Mine by Tegeta was transported by road?    And that would have been part and parcel of managing that risk of delivery from Optimum Coal Mine to Arnot?    From your memory or experience what is the distance between Optimum Coal Mine and Arnot Power Station?    Yes and so Eskom would pay not only for the actual price of the coal per ton, but it will also pay transport costs?    Yes.  Are you able to recall off hand what would have been the average of the transport costs relating to the Short Term Supply Agreement between Tegeta and Eskom to supply coal to Arnot?   Yes.    Alright.  The next responsibility I would like you to explain to is I think the fifth from the bottom where you say, you manage CSA Accounts.  Do you see that?    What do you do in that regard?    Do you see the fifth bullet point from the bottom on page 2 of your statement?    You say part of your responsibilities include themanagement of Coal Supply Agreement Accounts.    Yes.  Would that be invoices from the suppliers?    And if there are queries you will query them?    And I suppose if there are no queries you will certify them for payment?    And the last responsibility I would like you to explain forus is the one that follows thereafter.  You say you liaise with power station management, internal supply personnel, other Eskom clients and Industry Committees.  You see that?    Yes.  Insofar as liaison with the power station management is concerned can you explain to us what do you do?    So that if there are problems in relation to the power stations regarding their requirement you will be someone who is informed about them and you will be someone who would be able to deal would them in general terms?   Yes and insofar as your interface with Eskom’s clients and Industry Committees are concerned what do you do?  Who are these clients more or less?  Just categorisation of them quite quickly.    Alright.  So is if fair if we were to strike out that word clients and replace it with suppliers?    Okay.  We have now.    Yes Chair.    Yes. After Eskom    After Eskom, clients.    Indeed.    Because Eskom’s clients would generally municipalities and consumers of electricity, Mr Opperman?    Alright.  We have an appreciation of your rules and responsibilities and you confirm in paragraph 5 that you report to Mr Petros Mazibuko, who is the General Manager of Coal Operations.  Correct?    And all of these reporting lines are within the Primary Energy Division of Eskom?    Okay and Mr Mashigo leads that division as I recall?    Yes.  Now in paragraph 6 you explain the nature and extent of the evidence you have conversed in your statement.  I am not going to deal with it unless you want to reflect on any part of it.  For my part I confirm that I am interested in your evidence insofar as it relates to Hendrina Power Station and Arnot Power Station and you have explained when you started your management responsibilities in relation to the two.  Unless there is anything that you would like to raise I will skip that paragraph and go to paragraph 9.  You mentioned the name of Mr George van der Merwe who was the Chief Operating Officer of Optimum Coal Mine.  Do you see that?    Yes.  The Chairperson has not heard the evidence of Mr van der Merwe who is the COO of that mine, but has heard the evidence of Mr Ephron and Mr Ephron mentioned your name in the context of negotiations thatfollowed the Cooperation Agreement.  That you were part and parcel of the Negotiation Team for Eskom.  Do you confirm that?    Did Mr van der Merwe take part in those negotiations as far as you are aware?    Of Tegeta?    Oh, I see.  Alright. I was a bit confused.  Can I take you to page 3 of your statement?  Under the heading background to Hendrina you give us some historical detail.  Most of that has been dealt with by other witnesses.  I will move quite quickly through the paragraphs if you do not mind, but again the qualification is that if you want to say something more please do.  At paragraph 11 and you confirm that that mine that is the mine which was supplying Hendrina it began on a specific pricing structure.  It was a Cost Plus Mine Supply Structure.  Do you confirm that?    Do you know when it changed?    Yes and it became a Fixed Price type of structure for the supply of coal?    Okay.  Chair I think they have explained the differenceto you.  I am not going to ask Mr Opperman.    To deal with the differences.    Alright.  Mr Opperman you explain in paragraph 15 something relating to the coal quality that was procured from Optimum Coal Mine.  Do you see that/    You say that   Okay.  Chair you have heard enough of the evidence about what abrasive index is.  I am not going to.    Thank you Chair.  I think we have a fair understanding Mr Opperman of what abrasive index is.  So you can assume that we understand something about what it means, but what I would like you to explain to us is what is the typical implication to the operation of the mine, sorry the power station when coal has this high abrasive index?  How does it affect the power station?    Yes.  So the higher the abrasive index the greater and faster the wear and tear of the various parts of the power station takes place?    Indeed.    So as the coal with high abrasive index moves through various parts during the combustion process those parts wear quickly?    And there is a need for maintenance or replacement?    And that is the reason why you impose penalties/    Okay.  Now I understand.  I am going to get to that issueof the abrasive index with reference to an arbitration and settlement agreement that Eskom had with Optimum Coal Mine and you are aware of it?    We will get to that issue later on, because there are questions of penalties there.  You remember that?    Alright.  Now you have already dealt with paragraph 16.     You say ultimately there was a settlement agreement and you refer to the settlement agreement in paragraph 17.  Do you confirm that?     I would like to take you to the settlement agreement if you don’t mind, it is from page 171 of U8.  Are you there Mr Opperman?     Yes, you will see that the heading of that document is “Settlement of Arbitration and Second Addendum to the Hendriena Coal Supply Agreement”, do you see that?    So that the purpose of that settlement was not only tosettle the dispute relating to the short supply of coal by Hendriena at that point in time, but also to amend the CSA via the second addendum, do you agree with that interpretation?       Okay now let’s look at Clause 1.3 on page 173, that clause it’s a definition clause making it quite clear that the document we are looking at it’s the second amendment to the SCA and that’s why it’s called the second addendum, correct?     Now you will see that paragraph 2.2 on page 174records the history giving rise to the second addendum, and the amendment to the SCA begin at paragraph 3.1, do you confirm that?    The first amendment related to the coal quantity so there is an amount of R5.5million per ton of coal that’s Optimum Coal Mine agreed to deliver to Eskom.  Mr Ephron explained to the Chairperson the implication of that amendment and I don’t want to take you through it but my recollection is that it was changing the maximum amount that was initially delivered under the SCA, do you agree with that?       Yes so there was a reduction of the amount and the oversimplification of it is that Optimum Coal Mine was quite satisfied that it could not deliver the previous maximum and therefore did not want to incur penalties relating to short supply?     Yes.  Then the next amendment of importance to your evidence begin from page 178.  I have skipped the rest but it’s up to you if you want to bring our attention to other parts of the second addendum.     It’s paragraph 3.3, it talks about the topic of abrasive index, do you see that?     And the amendments are now set out in detail in paragraph 3.3.2, do you see that?     Now can I ask you to take us quickly if you can through these amendments because there is a stepladder like calculation of the abrasive index and the penalties depending on the degree of the calculated indexes, do you see that?     Can I please ask you to explain to us how the penalty model will work under the second addendum.     Yes.     Yes.     So you look not only on a stockpile per day, you look at an average of the stockpiles over a period of seven days?     Yes, okay, for some of us we don’t understand how weighted average work, can you explain to us how do you do your weighting during thisperiod of seven days.     Alright but we know that the importance or the objective of that calculation is to make sure that the index is less than 423.     If it’s more the calculations of penalties begin.     Yes.     Can I stop you there?     I think it’s important to make sure that your evidence is understood by us.  You say that if there is a need to impose penalties, then the penalties will be calculated and it will be levied on a monthly basis.     And the process of levying that penalty is you will do a set-off against invoices.    Yes, so – and that’s important and I would like to make sure that your evidence is clear on that score.  So every month Optimum will send out an invoice for the stockpile delivered and you will look at it and you will say but they are liable to pay a penalty, you will do your calculation and you will set off the amount of the calculated penalties against the invoices and you will pay the net between the invoiced amount and the penalty amount.    Okay and you say you do it on a monthly basis.    Thank you Chair I am going to skip the rest because we can see how the amount increases as the AI goes up.  Unless you want to make any comment on it, but what I would like to take you to, of relevance to the penalty, is paragraph 3.3.3, do you see it?    Can I ask you what is the implication of that paragraph to the penalties Eskom would be entitled to impose?    So it’s possible that although the baseline for calculation is R1.23 per ton that Rand amount may be escalated higher depending on the methodology set out in the CSA?    Yes, now Mr Opperman I am going to take you to paragraph 3.4.3 on page 179 and it talks to the question that the Chairperson has posed to you, on my reading of that paragraph it is quite clear that there is an obligation for Eskom to advise Optimum Colliery on a month to month basis about the nature and extent of the penalties it intends to impose correct?   And you do so with reference to providing details including the calculation of those penalties, correct?    Including the laboratory tests that you have at your disposal concerning the level of the AI that you may have picked up from the stockpile supplied, correct?    It’s an elaborate process, and it seems to me that you are at the front line of making sure that this process is complied with, correct?    Given this elaborate process and the need for a monthly imposition, sorry firstly monthly calculation and monthly communication of the funds imposed to the relevant mine why would there be a debate in due course as between Optimum and Eskom about these penalties, because it seems to me that this clause isdesigned to anticipate those debates and resolve them as and when they happen, do you agree?    But why would then be such a historical debates of two years worth penalties, in the light of this matrix of dispute resolution?    Thank you Chair.  There are two other additional points I would like to draw your attention to relating to this second addendum, the first is at page 179 paragraph 3.5.1 do you see that?    It’s about the base price for the coal supplied, or to be supplied, you see that it changes now to become 115, R115 per ton.    Yes, and it will begin from 11 April 2011, correct?    Yes, no I understand that, from that date going forward you will obviously apply whatever escalation.    But there’s a base price, alright.  The next part relates to paragraph 3.6.1 and it’s going to become important as we explore your evidence in two ways, firstly it seems to me when I read this clause and others that support the philosophy of it, that the parties were well aware and were concerned about the abrasive index of the coal stock from that mine, from Optimum Coal Mine, and they wanted to do their best efforts to see what were the reasons for it, and how they can resolve it, do you agree with that?   Yes, and the parties committed themselves to how they will deal with it, in fact they formed the Sterling Committee, correct?    Were you part of it or were you not there at the time?    Yes, from anecdotal evidence you could have obtained do you know whether the process to investigate this problem about coal from Optimum was taken further as between the parties?    Okay, Chair I am going to leave paragraph 4.1 and 4.2on page 181 because it will become relevant when we deal with the third addendum, so may I ask you to note that there is still that part of 4.1 and 4.2 but it becomes relevant when we deal with the third addendum.  And the last part Mr Opperman is the lawyer’s clause where the parties agree to abandon whatever disputes or contentions they may have had and that is paragraph 6.1, do you see that?    Okay.  Subject to any other issue you would like to bring to our attention I would like to go back to your statement and pick up your evidence from paragraph 18, are you there?  Page 4 paragraph 18 of your statement.    You talk about the fact that Glencore acquired Optimum in 2012, correct?    And as a result of that acquisition the parties signed a third addendum, correct?    And you say the purpose of the third addendum was to delete paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the second addendum, correct?     Chair it’s in that context and it was for that reason that I skipped paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the second addendum.     If you don’t mind I would like to go back to it to see precisely what is the effect of the third addendum on those two paragraphs of the second addendum.  Chair you will find the third addendum on ...(intervention)    No I think it comes after 171, it will be at 187.    It begins from page 188, do you see that, Mr Opperman are you at page 188?    Okay, can you confirm that that is the third addendum that you referred to in paragraph 18 of your statement?    Yes.  You see that it was signed by Mr – or Ms KirinMaharajah on the 11th of February 2013 on behalf of Eskom if you go to page 190, correct?    Do you know who signed it on behalf of Optimum Coal Holdings and Optimum Coal Mine Pty Limited seems to be the same signature.      Yes.    The substance of that third addendum you will find it on page 189, do you see that?    And paragraph 3.1.1 can you read it for us?   Yes.  So Chair what we did for our part is to go back to paragraphs 4.1.1, sorry 4.1 and 4.2 which are on page 181.    And we simply ...(intervention)     Crossed – a red line across those two clauses Chair.    Ja, we will say deleted Chair.    We will suggest that you delete it.    Yes, in terms of 3.1.1 of the 3rd Addendum.    And the importance of this Mr Opperman if you would recall is to make sure that the original coal supply agreement, as amended by the second – sorry the first and second addenda would continue to operate as they were, correct?    Because the deleted 4.1 and 4.2 impose the obligations on the parties to relook at those clauses of the original CSA and to see how they can restate them, do you agree?    Yes.    Yes, and the parties, you were under obligation as Eskom to produce the first draft?    And you did not?    And this is the reason why these clauses were deleted, alright.    Alright, so we’re now operating in that world of CSA original, first and second addendum.    And third addendum of course.    Okay.    I think Mr Opperman it was along answer to a simple question which you had previously answered.  Mr Opperman you begin to tell us what problems Eskom experienced one Glencore took over the mine.  You do so from paragraph 19.  I am at page 4 of your statement.    Are you at page 4 of your statement?    In paragraph 9 you say   Of course you can talk about your knowledge of the coal quality on size from Optimum Coal Mine when you took over the managementresponsibility relating to Hendrina Power Station, correct?    Should we read that paragraph to say that you beginning to talk about coal quality sizing issues from the date you took over the management of Hendrina Mine?    Yes, yes.  And you begin to issue compliance or non-compliant notices of your own immediately after you took over management of the mine?    I would like to refer to one of two of them and the first one is the one that you refer to in paragraph 20.  Chair it is Annex GJ5.  You will find it from page 191 if I am correct.  Are you there Mr Opperman?    The date of that letter is 7 August 2012, do you see that?    And it is written by someone called H Mokoena.    Do you know that person?    Okay subject to your guidance I am merely going to draw your attention to the second last paragraph.  Can I ask you to read it?    Do you know what happened after this letter was sent by Eskom?  Did the meeting that is contemplated in the paragraph you have just readever take place?    Anyway you refer to your working group and you say there was a report issued by that working group.  Chair I am at paragraph 22 of Mr Opperman’s statement on page 4.    And you confirm in paragraph 22 Mr Opperman that there was a report produced by the working group and you annex a copy of that report from page 198.  Are you there?    I am afraid I have looked at this report and I cannot understand precisely what it is supposed to convey because it conveys sampling results I am not too sure what they mean.  Maybe you would be able to help us on how we should approach the results recorded in this report?  Does it suggest or does it not suggest that there was some solution to the coal sizing problem from Optimum CoalMine?  Are you able to help us in that regard?    Please do.    Yes Chair.    You will see Chair that it gives you a background which I do not understand and on page 199 it gives you the planting – the sampling results through all sorts of graphs and numbers that I do not understand. Are you able to help us how we should approach this document?   Please do.    Chair can I follow up on the question that you have posed?   Now Mr Opperman we now have a study which explains the reasons why there is this degradation of coal quality on sizing at least.  You now know the reasons as Eskom, correct?    You now have the reason, you have an explanation about this coal quality problems.    You cannot speculate about what the reasons are you have established them through this study, correct?   What happened after this study?  Was there any improvement or did matters get worse?    Yes.    Well can I ask you to go to page 205 because the explanation that you give does not explain to me why Eskom wrote the letter on page 5.  That letter suggest that Eskom was still concerned about the coal quality.    And Eskom called upon Optimum Coal Mine at that point in time to take remedial measures.    And it did not do so.    Yes. And if I may ask you lead – to read the second last paragraph.    Yes.    And that letter was written by Pam Pillay on the 23 April 13.  Do you see that?    22nd April 2013.  And that is more or less eight or so months after you had received that email from Mr Riaan Du Plooy. So there was thisgrey spirit of eight months where Eskom was told about the reasons for the degradation and Eskom called for remedial action and Glencore did not do that.    Sorry Optimum did not do that at that point in time, correct?    Yes.  Now before we go to lunch – sorry to tea can I ask you to see the reply of Optimum Coal Mine to that letter of Pillay.  Chair you will find the reply on page 207 and 208.      Yes.    One last question.      Can you confirm that the letter beginning at page 207 is the reply by Optimum Coal Mine to the notice given by Eskom on page 205?    In fact it comes a day later.    Yes.  Chair that will be a convenient stage to take the tea adjournment.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Opperman we were at page 207 which is the response of Optimum Coal Mine.  You see it?    I would like you to deal with paragraph 3 of that letter.    Yes.    Yes.  That part of the letter was also dealt with by Mr Clinton Ephron and he made it quite clear that there was no way Optimum Coal Mine could meet the sizing specification in the Coal Supply Agreement.  They were not realistic.  That was his evidence and then he also dealt with paragraph 4 on page 208 and you will see that that paragraph calls for renegotiation of the specifications of the coal quality sizing in terms of those clauses of the first addendum.  Now it is quite clear and I would like your comment on this that at least as at April 2013 the coal coming from Optimum Coal Mine was no longer suitable in terms of sizing at least for Hendrina Power Station and therefore the supplier took the view that there was a need to renegotiate questions of sizing.  Do you accept that?    Yes.  What was Eskom’s response to OCM’s view that they were conducting operations according to best practice?  They could no longer meet the specifications under the agreement and they called for a renegotiation to see whether or not new specifications can be agreed.  How did you respond to that?    What was the upshot of those negotiations?    Yes.    Yes.    So should the Chairperson approach your evidence on the basis that the sizing problems relating to Optimum Coal Mine was not resolved by the parties.  In fact it continued?   And I am suggesting to you that it continued throughout the contractual relationship between Eskom and Optimum.  That issue about size continued?    What do you mean there was significant improvement?    Alright.  Thank you.  Can I then take you back to your statement at page 5?  You begin a new topic relating to the declaration of hardship by Optimum Coal.  Again the Chairperson has heard evidence relating to how OptimumCoal Mine declared hardship and the result of it was that the parties decided to conclude a Cooperation Agreement.  You are aware of that development?    Yes.  Can I ask you to deal with paragraph 25?  You may have dealt with parts of it when you testified about some significant improvement to the sizing problem, but just to complete your evidence can I ask you to deal with paragraph 25?    Yes and that letter of 21 August 2013 is on page 2010, but it seems to me when I read paragraph 4 of that letter that at best for the parties there was a mere proposal by Optimum Coal concerning the sizing issues and that is as far as matters went at that point in time.  In other words there was no agreement.  There was a mere proposal between the parties?   Correct.  Alright, then you take the issue further from paragraph 26 when you talk about reference to arbitration.  Do you see that?    But that arbitration to be clear is on a different matter.  It is on a hardship dispute declared by Optimum Coal.  Correct?    And do you know what the reason for that hardship declared by Optimum Coal was?    Yes.  So the parties resolved to go to arbitration to resolve the sizing issue arising from declaration of hardship and you know Mr Opperman that that arbitration was not finally concluded through an award of the Arbitrator.  The parties agreed to settle the arbitration dispute.  You know that?    Was suspended?    Yes.   Yes.  In your statement you refer to the statement you refer to the Cooperation Agreement.  Chair we have looked at it.  I would simply want to direct the attention of Mr Opperman to parts of it, but we looked at it in detail when Glencore’s witness testified.    On Mr Opperman’s documentation you will find it at page 212.    Mr Opperman are you at page 213?   You will see that that page records the basis of the Cooperation Agreement.  You will find it in paragraph 3 on page 213.  Are you there?    And then if you go to the next page and I am referring to Clause 5.2 you will see that there is an agreement to suspend the hardship arbitration.  Do you see that?    And if you go to paragraph 5.1 on the same page you will see that there is a constitution of the negotiating teams and your name comes up in paragraph 5.4.  Do you see that?    And lastly if you go to page 216, I will skip the rest, you will see that there is a timetable on various matters that the parties had to negotiate and must agree by a certain specific date.  The one which is of importance to you wouldbe the date by which a new Coal Supply Agreement ought to be negotiated and if necessary concluded.  That would be the one March 2015.  Do you see that?    Mr Opperman we know that you are part and parcel of the negotiating team.  Correct?    Can you just explain from your perspective whether the negotiations were successful or not?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and your sounding board was the people who operated the power station?    So you would go and talk to them about what the negotiations were all about and they will tell you their requirements?    And you take those requirements back to the negotiations?   Alright.  We now know that as a result of that process of negotiations the parties decided to formulate a draft fourth addendum.  Correct?    What I want to confirm with you is to the extent that the draft fourth addendum dealt with questions of price for the supply of coal to Hendrina you would have received the import from those who operated Hendrina at that point in time about whether or not they were comfortable with that level of a proposed price?    Yes.    [Intervenes].    Ja.    I understand.  The price is the other side of the coin relating to coal quality?    I mean the two go.    Hand in hand and what I want to understand from you is on both scores that is price and quality you always had a sounding board from themines?    The power stations?    The power stations, yes.  Correct.    So whatever was reflected on the draft fourth addendum reflected the level of comfort by those who operated the mine?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  You explain a lot about the negotiation process.  I am not going to take you through them, because that is not the point.  The point is that the negotiations resulted in some kind of an understanding as between the Negotiating Teams and that is to formulate a draft fourth addendum?    We will get to it in due course hopefully, but for now after the fourth addendum was presented in draft form those who were negotiating sought toget a mandate from decision makers in Eskom in order to authorise the execution of the fourth addendum?    And in your bundle of documents you enclose a submission that was made to the Board of Directors.  You will find it Chair on page 231.    Before I take you to that Board’s submission I would like you to explain something to us in your statement.  It is in paragraph 35 on page 8.    Are you there?    Yes.  You will see there you introduce a discussion you had with the Hawks?    About two letters.  Can you indicate to us how theHawks sought to interview you about these two letters?  What were so important about these two letters that the Hawks decided to interview you about them?  If you want to look at those two letters you will find them from page 226 of your bundle.  I have looked at those letters from page 226.  I must confess I do not know why these documents would be so serious and of interest to the Hawks that they would want to interview you on them.    Mr Opperman you like me have looked at these two letters.  They merely record failure by Optimum Coal to meet its contractual obligations relating to the supply…     Ja, Mr Opperman you, like me, have looked at these two letters, they merely record failure by Optimum Coal to meet its contractual obligations relating to the supply of coal, correct?      These letters set out what has always been Eskom’s position?      What was so unique about them?      You can’t say.  Alright, can you go to the Boardsubmission on page 31, 231, you have read this Board submission before, correct?      Did you make any input to this submission?      Yes, in other words parts of this document reflects your input in the negotiations.      Right, I’m going to reflect on two parts of this, maybe more but for now I would like you to go to page 232, and I am going to read the paragraph beginning with PED. “Primary Energy Division now requires a mandate to conclude negotiations with Optimum to ensure security of supply to Hendriena.” Do you see that?      From your perspective that must have been a legitimate reason why you sought a mandate to conclude the negotiations, because the security of supply for coal to your power station is a very vital part of your business operations.      Yes, and I continue. “Hence it is requested that the Board of Directors resolves that Primary Energy Division is mandated to conclude negotiations with Optimum CoalMine, to ensure security of supply for Hendriena Power Station ...” And you put something in brackets  “...February 2015 money values for a CV of 23.5 [I don’t know what that means] dry basis from 1 April 2015 to 31st December 2018 and to include this new coal supply agreement the following available rights to be exercised by  31st December 2015.” Do you see that?      There’s a price point that you reflect there of R442 per ton, do you see that?     It seems to me that a request for mandate in regard to that price point was something that you as negotiator supported.      You were quite comfortable with that price?      Yes.  Can I take you to page 233, and ...(intervention)       233.      The first bullet point there, and let me read it out to you and ask for your comment.   “Primary Energy Division is mandated to negotiate with Optimum for the full Optimum reserve/resource and production for Eskom supplied by Hendrienaand for other Eskom power stations including but not limited to Tutuka and Arnot Power Stations should it be possible to achieve an average cost per ton at or below 500 per ton from one 1 April 2015 to 31st December 2018 and at a cost below R527 per ton from 1 January 2019 up to 31 December 2035.” Do you see that?      What I would like you to help us with is that this point at which you seek this mandate reflects on two things, the one is the supply to Hendriena during the lifetime of the existing CSA which we know was going to come to an end around 31 December 2018.     But you were also looking for a mandate to look beyond that period, correct?      And you said the second leg of the future period you’re looking would begin from 1 January 2019 to 31st December 2035, do you see that?      More or less 15 years going forward.      I read this to mean that you were so concerned about the security of supply concerning coal from Optimum Mine that you wanted to make sure that you secure it for the lifetime of that mine, correct?      Yes.  And your security of supply concerns also went beyond Hendriena, you also wanted to secure supply to other mines, correct?     Yes, yes.  You know by now that that did not happen, correct?      You are someone who is in charge of the management of mining operations and you are part and parcel of this recommendation, and this recommendation is not endorsed by decision makers in Eskom.  How did that impact on your responsibility as to properly manage Arnot and Hendriena?      And with the greatest of respect it is not in hindsight, it was clearly foreseeable that if you lose volumes from Hendriena which was transporting stockpile via a conveyer belt you would have to procure them elsewhere.      And that will be increased logistical transportation costs.  It was so foreseeable that either you have this, if you don’t have this you aregoing to have the worst, correct?    Yes.    Yes, and I know that you are not a Board member ofEskom and I know that you are not a member of the Senior Executives of Eskom, but on your evidence, on your approach I suggest to you that it is reckless in the extreme for decision makers not to adopt this recommendation unless they have something much better that can compete with this recommendation.  What is your comment to that proposition?    Yes, anyway you know now that this mine as we speak today it is no longer operational, correct?    And Hendriena is no longer sourcing its coal from Optimum Coal Mine.    And that mine is just like a scrap yard, correct?    So as we speak Hendriena would be sourcing its coal from elsewhere?    Do you know where is it getting its coal?    Chair through you can I ask Mr Opperman to do a calculation for us, to see precisely what is the cost implication for procuring coal from other sources to Hendriena, I would like you to do that calculation for us to see whetheror not there was value for money for Eskom to reject this proposal and to find itself as we speak in a totally different set of circumstances for procuring coal far away from the power station.  Are you able to do that for us?    For now I will work with that figure of R450 per ton, going forward, alright.  I will come back to this figure at some point, because we know that this request for a mandate was not given by the Board of Eskom.  I am going to jump ahead to the next development that happened after this draft 4th Addendum was not approved by the Board.   You will get that next development at page 249.  Chair you would recall that Mr Ephron dealt with this in the context of his evidence to the effect that when he was told that the 4th Addendum was not approved by the Board he thenapproached Mr Malefe to try and understand why and thereafter when he was told that Eskom was not happy with the 4th addendum and in fact they were not going to sign it he decided to renegotiate by relooking at the cost that was quoted in the 4th Addendum and reduced it by means of the proposal set at page 249, and I would like to deal with that proposal from your perspective Mr Opperman, you attached this proposal in your bundle of documents, correct?    Now I take it therefore that you are aware of this proposal?    How did you become aware of it?    Yes, so it’s fair to approach your evidence on the basis that you received it at a point in time when Mr Ephron revived the negotiations, correct?    The date is 30 June 2015, I am going to skip it, and the    That’s a significant revision from the price proposed in the 4th Addendum, do you see that?    Indeed and we will get to that.  But for now insofar as price is concerned there is a proposed reduction on my calculation of something in the order of R142 per ton.    Compared to the previous price proposed in the 4th Addendum.  On price alone that reduction is almost a third of the price previously agreed, do you agree with it?   Yes.  We will come to the core quality parameters because I would like you to help us.  And then you will see that there is a second price proposed for what is called the second period, you will find it in the second bullet under the heading or column “price”.  From 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2023 in the second period the base price as at the base date will be R570 per ton, do you see that?    This of course as a second period is the one that comes after the initial period of the CSA comes to an end, correct?    So it’s again a futuristic view that Glencore adopts that we would like to supply to secure a security of supply beyond the existing CSA, correct?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Alright, then there’s another part of this offer which is quite interesting, and I would like you to comment on it.  If you go to page 2050 I will skip the coal quantity which is expressed in the first bullet point, I will go to the second bullet point.  It says Eskom shall be entitled by no later than 31 December 2015 to implement and conclude a tender process to obtain a bona fide written offers from third party suppliers, do you see that?     It seems to me that the implication of this clause Mr Opperman is to offer an opportunity to Eskom to go and test the market.   On whether they can get a better offer, correct?    And normally that’s how public entities such as Eskom operate, you go out to the market to test whether or not there is a competitive cost effective and transparent deal, correct?    If you were part of the negotiations would you have supported this part of the offer, to go out to the market to test it?    Yes.  And then the third bullet point tells us what will happen if Eskom had gone out to the market and had received a better offer, Optimum would be obliged to – or will be entitled to match that offer, correct?    Yes, subject to the question of coal quality what is your view of this offer?    Yes, you know that this proposal was not accepted by the decision makers in Eskom?   Were you told why it was not accepted?    As you sit there in the witness box with hindsight, because I believe that’s a term that you used before, were you able to get the reasons why this offer was not accepted by the decision makers in Eskom?    You see what troubles me is this, that this offer contemplated a genuine procurement and competitive proposal, out there in the market, what happened later is something else, Eskom agrees to cede the shares in Optimum Coal Pty Limited to a third party who is Tegeta, without any competitive bidding process to supply coal to that mine, to that power station.    I’m sure when those who made the decision come before this commission will ask questions around how they decided to implement adifferent strategy of cession, from your perspective did things change in relation to Optimum Coal Mine after this offer was rejected?  When I say things changed I refer to coal quality, did that  change?    The price remained the same?    And that was about less than 200 per ton?    I’d like to take you back to your statement, and Chair I am at page 8, you deal with the question of the rejection of both the 4 th Addendum andthe subsequent offer that we have deal with a moment ago, from paragraph 39 of your statement, correct?    And in paragraph 42 you say I do not know why Mr Brian Malefe made this decision to stop the settlement process as I did not have any personal discussion with him regarding the matter prior to this decision.  You see that?  From your perspective did anyone ever consult with you to tell you that they are going to reject the 4th Addendum proposal and the proposal from Mr Clinton Ephron of June 15?  Were you consulted on this score?    And then in paragraph 43 you say that the cancellation of the cooperation agreement reinstated the hardship arbitration, dated 23 June 2015, do you see that?    Alright, before I get to paragraph 44 can I ask you this,do you know what was the upshot of that arbitration on hardship?    What happened to that arbitration which was reinstated after the cancellation of the cooperation agreement?  Remember the 4 th Addendum is not approved.    Remember the arbitration was suspended.  Because of the lack of approval of the fourth addendum and the cancellation of the cooperation agreement the arbitration is revived.    Mr Clinton told us a lot about it.  Mr Ephron rather told us a lot about it.  What I want to understand from you is do you know what ultimately happened to that arbitration?    Yes.  In – from paragraph – so let me go to paragraph 44 which I skipped.  There you said there was a meeting between Mr Molefe, Mr Mobweni and Mr Glassenberg and Mr Ephron on 11 June 2015.  Following this meeting OCM made a revised offer which was sent to Eskom on 30 June 2015 and that is the offer we have looked at, correct?    Alright so we can comfortably go to the next topic you deal with which is your topic on the imposition of penalties, do you see that?    You start with the topic from paragraph 45.  In paragraph46 you refer to a Mr Christo Kruger of the Primary Energy Division as someone who made the calculation of the penalties imposed, correct?    What I find interesting with that part of your statement you say “I do not know how Mr Christo Kruger calculated the penalty amount and or how it was applied to the CSA and or the relevant addendums to the CSA.”  Do you see that?    Can I ask you some few questions around that?  We have looked at your mandate.  We have looked at your job description and you haveexplained to us how they work.  And the sum total of what you explained to us is that you were someone who was responsible for the calculation of penalties including the input from the scientists and the input from the financial division, correct?    Why would Mr Christo Kruger take it upon himself to do the calculation on penalties that ultimately were imposed?    No, no, no.  Look at your statement.  We now know that for the – when the penalty is imposed for the first time it is in the amount of 2.1 million.    And we know that it is around June, July, August when the penalties were imposed?    In the order of 2.1 billion.    Correct.  At that point in time your view is you do not agree with Mr Christo Kruger’s calculation because you took a view that on the interpretation of the agreement that amount was too high in 2015 because that reference point of 2015 is the last point at which the penalties are calculated in the order of 2.1 billion, correct?   If you take that reference point you came to a totally different conclusion that the calculation of 2.1 billion was too excessive.  In fact you came to the conclusion that the appropriate amount was something in the order of R720 million give or take rands and cents, correct?    Indeed, indeed.    Indeed.  So to answer the Chairperson’s point and thisis the reason why we called your evidence here is to tell us that as far as Eskom is concerned there was not a consistency of position and that point in time about the nature and extent of the penalty it ought to impose?    Can I read this and ask you to confirm before we go there?    Well can I…    Chair that is important.      You know Mr Opperman I do not know what is the job description and official responsibilities of Mr Kruger but from your perspective I know that your job description includes the management of commercial and legal aspects relating to the CSA, correct?    So that the very issue relating to the calculation of the penalties, the very issue relating to the interpretation of a contract on how penalties must be calculated falls squarely within your responsibilities?    Whatever interpretation you place on the CSA is an interpretation which in all probabilities Eskom will be guided by you?   I understand.    And that is a point of the enquiry that you come to the conclusion on the interpretation of the agreement. That the good estimate of the penalty is R720 odd million on your own interpretation of that agreement, correct?    Someone we do not know on his own interpretation of the agreement comes to a totally different conclusion.   On the interpretation of the agreement that Eskom should impose a penalty of R2.1 billion, correct?    The point of the inquiry is this, did anyone consult with you before this R2.1 billion penalty was imposed?    Someone does not consult with you to impose a penalty of R2.1 billion on a matter that falls squarely within your official responsibilities?    And I appreciate – I hope that you understand why this line of inquiry is important.    Because if it is Eskom’s position that penalties of R2.1 billion must be imposed that position must maintain regardless of who owns the mine,do you agree with that?    Despite your interpretation of the agreement and despite the fact that you contend on your interpretation for imposition of a lowered penalty Eskom goes ahead that I will impose a penalty of R2.1 billion.  That position must remain regardless of who owns the mine.      It does not matter whether it is owned by Glencore or by Tegeta?    Before we go to lunch can I ask you this for your comment?  Why questions of penalty suddenly become important and they reduce fundamentally to almost a hundredth when the mine is owned by Tegeta?  Why does the penalty amount changes and comes to R250 odd million when the mine is now owned by Tegeta?    You became aware of that settlement agreement when?    Gee yes.  Chair before we go for lunch can I ask Mr Opperman to confirm some sure things?    They are common cause but they lead me to the next topic.  You confirm that as a result of the imposition of the penalties on Optimum Coal Mine it went under business rescue, correct?    And that is a matter which ought to have been of concern to Eskom?    And to you as the operate – as the manager of the various mining holdings of Eskom – sorry power stations of Eskom?    Yes. Chair is this a convenient time to go for a tea break?    Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Thank you Chair.  Mr Opperman can I ask you to reflect on the following concluding remarks relating to your calculation of the penalties?  Do you know that Mr Nagar did his own calculation of the penalties?    Yes.  I am sure you were not aware that he testified about those calculations and the amount that he said he supported gave theChairperson some details.  Chair I believe that you do have Mr Nagar’s statement.  It is U2 and.    I would ask you to go to SN11B which is that A3 page set of documents Mr Mokoena gave to you.    SN11B.    It is the spreadsheet, but I will just read around.    Thank you Chair.  If you could go to SN11B.  You do not have it Mr Opperman, but I am just going to read out a figure to you and ask you to reflect on some concluding remarks that I would like to make on this topic.  Chair would recall that what he did in relation to that figure he talked about two sets of dates.  The first you will see is the settlement agreement/Optimum letter/CDH Response Letter.    That is the history of the calculation which he tracked and traced from the letter of demand sent by CDH on behalf of Eskom and then he reflected on a date 2017/03/03 and he calls it updated penalty master.    And then he said the amount that he was willing and prepared to support is R1.166 billion which is right at the bottom under the columnupdated penalty master.    Yes.    And he said he was surprised that Eskom was willing to settle at R255 million.    In the light of this figure.    And that this is the amount which Eskom was willing to give up.    In his own words, I think.    If I am not quoting.    Certainly paraphrasing his evidence.    And for your purposes Mr Opperman your colleague Mr Nagar, I think you know him?    Was prepared to support a penalty amount of 1.166 billion.  The concluding remark that I would like you to reflect on and comment about is this.  Did you know that Mr Nagar as at 2017, March had done this calculation and didhe share it with you?    So you are not aware of this?    Okay.  The next concluding remark that I would like you to reflect on is based on your own interpretation of the agreement you arrived an amount of R720-off.  Did you convey that amount to anyone?    R20 million, sorry.  My apologies.  Eskom will kill me.  Did you convey that amount of R720-odd million to anyone in Eskom?   Not.  So what happened you kept it to your own?    Yes.    Yes.    Is that letter in your bundle?    Okay.  If you were to obtain a copy of it in due course could you make it available to us?    Yes.  So what was the significance of that letter?    Yes.    Yes.  So do I then take it that your members that is the Eskom side of the Negotiation Team would have been aware of that letter?    So they would have been aware of the position that you took in relation to the calculation of the penalties?    Yes and finally on this issue you have explained to the Chair how you arrived at that amount and Chair that is the document or the spreadsheet at 253.    Two.    Yes.    To U8.    253.    I would like to.    Thank you Chair.  I would like to draws some conclusions on this, if you do not mind Mr Opperman.  This is your spreadsheet.  Correct?    When did you prepare it?    Alright and what did you do with this spreadsheet after you had prepared it?    [Intervenes].    No, the point is you were not doing anything other than fulfilling your official functions and duties?    Yes and so it would have been a document that on the face of it in your view a reflection of the outcome of your functions and duties?   During the negotiations period?  I take it that you did not prepare it and simply put it in your own file.  You must have done something to execute those functions and duties.    Alright.  Again I would like you to reflect on that issue and come back to us even if it is by way of a formal affidavit.  I am interested in finding out what did you do with the spreadsheet after you had prepared it around 2015.  Chair I have dealt with the question of penalties and subject to your direction I will move on to the next topic.    And that begins Mr Opperman from page 9 paragraph 48.    Yes Chair.    Yes.   Chair we are clear about.    The evidence.  In other words.    It matters not whether he is correct.    It matters not whether his.    Calculations were based on a proper interpretation ofthe agreement.    The point that we sought to make.    Through him is that he was not consulted on a matter that clearly falls within his portfolio.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair and.   Yes.    Chair the [indistinct] we understand for those who will be called to explain to you.    Is this that if they go for 2.1 billion.    In July/August 2015 without even consulting withMr Opperman then it means that they did not do their job properly.  The result of that failure of duty is that you have placed Optimum into business rescue with the drastic consequences that that carried.  On that approach what happened to the arbitration for that 2.1 billion when Tegeta takes over, because once Tegeta takes over we hear nothing about 2.1 billion.    At the arbitration on that score.    Because the only explanation they can give is that business rescue suspended the arbitration.    But we know that the business rescue ended in September 2016.    The arbitration for 2.1 billion would have sat there.   And still continued.    But instead of the arbitration on 2.1 billion.    What happens is the reduction of the penalties.    And those are the inexplicable sets of circumstances.    Which we would like people to explain.   It is for that reason we call Mr Opperman.    We call him to interrogate that issue.  We have his version.    And that is why Chair we would simply suggest that there is something more than a mere miscalculation.    There is something more than a mere.    Advancement of a claim which is not well founded.    Mr Opperman I am going to ask you to go to page 9 and paragraph 48 of your statement.  You do confirm that there was a commencement ofbusiness rescue proceedings and you know that Mr Pierce Marsden and his colleague were appointed as joint Business Rescue Practitioners?    Did you ever deal with them in their capacity as Business Rescue Practitioners?    Yes.    Yes.    Are you aware that one of the issues they had to confront as Business Rescue Practitioners is the fact that Eskom withheld payment of two invoices in June and August 2016?  I mean that is a matter that falls within your portfolio.  Correct?    The processing and payment of invoices?    Are you aware of that fact?    Yes.  Do you know why Eskom withheld that payment, those two payments?    So again Eskom was insisting on payment of penalties at that point in time?    Yes.  Are you also aware that the Business Rescue Practitioners suspended a supply of coal to Hendrina?    In August 2015?   Yes.  Did you deal with the Business Rescue Practitioners around the suspension of coal?    Yes.    Yes.    All I want to understand is that this is the matter that also fell within your portfolio.  Did you ever deal with them on that issue?    Alright.  You conclude that topic around the business rescue status of OCM by referring to an event which I cannot locate in the evolution of the relation between Optimum Coal Mine and business rescue and Eskom.  I direct    What was the effect of this arrangement, because my understanding is that Eskom had always insisted on compliance with coal quality, sizing specifications?  You have just also indicated that it insisted on withholding payment because of all those coal quality specification deficiencies?    Why in September 2015 there is a notice from the attorneys of Eskom to suspend sizing specifications and penalties?    Yes.  I suppose you were not consulted on this proposal?    No, but if you were you would have recalled?    And if you were consulted you would have given us copies of these letters?    So the bottom line is you were not consulted at all?    You move to the next topic and I will be fairly quick there, because we now understand the process for certification of coal compliance when it is delivered on the one hand through a conveyor belt or when it is delivered on the other hand through rail.  You explained that process from paragraph 51 on page 10 and you conclude that insofar as coal from Hendrina is concerned it was delivered by a conveyor belt and the process for coal certification for compliance will be through sample testing.  Correct?    Yes.  There is nothing that turns on your explanation.  From paragraph 56 you deal with that issue and there is nothing that arises for purposes of asking you further questions on it unless you want to raise anything.  In    When did you pick up for the first time that as a matter of hindsight the coal delivered did not comply with sizing specifications?    I just need a time that I can work it.  Is that the time you refer in paragraph 62?    61 and 62.  So it is around October?    Yes.  My recollection of your evidence on this score earlier on when we anticipated these two paragraphs was that the problem was not resolved fully.  You said that there was some significant improvement.  Correct?   And that the problems of sizing still remained?    Yes.  So that the coal quality which was delivered after this period still had some problem of some sort related to sizing.  Correct?    Yes.  I am asking you this question because we know that after the new owner took over it continued to deliver coal to Hendrina from the same mine.  Correct?    Yes and they would all things been equal still be coal quality problems related to sizing?    What I want to understand is after the new owner took over did you guys look at the question of penalties coming from the same coal mine?  I am talking about the period April.  In fact let me become more precise.  I am talking about the period to September 2016 going forward.    And did you impose those penalties?    Alright.  I would like you to take me to your documentation where that happened.  I am distinguishing between two things.    Historic penalties of 2.1 billion and future penalties that began to apply from September 2016.  Your evidence is that you did impose penalties?   Okay.  Chair I will explore that issue when we come to September 2016.    Because I.    I cannot pick it up.    I confess that.    I may have been drowned in documentation.    And forgot the bigger picture.    Yes.  Mr Opperman I have now concluded anything before the question of cession which is a new topic.  You deal with from page 12 paragraph 63.  Do you see that?    In that paragraph you talk about an internal memo dated 29 October 2015.  Chair you will find that memo on page 258 and I would like to take you there if you do not mind.    Yes.    Come on.  Is it me again?   I think it is; I made a mistake, ja.    [Intervenes].    No, I am sorry.  It is my understanding, because GJO19 is 254.    Mr Opperman you included this memo in your documentation.  Do you see that?   And it seems to me that this is a request for approval by the Group Executive for Generation for the supply of coal from Optimum Mine for a specific period.  Do you see that?    If you look at paragraph 2 on page 255.  Can I ask you to give us some background why in October 2015 approval is required from Mr Koko about a short term supply for coal from Optimum Mine?  I would have thought that by that time there always existed a CSA between Eskom and Optimum to supply coal.    Yes.    Where are you reading from?  I am sorry.  I missed you.    256.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I see.       You know at this point what is surprising about this, and don’t misunderstand me or the tone of my question, I’m not blaming you but what is surprising about this request for approval at that point in time, is that Glencore had been requesting this shift in change of the penalty level from 15 to even 20, correct?       And that was rejected?       Having rejected that historic request you’re now going to – Eskom is seeking an approval to change that very same position it had rejected previous, correct?       Why the sudden change of heart?       Alright, and this request was supported by a number of people and there are names are here on page 257, do you see that?       What happened to this request, was it approved?       Yes.       Do you see that?       So we know that they’ve approved it and it’s for a short period of time and we know it was during the time when this entity was still under business rescue, correct?       I am going back to your statement, in paragraph 63 you refer to Annexure GJ20, Chair it’s a report by a consultancy that has Eskom engaged I’ve read it and maybe Mr Opperman will help us about the importance of this.       Because it simply talks about the market analysis of coal all over the world and here and what could be the possible reason why Glencore sought a renegotiation, but I’m not too sure if it adds anything to the debate.  Mr Opperman how do you want us to consider this document?        Ja, in terms of cash to cost if this document is relevant at all you will find the analysis done by the consultants on page 280 about the different mines owned by Glencore supplying coal to Eskom and what was the cash to cost implication of the supply to Eskom.  The bottom line is that Optimum was not the most expensive, correct?       The most expensive was Spring Lake, do you see that?       Chair I can’t take it further, I mean I will leave it and this you ...       I would like to take you back to your statement and ask you to go to paragraph 64 on page 13, you refer to Annexure GJ21 and Chair you will find it at page 285.      Yes, but the real document begins at 286, I’d ask you to go there Chair.       Mr Opperman you will see that that’s the change of ownership.       And it takes place through a cession of shares in the operating company that owns the mine, correct?       Yes.  I want to focus on paragraph 1.2 on page 286, paragraph 1.2 of the approval given by the BTC consent to that change of ownership provides that there will be a release of the guarantee given by OCH to Eskom, you would know as the manager of the various power stations, especially in relation to Hendriena that a guarantee of performance given by a supplier it’s a useful collateral for Eskom, correct?       If you release the supplier from that guarantee then there’s a risk posed to Eskom about the performance by the supplier of his contractual obligations, correct?       So make sure that the change of ownership does not impact adversely on Eskom you would insist that the new owner provide a guarantee correct?       So what paragraph 3 records and Chair I’m at page 286, is that the condition for that cession is that Tegeta had to provide a guarantee of its own, is that correct?       Yes, the question is – well before I put the question, that change of ownership was contractually recorded as between Eskom and Tegeta by means of an amendment to the existing CSA, and remember when the CSA was in operation the last of the amendments we have looked at was the third addendum.       The addendum which constituted the amendment toreflect the change of ownership is now called the 4th addendum, correct?       To be distinguished from the draft 4th addendum which the Board had rejected and that 4th addendum you will find it Chair from page 288.       And for the purposes of the question that I had intimated but I had not yet put to you can I ask you to go to page 291, you will see paragraph 2.1.5.2 it says Eskom being issued with a guarantee by Tegeta on the same terms as the Eskom guarantee to Eskom’s satisfaction, do you see that?       So that it is part and parcel of this 4th Addendum that Eskom had to be given a guarantee by Tegeta to Eskom’s satisfaction, correct?       The Board had required that addendum be given the 4th Addendum we have looked at provide for the contractual obligation to provide for theguarantee and the question is was that guarantee given by Tegeta?       June 20?       Okay.       Yes, we will come back to the significance of that evidence and you do confirm, so if you can go to page 13 paragraph 67 you do confirm in paragraph 67 that the first time the 4th addendum was made known to you was on the 8th of June 2017, correct?       There are several issues that I would like to explore with you, you are aware that the 4th addendum was signed by the parties 14 months earlier than the date when you yourself became aware of it, correct?       And Mr Opperman I mean the questions relating to the 4th addendum, the amendment of the CSA by way of a 4th addendum are matters thatfall within your portfolio.       Yes.  From all events it seems as if people were doing something about your portfolio without even telling you.           Why would that be the case, I mean can you think of any reason why you being the person in charge of whether the 4th addendum should, - well whether the CSA should be amended and if so whether it should be on the terms formulated by the addendum, what is any plausible reason that people in Eskom would avoid and not talk to you on that issue?      Please do.       Chair I – in fairness I thought I should put that question, but we have our own reasons and we don’t want to be accused of unfair speculation when the witness who could have helped us has come and again, but ...(intervention)        Let us not speculate but it is surprising is it not?       You are ignored on a matter falling within your portfolio.       And you say you became aware of the 4th addendum ayear and two months later, but you now confirmed that the guarantee contemplated in the 4th addendum was not given?       Yes.  Even by the time when Optimum went into a second business rescue, that guarantee had not been given?       As we speak today that guarantee is not in place?       Thank you.  So Eskom has been on risk the day Glencore divested ownership of this mine and the day Tegeta took over this mine.       I won’t ask you to speculate why.       No Chair.       I have ...       I will – otherwise I am going to go to that world of speculation.       We have our own views Chair, but I think in fairness to Mr Opperman we will interrogate those views with other witness who was supposed to explain these anomalies.  Mr Opperman I would like to move then to the next phase of your statement which is the declaration of business rescue.  You start with the topic from paragraph 68, on page 13, okay, you talk about Section 54 notice, we have dealtwith Section 54 notices during the evidence of Mr Ephron, I am not going to ask you to repeat it.  It’s up to you, you may want to give us more information we are not aware of.  You then move to the question of the declaration of impossibility by Eskom at page 69 because of strike issues.       Ja, I would like to move away from it unless you think that is important.       Then you begin with the topic of an interim agreement at the request of Werksmans Attorneys who we know at the time they were acting forbusiness rescue practitioners, correct?       Chair you will find that letter on page 300.  Mr Opperman that letter records the extension of the interim agreement, I assume that that’s the short term supply agreement that you said was recommended by Ms Nteta.       Chair do you not have JG025 which is on page 300?       Yes, do you see that?       So it’s a request by the lawyers of the business rescue practitioners to extend further that short term agreement.       Yes, and just as a matter of clarity it is the sameagreement that was recommended by Ms Nteta?       Yes, then you refer to JG26, Chair you will find it from page 301.       Yes, and that is notice by the business rescue practitioner to the creditors, shareholders, and all other interested parties of Optimum to tell them that they are now out of business rescue.  Are you there at page 302?       Yes so that seems to me that that’s the end of thecommercially limping status of Optimum as a company in financial distress.       Yes, so it can trade on its own financial muscle.  Now what I want to ask you is this, and we will clear this with the Business Rescue Practitioners when they come in on  Tuesday Chair.  Do you know whether or not they had filed a Business Rescue Plan?       You yourself would not know.       Fair enough.  They sent the same letter to other people of course and one of them is Mr Petrus Mazibuko who was your superior as I recall?       You reported to him?       Chair you will find that letter on page 308.       And in it – in fact I made a mistake, I thought that it was sent by the Business Rescue Practitioners, far from it, that letter was sent by the new Chief Operating Officer of Optimum after it was taken out of business rescue.       It is Mr van der Merwe.    Chair you will find his name on page 310.    So this is a company under new management, it sends a letter to Mr Mazuduko confirming that it is out of business rescue, but of importance is what Mr van der Merwe says in the paragraph just before the escalation matrix, do you see it Mr Opperman?    Yes, he says in it   And then he starts explaining the pricing mechanism that he proposes which is effectively an escalation to the Rand per ton of the price that Optimum was providing coal to Eskom, correct?   Yes, Chair you will find the explanation of the matrix relating to the escalation on page 309.    Mr Opperman when you look at the table of the escalation Glencore when it owned this mine it made and requested Eskom to agree to this matrix of a price escalation, are you aware of that fact?    And Eskom rejected that request.    Yes, yes.  Chair can I ask you to cross-reference the pricing mechanism requested by Mr van der Merwe on behalf of Tegeta to the request made by Glencore through Mr Ephron via the 4th Addendum at page 148 of Mr Ephron’s statement.    148.    I’m sure you don’t have it but you are aware of it, it is the same cost component of running an operation, it is labour, it is diesel, it is electricity, other materials including engineering and electrical materials.  Those are the normal cost items to run a mine and Glencore requested the same adjustments in terms of price escalation and you do confirm that they were rejected?    Yes, what happened to this request by Mr van der Merwe, did Eskom approve it?    Yes.  In fact it was earlier than that, if you go to page 312, you will see that Mr Mazibuko responds to that letter of Mr van der Merwe.    And he tells me that as far as he is concerned he agrees to it but he will refer to the Board for approval.  And then the approval comes via the 5 th addendum, correct?   I do recall that I saw the 5th addendum in your documentation.  Chair you will find the 5th addendum on page 327.    And Mr Opperman I would like to take you to page 330.  You will see that there is a rebasing of the price to R201.46 per tonne that is a revised price structure?    Yes.   So it is – it is a new price but it was really setting a base price.    Yes.  Alright thank you for that clarity.  We now know that there is a fifth addendum that regulates the new price arrangements.  I am now at page 14, paragraph 72 of your statement.  This is a memorandum sent to the executives of Eskom.  Can you give us some background to this memorandum?  It is on page 314 Chair going forward.    314.    Can you give us some background why this memorandum was sent to the senior executives of Eskom?     Alright Mr Opperman all you saying in short is that you were going to request an approval to buy coal from elsewhere than from Optimum Coal Mine?   No I understand but you were going to buy from a third party supplier?    Yes.     I see.    And you are going incur substantial additional costs?    Yes.  And the cost component which is an additionalcost for Eskom was in the order of R494,00 per tonne?    Oh.  Just explain to me how do you get to the figure?    Yes.    So you minus the one [indistinct].    So the additional cost is the variance.    Which is R312,00?    Okay.  Now can I ask you this?  Was that approval given to your recollection?    Yes.    Can you read that handwritten manuscript for us I cannot make head or tail of it, it you could that will be great.    Yes.    Alright.    Yes.  So at that point in time we are sitting with a position where there is an existing CSA.    In terms of which Optimum Coal is obliged to supply certain maximum tonnage to Hendrina, correct?    And you request for a purchase of a shortfall to cover the December holiday problem.  Had you at that point in time made an analysis that what was supplied to Hendrina at that point in time were tonnages that were consistentwith the contractual volume that the mine had to supply.  What I want to understand is the shortage in the stock pile at that point in time was it because Optimum did not comply with its obligation to provide the tonnages under the contract?  What was the reason for the short?    No I understand.  So the short supply is attributable to business rescue situation of Eskom – of Optimum?    Okay thank you for that.  Then you go to the next topic about the suspension of penalties and a second business rescue situation.  You deal with that topic from paragraph 73.  And I would like to take you to Annexure GJ30.  Chair you will find Annexure GJ30 on page 317.      And you see that that again it is a letter addressed to Mazibuko to Mr – from Mr George Van Der Merwe.  So it is Optimum Coal under new management speaking to Eskom.  I am going to read the second unnumbered paragraph on page 318 and ask you for your comments.  It reads as follows Mr    What is new about this?  Glencore had already told Eskom about the onerous nature of this agreement.    So what has suddenly changed?  This is an old historic problem the mine had nothing is new.      Indeed.  And that is the point.  That Eskom is now willing to entertain old problems because they are raised by a new manager or a new owner.  Anyway let us read on.   “Due to this Glencore went into business rescue by August 15”. That we know.  “The factors surrounding the hardship clause in the agreement has not changed.” That we know. “Since the signing of the cooperation agreement inflation has increased two consecutive years by more than 6% even though the mine inflation is well documented to be more in the region ofto 12% per year.  This shows that the hardship had increased significantly.” Let me read it again Chair.   Okay.  Chair we still have some time I think we should continue.    Stop and go would be the order of the day if Eskomdoes not help us.    Yes.  Mr Opperman I was reading the last sentence. “This shows that the hardship has increased significantly since then.” Alright.  Can I stop there and ask you the following questions?  We heard from the evidence of Mr Clinton Ephron that before Glencore accepted the final offer that was made by Tegeta to acquire this mine it did a due diligence you aware of that fact?    So anyone who does a DD about an asset to be acquired would know about these problems?    So this is nothing new you agree with that?    Yes.  But what is important and I would like you to askus even if you go back to your records we now know that when Glencore – when Tegeta bought this mine the hardship arbitration was still there, it had not been concluded?    Yes.  So what they raise here is the progression of hardship in the middle of an existing or subsisting arbitration.    On the very same issue of hardship, correct?    Yes.  Optimum is threatening and let me interrupt myself– Optimum under a new management is threatening the second round of business rescue based on the same set and circumstances that gave rise to the first round of business rescue, correct?    Yes.  What was the response of Mr Mazibuko to this letter of Mr Van Der Merwe?    And that memo begins at page 321.  Correct?    You will see Chair that has been signed by Mr Mazibuko on page 324.      And it was approved amongst others by Mr Edwin Mabelane and Mr Koko.      Yes but he signs on his behalf.    Yes.    Yes.  The bottom line is that that memorandum by MrMazibuko was signed.    Yes.  Now I would like to get your assistance on aspects of this document.  The subject matter is Optimum Request for Cooperation Agreement, you see that?    More or less what Glencore did during its days when it requested for a cooperation agreement in order to look into and resolve the hardship clause claims and arbitration, correct?    Yes.  Paragraph 1 says   Yes.  The background is given in paragraph 2, paragraph 3 and the financial implication of the proposal is set out in paragraph 7 on page 22, do you see that?    Yes.  And there Mr Mazibuko says to his seniors   Yes.  There are recommendations which are made from paragraph 9.1 and I am just going to ask you to go to paragraph 10. Can I ask you to read it out for us please?    What does that mean Mr Opperman?    Yes.    Indeed.  In fact if you go to paragraph 9.3 on the same page.  You will see that the recommendation by Mr Mazibuko is that Eskom should reserve its right on – reserve its rights on all penalties and not deduct the same.    Correct.  In other words you say look I know there arepenalties that are accumulating but I am not going to impose them.    And the idea is if you impose them then there is liquidation coming.    Yes.    Yes.     But the difference is this.  There Eskom said I will suspend the penalties pending the outcome of the negotiations.    When negotiations failed Eskom imposed those penalties.    The difference here is that Eskom at least from Mr Mazibuko’s recommendation as accepted amongst others by Mr Mabalane is that you are going to give a favourable treatment to Tegeta under new management.    Yes.    Indeed.  That is a favourable treatment of the same – arising from the same mine from the same condition simply because there is a new owner.    Yes.  Can I take you to the next document which is the Temporary Relief Agreement you talk about it.  From paragraph 75 on page 14.  Chair as I have it that document will be from page 325.      You see in that document Mr Mabalane records the extent of the relief measures extended to Optimum Coal under new management.  Andthey are set out from paragraphs 1 to 3 on page 326.  Do you see that?    The penalties are not deducted.  The monthly supply is reduced to 375 tonnes, do you see that?    And you know that under the CSA if you short supply you incur the short supply penalties.    So another form of penalty which is now almost abandoned?    Yes.  And the number one measure that I have skipped related to the inflation matrix which has now been escalated.  The point of clarity there is, is it the same escalation matrix that we have previously looked at?    Or just a new one.  It is the same one.    Okay.  Alright.  Were you consulted about these measures before they were formally communicated to the new management of Optimum?    Yes.  Mr Opperman I know that from paragraph 78 on page 14 you deal with a number of developments.  From my part I am not going to dealwith them because you have already dealt with the history of the fifth addendum as you reflect on it in paragraph 78 page 15.  With your permission and that of the Chair I would like to jump to the next event from paragraph 79 of your statement and there you deal with the second round of business rescue by Optimum which was initiated on 19 February 2018.  Correct?    You refer to the relevant CIPC Documents from page 345.  Chair you will see the documentation that is required by the Commissioner of Intellectual Property from page 345 and this is your voluntary.    It is a voluntary business rescue proceedings initiated by the Directors of Optimum Coal.  Correct?    By their resolution.  You will see the resolution appear on page 346 and the explanatory sworn statement Chair begins at page 348.   The explanatory grounds for the resolution to.    Initiate voluntary business rescue.    And the contention of financial distress is explained from page 350.  Mr Opperman I am sure you have looked at the grounds for initiating business rescue proceedings as set out in this explanatory sworn statement.    Are you there?   I have looked at this and the grounds for initiating business rescue proceedings are unrelated to the hardship that was brought to your attention by Optimum Coal.  In fact they relate to the fact that several banking institutions had closed the accounts of Tegeta?    Do you know whether Optimum Coal Mine had its own account separate from the accounts of Tegeta, Oakbay and other associated companies?    It was a Tegeta account?   Alright.  So for that reason this company went into business rescue and new Business Rescue Practitioners were appointed?    Yes.  Do you know them?  Have you dealt with them before?    Alright.  I am now going to go to the new topic, but before I go there I would like to put some concluding proposition to you and ask for yourreaction if the Chair would permit me.    Mr Opperman it is quite clear from what we have discussed.  It is quite clear from the change of ownership that once set of owners were treated fundamentally different to another set of owners by Eskom.  Do you agree?    Yes.  You also agree that because of that difference of treatment the one set of owners which is Glencore was forced to take the radical decision of declaring a hardship which led to an arbitration.  Do you also agree that as a result of that difference in treatment Glencore had to put Optimum Coal Mine into a business rescue?    Yes and do you also agree that in regard to the new owner Eskom extended favourable treatment totally different to that of Glencore.  In that context I would like you to comment on the following.  One, do you agree thatEskom accommodated the financial and operating difficulties that Optimum experienced after Tegeta took over?    All of these difficulties which related to Optimum Coal Mine were clearly foreseeable when Tegeta took over that mine.  They were not new.  In fact they were a continuation of the old problem.    Chair I would like to go to the next topic which is Arnot.    And I hope to be quick, because they provide a usefulcontext to the prepayment, the R659 million prepayment that Mr Nagar talked about in detail on Tuesday.    You begin with the topic from paragraph 80 and in    Yes and it did so in terms of a long term Coal Supply Agreement which was a Cost Plus type of agreement?    Yes.  Do you know when then the agreement between Eskom and Exxaro came to an end?    Yes.  It seems to me that it was because of the termination of that Exxaro Agreement that Eskom decided to go into short term supply agreement with Tegeta and you begin to explore the first agreement from paragraph 82 on page 16.  That short supply agreement came into being from 16 January 2016.  Correct?  Chair you will find it on page 353.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Alright.  The coal which Tegeta was going to supply to Arnot comes from Optimum Coal Mine.  Correct?    I do not know the coal specifications of Arnot, but did that coal meet the specifications of Arnot?    Yes.    Okay and it was going to be delivered via transportation?   And in paragraph 7.1 on page 356 you will see that the prices is expressed in terms of gigajoules as R20,41 per gigajoules.  Do you see that?    If you use your expertise what will be the Rand per ton conversion of that price?    What does it give you?   [Indistinct].    Yes.    Yes.    The mathematics that Ms Hofmeyr comes down to on that method of calculation suggests that it is R488,58 per ton.    Okay.    Yes.    That same coal if it were to be supplied to Hendrina it will be far less in terms of price per tonnage.  Correct?    400?    Thank you for that detail.  We know that that agreement was extended later on for a further period of five months.  Correct?  You will find the extension in Annexure GJ36 and Chair you will find GJ36 on page 361.    Yes.    Oh, it was for three months.  You mean the extension at GJ36?   Alright.  Then there is something wrong about your statement.    Yes.  So can we change five months in paragraph 83 to three months?    Page 16 paragraph 83.            Yes.    So we do not change anything?    Alright.  Chair nothing much turns on the terms of the extension.  I have looked at them.  Again subject to further guidance from Mr Opperman the price is the same?  Do you confirm?   Yes.    Yes and then you say something in paragraph 85 on    And you refer to GJ37 which is at page 414.    You will see that the term of that further extension Mr Opperman is set out on page 417 paragraph 8.  Correct?    So your concern as far as I understand it articulated in paragraph 85 is that there were these short term agreements extended from time to time by [intervenes].    Yes.    Yes.    So Chair the [indistinct] from January 2016 to at least September 2016 there were short term supply agreements concluded between Tegeta and Eskom to lift coal from Optimum Coal Mine to supply Arnot.  When at the same time for that period Optimum could not supply sufficient coal to.    To Hendrina.    Yes.    And Mr Opperman says he had some concerns in that regard.    He articulates the concern in paragraph 85.  Do you seethat?    Mr Opperman there must be a reason why you were concerned and I suggest to you that one of the reasons related to the price of coal which Tegeta would fetch by supplying to Arnot instead of supplying to Hendrina?    So Eskom allows the same supplier who has a contractual obligation on a long term agreement to choose where it will get higher prices for the same coal.  Do you agree?    Yes.    Yes.    Indeed and my understanding of your CSA with Optimum allowed you to take even stock more than the minimum or the maximum in that case.  You had the option to over buy and that option if you exercised it would have helped Eskom to reduce the cost of buying directly from Tegeta to supply to Arnot.    Yes.    No, let us not go there.  Please I am sorry to interrupt you.  We have undisputed evidence of Mr Ephron about when they closed the export market.  You are aware of that date?    Yes.  So there was no export market for Hendrina at that point in time?    Yes.  In fact what was existing is that at that point in time when this supply directly by Tegeta from Optimum Coal Mine to Arnot you had relaxedthe sizing specifications for the benefit of Tegeta.  Correct?    Yes.    Yes.  So it is the same coal with a relaxed specification going to a different mine at a higher price.    Yes.    I am looking at the statement of Mr Ephron and Chair for your notes you can record that it is at page 5 paragraph 22.    And he elaborated on this.   When explained how they close an open [indistinct] because of the decline in.    The spot price of coal in the export market.    Yes.    And again Mr Opperman that is not new information to you, because you have referenced that report by what is the name of that consultingcompany again?  Meridian.    Yes.  They talk about the export market.    The decline and when Glencore stopped exporting in regard to at least this mine, Optimum Coal Mine.  The undisputed evidence, you can dispute it if you want to but as far as we know the owners of the mine have told the Chairperson that they closed the export market around 2012.  Is your information different?    There’s a last topic that I would like to explore with you and it begins at page 86, sorry paragraph 86 on page 16.  You say in that paragraph during my interview with the Hawks I was shown a Primary Energy Division Supplier Payment Control form issued to Tegeta for prepayment in the amount of R578.5million for Arnot and supported by invoices, so you mention them there, do you see that?    It seems to me that you acquired knowledge of these things for the first time when the Hawks show you these documents, is that a fair reading of your statement?   No I understand, so when did you get to know that there was this prepayment made by Eskom to Tegeta?    3rd of May which year?    2016?    Okay, we know that the prepayment was made around the 13th of April 2016, correct?    Of April?    Let’s work with the date that you have.    Chair we will for now just work with the date of Mr Opperman, our date is totally different for obvious reasons.    But let’s work with the 18th of April.  So you become aware of that prepayment a month after it had been made.    Yes, and again the basis of that prepayment was aprepayment agreement concluded between Eskom and Tegeta for the supply of coal to Arnot which Tegeta gets from Optimum Coal Mine.    Yes.  So effectively this was an extension of the previous short-term agreement we have talked about?    Yes.  Were you aware of the prepayment agreement that sought to establish the legal basis for this prepayment?    When did you become aware for the first time of that prepayment agreement?    Chair the same problems that arose with Mr Nagar, I think they are now unravelling.    From a different perspective, but the simple point is this that someone again usurp your functions and duties to go and execute a prepayment agreement without even talking to you.    Is there any reason why or any reason that you can favour to the Chairperson why someone would take over your functions and duties without talking to you on such a fundamental matter relating to prepayment, advance payment for coal stock which you have not yet received.    But is it not a matter of concern to you?    Did you ask Mr Nagar, did you ask Mr Mazibuko when they come to you a month later in May and say please authorise payment, did you ask them but why are you taking over my line function and duty?   So you are formulating paperwork to cover your tracks after the fact of payment?   No, well explain it to me, why are you doing things after the fact?    And that’s the point Mr Opperman, that you used a totally different contract number to rectify at best for you a prepayment for a totally different contract.     No, no, no I am asking you this because you are thebest person to help us now.  At that point in time when you begin the paperwork the payment had been made on your version?    The paperwork repeats the mistake which Mr Nagar has told us about, you use the Brakfontein contract in order to do the paperwork?    Okay, explain that?    I understand and so I go back to my question, payment had been done under a wrong contract number.    You now do the paperwork to rectify the situation.     And that is after the fact?    Yes.  Chair I think I have explored all the questions that I wanted to put to Mr Opperman.  Mr Opperman the rest of the things they talk about, a new CSA, I’m not going to raise those issues with you, unless you want to talk to them, these are the matters that begin at page 88, sorry paragraph 88 on page 17 up to theend of your statement.     You are fine.  Last question Mr Opperman, what is the lesson that you yourself have learnt from all of this, that you can share with us so that the Chairperson has the comfort of your evidence when he considers making recommendations.  You can think carefully on that question and if you decide to answer it please answer it on a considered basis via a supplementary affidavit.   Chair thank you, Chair it is almost half past.  MrOpperman is not done yet.  Ms Hofmeyr will deal with the rest of his evidence relating to Brakfontein on Monday.      Yes, we propose to start at nine thirty again.    Yes Chair.    Mr Opperman you are aware that you have to finish the Brakfontein leg of your testimony.    And it’s on Monday. 
MR GERT OPPERMAN:  I have put my [indistinct] because it has…    Some of the annexures as in Mr Opperman’s statement tothose of Mr Ephron’s annexures. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the truth; the wholetruth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    [Indistinct]. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Gert Jacobus Opperman.    No I do not.    Yes.    So help me God 3 in 1 Father, Ghost and – Holy Ghost and Son.    Good morning Advocate Maleka.    I will do that.    Correct.    I am there.    I can.    I can confirm that yes.    In Emalahlene, Witbank.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes Mr Maleka it is the statement – the area that refers to the penalty provision and the amounts.  As per my annexure 18.    So this is point number 47.    On page number 9.    Mr Maleka the calculation that reflects on Glencore’s penalty as plus minus 18 million if one reference annexure GJ018 that amount was 13.8 million.    It might not be that significant but that is the correction to be made.  The other amount is 720 that I am making…    Chair it is the total on the third – the fourth columnat the bottom.  The total that reads 13.833 million.      So it is sum total on the …    Correct, correct.    Correct.   To the 13.8.    Yes.    YEs.    That – Chair that amount stays as it is we need to change in my affidavit.    In my statement point number 47.  I made reference to the calculation as plus minus 16 million.    That is correct Sir.    I am comfortable if we make it 14 million plusminus something like that.    That is fine.    And then Mr Maleka with your leave I will leave the plus minus 720 million which is pretty much in line in – to the amount 723 million that is reported in that spreadsheet.    So I am comfortable with that.    Correctly so Sir.  Point number 16 on my statement which is page number 3 refers to Eskom imposing penalties based on thesupply of non-conforming coal and I think maybe…    Page number 3.      Point number 16.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Okay it currently reads that Eskom imposed penalties based on the supply of non-confirming coal.  I need to clarify this that these penalties were not imposed in 2008 and 2009 but they were recorded and it was not for non-conforming coal but it was for undersupply.      Correct.    I would prefer if we say that Eskom recorded penalties.    Correct.    Correct.   No that is all thank you Sir.    That is correct.    I started in Eskom in 1992 as a bursar but I was appointed in Eskom on 1 February 1996 as a plant operator at Kendal Power Station.    Correct.    That is correct.    It was around 2007, 2008.    It was the auxiliary plants areas looking after all the material handlings components on the power station.    Correct.    No that is not correct.    I was responsible for the management of coal supply to Hendrina but I never worked at Hendrina physically.  That was in my capacity that I am appointed currently as – in the primary energy division.    Correct.    As the coal supply unit manager, the same position that I still occupy.    We are a team of individuals that is allocated to certain power stations.  So for most of the close to ten years that I worked as a coal supply unit manager I have managed between one and two stations – power stations at a time.  So my responsibility as towards that station is to make sure that their coal supply that they get confirms to their requirements at the power station and is also delivered as cost effectively as possible.    Yes it was Majuba Power Station, Kumati Power Station, Hendrina Power Station and Arnot Power Station and at no particular time all four of them it has just happened that it was at certain times two of the stations butthose were the four that I was responsible for.    I cannot recall the exact date but it must have been around September 2012 when I started managing the Optimum Contract.    Correct.     I do know him yes.    Yes.    I cannot recall that date.    I do remember that I was responsible for the management to the supply to Arnot Power Station at the time when the coal was contracted from Tegeta in January 2016.    Yes ja.  So by that time I was there already.    The coal supply started with a short term agreement initially I think it was for a once off volume of 100 000 tonnes which was then extended with a three months contract and again extended with a five months contract.  At that moment in time Tegeta procured the coal from the Optimum Operation and sold it to Eskom.  But the contracting party was with Tegeta and not with Glencore at that moment in time.    That is correct.    I know of Brakfontein very well I managed that contract from inception until it went into business rescue also in February 2018.    I am there.     Hundred percent.    Short term will be a supply over three months typically something like that.    Ja it could even go up to five months but I will not say it is less than a year.    Medium term contracts is anything from a yearand we have had medium term contracts for even up as long as ten years.    Correct.  It is not clearly defined like that but I think if one needs to put a time line to it that is [indistinct].    Yes.    Ja we do get CSA’s for medium term contracts as well so the medium term contracts also does have a CSA and equally so the short term contracts as well but the long term contracts will typically exceed ten years so that could be something as long as twenty years or thirty years.   This function that is part of my Portfolio in terms of approval is facilitated by the Fuel Sourcing Department.  So we have got a department in our division which is termed Fuel Sourcing and they will negotiate andfacilitate the process of getting approvals.  So my function in this regard is to make sure that coal supply agreements is approved by the time that it reaches our desk to execute it.    Or my desk to execute it.    I cannot really say how we are – how I am involved in the approval of it other than assisting the Fuel Sourcing Department with technical support or contract management experience through that facilitation process. But the submissions that will go to the various authorising committees that gets compiled by the Fuel Sourcing Division or Department and occasionally we will have inputs into it bringing our experience to the table.    That need for coal supply will actually be identified through our integrated planning department.    Which is also one of the departments within thePrimary Energy Division.  So that department is responsible to look at burn requirement of the coal within the fleet and they will then based on that determine the shortage of coal at a specific power station and based on that that need will arise.    Not really, not really.    That is correct.    To give effect to the agreement?    No, I do not play any role in it.   That is correct.    No, nothing.    That is correct.  So in an existing Coal SupplyAgreement meaning it went through the procurement process.  It has been signed by all parties and it is in execution phase.  Commercial aspects might include or will include payments for goods delivered, coal delivered and legal aspects will typically be when there are aspects that needs to be interpreted in the contract and I will liaise with the Legal Team on those.    Correct.    That does happen, yes.    I think one needs to narrow down a certain aspect be it either on quantity or on a quality, those disputes.  So let us deal with the quantity one which is maybe the easier one.  So a Coal Supply Agreement will have provisions on how the quantity in the Coal Supply Agreement needs to be managed.  We term it in the contract when one looks at the quantity tables there is a nominal minimum and maximum.  So it gives you an opportunity to do some phasing with volumes mainly to compensate for seasonal changes, but also to accommodate challenges be it at a power station or in the mining section.  Certain contracts have provisions for an undersupply.  I think most of the contracts have a provision for undersupply.  These undersupply provisions in the contracts are very harsh.  It is a very harsh penalty andthat is the way that we deal with it.  So the moment that the supplier will deliver less than minimum.  So you will have the contracted nominal.  When he goes below minimum for a certain period depending what is noted in the contract a request for a rectification plan will be submitted.  That is an official request to provide a plan on how it will be recovered.  Within fairness that plan needs to be considered and ultimately we are in the business of buying the coal.  That is what we need.  So we will liaise with the supplier and see how we can get around to actually get those volumes to materialise failing which the short supply penalty will then be applied.    I fit in all that, in that whole area.  That is my responsibility.    That is correct.  So I will be the person who will beable to identify if there is a short supply.  From that short supply my finance team will assist me with the calculation of a short supply penalty if it goes to that point.  I will be the person who will issue the request for rectification plan to the respective supplier to engage them on a recovery plan.    I do play the same role.  However on coal qualities there is a process, a dispute process that can be followed.  So the moment that quality is out of specification there is a process that you can go through disputingthose qualities which is again dependent on the method of contracting and then after those qualities have been disputed and the results become available those results then become final and binding.  If those qualities then still require a penalty to be imposed I will be responsible for the imposition of that penalty and the penalty will be calculated with the support from the Finance Team.    I think that is fair to say.  There are teams available or supporting me on the technical point as well on the quality determination, but that is a fair deduction, yes.    That is correct.    Yes.  We have had an instance especially on the Optimum Coal Supply Agreement where there was a lot of contention around the way that the calculation needed to be done where we have or I have consulted our internallegal people and we then consulted external legal firms to assist us with the calculation of penalties as well as the interpretation thereof.    Correct.    It was in that order, yes.    I am aware of that settlement amount.    I did not disagree with the calculation.  I fully agree with the 2.1 billion.  What is important is to understand the different reference points.    And if I am afforded the opportunity I will explainit.    Correct.    Chair there is not a different interpretation.  I think.    Even the interpretation is the same, because.    We work from the same spreadsheet.    So there is no difference in that.  I think Mr Maleka refers to the 720 million that I refer to in my statement and my statement to the 720 million only including the sizing penalty up until end of April, I think, 2013 when Optimum issued a notice where they wanted to renegotiate the sizing penalty.  Whereas the 2.1 billion penalty considers the whole period.    That deduction that I made as I said was only for the period as consideration the sizing penalty up until 23 April 2013.    So I only considered, in my statement I only considered the sizing penalty up until the period when Optimum came to the table and they said to us Eskom we want to renegotiate the sizing specification.    They are entitled according to the first addendum to request that to be done.  There is a whole process that followed after that with multiple communications up and down for additional information and it never got to agreeing to a different sizing specification, but that was my interpretation.    So the whole time when I was referencing a penalty against this contract it considered the quality parameters, it excluded AA because the AA was levied at that moment in any case, but it only included the sizingpenalty up until April 2013.    That is correct.    Ja, there was some interpretation done to it.    And me not being a mathematician, but use some averages and.    And things like that and I got to the 723.  I did a similar calculation on Mr Nagar’s spreadsheet.    And on that spreadsheet it came to 719 million.  So the 720 ballpark figure is that.    Ja, I do not think there has been any differences.    I am confirming that it was the same figure.    Correct.   That is correct.    That is correct.    So what we will do is in certain instances when coal gets delivered not via conveyor where it is a fixed mode of delivery, but coal gets delivered via road we will consider that coal supply risk in that manner in terms of considering different routes that a vehicle can take.  The shorter the route the lower the Rand per ton that we pay for the logistics cost.  It could be that.  I immediately cannot think really of anything else.    That is correct.    That is correct.   I cannot recall, but it must be in the region of around 60/64 kilometres.  Somewhere around there.    That is correct.    I cannot recall a; you are referring to the Rand per ton for the transportation?    I cannot recall exact figures, but it must be in the region if I think around R140 or so.    Yes.    Sorry, can I just, can you just repeat that?    Okay, yes, ja.    Correct.    That is correct, yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    We will have monthly liaison meetings with the Power Station Coal Management Team.  It will occasionally also be attended by the General Manager or the Coal Supply Unit Manager and the function of that is to really report on the previous month’s performance and look at suppliers, try and align the burn requirements with the supply from the power station.  We will also revisit qualities.  So, ja that is what we do.    Ja, I will be informed with it, about it and will action it.    In this aspect Eskom’s clients are referred to as our suppliers.  So I also have monthly engagements with the suppliers where we will meet and look at supply risks, quality risks.  We will discuss any operational matters, potential coal supply issues, things like that.  So it is mainly on that.  Industry Committees will include on occasion if we involve people who are specialists forargument on sampling or coal accounting, things like that.    Ja that is fair.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    I see it.    Yes.    No, Mr van der Merwe did not.  Mr van der Merwe was the Chief Operating Officer for Optimum Coal Mine and the management and control of Tegeta.    Correct.   That is correct.    It changed in 1993 with the signing of the next agreement.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    So the abrasive index in coal that we measure is a determination of a certain chemical characteristic that coal has that impacts wear and wear rates.  So what typically will happen with a coal with a high wear rate, wherever itgets into contact with any metal surface it will wear away that metal surface.  So this will typically impact the areas of your milling plant, the classifier plant, your PF ducting, your pulverised fuel ducting that feeds the coal to the furnace, the burner mouse.  The burners that goes into the furnace and then what also happens is that the moment that coal is then combust it also has an impact on the ash characteristics with relevance to the pyrites and those chemical substances in the ash that then also have a wear impact on the boiler tubing, flue gas ducts, the air heaters in that stream even out on your ID fan impellers.  So basically everything that gets into contact with that that stream of coal or ash, gas stream once it is combusted.  So it is an indication of an impact on wear on plant.  So the higher the figure the higher your wear rate will be.   Correct relating to the areas that have contact to the coal.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes, I am.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.  That is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That’s correct.     Yes.     That’s correct, it was previously 6.5.     Correct.    That’s fine.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Okay so I want to take you back to paragraph 3.3.1, the paragraph just before that.     Because there’s something of importance to note and it’s the last section of that paragraph that clarifies the method or the manner in what – in how these qualities will be determined.  So it says there that the target is to have AI less than 423mg iron on a seven day weighted rolling average basis.  Okay, so this is important when we talk later about penalty determination.  So this is the first time that the qualities on AI gets raised and it clarifies the method in how it will be calculatedand it is calculated on a seven day weighted rolling average basis.     Okay.     You look at it over a period of seven days, it is rolling, so the seven days will consistently roll, so that’s correct, but you will also weight it according to the deliveries on that specific day.     Okay so what you will do during the period of seven days you will take the total tons supplied over the seven days and you will take the tons that was supplied on that specific day, that will be worked out as a percentage to one another and you will multiply the AI on that specific day with that weighting, and that will roll the whole time, so the importance here is to understand that it’s weighted, firstly, and the second one is that it is not a seven day window, but it is a rolling average, so it does become quite a complex calculation when one does this.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.  And that takes us to point number 332, so I can explain that, so what you find here is that there is five ranges, so the contract stipulates that it should be below 423 to not attract any penalties.  The momentthat it is greater than 423 but less than 500 or up to 500 the – Optimum will pay a penalty of R1.23 per ton, so where I get to this Optimum pay a penalty it’s described just in the paragraph above where it says in the event that the AI level is greater than 423mg iron Optimum Coal Colliery will be liable to pay a penalty to Eskom calculated based on the following basis.     So what it will mean is that Optimum will invoice us and then they will pay that, so what we have done in reality is that this penalty on a monthly basis where it was applicable this penalty was offset against the invoice amount on a monthly  basis, okay and so it goes on.    Yes.     Correct.    For that specific month yes.    That’s correct.    Correct yes.    Chair there will be a remittance advice submitted by the Finance Department to the mine so they become aware through that before the payment is effected.  At a later stage in the management of the contract I have started drafting a letter which was a letter formatted by Cliffe Dekker and Hofmeyr where theyadvised us how to share this detail on a monthly basis and this letter made reference to the coal price at the time, the total invoiced amount, the amount deductible for coal quality CD as volatile sizing and then also the AI.    Yes.    So Chair these amounts, and if we just take the first range, the R1.23 per ton that is payable by Optimum for AI between 423 and 500 this R1.23 was as on the base date 1 April 2011 and this amount of R1.23 will then be adjusted with the escalation matrix in this contract on an annual basis as the escalationhappened.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    Correct.    That’s correct.    Correct.    I agree.    Throughout this contract there has been various attempts in terms of the interpretation of the penalty provisions of this contract and I think this was just again one other example where the parties fail to agree on the method of calculation of this penalty and that is why there was that discontent around the penalty amount and there has been a lot of engagements around that with Glencoreon a frequent basis where calculations were shared.  The laboratory results is shared in real time on a daily basis so that is something that is available to either party at any given time.  The calculations were shared at intervals, I would not say that it was consistently shared every month but if you draw up a spreadsheet and you say well this is the way that we calculate it then it implies every month you just plug in the actual quality parameter that’s relevant to that seven day rolling period and it should yield the result, but yet there was a difference of interpretation around this calculation.    Chairperson on the AI we did offset that amount every month, irrespective of ...(intervention)     Of a dispute yes.    Correct, we felt from Eskom that the second addendum was very clear on how the AI should be calculated and that amount was deducted every month, reason being that the month that that AI was  high we incurred the additional wear at our power plant and that was a material cost and that was all determined through a recent study that informed these penalty parameters in the second addendum.    We could do that yes.    Yes sir.    That’s correct.    Now it only meant that this is the base price for that specific date and that the escalation will be made on the indexes from that date going forward.    Correct.    Yes.    That’s  correct.    No I was not there at the time, I only started managing this contract in September the following year, 2012.    I do recall that there was a study done by an independent expert company, in short I can just refer it to the Turgess Study, I am not exactly sure over what period it fell but I would like to believe that it coincided with the actions from this Steercom where it was done.    Yes.    I’m there.   Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes it is.    That’s correct.    I think it’s Mr Ephron signature but I’m under correction.    Ephron, Clinton Ephron.    Yes.    “The parties hereby amend the second addendum by deleting  the provision of clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of the second addendum.”    That’s correct.    Yes Mr Maleka, maybe I can clarify it, so at thismoment in time one needs to appreciate that this was a contract that was signed around 1983 that has already undergone ownership and it also has now undergone two addendums, so at this moment in time the intention of these clauses was to consolidate the 1983 contract, the 1993 contract, the first addendum and the second addendum into coal supply agreement and let’s call it a more modern practical executable contract, and at this moment in time at the signing of the 3rd Addendum both parties have had several workshops, several engagements and attempts to achieve that and we could not reach consensus.    And  hence the decision to say we are not goingto consolidate this, we will leave it as it is, that’s basically what the third addendum does.    Correct.    We could not.    Yes.     That’s correct yes.     Yes.  I need to just make it clear we say that Eskom did not provide a draft, there was several attempts to get this draft but there was not something that both parties could agree to, to say this is the first draft revision that both parties could take to their legal teams and get a validation on it.    I don’t even think it came to the compilation of a draft document sir.    Yes.    That’s correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes it was there and there about although at that moment in time there has already been a first notice issued by the previous contract manager to Optimum putting it on record that the size grading is out so I am not the first person to raise it.    Correct.    I am.    Correct.    That is correct.    I know of him, I do not know if I can say I know him.    “In terms of Clause 3.44 of the first addendum of the Hendrina Coal Supply agreement Eskom hereby request a meeting with Optimum Coal Mine to assess the extent of our risk as well as the plans that Optimum has implemented to reduce the minus 0.81 millimetre material delivered to Hendrina Power Station.”    I cannot say.    That is correct.    I can Sir.      I can.    Mr Chair I – for a moment just want to take you back to the previous Annexure GJ05 and not the first page but on page 193 because this is what guided this work group that was established in September on what initial action to take.  So around the middle of – so this is an email response from Mr Riaan De Plooy which at that moment in time I think was the Chief Operation Officer at Optimum Mine.  So he responds to the Eskom team following this letter or following the initial email that was sent to Mr Doug Gain and around the middle of that print I am    Yes.    Not necessarily.    Because the measuring point for this quality parameter remained at the sampling station at the power plant.    But what it would have done, it would have provided some background for the origin of this high size fraction.   And one first need to know in what area to focus in order to correct what went wrong.    So at this moment in time we saw from the analysis that around April, May 2012 the size fraction started increasing and we needed to understand why.  There is some other background as well in the top paragraph.    Where Mr Du Plooy refers to a drag line that has moved to a new area and all of that might have contributed and he actually deals with it    I do not understand the statements.    Yes.    Correct.    There was no improvement.  I cannot say that it got worse or that it got better but the size specification did not come back in line with the contract specification.     It remained high.  We were not too much convinced that this test really concluded the whole exercise.  And what we have done after this is subsequent exercises as well where we had independent specialists from the industry to come and have a look at the sampling station because that was the next    Correct.    Correct.   No.    The one that starts with Eskom wishes?     “Eskom wishes to place on record that this is a transgression of the coal – of the quality specification of the first addendum of the coal supply agreement and calls upon OCM to rectify this transgression.”    The 22nd yes.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Can I cite it?    “OCM has now reached the conclusion that the sizing specification set out in Clause 3.4.3 of the first addendum is no longer realistically representative of the coal which OCM can reasonably be expected to achievefrom the exploitation of the coal deposits constituting the Optimum Colliery.  It being OCM’s view that OCM is conducting its operation in a proper manner and in accordance with best industry standards.”    I accept that that was OCM’s view.   So Mr Chair Eskom responded to inform OCM that we are prepared to engage with the discussions to renegotiate in good faith as guided in the first addendum.  As part of the process we also engaged our Centre of Excellence, CEO, which is an Engineering Department within Generation which has materials handling specialists in that team to assist us with an assessment of the Hendrina Power Plant materials handling plant in order to determine if that plant couldhandle the 20 percent -0.81 millimetre size fraction compared to the 15 percent.  Numerous letters followed over the next couple of months which goes to the extent where Eskom requested from Optimum to provide details on their analysis as to why they say they cannot meet the quality parameter.  We were of the view that the exercise that was completed by 29 November did not conclusively provide a reason to say that is what it is.  So Eskom did not agree to the increase of the sizing although we said it is fine.  We will negotiate in good faith with them and in our view negotiations was to say we will get technical experts to come and provide advice.  We will most probably go on and do some more tests.  It will be a process.  So we did not tell Optimum we are not interested, we do not want to listen you.  We participated in the process and during this process this matter has even been escalated within the Eskom Organisation to my seniors.  So everybody was well aware of this and I am going to call it for now perceived sizing issue at Hendrina.    The negotiations were inconclusive.   In the sense that we embarked on some inspections by independent specialists and that happened in November 2013 where we got a company or a specialist in from Intertek who this individual has vast knowledge around coal sampling, coal analysis Mr Erasmus.  He did an exercise on the sampling plant.  We also got the OEM, the Original Equipment Manufacturer which was Multotec.  That was the company that installed the sampler in around 2012 the modified sampler.  We even got them out.  They did an assessment on 3 December as well.  So throughout this process we were still trying to determine what the reason for this sizing is and we could not get to it.  It eventually got to a point where Eskom was requestinginformation from Optimum to be made available in order to understand why they want to change the parameter and Optimum just never provided that information.  So I think it just went into a stalemate, but the issue with the sizing persisted.  So the sizing never improved.  Every month we sat and in fact that this moment in time it got to the extent where the sizing was out throughout the month and when in our interpretation one then applies the penalty this coal price was now defaulting down to R1 a ton, because of the penalty mechanism that we applied.    Rightly or wrongly, but that is how we determined it and maybe I can fast track, maybe I can fast track this to what happened on 1 October 2015 where Mr Jan Voges who was a Glencore employee at the time, I am not 100 percent sure of his background, but I know he has got a very good background on coal, geology.  I do not know if he is a qualified metallurgist, but he has got vast knowledge.  He also participating in this process throughout, where he identified a problem on the sampling plant.  So this was the plant analysing the coal where therewas a crusher that he went and switched off and immediately on the following day there was a step change in the fine, the small size fraction reported by the sampler.  It did not correct itself 100 percent, but it significantly improved and this for me substantiated or supported this whole effort that we consistently were putting in to try and identify what is the real issue, because have we just admitted in the beginning that it is this coal that is friable and the transfer of the coal from Kwagga North we would have made the wrong decision.  We would have made the wrong decision.    Correct.    It did continue up until October 2015 when that crusher was switched off.  After October 2015 there were instances where the sizing still did not meet the specification, but there was a significant improvement.    Meaning that beforehand the -0.81 millimetre size fraction that was reported on a daily basis by the laboratories were in the region of 30/35 percent.  That then dropped to around 18 percent/19 percent and there was even instances where it dropped below 15 percent.  So it significantly reduced.    Yes, I am.    So this paragraph reports that   Correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    I cannot recall the exact reason of that hardshipclaim, but I would like to believe that it related to the imposition of the sizing penalties that has been accrued over a long period of time which were placed on record over numerous, with numerous correspondence and also at the hand that at this point in time there has been several efforts to try and identify the original of the sizing and the teams have still failed to do it.  At this moment in time we in August 2013 or there around so it is still way before October 2015 when Mr Voges identified the issue.    I recall that the parties entered a cooperation agreement where the hardship was sort of set aside.  If I can [intervenes].    Suspended.    That is the correct word.    Yes I am.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Yes.    Yes.    [No audible reply].    I think it is important to note what my function was in this Negotiation Team.   So this is a process that is facilitated by the Fuel Sourcing Department because it will be an addendum to a contract.  So it is not something that I can do.  So my function in this team at this moment in time was to be the liaison between the power station and this team.  So at this moment in time one of the provisions of this Cooperation Agreement was that there will be a change in the price.  There is a potential extension of this agreement and at that time because there was a change in the price there was an expectation from the power station to also realign the coal quality parameters on this contract that might not have been what they wanted it to be.  So my function during this period in time was to liaise with the power station and the technical specialist at the power station at the Centre of Excellence as well at the [indistinct] Department that has been reported on previously to identify or get to a point where we could get the best benefit going forward.    So we all realised it is going to be most probablyan increased price that is where the hardship related from.  So it will be an increased price but let us also have a look at the coal quality parameter.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.  I think in a way although the main focus with the engagement at Hendrina was to look at the coal quality parameters.    One need to appreciate that those parameters and the price walks hand in hand.    So I cannot say no.   But the price primarily was driven by the negotiations.    Correct.    Correct.    The power stations.    Yes, sorry.    That is correct.    100 percent.    So Mr Chair maybe just to get back to answer the previous question in full.  The question was what aspects did the fourth addendum address that I was responsible for and I think if one goes to the fourth addendum there was a couple of matters that needed clarification.  Some that included the interpretation and the implementation of this penalty, because there was clearly still not alignmentaround that.  The second aspect the implementation and the execution of the sampling process, because we are now at the point where we started questioning the sample process.  We are not in October 2015 yet, but at this moment in time we are saying that modification that was done in 2012 did we do the right thing.  Are we in a position where we might need to something different?  Then there was the continuing failure from Optimum to supply the right size grade in coal.  So the issue was still there.  Optimum still had the belief that it originates from their mining and we were not too sure about that.  There was also an issue that just before the Cooperation Agreement also came to light and that was or came to the table and that was a reduced availability of conveyor belts.  So because Optimum had to give this coal over a conveyor belt toHendrina and Hendrina Power Station had some breakdowns on these belts.  Optimum was of the view that they could not supply the coal.  So we were issuing them or I was issuing them with short supply notifications but they were contesting that they were not able to supply the coal and then I think the last one was the whole price adjustment on the size fraction which we still did not know how to do the sizing and maybe I can expand on it.  When one gets to the sizing parameter in the coal supply agreement that supplied it talks about measuring the coal sizing on a monthly average, but yet there is no penalty mechanism that talks to this monthly average.    The only big penalty mechanism that exists on this contract is this three day, four day, five day, six day and seven day rolling period.    And there was this disconnect on how to align it.  So even though all this time we have been accruing this sizing penalty that was calculated there was this very strong disconnection between the two parties on how toreally calculate this, the sizing penalty.  So that was also something that we wanted to try and attempt and [indistinct] off with the fourth addendum.  So maybe in a way the fourth addendum was doing a bit what the third addendum should have done.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes I am there.    I am.    That is correct.    I cannot comment on the reason why the Hawks made reference to the letters.  I merely included them at the time because I thought maybe it might be referenced in some way at some stage, but I think these two letters were let5ters that were signed by Mr Ncube my senior at the time putting on record thecoal supply commitment and the relation to the sizing penalty that was still at this stage sought of put on hold if I can say it like that.      Yes that’s correct sir.      Correct.      I can’t say.      Correct.      I was party to the negotiation team so I would like to believe that I did make inputs, I was not party to the drafting of this document, but surely my involvement in the negotiation team would have meant that there is comments in here that related to my involvement.      Correct.     Yes.      Yes it is.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Ja, that was the price at the time that we were talking about.      Yes.      Correct.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Correct.      To other power stations, correct?      Correct, yes.      Firstly it significantly impacted on the future supply, post December 2018, plus at the time when we were looking at this coal supplythere must have been a need for coal at the Tutuka and Arnot power stations as well, so it most definitely was not a very well received decision to say now we’re not going ahead and we’re losing these volumes.  That is on the second part of it.  On the first part of it what was said about it is that this coal supply would have been a coal supply over a conveyer belt to Hendriena Power Station and in hindsight where we are sitting today we are now trucking in all the coal to this power station, and at that moment in time because there was this hardship that was there, there was all these issues that was there we realised that there is the potential of losing this coal supply completely to Hendriena Power Station and we felt very strong about it.      Most certainly yes.    Correct.   I do not happen with that arbitration other than Glencore going into business rescue in August two months later.    Correct.    YEs.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Mr Kruger he is supporting me on a finance point of view and they will do this calculations.  Maybe for clarification point number 46 what I meant by this is that at the moment when Mr Kruger did this calculation I did not understand the method that this calculation was – this penalty was derived to how it was got  - how he got to that amount.  And the reason was because of this continued difference in interpretation on like for instance the application of the sizing.  Where the sizing is measured on a monthly average but applied on a three, four, three to seven day rolling period.  I am not trying to say that I do not agree to the 2.1 million but it was merely the way that it was calculated at that moment in time there was not a commonunderstanding between Glencore and Eskom this is how we are going to determine the qualities.    Yes Chair.    Good thank you Mr Chair.  What I tried to explain this morning was to say that at the time of this calculation being done to 2.1 million in this moment in time Mr Kruger’s reference point and the reference point that myself and Mr Needham from Glencore did was different.  In the sense that the Glencore view and the reference point that I used was to only account for the sizing penalty from May 2012 up until April 2013 which was the date when Optimum issued the letter indicating that they want to renegotiate the sizing penalty.  So I only considered the sizing penalty up until that period and if you consider that period it gave me this amount of around 720million.  If I consider Mr Kruger’s point of reference where he looked at the penalty period the sizing penalty for the full period it gets to 2.2 million.    Million correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct based on my interpretation of the contract.    Correct.    I would not say that.  If I can take you to Annexure 18 which is my calculation sheet that I attached to my statement.    Correct.    Correct.    I interpreted it in the same way.    One hundred percent yes.    The calculation to get to the R2.1 billion was correct and I supported.  My interpretation of the coal supply agreement from a contract management point of view said that I should not apportion the sizing penalty after Optimum issued a letter to ask can we please renegotiate the sizing which was in April13.  So if you take the same calculation that Mr Kruger did and the same calculation that I have in my annexure and you remove – and you add the sizing penalties from April, May 2013 until 2015 in fact I get to a value of R2.27 million.  So we are there and there about on the same volume    R723 million and it is based on the fact that I did not include the sizing penalty post the date that Optimum request the renegotiation.    He included the sizing post April 2013.    I excluded it.   Correct.    Mr Chair I do not know.    We do not have – we do not have that advice on what it should be.  Was the sizing penalty out at that post April 2013?  Yes it was out.  Should they have been penalised?  Maybe they should have been penalised.  From acontract management point of view there was just this let me call it this peg in the ground where we said well the penalties – because you did not contest the penalties it sensed that you – my sense was that you accepted it.  So up until April 2013 you did not contest the penalties so in my mind you accepted it but in April 2013 you asked, can we please renegotiate it?   And in my view that is a period where the sizing penalty should have been dealt with differently.  If a decision was to say what is the total penalty at this moment in time that needs to be levied most probably it would have been R2.1 billion.      Ja the sizing penalty post 2013 – ja.    Sizing penalties.    Ja.    Post April 2013.    Correct.    Correct.   The method of calculating the R2.1 billion penalty I agree with.  So the total of R2.1…    Exactly but the fact that I am including or excluding a portion that is an interpretation of the relationship or the communication that has happened under this contract.  So if you – if you consider the quality parameters and the penalty provisions against this contract and you do a calculation the calculation is R2.1 billion.  If you now go and look at what has happened in this life of the power station it means that somewhere in this life and that happened in April 13 there was an engagement which said we contest this sizing penalty and we wantto renegotiate it.  And yes there was a process that followed after that that then conclude at the time when even the corporation agreement was signed or the fourth addendum was signed and hence the reason why in the fourth addendum it was included to say that the parties need to agree on this historical penalty because there was no agreement.  There was no agreement between Glencore and Eskom at that moment in time on how it should be calculated.    Correct.   Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct yes.    Yes.    The calculation that I did actually came to R2.2 billion.   In my view it should have been somewhere around R2 billion because the agreement to exclude the size or the decision to exclude the sizing penalty post April 2013 when the request was made to exclude it.  That portion of penalties that was excluded which is the balance between R720 million and the R2.1 billion will most probably be something that the parties would have negotiated and agreed to.  But the penalty that was due to Eskom is the R2.1 billion.    Correct.    That is correct.    It would be guided by me it might not be the decision that is taken.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    No, nobody did.    No.    No I understand.    Just repeat?    For sure.    For sure yes.   I cannot answer that.    No.  In fact I only got to know about the settlement that was reached way, way after the settlement was done.  I only became aware of the settlement agreement for the first time on the 23 January 2018.    The 23 January 2018.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.   I am not aware that he did his own calculations.  I would like to think it is the same schedule as what Christo used, but I cannot.    Yes.    No, he did not.    No, I am not.    No.    I need to recall in January 2015 I wrote a letter to the Negotiation Team.    Giving a response on the discussion between myself and Mr Needham from Glencore around the penalty calculations.    I cannot recall if I actually mentioned the amount in that letter.    I do not think I referenced it, no.    I will gladly do that?   As part of the Negotiation Team with the negotiations around the fourth addendum or Cooperation Agreement I was tasked to engage with Mr Needham to get alignment and the same understanding on the penalty calculations on this Coal Supply Agreement.    And that memorandum was intended to just provide feedback to the Negotiation Team.  It did not conclude that there was alignment or agreement on the penalty calculation mechanism.  It merely provided feedback and an update on the discussion that I had with Mr Needham.   Yes, ja.    As I say I cannot recall if I put it into that document.  I will have to check.    That is correct.   I cannot say, but it must have been around that period, February 2015 up until when this document was updated.    I cannot recall that I did anything with it.  It was just a calculation that I did.    I might have discussed it with Mr Kruger.  I cannot.    Yes.    Okay.    I will have to go and check if I shared it with somebody.  I cannot recall.  I cannot recall.    100 percent sir.    Correct.    I have dealt with them once or twice, but not on an ongoing basis and I once attended, I think it was a creditors meeting that they chaired.    And I think there was a letter that I sent to themthat was addressed to them.    Something like that.    Correct, yes.    Correct.    I can recall it yes.    At that moment time there was a consultation withMr Nagar and the view was that that monies be withheld to compensate for the accrued penalties up to that moment in time, because Eskom’s view was that if Optimum goes in business rescue we will not get any monies.    Correct.    Yes.  That happened in August, yes.    Correct.    I cannot recall exactly.  There must have been some engagement.  I know that the suppliers were suspended around 3 August for about three/four days.    And then it was again suspended I think around 21 August and that continued to 3 September when they recommenced with.    With deliveries.    I cannot recall how we dealt with it at that moment in time.  It might have been communication through our legal team with them.  Surelythere was an engagement on my side to have an engagement with Optimum.  I cannot recall exactly if I communicated directly with them or if it was through our internal legal team.    Yes.    Correct.    I can only thing that the discussion was around the reinstatement of the supply.  It coincides with 4 September when the supplyreconvened.  I; and that Optimum agreed at that moment in time to say we will reconvene with the coal supply, but then you need to suspend these penalties.  As this proposal or this letter came from Cliffe Dekker and Hofmeyr which was our legal advisors there was obviously consultation between them and the Business Rescue Practitioners and they were talking and there was an agreement around this.  I think at that moment in time the most critical thing for us was to get the coal supply to Optimum, to Hendrina Power Station reinstated.    I cannot recall it, no.   For sure.    For sure.    Correct, yes.    Ja, the sample was collected through a sampleryes.    Yes I do.    It became evident at the time on 1 October when the crusher was switched off in the sampling plant that the issue all the time was actually related to the upgrade and the work that was done on the sampler around 2012 that introduced these increased fines that was reported.    Yes.  61 and 62, correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.  Correct.    Yes we did.    Yes we did.    Huh-uh.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes I did.    Yes.    Mr Chair at this moment in time I can take you to page 254.    The table under point number C.  What is of relevance is that this table chances the sizing parameters under the existing CSA for this period.  So one can see that the size fraction for the 0.81 where the previouscontract specification was 15 percent it is now increased to 20 percent.    Page 256.    In that table.    Under quality if you go right to the bottom.    It refers to the size specification on the smaller size 0.81 millimetre.   And it says   The existing contract specification at this moment in time that was 15 percent.  So in essence this memo is requesting a change in the quality parameters on the existing CSA for this period.       I think it was dealing Chair with the size fraction that was consistently high and above the 15% and attracting sizing penalties on an ongoing basis.       So at this moment in time there must have been some engagement to say if we can change it to 20% that is something that the mine can achieve, because that’s the only thing that I can see that was changed.       One five correct yes.       Correct.       That’s correct.       Correct.       Correct.       That is correct.       Pardon me Chair?       I cannot answer that question Chair, the requestor of this Ms Ayanda Nteta and I think that is the person to answer it.       That’s correct.       By the look of the signatures it was approved,yes.       Yes.       That’s correct yes.       Mr Chair I cannot recall requesting this document and I thought that it was of relevance to include it since this came at the hand of this sizing adjustment.  A similar document was requested in December 2013, a similar exercise was undertaken by a different company and in reality it basically made the same conclusion where it just talked to the impact of the markets and the different movements around it.      Correct.       Yes.       That is correct yes.       That’s correct.      That’s correct.       That’s correct.       That’s correct.      Correct yes.       That’s correct.       That’s correct.       Yes.       Correct yes.       According to my understand no it has not been given, something that I also want to mention is that I only became aware of this 4 th Addendum on the 8th of June 2017.       17.     I only saw the addendum for the first time on the 24th of July 2017, so on the 8th of June 2017 I became aware that there is a 4th addendum, it was in the process where we stated with the drafting of what was now the5th addendum and in that draft document we called it the 4th addendum and then we were told but there already a 4th addendum, you can’t draft a 4th addendum, so that happened around the 8th of June 2017 and as I say the first time that I saw this document was on the 24th of July 2017.         Correct yes.       Correct.       That’s correct.       That is correct.       I can only speculate Mr Maleka.       Very surprising.       Very much yes.       No.       Correct.       That’s correct.       You are correct Mr Maleka.       That is correct yes.       Thank you.       Mr Chair that is possible.       Mr Chair that is possible.       I do not 100% know it is there or it is not there.       I will not necessarily have seen it, it will be something that will be submitted to the fuel sourcing department because they are contracting these new agreements and transition things.       I could yes.       Correct.      That’s fine.     That’s correct.      Yes I do.            That’s correct.       Correct.       I am.       By the look of it yes.      I would not know the Business Rescue Plan would have been shared with Cliffe Dekker & Hofmeyr at that moment in time but I would not know.       No.       That is correct.      That is correct.       Thank you.       Correct.    That’s correct.   I do see the paragraph.    Yes.    That’s correct.    Yes.    I think it was rejected Chair as part of the 4thAddendum that was drafted at that moment in time, so yes the answer is it was rejected because that was terminated.    Correct yes.   It was eventually approved as part of the 5th addendum yes in – I think in January 2018.    Correct.    That’s correct.    That is correct.  In order to apply this price adjusted mechanism this escalation mechanism it needs to refer to a base price and at this moment in time the base price on this contract still moved back to the price that was in the second addendum which R115.00, 115.  So in order for that price to be current an assessment was done and it was calculated that that is a – the most representative price of what the coal price would have been at that moment in time not escalated and then being escalated going forward based on this matrix.    So Mr Chair at this moment in time I am taking you to page 315 paragraph number 7.  What was of significance is that the Hendrina stock days by this time has significantly reduced and were down at 25.2 days.  We were sitting in October it is just before the rainy season.  The December festive break is on its way when we traditionally have a road embargo period where we do not haul coal on the road.  And we were concerned that the stock days will drop below 20 days.  20 Days is of significance in terms of grid code compliance within generation where power stations stock days need to be maintained at and the intent of this document was to seek approval to increase deliveries via road to Hendrina Power Station.  At this moment in time it was evident that Optimum could not sustain or could not meet the burn requirement of the power station and we realised that we – we needed to get some additional coal in.  At this moment in time of drafting this note Eskom were in financial constraints and because of this significant cost impact as the coal operationsteam we felt that it is necessary to seek approval for this additional expenditure and the typical cost implication is listed under point number 8 where the typical cost for the coal that was then contracted to Hendrina on road is noted against the cost of coal at that moment in time from Optimum via conveyer.  Bullet point number 9 then reflects the additional coal cost and then the recommendation on the next page then seeks the support in order to bring in additional coal to Hendrina Power Station to recover the stock days back to around 30 days.    Ja Liketh, the Liketh contract, the Liketh KK Pit 5 contract that is mentioned here is a contract that what – at that moment was contracted for Hendrina.  So historically they did deliver coal to Hendrina but just in lower volumes because the makeup volumes was low and at this moment in time we had to significantly increase which were not budgeted for.    Correct yes.    But is was an already existing contract.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    No Mr Maleka to – the additional cost under point number 9 and it is around R312,00 per tonne.    So under point number  it is explained what the Liketh cost component is at that moment in time R494,99 per tonne that was delivered cost.    So that is coal and transportation included and then the coal cost from Optimum Hendrina at that moment in time was R182,89 so …   The variance is the additional part correct yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes it was given the – on the next page, page 316 the document was signed and it was signed by Mr Edward Mabolane on behalf of Matshela Koko as group executive generation.  So most probably at that time he was acting in that position.  Well he however do limit the volume.    And that is – there is this handwritten comment where he says that he does improve – he does approve to only import 100 kilo tonnesand he also gives the date by when it can be done.    I will try my best.    So Mr Mabolane makes a *with a footnote where    So if I read it his approval is granted for 100 kilo tonnes at a certain date and then the station need to perform on two aspects which is either to recover the supply from the mine.  So meaning that there is something that gets corrected there or alternatively to get additional reclaiming infrastructure to move the coal from their coal reserves that they have.    Correct.    That is correct.    The reason for the shortfall was the fact that Optimum just came out of business rescue and during the business rescue period Optimum basically delivered whatever they could deliver.  So even though the contract was 458.3 kilo tonnes per month if one goes back the actually deliveries were more often than not ranging between 300 and 400.  So over a period of time while Optimum were in business rescue the stock levels slowly depleted and at this moment in time thesignificance of the risk was the upcoming rainy season as well as the December festive break.      Mainly yes.    I do yes.    That is correct yes.    I think the only thing that was new at this moment is the new management at the mine but that is it.   Yes I did.    Mr Chair unfortunately I cannot be in two places at once.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I do not recall the response to that letter specifically and I can go and check on the records if there is something but I think the next annexure refers to a memo that Mr Mazibuko then sent to the Chief Procurement Officer on this same matter.      That is correct yes Sir.    Chair that signature is not Mr Koko’s signature that was Mr Willie Majola’s signature.    On his behalf.    Correct.    That is correct it is supported.    I do Sir.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I do yes.    That is correct so at this moment in time theadditional coal that was delivered via road to make up for the balance is referred to here as R500 a tonne delivered cost.     “Should Eskom consider decide to implement the existing agreement Eskom would have to change Optimum’s shortfall to supply penalties in the region of R585 million.  It is Eskom’s view that this will probably cripple the company and put it into liquidation.  The next best alternative option for Eskom would exceed the cost of Hendrina Coal Supply.  It therefore makes business sense to keep Optimum afloat and supplying Eskom at the current terms and conditions of the contract even if the supply is reduced.”   Mr Chair I cannot really understand the first sentence that talks about the short supply and it talks about short supply penalties of the region of R585 million.  But I think the paragraph continues to say that these penalties need to be waived I think it is implied.    That does help thank you Chair.  Thank you.    So I – what my deduction is at this moment in time is that if the existing agreement just carries on there is a penalty that is due for short supply in the region of R585 million.  It then carries on to say that – that it is Eskom’s view that if this penalty is applied that it will cripple the company, put it in liquidation and that will imply that Hendrina will not get coal supply from Optimum and that will have an even worst effect if I can say it like that.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    And I think it is in line Chair with the request that was originally made that detailed point number 5.3 of the cooperation agreement the then cooperation agreement with Glencore that refers to the suspension of penalties.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Ja if I read this point number 9.3 it does says that Eskom to reserve its rights on penalties so yes, correctly.    It means that the penalties will not be levied.   That is correct.    I do see it yes.    I do.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes Mr Chair it is the same.   It is the same.    I do recall being engaged by Mr Mazibuko around the coal burn requirements for Hendrina Power Station at that moment in time.  So, yes I was involved in that.    Correct.    That is correct.    I am here, yes.    That is correct.    Mr Chair I know that the banking details had to be cancelled on the transition of the sale between Glencore and Tegeta and that went into a Bank of Baroda account initially and then I think at some stage it changed to a Nedbank account.  So my interpretation from that was that it is not an Optimum account.  It was a Tegeta account.    Yes.    That is correct.    I have met them and I have dealt with them a couple of times.    I agree.    I agree Chair.    Definitely yes.    That is correct, yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair I am not 100 percent sure but it was in December 2015.  I am not sure of the exact date.   Chair I have it that it came into existence on 13 January and that it is as per paragraph 2 on page 354.    Chair Mr Maleka indicated that it commenced on 16 January and I just clarified to say that based on point number two it seems that it commenced on13 January.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the coal that came from Optimum?    Yes it had.    Yes, via road trucks.    That is correct.    The conversion from Rand per gigajoule to Rand per ton one simply just multiplies it by the calorific value.  So it will be that value of 24,01 multiplied by 20.41.    I need to clarify that the calorific value recorded in that quality table at the top.    Is on air freight basis.  It is not as received basis and normally the price is recorded in as received.  So if one just continues reading that    Price.   That sounds more or less correct, yes.    Yes Chair it will be.  What needs to be notedhowever is that it is a different quality parameter which does make a difference and then I just looked in my records the January 2016 price was actually R469,50.    469,50.    Chair can I just clarify something?    I think this initial extension was only for three months.  It was only for February, March and April not five months.    That is correct.  If one goes to page 382 it has got the contract coal supply schedule and in there one can see that the volumes were planned for February 2016, March and April 2016 for a total of 500 000 tons and 11.5 million gigajoules.    I notice that as well.    Please.       Chair can I maybe just assist?  Paragraph 83.    Reads that the contract with Tegeta was extended for a further three months in February.  So in February it was extended for three months.  It was February, March, April and then again it was extended for another five months in May.    For May, June, July, August.    So it reads fine.  It reads fine.    No.    No we do not need to.    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes I do.    That is correct.    Yes sir.    Correct.    Yes that is correct.   I think I need to put context to it.    And I want to make reference just too where Hendrina was at that moment in time.    So if we go back to February 2016 the Hendrina stock base was very high.  The stock base was around 52 days.    Which is abnormally high for Hendrina.    However during that period in time if one lookedat the burn that the station was burning and for February itself it was fine, but from March onwards we see that the volumes that Optimum delivered versus what the station is burning there is a slight shortfall which in principle is not a big problem if you have high inventory levels which we had at this moment in time.    But what we have, what I have seen is that where we started at 52 days in January at the end of this period in September when these short term agreement ended to Arnot the Hendrina stock based ended a 29 days.  So it was very clear that the coal that was supposed to go to Hendrina did not go to Hendrina, because we had to use our inventory.  So the 29 days is still not that of a bigconcern.  It is manageable, but what I wanted to try and bring across with this statement was to say that during this period when Optimum was supplying coal to Arnot it was clear that the coal supply to Hendrina Power Station reduced.    It [intervenes].    It was clear that the coal supply to Hendrina Power Station reduced.    So they did not meet the burn requirement on a month to month basis from January to September 2016.  We; it was not a huge risk, because we had high inventory levels, but I just wanted to bring that across that the Arnot deliveries were made at the cost of coal supply going to Hendrina.  I think the more important is what Mr Maleka has touched on was the one end you are sitting witha cost, with Rand per ton around R470 versus a price on the other hand which was around R200.  So that is a huge difference.  So one could argue why not take the additional coal under the Hendrina Agreement at the Hendrina price.    It could have been possible Chair.    However what is important to note is that the coalthat went to Arnot was of a higher grade than the coal that went to Hendrina Power Station.  So just buying the Hendrina speckle at R200 a ton will most probably not, would have been accepted by Arnot as a delivery, because the coal that went from Optimum Colliery to Arnot was the portion of the coal that they actually allocated to their export business.  So they were making that export coal available to actually take that to Arnot.    Yes.    Correct.    At Hendrina?    Correct.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Meridian.    Correct.    Chair I would rather reserve my comment on that since the owner of the mine made a comment on it I will just be talking around my understanding on the processing plant and how it works, which in my view afforded an opportunity to get a higher grade coal spec out of that same plant, the plant that was currently in operation, but let me rather not talk about it, let the specialists talk about it around their own mine.   Yes sir.    Chair that is not so, I do not keep records of these payment control sheets, just in my line of work these control sheets I do sign them, it was not the first time that I see it, but I do not keep record of them.    I got to know about it on the 3rd of May Chair.    2016.    Yes.    Chair I think it was made on the 18th of April.    Yes.   I’m just reading from the payment sheet so I’m just reading the date that’s on it.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct yes.    Not at all Chair.    I first became aware of it Chair on the 5th of May when I was handed the payment sheet for signature, for my signature and in my view payment processing and on that date I requested supporting documentation.  Initially when the management accountant brought me the payment back I immediately went toMr Mazibuko and I said to him that I don’t carry any knowledge of this, how do we need to deal with it, we had a look at it and we agreed that we need supporting documentation.  The supporting documentation was provided, after which we signed it off and basically my signing on that control sheet was basically as Mr Nagar, as indicated to move the funds from the then purchase order that was used under the Brakfontein contract to the purchase order under the Optimum order to get the Arnot contract.    That’s correct sir.    Mr Maleka, Chair, I can’t provide an answer for it, I will just speculate, I ...    It is a matter of concern.    Chair I did not ask them that, what I did ask them is at the time when I had to sign the transfer of these funds between two different accounts I was extremely reluctant to sign this document and that’s why I immediately went to Mr Mazibuko and said to him that we need to get supporting documents.  It was at that point in time that the Minutes of the Board decision was provided and I think the position just is that if the Board made the decision then surely I can’t stand in their way.  At least by that time we also realised that the payment were done, the accountant told me that the payment was done, so ...    Not covering my tracks sir, with respect.    The reason why I signed this document was because the monies had to be transferred out of the Brakfontein account into the Optimum account and that is the reason why this was signed.    Sir with all respect Chair I never used that different contract number to process the payment, the payment was processed by somebody else, without my knowledge again an order number that I created, that I need to admit, because the order numbers gets created quarterly, so I did create that order number but I never used the wrong order number to process that payment.    That’s correct yes.    No that is wrong.    At this moment in time when I did this transaction there was no order number for this activity, there was a payment made under the Brakfontein contract, so that payment, the incorrect account was used to make thatprepayment so at this moment in time when this document came to me and I had to transfer the funds under the correct contract I had to go into our accounting system, into our SAP system and create a purchase order in order for this to take effect and that is also the document that’s attached, that’s one my annexures.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair I’m fine, thank you very much.    Okay.    Chair I was initially only handed a cover, a front page with an invoice and had to sign that, when I sign invoices it always has supporting documentation.  The fact that this was a prepayment amount obviously made it different so you will not have quality sheets and payment calculation sheets and maybe supporting documentation out of the contract and so, but for me signing of this significant big amount on two documents made me very reluctant and it was at that point then that the Board Minutes were presented and all those approving and supporting documents and once that was attached and Mr Mazibuko and myself read through it we decided that we will sign it.    Mr Chair no it did not reflect that it was a prepayment, if one look at the invoice it’s a normal invoice with volumes on it, but me being responsible for this contract I knew that there was not such payment like this due, so I knew that this payment is out of the ordinary, that I did not know yes.    Correct, correct.    That is correct yes.   Correct.    Mr Chair it’s the documentation that’s currently attached to this document so it was an extract of the shareholders and Tegeta exploration meeting that was held where the decision was made for this prepayment and how the coal will be supplied to recover it as well as the minutes or the extract from the minutes that was from Board teleconference that was held on the 11 th of April approving this prepayment.    Chair in my nine and a half years in this capacitythis was the first time.    Yes.    No.    The moment that I ...(intervention)     Definitely, it is not regular and it did worry me, but as I say I sign multiple payments like this on a monthly basis, this was the first time that I had and it really did make me feel very uncomfortable, that’s why I immediately went and engaged my senior on it and consulted with him.    That’s correct.    That’s correct yes.    That’s correct yes.    Mr Chair when I read the agreement that was attached to the payment pack I could see that Eskom will get the value for that prepayment, it was obviously something that I would have to manage because it now meant that there was a payment made up front and we will now get the coal delivered and I sort of will work on a rebate account the whole time until the whole money has been recovered, so it was definitely doing things back to front, but when I read the agreement I felt comfortable that we will get the value for what was paid.  Yes it isputting trust in people delivering, and maybe one could question that, but ja, that’s it.    Yes I think there would have been yes.    For sure.    I did, I definitely did it, I did it the moment that I got the payment pack for approval, normally I will just sit at my desk, I will work through the normal documentation, sign it, it will go to my senior and he will sign it, and this daywhen it happened I immediately took the whole pack and I went to his office and I immediately discussed it with him.    I cannot recall what he said, no.    Mr Petros Mazibuko.    Mazibuko yes.    That’s correct Chair.    That is fine.   100%. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  100% and Mr Chair I think that partly also contributed to this price where we – how we got to this price.      It’s common knowledge, or public knowledge at this moment that we know that the Optimum price at this moment in time was around R200 a ton, so to sit and look at an amount of R442 a ton that’s a significant jump, but the coin side to this is exactly what you’re saying, it was contracting coal from another source and bringing by a truck most probably landing it at this cost or slightly more.    I agree the much better could have been to just default to the original coal supply agreement.    Correct.    That’s correct.    Yes.   That is correct.    It’s most probably currently getting its coal from three or four different other sources, and it’s not all directly close to Hendriena Power Station, it is in the Witbank area but it’s multiple deliveries from multiple sources.    Yes, I do have some amounts with me and if I try and relate it Mr Chair to the period which was around June 2013 – so – June 2015, and I just go back to the cost of coal delivered over that period at that moment in time the Hendriena cost was around R159 a ton, and the landed cost for coal delivered via road trucks was around R450 a ton.    Correct.    Correct.   I would like to think that it was shared with the negotiation team at that moment in time, this proposal was addressed to Mr Johann Bester, as the General in Fuel Sourcing, which was part of the negotiation team at that stage, so I can’t recall exactly how I got hold of it but I would like to think that it was shared in a forum where as a negotiation team on the Eskom side met to say well there’s a revised proposal on the table because ultimately this was something different to the previous mandate that was compiled for submission to the Board.    Correct yes.    Yes.     That is correct Mr Chair, what is of importance to note as well is that this quality parameter also now again defaulted to the original contract qualities and not the higher qualities as what was negotiated.     That’s correct.    I agree with it.    Yes.    Correct.   That is correct, I think Mr Chair what is important to just also note if we’re trying to compare apples with apples because we’re relating this to the mandated document is to note that the original mandated document for this period was R500 a ton.    So the price is now higher.    Again it is still at the original contract qualities not at the higher qualities that we negotiated.    So most probably at this moment in time this coal will not be suitable for Arnot so one is losing some alternative but I agree if thestrategy was to secure for the long term this does deal with that.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct ja.    That’s correct yes.    Yes I will because I would like to confirm that the price is reasonable.    That’s correct yes.   I think it was reasonable, one needs to consider that at this moment in time the price of coal at the Hendriena Power Station was maybe around R175 a ton, so R300 a ton for the same quality might seem like a lot of money, but obviously this opens up that extended 15 year window with some security, so I think it’s reasonable, considering the mandated document that was drafted this is a good proposal.    Yes I do.    No I was not told.    No I was not able.    Yes.     Not really what I could recall.     Correct.    That’s correct yes.    That’s correct.    No I was never consulted.    Yes.    I’m not sure if I understand the question?    Ja. 
MS KATE HOFMEYR:  [Indistinct].    I calculate it.
