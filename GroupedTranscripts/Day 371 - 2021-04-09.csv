CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Are you ready?    Via video.    Yes.   Yes let us do that first.  You can do it from where you are if your mic is working.    Good morning. ADV    You lowered your voice as you said your name.   So that (inaudible).    Thank you.  Okay good morning Mr Mahlobo.    Good morning, good morning.  Thank you for making yourself available to us this the commission.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Yes I do not know whether there is a delayed transmission of the voice.  Mr Mahlobo are you experiencing any problems with hearing us?    Oh okay alright thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you.  The – I hope the transmitters have got the spelling for the first name right.  Mr Mahlobo do you want to spell Mbangiseni for the benefit of thetranscribers?    Thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Mr Pretorius.    Yes.  Mr Pretorius.    That is Bundle SSA bundle 1 which is has got Exhibit YY1 and then there is SSA bundle 2.  I think it is Bundle 2 that – in which we find Mr Maholobo’s affidavit.    Is that right?    Okay.    Ja.  Okay.   753?    737.    Yes he says he does have it.    That is the signature above the word Deponent – there are two signatures.    Well  1. If you have a written statement that you would like to read out before we proceed with your evidence I would need to see it first to see whether it does not implicate anybody who would complain that somebody gave evidence about them that implicates them without Rule 3.3 Notices being given to them.  If – soI will not allow it until I have seen it.  You know.   So If I know that I have not been given at least I am not aware that I have been given anything.  So it may be that if you have it as something that I can look at during the break and at some stage before you end your evidence you might then get that opportunity.If you do not have a statement that you want to read out but you have remarks to make it becomes more of a challenge because we do not know what you are going to say until you say it.But I see you seem to have some document – do you have a statement that you wanted to read?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.  Okay.    It is a – yes.  But you say it is in the form of a document?    You say it is in the form of a document?    Okay    Ja.  Okay.  If – if…   Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay if you are not going to...    If you are not going to mention anybody’s  name or organisation or entity in – by way of implicating them Mr Pretorius what is your attitude.  I think I could allow it if he gives me that assurance?    Ja.    Just to be sure.    Ja.  Mr Mahlobo  I see there is no signal. MINISTER    Yes.    Oh you can hear me?    Ja.   So – but you say you assure me …    You will not implicate anybody and you will not mention anybody’s name or entity, is that correct?    Okay do you need two minutes, three minutes, how much do you need?  Five minutes?    Three minutes.  Okay I will allow you.    Three minutes ja.  Okay.    Okay.  We do not seem to at the moment…    We do not see you at the moment. MINISTER    I am saying we do not have your picture on the screen.    At the moment but if you can proceed it is fine.  Oh – oh you do not appear in one screen but you appear in another one.  You can proceed ja. MINISTER    No thank you very much Mr Mahlobo we –you certainly kept your promise in that regard.  Thank you for that.  I just want to assure you that the commission also appreciates the sensitivity of matters relating to intelligence and that as the commission hears evidence it is alive to the intricacies of intelligence.   Obviously the commission will also not want to be in breach of any law itself nor will it want any witness to be in breach of – of the law and certainly matters of criminality should not be swept under the carpet so that – that is quite important.But I also want to mention to you because you did say that you noticed that there are some documents that might not have been included in the Rule 3.3 Notice to you that you may be asked about and you indicated that you would do your best to assist and deal with them. I just want to assure you that the commission remains very committed to fairness to everybody and we – we will keep on trying to make sure that there is fairness to you as well.Where there are serious challenges articulate them, we will look at them and where decisions need to be taken they will be taken but certainly there is no intention to ambush you or to ambush any witness so there will be an attempt to try and make sure that there is no unfairness to you.Where it is necessary that you get more time in order to deal with certain issues that can be explored within the constraints of the commission in terms of time.  But thank you very much.  Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Oh.    Ja.    Yes.    Paragraph 15?    50.    Of Mr Mahlobo’s affidavit?    Oh those names should not have been mentioned is that right?    Oh they are – these are pseudo names?   Ja.    Ja.    Okay no that is fine.  No thank you.      With small things ja.    Okay no that is fine.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay alright.  Do you want just to place yourself on record – you might have done so previously.    But you maybe do so again.    Okay thank you.     Mr Pretorius I wonder whether maybe during the break there should be a redaction or something on this paragraph or     Ja I am just – I am just concerned as that – as long as it remains here you know one is not compatible.    Ja.    Okay alright.  You heard already Mr Pretorius confer – got Mr Mahlobo to confirm that this ishis affidavit.  Do you – are you asking me to admit it as an Exhibit?  His affidavit?    Hm.  We did not admit it as an Exhibit as yet.  Do you want me to admit it as an Exhibit?    What exhibit should it be?    YY13.    Ja.    Yes the affidavit of Mbangiseni David Mahlobo which starts at page 737 of SSA Bundle 2 will be admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit YY13.  Okay alright.      One second Mr Pretorius.  This screen here or the technicians is it not possible to make sure it works?  Somebody maybe could it - if they can attend to it without us adjourning.       H’m.  Yes.     Yes.  Also, the technicians could look at the sound.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.  Okay, we will take a short adjournment to give the technicians time to deal with this matters.  We hope five minutes will be enough.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes, Mr Pretorius.    H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     Mr Mahlobo, can you hear us?     H’m?     We can hear you.     H’m?     Yes.     You cannot hear him.     H’m.     Ja-no, no.       He will try.  Ja.  Okay alright.    I think it was Ms Letsatsi-Duba in 2018 or – if I am not mistaken.       I think he is frozen.     You ...[intervenes]   I am sorry Minister Mahlobo ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  While you were speaking, your picture froze and I do not whether, when it froze, youwere speaking but we could not hear you or whether you were not speaking.  I think you might have to repeat what you were saying.     [laughs]  Well, I see that when I just ask you to repeat, the screen goes black, Mr Mahlobo.  So let us try again.  Just say what you said again.     Oh, sorry.  It ...[intervenes]     H’m?     Yes, we can hear you.     Yes.     [laughs]     H’m.  Well ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Well, Mr Mahlobo, you are not the first witness to include their mother tongue when they are testifying in English.  Others have done so, but it does create some challenges because we do not have an interpreter at hand.  So do your best to make sure that you speak English.     [laughs]     But I think.  Mr Pretorius, for what it is worth.  When Minister Mahlobo referred to use isiZulu to say... [speaking vernacular].  I think that means, you were laying a foundation for questions to come later.    So he was saying, he will not be able to assist you while you lay the foundation but he will assist you when you ask him directly on certain issues later.  Minister Mahlobo, is that what you meant?     Okay alright.     Hey, this technology is really giving us problems today.     We can hear you but your picture froze for a few seconds earlier and we could not hear. MINISTER     Yes, yes.     We did, but I think Mr Pretorius has a suggestion.     H’m.     Yes.     H’m.     Ja.     Are you not too far from where we are Mr Mahlobo?  Is there a chance that we could adjourn and you could come to the venue and give evidence in person in order to avoid these technical problems?     Well, from Pretoria to here should take about, what, an hour or so?  We would be prepared to adjourn and – for that time, because these technical problems are just becoming more and more intolerable.  Would that be fine with you?     Yes.       [laughs]  You are not allowed to break the law Mr Mahlobo.     [laughs]       What, quarter to twelve?    Yes, yes.     Yes.  So what, half-past eleven?     Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.   MINISTER     Okay thank you very much.  Okay thank you.  You can get onto the road.  That is fine.       [laughs]       Yes.     Oh, okay ...[intervenes]      It is an obligation.     Oh ...[intervenes]      Just wait for the first one, ja.     Ja.     No, he is – I think he is comfortable.  Because we do not want to try another one and find that one is also problematic.     So if he can come here straightaway, that is much more helpful.       Oh, okay.       Yes, but I think you can get onto the road, Mr Mahlobo.  We will adjourn just now.  Your counsel was just mentioning – was talking about the other alternative but we – I think we agreed that the best thing is for you to get onto the road and be here at half-past eleven.     Sorry?     Okay alright.  Okay alright.     Who is that?    That is fine.  We are going to adjourn.  Mr Mahlobo says he will be here before quarter to twelve.  We adjourn.     You have arrived, Mr Mahlobo.     Thank you.  Mr Pretorius, are you ready?     Thank you.     Before you proceed, must just mention that it is “mtiyane” [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Oh, okay.     Thank you.  Mr Pretorius?     Oh, you got it right this time.     Ja, no, that is fine.  I assume that when you talk about names that were mentioned you are not talking today, you are talking about sometime in the past.     I do not remember that.     Yes, yes.MINISTER     Ja.     No, you cannot.     Ja.     Well, I was going to ask you whether part of your concern is that answering the question whether there were prosecutions following your instruction for the implementation of the remedial action whether that might lead to you indirectly disclosing that remedial action may have been recommended, whether that might be part of your concern.     And it has been declassified.     Maybe let me ask this question and in part it might or might not assist, Mr Pretorius.  You gave instructions for the implementation of the remedial action, is that correct?     And the person whose duty it was to make sure that your instruction was carried out was the accounting office, is that right?     Did you at any stage get to know whether your instruction was carried out?     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.      Ja.  No look, I think you can accept that both from Mr Pretorius’ point of view and from my point of view, we certainly do not want you to act in breach of the law, it is just going to be an attempt on your part and on his part and on my part …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, ja.  I thought you might be able to say, without talking about details, I thought you might be able to say look, I am aware that my instruction was carried out or I am aware that in some respects my instruction was carried out but in some respects it might not have been without talking about in what respects.     Okay, okay.     Okay.     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes, okay.  Mr Pretorius?     Maybe you can just provide the spelling for her surname? Ja, okay, alright, just for the transcribers.     Ja, they are generally known.     So what you are saying is, if the DG – if you are asked about a particular matter that relates to intelligence in an operational way, if it was done by a DGor DDG even though generally a DG is known but in relation to that particular project you would not be allowed to mention the name.  That is what you are saying.     Ja. MINISTER     Operations.     Yes, those are too wide.MINISTER     Ja.     Okay.     Yes, yes.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Pretorius?     Ja.     Ja.  Let us leave it where it is.  Mr Pretorius said he is happy to proceed.  Let us leave it where it is.  Ja, okay.     Yes, you cannot remember whether this would have been January 2021 this year or last year towards the end – that you cannot remember.     They were received this year.     That can be checked.     Well, maybe let us do this.  In paragraph 4 – I think paragraphs 4 and 5 of your affidavit, Mr     Ja.     Okay, Mr Pretorius I suggest that we  do the following.  To the extent that, in relation to the exchange of documents there are some things that Mr Mahlobo’s affidavit that do not accord with the legal team’sunderstanding.  Can we have an arrangement in terms of which discussion, maybe during the lunch break can be had between yourself and Mr Mahlobo’s legal team so that, if possible, later on you can just place on record something that’s kind of agreed to say, that’s the position, if it’s not agreed we can then take it from there…[intervenes].     Yes.  Ja then you are done with the…[intervenes].     Mr Pretorius my inclination is this, one, what I have understood from Mr Mahlobo and his legal team is that they’re not taking the point that, because, on Mr Mahlobo’s version they didn’t receive certain documents timeously, they don’t want to continue.  My understanding is that Mr Mahlobo’s position is, I will try and deal with all issues that I can deal with, even in regard to documentsthat I might have received late but where I am unable to, I will say so.  So, my inclination is that there needs to be that discussion that I talked about and at a later stage a decision – you can indicate to me whether you do want to place certain things on record and that will be fine, but it seems to me that that discussion should precede that.     Ja do that.     Ja, okay, alright, my ruling is that there should be that discussion and at a later stage if the Commission’s legal team wants to place anything on record, we can take it from there at that stage.  So – did I summarise your position correctly that even with regard to documents that you may have received, on your version, late, you are here, you are prepared to answer as far asyou can?     Ja.     Okay, alright.     Well, he’s responding, Mr Mahlobo to what you said, you said certain witnesses came here and gave the impression that the white paper is law, I think,that’s what you said.     Ja his response is, we’ll look at whether that’s what those witnesses said, ja, but that’s how, at least, I understood you.    Okay, alright.      Ja.     Maybe I could say, Mr Mahlobo, I think Mr Pretorius wanted to establish whether you are able to say, in relation to that sentence, you are able to say, for example, there was no structure that assisted with this type of accountability, there was no structure that assisted with this type of situation and this – the absence of that structure created these types of problems.  I was thinkingmaybe he had…[intervenes].     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     I understand you to be saying, and I just want you to confirm that my understanding is correct, I understand you to be saying, when you took office as Minister of State Security you found, among other things, that there were allegations of political interference in matters relating to your portfolio, you understood that they were not new, they had been there for a long time you go back to 1995 and you say allegations of political interference have continued, continued during your term in office, they continue even today.  Is my understanding, what I say correct?     Okay, Mr Pretorius?    I hear you battle when you are facing this side. MINISTER    Just before you proceed Mr Mahlobo Mr Pretorius is going to tell me if I misunderstood his question.  He was asking whether you agree or you do not agree that a Minister should not be involved in those matters.  Now should not might mean you should not because it would be unlawful to do so but should not might mean that although itmight be lawful maybe for other reasons such as ethics and other things it might not be…    Yes.    Ja okay.    You can keep your mic on Mr Mahlobo at all times.    Ja.    Yes.  You made a promise earlier on youremember not to revert to your mother tongue.  You have forgotten that.  You want to just say that again for – so that everybody knows what you were saying.    Ja.    Okay.  Alright.   Well Mr Mahlobo I guess I should ask you whether I should keep mine on.     Ja. MINISTER    Ja.  I guess they take notes when I cough.    Even when I cough or sneeze.  Yes Mr Pretorius.  I see it is one o’clock.  Because of the problems of technology we have lost quite some time this morning.  I wonder whether we should take less than an hour for our lunch or whether we should stick to an hour.  So I am just checking so that I do not impose.    Hm.   Yes.    So your suggestion is maybe let us continue and then take the lunch break a little – a little later.    And make some progress.    Hm.  Mr Pretorius what do you think?    Ja, no I – I do not have a problem.    Sorry.    Yes.    Ja, no – yes sometimes I do but I think it is fine.  Maybe not for an hour as such but maybe – let us see how far we are at half past one.    And then maybe we can go up to quarter to two.    Yes.  And I think your Counsel is fine as well with that.    Yes okay alright let us continue.    Oh the lighting is not good there.     Oh, ja.     I guess that your answer is that your reference to labour in that sentence includes both tradeunions or activities where trade unions are involved and activities where trade unions are not involved?     Yes.     Well, you see, as I understand it.  Quiteoften when the word labour is used, it may be understood to include unions and sometimes not to include it.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja-no, no that is fine.     Yes.     Ja, ja.    Ja.     Yes.    Yes-no, that is fine.  Let us take thelunch break now.  Let us – let me see whether we agree to take less than an hour and if so, shall we talk about 30-minutes or 45-minutes?  You are happy with 30-minutes, Mr Pretorius?     Okay.     40?     [laughs]  Okay alright.      [laughs]  We are, unfortunately, notproviding your with lunch Mr Mahlobo.     Or maybe I should not say that because I do not know everything that happens.  So it may well be that witnesses are provided ...[intervenes]  MINISTER     Ja.     [laughs]      Okay alright.  Let us ...[intervenes]      Ja, that is fine.  We are at twenty-seven minutes to two.  Shall we, let us resume at twenty past two?     Okay.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS    Okay.  Let us continue.      Ja, let him finish the question.    Ja.     Ja.    Ja, okay.  Let him, Mr Pretorius.    Ja, let me ask this way because I understood Mr Pretorius’s question in relation to the first sentence of paragraph 40 in a certain way.  I understood that sentence, I understood Mr Pretorius’s question to be asking whether in that first sentence ...[intervenes]     Paragraph 40, first sentence   But does it mean, because this is what I am checking.  Does it mean that what you are saying is you are not necessarily talking about the fact that the labels that might be reflected in terms of the document might be misleading to somebody who was not involved in labelling, but you are talking about the fact that anyone who wants to know exactly what is there and what is covered there, andlet us assume it is somebody who is authorised to know, they will not find that the records correctly reflect the situation.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.    Well, I thought that maybe not now, but earlier on, I thought that you were saying that the situation is such that the name of the project for example that could be given to the project, to a project, could be misleading.  It could be about, it could give the impression that it is about tin roofs, when it is about complete something else.  So and I thought you were saying in that environment that is acceptable.     Mr Pretorius?    Ja.     Ja.  Mr Pretorius, is that fine in terms of your planning?      Ja.     Ja.    Yes.     Mr Pretorius?     Well, you …[intervenes]     Well, you mentioned a certain affidavit that you said, as I understood you, should have been presented to you but has not been presented to you that I think you say indicates that you were not involved in something that you were alleged to have been involved in.  I just want to check that because obviously we want all facts to be in the open.  Do you know anything, Mr Pretorius?     No, no, that is fine, the only one I am asking about is the one he talked about in particular where he was saying there is an affidavit that is in the possession of the Commission from I think Dorothy, some pseudo name, that I think exonerates him.     Ja.     Okay.     Okay.     Yes.    No, that is fine, what I do not want or what I did not want is a situation where you have made a statement that somebody within the Commission has concealed something that should be brought to your attention and we do not find out what is happening.  Maybe we should leave it on the basis that Mr Pretorius will investigate and try and establish where this affidavit is and then take it from there.     No, no, no, wait, Mr Mahlobo.     Yes, wait, let Mr Pretorius finish.    Okay.     Okay, alright.     Ja?     Can I ask you this question?  What you have told me now, does it amount to saying as far as you are concerned and as far as your client is concerned, the Commission does not have an affidavit that contradicts what your client previously said in the affidavit as far as you and your client are concerned?     Okay, alright, what I propose should happen is from the – obviously there needs to be some investigation or discussion of some kind because from Mr Mahlobo’s side he is definite, I think that there is such a affidavit which contradicts what Dorothy said previouslyand he believes that the Commission is in possession thereof and certainly Mr Pretorius has indicated that he is not aware of that.  So at some stage, at a later stage, there would need to be a clearing of the air to establish exactly where everything is but maybe let us say everybody has noted what everybody has said and let us continue for now.     Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Well, Mr Mahlobo, I must say that my own understanding of what you said included that you said that affidavit has been hidden from you or something like that.  Did I misunderstand you?    Ja.     But I just want to check whether I misunderstood you.  Okay, you are not alleging that [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Okay, alright.    Ja.     Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?     Somebody will assist you.  Maybe Ms September can help him to identify the right bundle.  Bundle 1.       I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, I was busy …[intervenes]     Hang on, Mr Mahlobo, I did not hear the page because I was trying to get the attention of my registrar unsuccessfully, so what is the page?     Okay, alright.     Can you see that – can you see - you know, under paragraph 3 can you see it says “Budget reprioritisation.”  Can you see that heading?      And then there are two paragraphs below that heading, can you see that?     Yes, the second one starts with “This means...”     And then below that last one then there is a table there which has got columns.  The first column, the heading for the first column is sub programmes andthen the heading for the second column is “Project/Activity”.     You can see it now?     I think it is 6.2, Mr Pretorius.  Or is it – oh no, ja, 5.2.     Are programmes as contemplated here within the environment of SSA part of projects all the time or can there be programmes that are not under projects?     Yes but hang on, just focus on my question, is the position that in certain circumstances within the context of SSA, maybe of the whole public service but let us say SSA, is the position that programmes can sometimes be under projects and sometimes they can be independent of projects?    Yes.     Yes.     Is it a project that can be under a programme [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Oh, okay.     Oh, so the project is – can be part of a programme but a programme cannot be part of a project.     Ja, okay, alright.     Mr Pretorius, I am not sure whether you question was answered but you would know. ADV PRETORIUS     Hang on, hang on, Mr Mahlobo, let Mr Pretorius …[intervenes]     Yes, okay.  You see Mr Mahlobo we will make - I know you want progress, I want progress, Mr Pretorius wants progress, everybody wants progress. I accept that when you answer certain questions, you may have to explain yourself but where you are able to answer briefly, and to the point, it helps, you know…[intervene]     Ja, do that but when I say that, I do not want you to feel that where there is a need to explain something you are being suppressed, because that is not the case.  So let us all try Mr Pretorius, I was not sure whether you had actually formulated your question to Mr Mahlobo when he responded.  I know that you had said that in effect, if you put together those, the first three bullet points under 5.2 you get the total which is reflected in the fourth bullet point.  But I am not sure whether you took it further and I thought you were going to take it further.     Ja.     Ja, can…[intervene]     Before he does, he goes there Mr Pretorius may I ask this Mr Mahlobo, if you look at page 34 the same documents that we have been looking at, page 34 where your signature appears. Can you see there is a line above your signature,     Yes, okay alright.  And now, you - and then there is another 5.2, I see here on page 34 just above     Yes, no, no, I understand the import Iwas just wanting to make sure that you crossed out not approved because you did not approve.  You did - because you were approving.     It is the one that you were going along with, ja. Okay, now you have made the point that the Minister does not approve projects, okay.  But you have said that round about this time when this document – when you signed this document namely November 2015, wouldbe the time for reprioritisation I think.     Now you must help me because when I look at – when I look at this document, my understanding is that it sort approval for what was dealt with in the letter and that seems to me to be approval of a budget for projects. Now, are you saying that is not what the document is about?      Yes.    So are you saying that what you were approving was the reprioritisation…[intervene]     …of the budgets?    Yes.     Yes, okay, Mr Pretorius.     Oh, you do not have?     Yes.     Ja, the document that we are talking about appears at least in terms of what I have here, in SSA bundle 1 and it starts at page three zero.  It is addressed to the Honourable Minister, Mr D Mahlobo, it is dated 4 November 2015.  Is it the same document?     You have the same document?     Oh, okay.     Oh, he wants you to tell him about A, D, C, D.     That helps him.     Well, maybe Mr Pretorius…[intervene]     453?     Yes.     A date is given there on I think maybe 06/05/2016 that is how I see it.  So in that handwritten part    Ja.     The next page.     And let us - I would like you to deal with the issue much more directly.  One, did you issue any written instruction? MINISTER     Did you issue a verbal instruction?      Okay, Mr Pretorius.     Okay.    No, that is that is fine but Mr Pretorius will not necessarily know in advance in the gut which questions you will not be able to comment.   So he may put questions and then you are free to say I cannot comment on it, and then move on.     Yes.    Let him go according to his plan, from your side you will be able to say look, I cannot comment, and then he can move on, okay continue.     You say we should go to 2.1?     That is 2.1, I think at page 36, is that right?      Well 2.1 say    Mr Pretorius.     Yes, but hang on Mr Mahlobo the question is did you read the document?     Okay.    Okay, Mr Pretorius.      That is a fair point.     Yes, no…[intervene]  I think we should take a short adjournment and then I could have a discussion in chambers with yourself and the Evidence Leader in the next work stream and counsel for Mr Mahlobo I think should come as well so that we talk about how we are going to deal with the situation.  As well as the counsel for Mr Gigaba or if he is here and for Mr Gigaba if they arehere. So we will take a short adjournment of 15 minutes and then we will resume after that and I will indicate what will happen.  We adjourn.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Maybe I should just allow Mr Myburgh to say something to me about the work stream that was supposed to start with the application.    Well okay thank you, thank you.  What was going to – for the plan for today was that I was going to hear Mr Mahlobo’s evidence and when he finished I was going to hear an application by Mr Gigaba for certain relief in relation to Ms Noma Gigaba’s evidence and thereafter depending on the outcome of that application I could hear Ms Gigaba’s evidence.Due to the technical – the problems of technology that happened this morning we have not been able to finish Mr Mahlobo’s evidence within the time that we thought we would finish it.  The arrangement that has been made is thatwe are not going to interrupt Mr Mahlobo’s evidence we will continue and try and finish his evidence and the hearing of Ms Gigaba’s evidence is adjourned to Tuesday this coming week and will take place during the evening session so all concerned should be here at four o’clock we might be able to start at four or we might be able to start at five.I understand that Mr Gigaba’s Counsel is not able to move his application this evening.  What they will do about that application I leave it to them but the evidence or hearing of Ms Gigaba’s evidence is scheduled for Tuesday evening if- they will decide and make an approach if they wish to in terms of their application but I will not strike it off as such maybe I should just adjourn it although it could be    Yes.    Yes you are excused.  Thank you.  Counsel for Mr Mahlobo was not able to be with us during the discussion but I understood what happened but I think what we discussed has not prejudiced him or his time in any way.    Oh okay.    Ja okay.    Alright.  Thank you.  Okay we – we will continue then – we are effectively continuing into the evening to try and finish.  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.    Oh I am sorry Mr Pretorius I forgot to mention something for the benefit of the public.  I think the commission had announced a few days ago or maybe yesterday that Ms Lynne Brown former Minister of Public Enterprises was also going to give evidence today.  It seems that that could not happen because of certain challenges.  So from her side I think she was not aware that she was requested for today so another date should be arranged.  Okay alright.      Mr Mahlobo you are – are you learning to refer to Bundles?   Oh.    Ja.    Hm.    You said something about this affidavit Mr    Yes.   And I see it is dated 10 April 2019 it was deposed to on the 10 (inaudible).    Okay no I am sorry I think I was looking at the last page of a different affidavit.    The last page of her affidavit is what page?    445?    Oh okay.    Yes.  No, no I was looking at the last page of another affidavit which I thought was the last page of her affidavit.  Okay.    Hang on, hang on Mr Mahlobo let Mr Pretorius finish.    But the – but what – part of what you have said is you say there was no such money that was brought to your residence.    Ja.    Mr Pretorius.    Oh Mr Pretorius let him finish.    The controls that you talking about are controls that relate to taking money within SSA for purposes of SSA’s operations.    Ja to take money.    Mr Pretorius.    Yes but you see Mr Mahlobo do not place too much evidence or too much weight on whether there was a document or not that was signed because money can be given without the person receiving it signing to say I havereceived it.  So when you answer these I think it is important for you to deal with the allegation head on.    Ja.  Ja.  So     There was no – nothing in writing but was it – did you receive such money?    Okay alright.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  No, no, no I think that may be fair enough.  But I think what I wanted to emphasise to him was when there is an allegation that he was given money he should not think his answer is adequate if he says where is the receipt where I signed?  He should be able to say if he says I did not receive any money he say I did not receive any money and he can go on if he wants to - to say whoever says he gave me money let them produce a receipt.  I just want to be (talking over one another.)   Ja, ja okay.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    I think I will help you Mr Mahlobo.    I will – I will help you because Iunderstand what helps you – 504 you said Mr Pretorius?    504 Mr…    Ja.  Somewhere close towards the – then end of that page – close to – to Divider 4.  Yes.    Yes.    Would be?    And you have never received it before?    Ja it may be that you might not need to have the whole bundle but it seems certainly you ought to have any document that may refer to your client in one way or another.  Mr Pretorius have you got something to say?    Was it sent to …    It was sent to – was it sent to Ms – to Dorothy’s legal representatives?    Ja that – that is his concern.  He says the evidence of Mr Mahlobo does affect his client Dorothy and there are references to bundles but he has not been given bundles – any bundle and I was saying well he was not given this bundle I think he says.  I said to him it may be that he did not need to be given the whole bundle but certainly any affidavit or document that may have – may affect his client should have been given.   Hm.    If – if by any chance there is a spare bundle that can be lent to him to say the least we could continue while he uses that and then later on whatever the problem is can be sorted out.    Yes.    Ja.  Ja.  Maybe – should we take an adjournment so that it is addressed because I think his concern is he is not able to follow the witness’ evidence properly because he does not have documents that he should have.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well it may well be that – well it – specify again what date the affidavit is so he can check in his file if he has got it.    Yes.   Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    No maybe let us take a ten minutes break – five minutes might be too short.  Mr Pretorius.    You have provided a spare copy.    Have you got a copy?    Ja.    Oh.    Okay no I think let us take a ten minutes break.  You can have a discussion with Mr Pretorius and Mr Pretorius can have a discussion with you to make sure that going forward when we resume there is clarity on your part as to which affidavits will be referred to that may affect your client.    So that when we – when we resume then the way forward is clear.     Okay.  Let us adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn.     Are we able to proceed?     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay alright.  You spoke away from your mic, Mr Pretorius.     441?     And it is Bundle 2?     Are we back ...[intervenes]      ...Ms Dorothy’s affidavit?     Have you got the page Mr Mahlobo, page 441?     Yes.    Yes, yes.     Okay alright.  Well, I guess you cannot deny that Mr Darryl gave instructions but what you can deny is that money was handed over to you.     Ja, okay.     Right-hand top.     Right at the top.  Can you see ...[intervenes]      Oh.     Oh.     H’m.     Yes.     H’m?     Yes.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  Okay.    Hang on Mr Mahlobo.Hang on Mr Mahlobo.  Your counsel has raised a certain point and I would like to hear what Mr Pretorius has to say about that point before we go further.  Mr Pretorius.     H’m?     H’m.  Well, I do not know whether youhave that mister ...[intervenes]      Well, hang on.  Let me first hear from your counsel.     ...represents you Mr Mahlobo.  Let me hear him.     Ja, let me just make sure that you and I are on the same page in terms of what we understand him to say.  My understanding of what he is saying is that the documents to which he wants to refer the witness were supplied to you on the 25 t h of March.  That is what my – I understand him to say.  Is that your understanding as well?     That is not your understanding?     Before you proceed, let me clarify with Mr Pretorius.  Is my understanding ...[intervenes]      H’m?  You have been in – corrected?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     No, no, no.  You may remember – well, one, let me deal with the – what your counsel raised now.  I think it is common cause now that the documents were not given to you.  I think that is common cause.  Okay.  Just to go to deal with what you have just said Mr Mahlobo.You will recall that I have said before lunch, at some stage, that any documents that you may have     Ja, h’m? MINISTER     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Mister ...[intervenes]      Yes.  No, no I am satisfied.     Ja, ja.  Let him not be questioned on the document that he has not had chance to look at.  Okay alright.  I think that covers your concern?     Okay alright.  Thank you, Mr Pretorius.     Hang on, Mr Mahlobo.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m?    H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     Ja.  No, no that is fine.  Well, I am not aware whether I have seen or the correspondence you may have addressed to or your legal team may have addressed to SSA and copied the Commission.  It might have gone to the Secretariat and the Legal Team because such matters only comes to me when it is really necessary.But I do know that in terms of the Terms ofReference of this Commission that we have published in 18, there was a specific provision saying all organs of state must cooperate with this Commission and all organs of state need to bear that in mind.  Mr Pretorius.    I am sorry, your voice is going down.  Not at this stage ...[intervenes]     Ja.    As long as I can hear because obviously it is important that I should hear what you say.    Well, it may be so that we can dispose of some of the issues.  Let us start with the first one.  The mere fact that a witness has not yet testified, would not be a ground to say the witness cannot be questioned on that.  so if there is already an affidavit in the possession of the commission, even if that person has not been, has not testified, it can be put to the witness to say so and so who has not testified or who would not be testifying, but he has signed an affidavit and this is what he says about you, what do you have to say.   Yes, yes.     Yes.    The page I am looking at, the page I am looking at is initialled in terms of pages, so I will have to go to the end of the ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.  My understanding ...[intervenes]    You will see that the name Barry Roux appears there, which would be a student pseudonym name.  My understanding is that the, if you put in the signature there, the signature might reveal the identity of the person.  So then they put just the pseudonym name.  So for all intents and purposes, it is taken to be deposed to.    Yes, yes.   Okay, just to complete what I ...[intervenes]    I am sorry, I am sorry.  Mr Adonisi, just to complete the point I was making.  You will see at page 191, that is the next page where the commissioner of oaths has signed, that part of what he certifies, is that the deponent has signed.  So just to complete that point but you were ontoanother point.     Ja.    Well, I would say that as far as the facts that there might be a different font from one page to another, or from certain page onwards, maybe you might just wish to place that on record, what you make of it.  You can decide later on.    Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?      Ja, I think it is the same affidavit onwhich he was.     You are still on bundle 2.     What page Mr Pretorius?    Okay.    48 looks like 4B I guess.    Hang on Mr Pretorius, I think I lost you somewhere.  What paragraph are you on now?    23?    Okay, I have got it.    Okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius?      It does or it does not?    Okay, but as I ...[intervenes]    As I indicated, where Mr Mahlobo needs more time to look at documents that he has not looked at, I am sure that we will make sure that when he is ready, he can address them.    No, no I understand that.  I am just saying in general because you made the point and Mr Pretorius is responding to say those documents where you say you have not had time to look at, and you are not able to deal with, arrangements will be made for ...[intervenes]     Ja, that is right ja, but otherwise where you are able to respond, that is fine.  Okay, Mr Pretorius.    Ja, well I think ...[intervenes]    Yes.  No, no that is fine, but I am ... I just want to say that it is important that whatever allegations are being made about judges that this commission while on the one hand not necessarily wanting to elevate anything that does not deserve to be elevated, on the other hand should not be seen not to look into those allegations.    Because I have already been accused ofsweeping under the carpet allegations of corruption by judges.  So that evidence or allegations that were made here, I have already been accused of sweeping those under the carpet. But for what it is worth, if there is any sector of society that I would really want us to make sure if the allegations and the substance that we look at certainly would be those against judges, because it is so important that the integrity of the judiciary is not impacted adversely, unnecessarily, but I accept that also when there may be people who for their own reasons throw around allegations that have no substance, one also has to be alive to that. But certainly there will be no attempt by me or this commission to say A, you are saying that about judges, we will sweep it under the carpet.  That will not happen. Anyway ...[intervenes]    Ja.     No, that is fine but sir, just for the sake of completeness about this, the one thing which the nation must be reminded of is that on a number of occasions theChief Justice has gone public to say if anybody has evidence of any wrongdoing or corruption on the part of any judge they must come forward and to the best of my knowledge nobody has come forward with evidence other than what I have heard here and various witnesses including you, Mr Mahlobo, have said what you think of some of these allegations and I believe I have also said the same thing to say, you know, it is unacceptable for people to be making all kinds of allegations about judges and when they are invited to come forward with evidence, the do not come forward, they do not want to be subjected to questioning and cross-examination to see whether what they are talking about is true but they keep on making allegations away from fora where their allegations can be tested so it is very important.  The leadership of thejudiciary has been very clear over a long time that anybody who has got evidence of any corruption or any wrongdoing on the part of judges must come forward.  There are structures that are there.  They can to go the police, they can go to the Judicial Conduct Committee but as far as I know, I do not know of any case where evidence has been placed before those structures.  Okay, let us continue.     You did not put on your mic.     Well, my understanding from what Mr Pretorius said, I think, when the SSA evidence was led is that there had been cooperation between the Commission’s legal team and SSA to make sure that names that were not supposed to be disclosed were not disclosed and my understanding was that – I do not know whether it includes this affidavit but at least at that time, my understanding was that the affidavits that were being used then, the SSA had satisfied themselves that everything was in order.     Ja.  No, that is fine.  Mr Pretorius?     Mr Pretorius?     Ja, you are just expressing a concern.     Ja.     Page 311.     I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, you have used Mr Blank for different people, somebody who reads the transcript will think it is the same person that you …[intervenes]    Ja.       Ja, okay.  I was just wanting to alert you that somebody who reads the transcript will think it is the same person because you say Mr Blank all the time.     Yes, continue?  Or shall we say – because each time you read you did say which paragraph you are reading from.     Do you want to simply say in paragraph 53 – there is only one Mr Blank, there is Blank 1 …[intervenes]     Ja and then continue under paragraph54 and the next two of …[intervenes]     Okay.     No, is it not Blank 3?     No, is it not Blank 3, that paragraph?     Blank 1, the one at paragraph 53, is it just Mr Blank or is it Mr Blank 1?     Okay, then you go to 54.     Yes, then you go to 54 in the second lineat the end …[intervenes]     Blank 1 and Blank 2, okay.     Okay, okay.     Okay, ja.     Ja, okay.  No, that is fine.     They are 2013 dates?     Yes.     Okay, well I guess it shows Mr Pretorius’resilience.     Ja.     Ja, let us take an adjournment, 10 minutes adjournment.   We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     YY5.    Bundle 2, SSA2, page 165.     Then page 165.     Did you say 235, Mr Pretorius?     Yes.     With project?     Ja.     Ja, no that is fine, between now and when Mr Mahlobo comes back or get to deal with it both sides will have thought about the concern that he has raised and then we can deal with it, then in terms of whether there is affidavit…[intervene]     Ja.     Ja, that is fine.     Okay.     But are you saying that your intention is to bring to the Commission such views as you may have on the recommendations through the organisation as opposed to you at some stage dealing with them?     Yes.     No, no, I think that is okay if you are able to share with the Commission the views that you have in terms of what going forward you think should be done to address certain challenges that you experienced or that you are aware, were there or maybe are still there, and what may need to be strengthened, which was working.  That would be most welcome.      But what I think we have agreed upon is that there are still some documents that will need to be dealt with.  What will remain is whether - I think preferably, they should be dealt with Mr Mahlobo giving evidencerather than just sending documents.  But that does not prevent you from sending that document with your views on recommendations that you can still do.  I have in mind these other these other documents.     Ja.     No, no, that is fine.  What I must just say is also that if your legal team and they are listening, if your legal team would like to make written submissions on what I should find on the evidence that has been led in so far as it may relate to you that need - that should be done reasonably soon, because we will not have oral argument. There will be no oral argument, but written submissions will be acceptable.  So where you can say, well, this was the evidence that affects my client.  It is evidence from your - or whatever, whoever, whoever, and this is what they said.  This is what my client said, in our submission. These are the findings that should be made you know against that one or in favour of that one, because then I will have regard to those written submissions in preparing the report.There will not be time for oral arguments.     Ja, no, that is fine.  I think your counsel will speak to Mr Pretorius but I think those submissions, written submissions should be with the Commission not later than the end of April, those submissions.     Ja.     Yes, do not wait anything.      Ja, just from now, from tomorrow work on written submissions, have regard to all the evidence that might affect your client that has been led.  Of course we know that he is still to come and deal with this other document, but you can start preparing.  So that by the end of April, at the latest, you can submit your written submissions that tell me as far as youare concerned, these are the findings I should make.  These are the findings I should not make insofar as it relate to your client.     Okay alright.     Yes.     Yes.     After the Commission?     Okay, no thank you very much to you, Mr Mahlobo and your legal team for all the cooperation so that we could have this session today and we could go into the evening.  Thank you to Mr Pretorius and his legal team.Thank you to the investigators, the technicians, the staff, everybody I really appreciate all the cooperation that everybody is showing to the Commission, to assist the Commission to finish its work within the time available.  We are going to adjourn now.  For the benefit of the public, I must just indicate that on Monday, the Commission will hear the evidence of Mr Anoj Singh being under the Eskom work stream because he has not finished his evidence so he will continue.  Thank you very much, we adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Yes we are Chair.  The Minister Mahlobo is present by virtual…    Connection.    And so his legal representatives are present perhaps they should place themselves on record.    Mr Mahlobo you have before you and you will be assisted through the documentation by one of the commission investigators your own affidavit which appears in Bundle SSA2 at page 737.  It is Exhibit YY13 in Divider 3.      Yes I would…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.      In that affidavit it will be part of Exhibit YY13.    If you would go please Mr Mahlobo to page 737 of SSA02.      737.    Is there an investigator of the commission with you Sir?    Alright well they should assist youthen please in putting that document before you.  You have it before you?    You do have it?  Sorry I did not hear that.    No he does have it.    Thank you.  Do you recognise the document at page 737?  Is that your affidavit?    Yes and if you go to page…    Yes.  Do you – if you go to page 758 is that your signature there?    Yes.  And you are you satisfied.    That as far as you are concerned the contents of this affidavit are true and correct?   You have before you three files Mr Mahlobo the one file we have just referred to is Exhibit YY2 or Bundle YY2.  You are also have and you will be shown excerpts from that file in due course – not the whole file Exhibit YY1 and then there is a third folder which forms parts of Exhibit YY13 and will be incorporated into the bundle in due course of additional redacted affidavits and transcripts.  We will deal with those piecemeal in due course.    Now a matter we should clear up at the outset is there an classified material in your affidavit and I refer in particular to certain passages dealing with operational directives – paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2.  I raisethis just… MINISTER    Alright.  Well you have placed them in the affidavit.  Your evidence is they are not classified nevertheless we will take the precaution of checking that further before anything is put up on the public website but for the moment our understanding is that you may testified to those and we will get there in due course.  Before we get to the contents of your affidavit just to place your own position in its context.  I understand that between 2005 and 2008 Minister Kasrils was the Minister of State Security is that what you recollect?    I am not sure what the Minister wants to say so I would not be able to – if it is a matter of controversy.    Then – whether names are given or not is not an issue that requires an answer we would prefer to see it in writing so that we could prepare a proper…    Proper answer;.   We will do so Chair.    Sure.    We will do that Chair.    He has done so Chair.    Yes please Chair.    Exhibit YY13.    The page is 737.   SSA2 and following.    Perhaps – may I proceed Chair?  Perhaps Mr Mahlobo we can go back to the timeline and just by way of introduction to this series of questions I can just explain to the Chair and to yourself that your ministry took place in the context of a series of events that not only preceded but followed your occupancy of the ministry of State Security and in order to understand the context of the evidence that you will give and the time during which you occupied the ministry it is necessary to put thistimeline on record.So if you would just bear with us for the moment.  05 to 2008 Minister Kastrils was the Minister of State Security, you recall that?    Then from 2000 – sorry had you finished?     Yes, the sound from the remote facility is not ideal as well.     So it is maybe necessary to ask Mr Mahlobo to repeat some answers.     Perhaps we could clear that up in the next five minutes.     If we are granted a shortadjournment.     It will save time in the long run.     Thank you, Chair.  We have attempted to improve the signal.     The screen is now operational.     But I must say that it may be that during the course of evidence, the signal deteriorates again and we might have to make some other arrangement.     But for the present...  Mr Mahlobo, can you hear me?     Understood Mr Mahlobo.  I will do my best.     Alright.  And if there is anything that is unclear in any question that I ask, please, do not hesitate, Mr Mahlobo, to ask me to repeat the question.  Is that in order? MINISTER     Thank you, Mr Mahlobo.  To continue the timeline then, between 2008 and 2014, Minister Cwele was the Minister of State Security.  We heard evidence in related to State Security that occurredduring that period.       And then you occupied the position of Minister of State Security during the period 2014 to 17.  Is that correct?  That is in accordance with your statement.     Yes.  We will get to your affidavit where they are, indeed on record and that detail.  And then, after your period of ministry, the position was occupied by Minister Bongo between 2017 and 2019.  Is that correct?    We have a message on screen that your internet connection is unstable.  Did you hear the question?     Was Minister Bongo ...[intervenes]      Yes, 2017 to 2019?     Alright.  Thank you for that correction.  In any event, you were followed in the ministry by Minister Bongo.  Is that correct?     Yes.  And between 2005 and 2010, Mr Arthur Fraser was the DDG of Operations in the SSA.  Am I correct in that regard, as far as you recall? MINISTER     Alright.     And then, I can just put it to you for your comment if you wish.  In January 2010, our investigators tell us that Arthur Fraser resigned his position.  Do you know of that?     Alright.  And then in September – we will come to the point of the questions in due course – but in September 2016, was he appointed by you as Director General of SSA?     Alright.  May I rephrase it then?  Whilst you were Minister of State Security, Arthur Fraser was appointed as Director General.  Would that be more accurate, as far as you are concerned?     Alright.  Thank you.  Before you took office, approximately, from 2008 to 2010 there existed a principle agent network often referred to as Pan 1.  Were you aware of that fact when you took office?     Alright.  But whether through mediareports or otherwise, you were aware of the existence of the principle agent network?     Alright.  Well, we know and we are told by our investigators that Pan 1 was investigated internally within the State Security Agency and a report was made to Minister Cwele, approximately, in November 2010.  Do you know of that?     Alright.     Right.  Our investigations also inform us that at least two persons were implicated in the report made to Minister Cwele in serious wrongdoing and those two persons were Mr Arthur Fraser and a Mr Engel,e-n-g-e-l.  Are you aware of those facts or were you aware of those facts when you took office?     Indeed, Chair.     Alright.  Well, let us move above ground level then immediately Mr Mahlobo.  When you took office or before you took office or after you took office,were you briefed on the Pan 1 Report?     Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Well, one suggestion might be we persuade Minister Mahlobo to attend the hearing in person.     If that is possible.  We will take all the necessary steps.     The other possibility is to ensure that the place from which Mr Mahlobo gives evidence hasan adequate internet connection with the venue.     I say so, because the detail and the wording of questions and answers may become relevant and one cannot have a situation where we do not hear an answer or an answer is not properly on record or there is some misunderstanding in communication.     It is very important that this evidence be accurately and thoroughly recorded.    Thank you.      Thank you. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you, Chair.     We were dealing with the PANreport …[intervenes]     Mr Mahlobo, we were dealing before the break with the PAM report and let me just stress that I am aware of the fact that you would have no directknowledge of whether or not any particular person was actually engaged in the activities set out in that report.  So the purpose of the questions are simply to ask you what you knew about the existence of the report and its contents.  The report itself is a classified document, the PAN 1 report is classified document.  The Commission has sought declassification of a summary of that report and we are awaiting the outcome of that request but the question is, were you briefed in relation to the PAN report when you took office or at the time you took office?     What we know then is that there was a report, a PAN report, that you were briefed on the report or given a copy of the report and you took certain steps.   We know two things and these may be clarified once we – and if we obtain declassification of the summary of the report and there is absolutely no reason why weshould not obtain declassification and the view of the legal team but we will take those steps further.What we know is that there have been no prosecutions arising out of the PAN 1 report, correct?     That is not classified input.     Mr Mahlobo, you have told us at some length what was done pursuant to your receipt of the report.  I do not understand why you cannot say what was not done.     I just, Mr Mahlobo …[intervenes]     No, sure.  My apologies.     Who was the accounting officer you refer to?     K-u-d-j-o-e.     It is only operatives that require names to be concealed.    The law only requires the names of operatives, not officials, as we understand it.     So accounting officers, ministers, they names need not be kept secret.     Just two things then arising out of these exchanges, Mr Mahlobo, the first is that ArthurFraser was appointed in 2016, correct?     And, as I understand your evidence, that the responsibility for that appointment would have been that of the President at the time, former President.     And leaving aside the report, the contents of the report, the contents of the summary of the report, what recommendations were implemented and what recommendations were not implemented?  Our information is that there have been no prosecutions arising out of the conduct of the SSA dealt with them.     If you do not want to answer, that is fine, I need to place it on record.     I understand your answer, I do not agree with your answer but we can make submissions to the Chair …[intervenes]     It is my turn please, Mr Mahlobo.  I understand your answer, I do not agree with your answerwhether or not there have been prosecutions is a matter of public record and should remain a matter of public record.  But let us move on.     In your affidavit, Mr Mahlobo, you deal with certain procedural matters.  I would just like to place certain things on record which should not be controversial.  In January 2021, six Rule 3.3 notices were forwarded to you, in fact on the 19 January.  Are you able to confirm that?    No, I am putting facts on our records to you.     Yes, well, I am asking you a question, Mr Mahlobo, I am asking you if you confirm that six 3.3 notices were sent to you.  If you do not know, just say so.     But, Mr Mahlobo, you are perfectly entitled when I ask a question to say let me refer to my affidavit, it is your affidavit and we will be very patient.  If the information is in your affidavit we can place it on record.  If it is not I would still like to ask the question.     Well, I am putting this to you, if I may, what appears from the records and my instructions, I think, are not controversial, that you did receive 3.3 notices.  When you first received them there were no documents annexed, they still had to go through a declassification process but my instructions are that thatthe declassified documents were sent to you some weeks later on the 8 February that were annexed to the 3.3 notices ultimately.     Mr Mahlobo …[intervenes]     Mr Mahlobo, it is incumbent upon me to put to you the record of what documents were sent to you and your attorney and I wish to do so in order to deal with the allegations you make in the paragraphs in your affidavit.  If you do not know the answer to thequestion that is fine, I just to place them on record and you can make whatever comments you choose because there are certain allegations in here which are incorrect and they need to be corrected.  This is your statement, it is on oath and I am entitled and it is incumbent upon me to deal with it, in fairness to you and in fairness to the Commission.  So I am going to ask you against that background if you can confirm or not confirm or whether you have any knowledge of what the record is.  Six 33 Notices were sent to you January 2021.     Yes, in February, in fact on the 8 t h of February those notices were resent, this time with the declassified annexures attached.  You know that would not ...[intervenes]     Alright, that is fine.   On the 25 t h of February 2021, a request for an affidavit, together with a bundle of new declassified documents were sent to your attorney, do you know of that?     Well, I’ll call the evidence if necessary.     Well, there is one important thing, Mr Mahlobo has gone on oath to say that certain documents were received only in the past two weeks.  That is incorrect as a matter of record, it’s stated on oath and its incumbent upon me to put what we will argue in due course, is incorrect.     Just one issue I want to put to him now.    Well, yes.     Well, Chair, I would appreciate the opportunity to address you on that.     In paragraph six Mr Mahlobomakes a statement on oath to the effect that certain documents were only given to him with the 10(6) notice recently.  Now, I understand that between an attorney and a client the communications may not be such as all the matters are within Mr Mahlobo’s knowledge, but this is a statement on oath.  All I want to put on record, is that those documents which he complains were sent to him late, were, in fact, sent in February, that’s all I want to put.     Let’s move on then Mr Mahlobo if we may.  Paragraph nine of your affidavit – and I’m going to deal with certain issues in your affidavit, if I go too far,in other words if I leave out something that you wish to emphasise please stop me and deal with it but your affidavit is a matter of record, it is before the Chair, and I’m going to ask you certain questions on the contents of your affidavit, then I’m going to put further documents to you but you’re free to say, but you’re now on paragraph nine, in paragraph eight I want to say x, y and z.     Good, in paragraph nine you say, “I participated in the high level review panel on theSSA by giving testimony on activities and the conducts of the SSA”,The question I’d like to ask you, do you have any record of your evidence? MINISTER     Yes, no, my question is somewhat different, we’ve…[intervenes].     Do you have your own notes, do you have your own prepared statement?     Here, do you have it at all?    At all?     As your attorney pointed out, there are certain typographical errors, but I don’t think we needto deal with them they’re quite obvious typographical…[intervenes].     There has been evidence by Dr Moshomade and others in relation to the status of the white paper and the constitutional requirements, you deal with those in paragraph 12.     Well, if you wish to raise anything in relation to the legislation outlined by you in paragraph11, please do so but…[intervenes]     Well, we can look at the detail ofwhat was said in that regard, several witnesses gave evidence in relation to the contents of the white paper.  Be that as it may, can I move…[intervenes].     And indeed, I don’t think there’s any disagreement that the most important expression of the law is in the constitution.     I’d like to move on to paragraph 16 to deal, very briefly, with what you found when you cameinto office in 2014.     Paragraph 16 yes.     It says in paragraph 2 – or you say in paragraph 16 line 2, “There was no proper accounting structure in place, mainly because of the nature of the operation of the Intelligence community”,Would you explain that please?    In fact, I’m sure that, with your experience, Mr Mahlobo, the Chair would be very interested in your understanding on what remedial measures might or might not be required, we’ll come to that.     Let’s move then to paragraph 17 where you say, “I inherited an agency that was greatly divided andcharacterised by mistrust and allegations of political interference”.The notion of political interference in the affairs of the State Security Agency has, to an extent been dealt with by previous witnesses, it would assist us if you gave us your understanding of what is not proper by way of political interference, what are you referring to there?     Yes, so, I understand you refer to common cause and matters of principle.  It to be a matter of principle, as far as you’re concerned that the State Security Agency shouldn’t interfere in party politics of factional politics within parties.    We assumed that for the last twoyears and I think correctly.    In the last sentence of paragraph 17 you say you made it your duty and mission to steer the agency towards a new direction of transparency and accountability.  Can we deal with that at the end of your testimony as to …    Because the Chair will have to make some recommendations about the evidence he has heard.   We go to paragraph 19.2 towards the end of the paragraph you are talking about the operational    You say however and I understand that it is difficult to make absolute statements and general statements sometimes lead to misunderstandings but you do say here  “This directive would explain why I would nothave direct access to operations, the nature of the operations, the members involved in that particular operation and the person who conceived that operation as they were conducted on a need to know basis.”Now arising out of that and arising out of the evidence that other witnesses have given as a general principle is it correct or incorrect that a Minister should not be involved directly in operational activities?    I understand your answer Mr Mahlobo one thing I would like to place on record because this theme has emerged in evidence before is that certainly we will submit to the Chair that the standards which should applyand be adhered to I – our own state security agents should be established by our own policies and our own constitution and if those are more strict and higher standards than other countries so be it but the standards are our own standards not those of other countries.    Let us go to paragraph 32.  I know it is a great leap forward.    Thank you we learning – secure along.    Note it is one o’clock Chair.   I am happy as long as it is convenient to you.    I know that one has arrangementssometimes.    I know that you might have arrangements.    Over the lunch breaks.    Yes.   Let us go to paragraph 32 of your statement.  I just have one question to ask in relation to the    In paragraph 36 then you refer to the particular threats to the authority of the state that you foreshadowed in your discussion of the National Intelligence Estimate – the NIE.  I just want to ask you in terms of paragraph 36 sub-paragraph 4 you deal with threats to the economy of the Republic and specifically mentioned under that head is the concept of corruption.Corruption too would be a matter that might legitimately draw the attention of a security agency in South Africa.  Is that correct?     [Microphone not switched on.]     Thank you.  You then go into some detail in paragraph 37 and you deal in more detail with the threats that you summarised in paragraph 36.  Now it may be that later on in your evidence these threats are the context of certain projects that I would like to put to youthat emerges from the evidence and documentation that we have.  But if we could go to – and a matter of interest to, certain the evidence leaders, there is a statement in the     We will come to the detail in due course, Mr Mahlobo, but the concern that under the absolute statement here, all manner of activities may be justified but look at the statement that you make here.   “The Foreign Intelligent Services were aligned with negative domestic forces to destabilise the state’s ability to govern the country...”Not to gain economic advantage for their own country but clearly to destabilise the state’s ability to govern the country.  Now that may seem legitimate.  And my question is, what are those domestic forces?  Are they trade unions or NGO’s?    Well, let me put the question in adifferent way, if you are not willing to categorise these domestic forces.  Are these domestic forces in the private sector, the public sector or both?     Maybe stronger.     No, understood.  In paragraph 37.3.  This may become important later.  You deal with violent industrial action and under that head, you talk of an assessment report which revealed that labour provides another platform to be used by Foreign Intelligence Services to destabilise our economy and pursue their agendas.  Now if one is talking about violent industrial action, one is no doubt talking also about trade unions, notso?  Is that what you mean by labour?     Organised ...[intervenes]      Right.  And then in paragraph 37.4 to 37.6, you highlight several other threats, violence in the transport sector, violent protest and in the education section and cyber security threats.  I do not have any questions.  The statements, they are quite clear, and the next topic would be funding of the operation of SSA which perhaps we can deal with after the break, Chair.     I am in your hands, Chair.     Maybe 40-minutes.     [Indistinct]  Chair.     [No audible reply]     Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahlobo, may we go to paragraph 38 of your affidavit.  You describe a process there in paragraph 38 which is the basis of how weunderstand the operations to be in accordance with     Certain affidavits have been given, there is a small bundle of documents which have been given to Minister Mahlobo only recently, he has expressed a willingness and a desire to deal with and we will putthem on that basis.  If he is not ready to deal with it then we will obviously have to deal with it at a later stage but that – my suggestion is let us put each one rather than in the general terms that have been put now.     Yes, I understand the question.    We have received information, if I may use intelligence term, to the effect that such an affidavit exists.  We spoke to Dorothy this morning who denies that such an affidavit was ever attested to by her and if such an affidavit exists it must be brought to us and we will investigate it but we know of no such affidavit.     We certainly have not concealed any such information and would never do so.     No, Chair, it is a serious allegation.  To the extent that we received information  that there was talk of such an affidavit existing, we investigatedthe matter.     May I finish, Mr Mahlobo, you have made a serious allegation.  Let me deal with it.     No, let me finish.     I want to place on record that according to the best of our inquiries and according to our legal team that supports me as evidence leader in this matter there is no affidavit from Dorothy which denies what she has said in previous affidavits.     That is our knowledge for the present.  If there is such an affidavit and if we have been misled we would welcome being provided with such an affidavit.     For the present, Chair, your ruling is noted, I would just like to make three points.  All – thereis more than one affidavit of Dorothy.  There is no affidavit that we have, to my knowledge, that contradicts everything she has said.  First point.Everything we have has been declassified, second point.Third point – and we must not conflate these two issues.  There is an accusation on record that the Commission’s investigation and legal team, that is the Commission, is withholding an affidavit to whatever prejudice might in future be alleged.    I know of no such allegation and in order to assist us in that regard we would appreciate if we could be provided with the so-called affidavit so we can investigate.     But the existence of the affidavit and its deliberate concealment by the Commission are two different issues.The latter one is a very serious accusation.     Thank you, Mr Mahlobo, our coffee date still stands then.     For the present let us go to bundle SSA1, if you will, at page 30.    Page 30, please and I am referring to the black numbers in the left hand top corner of each page, so if you go to the documents in that bundle after the index.      After the index, you will see in the top left hand corner a page number, SSA01/030.    SSA01, page 30.     Yes, I understand the frustration, it has been expressed by several witnesses but it is for later recordkeeping that we need to have these numbers …[intervenes]     Yes, well you can go to C, if that makes it easier but I will still refer to the page numbers.     So you are at page 30?    That is a letter dated the 4 November 2015 and it is addressed to the Honourable Minister Mr D Mahlobo, Minister for State Security Agency. If you go to page 34.       You will see at the bottom of that     Yes and if you go to page 31    Well, if you look at page 33, paragraph 5.2, the fourth bullet in that paragraph …[intervenes]     5.2.     It says there    Well, if you total those projects referred to in paragraph 5.2, R130 million, that is the amount you approved by your signature on the 16 November 2015.     The I misunderstanding might be on my part, Mr Mahlobo.  If you go to paragraph 5.2.     You will see four bullets there.  “Domestic intelligence R90 million.Foreign intelligence R20 millionMinister ’s projects, R20 million. Total R130 million.” As I understand this document, that amount of R130 million which includes R20 million under the head, as we read it, Minister ’s projects, is the amount approved by you on the16 November 2015?     Okay.      I did as I understood it.      And I might not have understoodMr Mahlobo’s previous answer, but that R130million was the amount approved by his signature on the last page of that doc but I think we are there at the moment.      I may ask you to go to SSA1, page 453 please.     As I understand your evidence, Mr Mahlobo you ceased being Minister of State Security inOctober 2017, is that correct?      Would you go to page 453, please.     Of SSA 01.     Well by the time we get there the alphabet has been exhausted.  So it is…[intervene]     It is 3, divider 3.     It is divider 3, hard board divider 3, it is right there by your printer.     Yes.     And go please to page 453.    Ja.     Right, now I would like to put to you certain passages that appear later in the document.  To place this document on record, it is a letter addressed to the Director General SSA and certain other parties dated the 31 s t of May 2016.  You see that?      It is a request for authorisation renewal of Cover Project Mayibuye and payment of expenditure related to Project Mayibuye from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. Do you see that?    If you go under the heading background and explanation mention is made and a description is given, a description is given of the Project Mayibuye.  Do you see that?     If you over the page to paragraph 3, financial implications.  You will see there in the table nature of expense Project Mayibuye estimated amount R54,120,000.  Do you see that?    On the next page, that is page 456 of SSA 01 you will see under the heading compiler signature of code name Darrell.  Do you see that?     And then underneath that you see recommended, not recommended is crossed out and the note as per instructions issued by the Minister and then there is a reference number.  Do you see that?     Do you know anything about any instructions you issued in relation to Project Mayibuye?     Underneath the words as per instruction issued by the Minister, Not entirely legible.     Perhaps that document still exist, if it does exist.     Yes, and then if you go over thepage to page 457.     Seven.      The next page.      The first paragraph reads; “Recommended and not recommended, has been crossed out.” It seems that Matthew another pseudonym signed this on    Right, and as I understand your evidence, there would be nothing at all unusual untowardfor you to approve the use of retained earnings.     Beneath that is, what appears to be the signature of Dr BWJ Langer, Director Domestic     Did you ever issue and express instruction and directive for payment to be made urgently in respect of Project Mayibuye?     I did not follow the last part of your answer.  Do you recall whether you issued any such instruction?     Thank you, Chair.  If you could just bear with me a moment.       Would you go to page 36 please, that is in divider letter D, SSA1 page 36.  Do you see that document dated, it is a document dated 30 August 2016?      It appears to be addressed to yourself, Minister for State Security Agency.  Do you see that?      If you would look at page, the last page 44 bundle SSA01.  Is that your signature there?     Under the head approved?     If, you can go back to paragraph 1,     Then on the second page of that document which is SSA01, 37 there is a heading in the table Project Wave.  Do you see that?     See on page 37.     Project Wave it says    Then over the page, there is another heading Project Construcao and certain project activities are listed against six bullets in the next box and planned events a budget of R24million.  Do you see that?      And then 3    And then several project activities     The way it reads or qualify probably, or even possibly reads, is that the target camp would be the State authority and its organs of government, including justice, Parliament and provincial legislature.  Do you agree or do you not agree?     No, it is proposition I am putting to you as even a possible way of reading this, can you help us?     So, you cannot speculate as to what is meant here, to help us?     Alright.  Then paragraph - in the     Well, let us go to…[intervene]     Do I understand the position correctly, then that, as appears from page 44, of SSA01 when you approved expenditure for the utilisation of unexpended balance to fund covert operational projects, you do not know what those projects are?     I understand your answer but it does appear from this document at least that you appended your signature to a document which named allocated money to and described project activities for a number of projects which have been the subject matter of evidence before the Chair.     Let us just continue the description of the projects contained in this document that you signed and approved.  Mr Mahlobo, the next project is Project     Budget, R25,180,000.     And finally there is on page 40, Project Tin Roof.      The project activity there is    Alright, and the budget for thatProject Tin Roof is R8million, simply then what I need to put to you is when you signed this disapproval, did you read the document?     The approval on page 44 is the approval for the expenditure of money on covert operational projects.  You see that?     I am perfectly happy to do that Mr Mahlobo.  The approval that you gave on the 2 n d of September 2016 under your signature in a document whose    Paragraph 1 on page 36.     Yes, paragraph 1.  I simply want to put…[intervene]     1.1.      Sorry, there is no word?     Yes, sure.  What I am putting to you is that the covert operational project referred to in paragraph 1 and referred to above your signature on page 44 are the projects outlined in four pages of this document.    Chair, I am aware that they are at the counsel here, and I need to save it I suppose…[intervene]     It is obviously in your hands, but we will be a while still unless we break now.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahlobo would you please go to…   Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahlobo would you look at Bundle SSA2 please?  It is the other one – yes.      If you would go please to page 431which is behind the divider YY12.  If I might just place on record Chair whilst Mr Mahlobo is finding the page.    You have.  All the affidavits of Dorothy in our possession are in fact in the bundles before you now and before Minister Mahlobo and with me.  Page 431 is an affidavit of Dorothy in response to a request for an affidavit issued by the commission.    Yes.      It was issued or attested to and given to the commission in response to a request.    Made to her by the commission.    Page 431 of SSA02.    Yes.    Page …   445 yes.    2n d of March 2021.    Could you go please to page 441 Mr Mahlobo in fact we should start at page 440.  440 has several reference to documents and they are all tabulated or referenced to the documents is tabulated and at the bottom of page 440 is a reference to M19.  A submission dated 29 November 2016 requesting authorisation to pay the related expenses for Project Mayibuye for the month of November    Chair if there is a relief whether correct or not correct that there is another affidavit which is relevant to what is contained in the affidavits and transcripts that are now wanted to put to Mr Mahlobo then in fairness he shoulda. Be reassured that such an affidavit exists or does not exist and b. If it does exist to be entitled to refer to it insofar as it contradicts this evidence.    So it may be necessary for that exercise which we trust and hope will reassure Minister Mahlobo that there is no such affidavit but he should have an opportunity to reassure himself of that.    So are you saying there is a procedure that is followed when cash is delivered to your residence?    Well I think the whole point of the evidence is that there were no internal controls.   If you could just bear with me a moment please Chair.  You will go please to another part ofthe affidavit which is on page 437 of SSA2 please.  There    And just to refer to M19 and I am going to ask you to take the other bundle – apologise SSA1 at page 504.      SSA1.    Do not worry about M19 for the moment it is SSA1 at page 504.      Behind Divider – behind Divider 3.    Yes a 3.3 Notice was sent with excerpts of this evidence on the 19 t h of March 2021.  It wassent I think electronically but I am not sure about whether it was hard copy or electronically.    Yes the attorneys for Mahlobo.    Oh not to Dorothy’s.    Well if you could just bear with me a moment.    Please.    Yes I am – for the life of me I do not understand why Dorothy’s Counsel or attorney should nothave the affidavit.  I would have assumed that he did.  I am not aware of the delivery.    And passage of documents.    Chair I would like to sort this out.    For the convenience of my learned friend.    But I must point out that this affidavit came from his office.    No we have – we can try and provide a spare copy.    We do not have spare copies.  These affidavit emanate from the attorneys for – for Dorothy.     Yes, I am instructed that or I am told that we can proceed.  That the thought that there was a contradictory affidavit has also been sorted out but I willget proper instructions and placed them before you ...[intervenes]      ...on record.  It appears that it rested in a possible misreading but I do not want to half the submission to you.     I will put the whole – but all those issues related to the affidavits, even the missing affidavit.     ...resolve that... [Speaker not clear]     But Mr Mahlobo, would you go to SSA-1 at 505?  The only reason I put this document beforeis the document request for authorisation for funds signed by Dorothy on page 508 for funds for Project Mayibuye in the sum of R 4 510 000,00.  I want to put it before you if you wish to comment on it.  Only if you want.     And then, on page – if I can ask you, please, to go to SSA-2 again?       If I can ask you to go to SSA-2again, page 441?     41.     441.  After the divider YY-12.  You had before you.  I would just like to refer you to paragraph 13 there, 13.1.     Bundle 2, Chair.       Yes, it is 13 ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.  Page 441, 13.1.  The     Then if I can ask you, please, to go to SSA-2, page 460?     This is an affidavit of Dorothy in response to 3.3. Notice issued in relation to the evidence of Lloyd Mhlanga.       It does say in paragraph 2.2    You have it?  Page 461 of 2.     Paragraph 2.3.     And I am going to read these paragraphs and then you can comment.     Alright.  2.4    Dorothy also conducted an interview with the investigations under Operation Veza, the Internal SSA Investigation.  The transcript together with certain other affidavits of Dorothy were supplied to the Commission by the SSA under certain conditions.The conditions were that they could not be made public but could be used in evidence.  I interpreted that tomean that – and I have instructed that that means, if that to be used in evidence, Dorothy can obviously have sight of them as can Dorothy’s counsel but they should not go on the website in due course.  The transcript of Dorothy’s evidence with the SSA investigators has been declassified and it is in the paper bundle before you, the plastic bundle and it is in...     Sorry, you have a plastic folderChair.     Yes, these are the documents that were declassified on the 25 t h of March this year and were declassified on the condition that they should not be given to anyone else but could be used in evidence.     And it is on that basis that they have been used.  They were all – these documents were supplied to Mr Mahlobo and Mr Mahlobo’s attorneys past few days.  That is the factual position.     Sorry, I have been corrected Chair.     These documents originated fromthe SSA.  They were documents given to the SSA or testified to before the SSA in terms and in relation to the transcript and all classified.We requested those documents and we were given then under condition that they were not to be given to anyone.  That was the condition.  But could be used in evidence.  Now, obviously, if it can be used in evidence, we can disclose them, deal with them in evidence.  That is my interpretation and that is the instruction I have been given.  But the Legal Team, apparently prior to that, did not givethem.  So these documents were not given over the last few days.  They were given now.     Well, we can always recall Mr Mahlobo’s notice.    Until he has had a chance to look at the document.     I must just place on record, Chair, that it is not as if the State Security Agency opened their doors to the Commission and allowed us to obtain any documents we wish.  It has been a continuous investigativeprocess that has taken place over a long period of time.  So that it explains the fact that not everything was obtained at one time and certain requests ...[intervenes]      ...or a request had to be made ...[intervenes]      ...over a period of time.     Thank you, Chair.  If you would go, please, on the understanding that we can put to you statements or affidavits in Bundle SSA-1 and SSA-2 but not the additional bundle to SSA-2, page 145, please.     Yes, Bundle 2, SSA-2, 145.      YY-5.       This the affidavit of one Darryl and I would like to take you to his statement at paragraph 50.     50, five zero on page 160.  At the time, I understand, that Darryl was the General Manager of the CDSO but if you go to paragraph 50 under the heading, Minister Mahlobo’s involvement in Operational Activities.      Paragraphs 80 to 82 on page 168.  We will come back to this affidavit in another context, later.  Paragraph 80 in page 168 reads under the heading, Cash     For the sake of completeness, Mr Mahlobo, you have referred to it in passing, paragraphs 33 and 34, the last two paragraphs that deal with the topic.     In the same affidavit at page 310 of SSA 2, the creation of a trade union to rival AMCU is dealt with, A-M-C-U.     Paragraph 52 reads    “She is now deceased.”     By way of background, Chair, you are correct that …[intervenes]     311.  If I may just respond, MrMahlobo?  All the redactions were indeed checked with the SSA’s attorneys and my belief is that what has been put now is in accordance with those arrangements.  I am not sure about the first name mentioned and I am quite happy not to mention it in response to …[intervenes]     311, para 53.     So that the first name I need not mention nor the name of the wife anymore.     But the other name, the principal agent, he actually sued in his own name and set out all the circumstances in a court application of this series of incidents, so I do not think there is any reason why thathaving been made the subject matter of a court case which was settled but I am happy to be guided by your Chair.  If I do not mention that name I am not sure that in public – it is before Mr Mahlobo, he knows who it is, should know who it is.     Yes.  Well, the Commission is obliged to deal with matters in open and we will follow that unless there are lawful reasons rather than reasons of practice to operate otherwise, but I am going to read on at your invitation.   “At this meeting…” And I am at paragraph 54. “…with Minister Mahlobo, I was informed by the minister that Mr Blank  had been deployed together with principal agent Blank  to start a rival union to the association of mineworkers and construction union, AMCRU.  He told me that this project ran intotrouble and Mr Blankwas kidnapped and threatened.  Mr Blank now feared for his life. Minister Mahlobo required me to arrange for funds to be paid to Mr…for him see to his protection.”     Yes, well I am now dealing with Mr Blank 2.    The principal agent.     Yes.  No, fair comment, Chair.     Yes.     Mr and Mrs Blank.     54 and the first blank is Blank 1 and the second Blank is Blank 2.     And the third and fourth Blanks are Blank 1.  Para 55 is Blank 1, 56 is Blank 1 throughout and 57 – let me read it again. “I also met Minister Mahlobo at his residence in order to discuss a problem that had arisen with the principal agent and the project to create a rivalunion to AMCRU, Mr Blank 2.”     “Minister Mahlobo informed me  that Blank 2 had been hired by special operations as a principal agent for the project at one of the project meetings.  Former President Zuma was also present.”     No.     Paragraph 53 is Blank 1.     And Mrs Blank.     Blank 1 and Blank 2.     And then later on Blank 1.     55, Blank 1, 56 Blank 1 throughout.     57, Blank 2.     Okay?  58    Alright.  Well, that could cut the questioning short, given your response.  As I understandyour evidence was that you played no part in the establishment of the operation.     But that where problems arose and particularly where there was a lawsuit including a lawsuit against you as one of the defendants, I think it is, you could legitimately become involved, is that correct?     And just for the record, the particulars of claim in the matter appear at SSA1, page 186, where you are cited as the 3 r d Defendant.  Do you recall that?     Yes.  I do not think it is necessaryto it, I mean, it is common cause …[intervenes]     The claim was for actually an amount of R120 million under a number of what might betermed – may I be so bold as to comment, dubious claims.  But be that as it may, it was finally settled, is that correct?     On your instruction?     Did you know of the settlement? MINISTER     Right, it was settled in an amount of R7 million our investigators tell us.     The only one standing.     Thank you Chair.   Just to finish off on the Trade Union matter Mr Mahlobo can I refer you please to Bundle SSA2 at page 165.  This is the affidavit of Daryl which begins at ...[intervenes]      No, a different one, YY5.     There Daryl deals with the Workers Association Union project and in the establishment of the project he does not mention your name, but he does mention your name in paragraph 69 in relation to the summons issued under the Gauteng High Court jurisdiction on 12 December 2017 to which we have referred and he     Then in relation to Project Lock, there is in Bundle SSA2 at page 317, the affidavit ofShadow, and if I may refer you to ...[intervenes]       YY8.       At page 317.        Did you have any involvement in Project Lock, the operation Project Lock?     He says in brief that there was a visit made to your house in Pretoria in the presence of Mr de Kock, he also says that there was a complaint made to you about the breach of the arrangement SSA had withhim, that is Mr de Kock.     Thank you.  If we can go on then to YY14 in SSA2, right at the back of the file, the affidavit of Blaise, page 742, there is an extract from what has become known as the Boast Report…[intervene]     There is an extract on page 742 of the Boast Report I would just like to put one paragraph to you.     Boast, B-o-a-s-t, it has beenreferred to colloquially as the Boast Report. It is a report by an operative Blaise and this is his confirmatory affidavit on certain activities of the SSA.  It’s been dealt with in evidence and the matter of record it's been read onto the record and I just like to understand under the heading SONA Western Cape,     Okay, there is evidence in the bundle about the monies allocated to the Sesikhona Project but I do not then think it is necessary to put them to you.   Lastly, at least for the moment, there are certain allegations that we have agreed not to put you at the stage because they are in the additional bundle and quite clearly you need time to acquaint yourself with the allegations.  But if I may deal with the document at SSA1 at page 235.      Yes, Chair appropriately undercover, it is under P.     Under the header background it     Alright, well there are two issues. The one is that I do not believe that it is untoward to put to you a report that is made to or under the auspices of the SSA whether it is an affidavit or not might go to the weight to be attached to it, but in relation to your second pointyou need time to deal with it I understand that.     Now perhaps there is a point to the fact that this document authenticity is not established, it simply says it is a report.  If there was a covering affidavit, then I could validly argue that although it is a report, it is an authentic document, and therefore it should be dealt with but we could argue that at a later stage, because it seems we agree on the fact that time is required.     Chair, in order to expedite matters if maybe before the next appearance without sending questions, because that is not the practice of the Commission but to highlight topics with the appropriate references that will be dealt with we could be muchquicker.     Thank you, Chair that is all for now.      Well, apart from – yes for the moment apart from issues raised in that other bundle.     And secondly, well just let me tell you what we have not dealt with. Secondly, any recommendations that you might have to assist the Chair in relation to regularisation of State Security.     Not tea? 
ADV ADONISI: Good morning Chair.    Oh.    Lehlohonolo Peter Adonisi a practicing attorney at Msikinya Attorneys and I am representing the witness Mr Mahlobo.    Chair sorry.    I just – can I just take this opportunity to clear something out on – on some grammatical errors.    Which I had hoped my client wouldaddress when he was addressing…    The – or making his opening remarks.  Chair I know an affidavit would have to be amended by a supplementary.    However we have noted that this of the limited time work that we had to compile.    Necessary.    And there were some grammatical errors.    And there were also some incorrect mentioning of a name.   In particular of a witness that has given a Rule 3.3 Notice.    And there has been an accepted to your name.    For record.    May I also with the permission andindulgence of my colleague direct you to page 15.  Sorry paragraph 50 of the affidavit on YY15 (inaudible) has already been placed on record.    Paragraph 50.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.   Chair you will note that there are names relating to 3.3 Notices in there.      No these are pseudo names - some of them.    Some are indeed the name of a – I think just one or two they are the names – the real names of the witness and they – these are not protected witnesses – one    Originally it was in the 3.3 Notice used as Sharon.    However with the proceedings that of    And – yes Chair otherwise I do not want to really bother the Chair and with the time constraints …    Ja with the other administrative (speaking over one another).    Thank you Chair.     Okay.  No, no Chair.  There were two options provided but I think it seems like there is concerns(?) as with the witness ...[indistinct]     Because the reason why he agreed like(?) it(?) was true but I heard my colleague saying there are precautions that will be taken.     And ...[intervenes]      Ja.    So I think there is no big(?) issue(?) ...[intervenes]      Otherwise...  Because I was going to suggest of the second option of him relocating into his house, closer to his – his, probably, route because that – the second option my colleague proposed.     But it seems ...[intervenes]      Yes.       If my client is comfortable ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]     Exactly.     [laughs]       Chair, I am being rejected by my colleague ...[indistinct] to ask you indulgence to address you.     He will place himself on record.     Chair, I did not place myself on record because we did not anticipate that we will be heard today.  I am – the name is Raplane(?) Goredira(?) [phonetically]     Chair,[indistinct] I’ve …[indistinct] and I equally reserve my obligation and duty as a legal representative and I’ve been referred by my client, seeking protection from you.  You have also suggested to my learned colleague as to how to deal best with the administrative issue but you would have heard from my client, he’s tried several times, for hours now to avoid toengage on the administrative issues and we get to the crux and the trust of the issues but it cannot also be correct as it has been put forward as a matter of correcting what is an incorrect version from my side but there’s two sides of the coin which you’ve given guidance and directive and I would, respectfully accept that we deal with it off the record to not indulge in administrative issues as my client has said.  So, however, my colleague would want to deal with it because there are a lot of things that I could have stood up and spoken about that we’re unhappy that we can record as prejudice but as my client has said, we have tried to come here, relatively on the short notices griping and being dragged but as an obligation and a duty we owe to the citizens, we have done so grudgingly but we are here, we are trying to help you.  So, can we progressivelyo to the thrust of the issues instead of – as you have suggested Chair.     I am Chair thank you.     Your mic.  You have lost us.     Chair?     If Chair might allow me, I think if I not address this issue I would not have act on the best interestof my client because earlier this morning I was approached by the team, the legal team of the Commission and the legal team of the Commission did talk about the affidavit that the minister is bringing to the picture now and I was requested to call my client with that regard to say on the corridors there is that thing in that there is an affidavit which contradict the affidavits that he had submitted already.  Then my client did say no, I do not know if any affidavit that the Commission requested which I did not submit.  In addition also, the questions that the Commission brought forward, I did answer and respond to the Commission.  I went back to the legal team of the Commission.  I get them the response of my client.  Now the legal team of the Commission did give me a respond to say we do have an affidavit which was submitted to the SSA, State Security Agency, by your client and I said hold it right there.   Now we are not going to play mind games because even though I have not told them that you are not playing mind games but I am learned person and I have read into everything that they were discussing with me.  An affidavit that is submitted to SSA, it is not for the Commission and certain work of the SSA, it is for a classified high level.  Now for that information to be brought into thisCommission, it needs to be declassified and the Commission to discuss that affidavit with me, they need to tell me or who me proof or certificate that this information is declassified.Now if I do not stand up and address this issue or the engagements that we had with the legal team of the Commission, I would not act on the best interest of my client.  So the minister to say whatever that he is saying right now, he is well within – position is right because this thing has been happening since morning and we arehearing all this information.     Chair, all the affidavits in terms of Rule 3.3 notice that were requested from my client have been submitted and accordingly so.  In addition also to the questions, 19 questions that were submitted to my client, have been submitted to the Commission.Now if there is anything else outside of that scope which my client was given to respond to the Commission, then we are not aware of and like I am saying, when one ofthe legal team says this affidavit was submitted to SSA, I said I cannot come here at the Commission to deal with the Commission and be expected to also address issues of SSA, it is a different scope and I am not going to entertain that.     Chair, may I seek you indulgence and that of my colleague, Chair.  As you have noted, when the witness was testifying that being my client that he would have – when referred to the bundle.   He will have said he has noted the document in reference to, but I have always been alive in the engagement with Advocate Wendell[?] and - but I just need indulgence to check because I have got a document whenwe discovered – because maybe let me just say the bundle that now being referred we are assured that the confidentiality will be given at the hearing we do not have, so meaning myself and the client do not have.     Ja, but however, I have throughout the process of preparations and as the evidence has been led saw that there is almost a similar document that I just want to check through the Chair, with the indulgence of my colleague.  That on why to you as you have been guided,and the paginated numbered pages 81 or so because on one, why, on 1, 2 or so which is the discovered predicament we have at page zero thirty-four we do have a similar document but I am just checking with my colleague, whether, is it the same document that you are now referencing because it reads almost the same including what you have been canvassing now in evidence.     And approval - so I just want to check.     Ja.     I have the same document, what seems to be is not - maybe the pagination that has gone on some.     But I now know why I am lost in term of – thank you Chair.     Okay, alright, Mr Pretorius.    Yes thank you Chair may – let me take this opportunity to apologise I misunderstood the fifteen minutes or whether it was outside that.  Yes but I have been briefed by my colleagues.    Yes (inaudible).    Chair may I also get an opportunity on yourclarity or what the direction Chair.    But I think you my – you might have to have listened to him because the question and how the statement    So it brings about whether or not there was a TA.    Which my client is now trying to explain the issue of the signing or not.    It is not placing too much weight I think theChair should note.    We are helpful Chair the answer is no.     Chair, I think we have made the point and we came grudgingly on this issue of discovery and prejudice recorded.  I think it has been cleared.     We have tried in attempted to, at least, clarity to ourselves as the counsel the administrative issue how it happened that my client had to testify on a deliberation(?), new evidence that...  Chair, it has also now become apparent that, his other affidavits and/or documents, which now also relates to us and these are not I our possession.  These are not even discovered and that is worrisome because we have had on several occasions.And you will see if you go through the affidavit that has been placed with the constraints that we have raised that it cannot be correct Chair that we are subjected to this and in particular when my learned colleagues have in their possession, whether it is extra stipulations or otherwise.At least for the relevant – where it is relevant to us, it should have been provided.  Worse when it has now since testified.  So we have had engagements until the early hours of the morning.  We were promised that inactual fact there would be some documents that are classified, not into the way my learned colleague is proposing now before you.That we will be provided with copies for the relevance of us following the proceedings this morning and that is how we accepted and subjected ourselves to it even because we wanted to but it has become apparent that there is – and this is probably where the issues of concealment and otherwise but I will use it in context...That there are further documents and affidavits that mention us and deposed by this relevant person that are not in our possession and that is worrisome because as to why they are not in our possession, in particularly, when they have made reference.  And we have been given 3.3. Notice in particularwith this witness and the extracts that are relevant to us but it seems like there is over and above what has met our eye in deliberation that has been discovered and I do not want to cast suspicions by doing so but it is clear that there is more.The worse now, even records.  And you will have noted, Chair, and you will see as we progress, there is also correspondence to the effect, be it on difference of opinion of how we interpreted discovery but one thing is, essentially is that, we griped and we have written to theSSA itself on declassify and providing information for us to be able to submit in either in any election of whether oral or...  That has not been done until we are here.  So.  And this is a situation and that will be an injustice.  Although we are not in court, Chair, but we still have to respect the framework of the legal, the framework that is of principles of discovering, principles of ...[indistinct] and otherwise.  That is my submission Chair.     I am not trying to be obstructive.     And you have realised that we have kept     But it cannot correct that my learned colleague now has declassified information and it is relevant to their own understanding as stipulated what they think is relevant but now when you are leading evidence, it seems like now these other paragraphs that they were not provided to us of the same document even.     Chair, I can see my learned colleague is constraint to accept and to an extent he is, with respect, to say that they have not discovered and this declassificationhas happened on the 25 t h of March.     No, Chair.     No – yes ...[intervenes]      Ja, Chair, your intelligence has given me light(?), because otherwise, there is a secondary argument to this but I think your summary has been embracive and we will think – we take queue from that. 
ADONISI:As previously stated my name is Lehlohonolo Peter Adonisi I am from Msikinya Attorneys  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  (Speaking in vernacular) Your Excellence Chair and Deputy Chief Justice morning and to the colleagues there.    Thank you Chair. ADV PRETORIUS    No I can hear you well (speaking in vernacular).    My name is Mbangiseni DavidMahlobo.    No objections.    Definitely.    So help me God.    It is M-b-a-n-g-i-s-e-n-i.    Well I am okay.  You can proceedbecause I have got my affidavit.    Yes.    Yes they are here – they are around.    No I do have it.    Yes I.    That document was filed by my attorneys.    Through the Secretariat of the State Capture Commission.   The signature there it is my signature.    That is my signature.    Yes, yes, yes Chair.    I do.    Well I do not understand you to say I must put it in my own context.  Is there going to be an opportunity through you Chair where one would be able tomake some few remarks and then – so that we can deal with the issues that were part of the summons that they issued to me through your office?    Well Your Excellence Chair I want to make short remarks and we will find a way to transmit them.   But I assure you.    Because I have taken an oath.    Not only this oath.    And I am very sensitive to matters of intelligence.    I will not mention people’s names.    But it is a short remark.    Thank you.      Yes I have a small two pager document.    But not – not this thing that I am going to say that there are outside some of the offending remarks on my affidavit but I wanted to place something just for your reference.    Without wasting time because I know the commission is running out of time.    But I can assure you I will not divulge any information, any name, any information that can tend to give a name of any person.    Or – both an organisation.    That the 00   I am very cognisant.    I can hear you Chair.    Chairperson I do not want us to take – Ja I can hear you Chair.  I do not want us to take long.    I have made an undertaking and I am not going to break the undertaking and if I break any undertaking you are empowered to call me into order    It is a small..    Definitely no – Definitely I will not do that.    Give me three minutes.    Thank – thank you very much.   Your Excellence Chair.    I can proceed Chair.   I recall.    (Inaudible) the Minister that I will not – I did not know that he was the Minister to the     [No audible reply]      Chairperson, I can hear you.  But if Mr Pretorius can try to manage when he is standingthere.     That every time when he put...  Can you hear me, Chair?     I am making a request through you, Chair.      That Mr Pretorius need to help me so that he does not get ...[indistinct].     That he tries to speak to the mic, even if he tries to refer to his notes but he must not lose the mic because when he loses the mic ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      But...  You know, I was just saying to the question of the ...[indistinct] or on the mic.  He must not lose the mic.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes, and I guess the time that you give is correct.     Let us put it accurately.  So on 25 May 2014 until to the 16 t h of October 2017.  I want those dates to be on record, Chair.     [No audible reply]      No, I could not hear the question.  You said the next minister after me ...[intervenes]      It was - it was Mr Bongani Bongo.     No, that is not correct.  It cannotbe 2019.     Just get the records correct.  It should have been 2018, around February because there was a Cabinet, a reshuffling(?) that happened on the 26 t h of February 2018.       That is correct, Chair.     I will not go to that.     It will be presumptuous of me Chair to comment on a matter I do not have details.    No, it is very clear Chairperson.  In terms of the Constitution and the Intelligence Law, the appointing authority in terms of the head of the service or the Director-General is by the President of the Republic who was national – who was the Head of the National Executive or the Commander in Chief, in terms of law.      It would be partially correct.  Youneed to add and say Arthur Fraser was appointed for His Excellency, the President of the Republic as the Director General.  That becomes complete statement.     Except media reports that I cannot speak about.     I am aware in terms of those media reports of the allegations of the existence of that programme.     No, I only know when my – the time I became a Minister when I received the report from the office of the Inspector-General.     But there is an indication thatthere was a request by former minister to investigate the programme in terms of the law where the Inspector General must investigate any matter that is either referred to by His Excellence the President of the Republic or by the Minister or by the ...[indistinct] Committee of Intelligence or by the party.     Mr Pretorius, let me help you.  I do not want to speculate.  I do not have a... [break in transmission]     ...somewhat mislead the panel on a document that is not in front of me.     But when you want to discuss...     Yes, Chair?     I hope I am not... [speaking vernacular] Chair.     [No audible reply]      I am saying to Mr Pretorius, Chairperson.     If you can hear me Chair?     Chairperson, I am saying for your record, Chairperson.  What Mr Pretorius is proposing, as in the report, I am not in a position to say yes or no because that report by the Inspector-General is not in front of me as we speak right now.       But I will be able to assist Mr Pretorius because I could see... [speaking vernacular]     Yes, I will be able to speak at thetime to say when you received the 10.4, what did you do?  That is where I will help Mr Pretorius but the other issues are [speaking vernacular].  I might not assist him that much because I do not want to mislead you and I do not want to mislead the counsel.  But as I am saying, I will not say who was actually been said to have done a wrongdoing or no wrongdoing without refreshing my mind.  Remember, Chair, I held Intelligence as a Minister.  It is nearly four years ago now.     But I will help him.     I will refrain from using my language.     [laughs]     You are absolutely correct, Chair.     Well, Chairperson, I will be weary to use the word Pan 1, what, what, what.  But what I want to place it on record.  In as much as I do not have the documents here right now...  [break in transmission – speaker unclear] ...the then Minister in 2014 – in 2014 or from the 25 t h(?) of May, I was ...[indistinct] that my predecessor did the handover.  In other words, to brief me of issues.  But I must also qualify.  The issues I needed to know and once I am in Intelligence, there are things that you need to know and there are things that they will not give it to you because they are governed by the rules of confidentiality or secrecy.  The issue of Pan was one of those that was brought to my attention and I was...[indistinct] but.. [interruption in transmission]     ...in the office.  They are able to give me the reports.  I can hear you, Chair.  Can you hear me?      [Indistinct] captured the one about handover?     I am in Pretoria, Chair.     Yes, Chairperson, because I do not have another time to deal with these matters including...     ...[indistinct] reason.  But I do notwant it to be an obstructing to your work.  You can – the guys that you sent here from the team because they are from the Security Services.  Let us be fair(?).  Oh, I must be careful... [speaking vernacular]     [Speaking vernacular]     Yes.     Let us...  I want to finish today.     [Indistinct]      Chair, ja, half-past eleven let us resume.     I have already informed my ...[indistinct] comrade(?) ...[indistinct] [break in transmission – speaker not clear.]     Chair ...[indistinct]     [Indistinct]     I will be there at quarter to twelve.     I should be there before quarter to twelve.     [Speaking in the vernacular]     This is what the [indistinct] have.     Ja.     Well, thank you very much, Chair, our Deputy Chief Justice [speaking in vernacular]     [speaking in vernacular] to Mr Pretorius.  Well, Chair, and you, I will respond, MrPretorius, but with a small indulgence that I will try to help you and the Commission as far as matters I know and especially during the term where I was involved but at the very same time, the incident that happened, while were virtually, I think I should place it on record I have no intention in terms of access to information and documents whether governed by the Information Security Act, which is still valid, but including the issues of oversight because they were [indistinct] today as every component of doing oversight.  Well, I had the discomfort, Chair, when therewere certain names of people that were being mentioned because as a person who was a minister and the oath of office, I cannot disclose names indirectly or directly and secrets placed on me but I have a responsibility to account.  The Oversight Act is very clear that at no stage shall I divulge any information, any methodology including any organ that might inadvertently reveal names.  I was a little bit uncomfortable when certain names of people were being mentioned and unfortunately, the signal failed us but I want it to be on record so that I do not – I do not want to be seen as a person who is very conscious about intelligence matters, as if I allowed myself to implicate individuals but then I can respond to what Honourable Pretorius is saying while I am having those safeguards.  I thought I should just put that important point.    Your Excellency, what happened, Adv Pretorius started quoting certain things that are in the PAN report.     Let me help you, uBaba Zondo, I will help you.     And I will not be able to repeat them.     Because I will be complicit, Chair.     But now I am happy that Pretoriusis indicated the report is classified and is sorting declassification, then I will respond to him now so that in as far as I was concerned, without getting into the body of the report, I want to place it on record.  Mr Pretorius, when I became a minister I received the report officially and that report, when I received, it had a number of recommendations and those recommendations were acted upon and there were remedial actions that had to be taken.  Those remedial action had to be referred to the accounting office for execution and on an ongoing basis becausereports of IDU(?) there are also reports that we must report it to parliament to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.They had a sight of what the recommendations were, they were shared and on an ongoing basis we reported on the progress made.  At this stage I will not be able to say how far did they implement.  I do not have the document here.And secondly, while I was at home I made a reference to say I do not know this numbering, PAN 1, but I know in the media statements that another political party has made the request again to the IG to further investigate and I have not heard now whether that particular investigation has been concluded.  But on record, I did have a sight of the report.  I acted on the report, there were certain remedial actions that were to continuouslyreport to by the accounting officer to me as an executing authority and the same we reported to parliament.  That is how I can help you.     Well…     No, you see what you are doing, Mr Pretorius, you are making an error.  You want us indirectly to start to divulge the contents of the report.  Remember, the content of the report in terms of law, check your Information Security Act and check your Oversight Act.  I cannot sit here and start to speculate.  I am saying to you, at my level I received a report, it had remedial actions, it had recommendations, remedial actions and what I did was to say those remedial actions must be actedon by management under the guidance of the accounting officer.  That is the action I took.Secondly, we brief parliament through the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence which is a mechanism as the breach in terms of the constitution in terms of Chapter 11, Section 210, that there must be a monitoring mechanism, a multiparty committee will be in place, that multiparty committee to assist the Commission, check the records of that committee inasmuch as there are certain classified if you want to further investigate whether actionwas taken or not but there are remedial actions to say please do the following, the very same issue that I will insist when it comes to matters of an audit report.  The audit report, you have to have a duty to ensure that after AG issued it, like they have issued it in the past, remedial actions are produced and you start to implement the plan.  That is how far I could be able to help you.     Well, you want me to actually place me in an untenuous[sic] situation.     No, no, no, let me finish, MrPretorius, let me finish please our respective …[intervenes]     Please do not put words – I am saying to you, I do not remember the things that are said in the report because I do not have the possession of the report and I will not want [indistinct] to speculate.  I am saying, in as far as the broad thrust, what should an executing authority do?  And I have responded now to say what did I do and if there was incomplete implementation of the remedial action, is another matter.    Chairperson, you have captured it correctly.  I remember one specific recommendation in that report but if you push that line indirectly, I am going to have to disclose what this action is while Mr Pretorius has not had this report being declassified.  I do not want this recommendation and in terms of the oath of office I took both as a Minister but also in terms of the law.   You know Intelligence, Mr Pretorius, what isdifferent?  There are certain things you say in a particular way and when you say them, right now, when I am speaking right now, I can tell you we are being watched all over the world and there are certain things that will  actually indirectly confirm some of the things, but if this report is here, uBaba [indistinct] …[intervenes]     I am very, very clear, I remember that one recommendation but I am not going to put it here on record and behave as if I am a novice when it comes tointelligence matters.  I might not have the right word but I just use the word novice but I am very conscious.     Yes, definitely correct.     That is correct.     The accounting office provided reports on the implementation of the agreed remedialaction proposed.     Equally, those remedial actions from time to time, we apprise the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.     The reason why we have to do this, Baba Zondo, it was a matter of public interest.     And it continued to be so.    But when we come here, I want to assist to the best of my ability so that you can be able to see the truth from this other smoke but the manner the question is couched, very conscious class I am going to be starting to say there was this recommendation, there was this recommendation and nothing actually – that is the bearing.     That is why I [indistinct] that is why I came in quickly the manner I came.    Because if you look [indistinct] at this, that [indistinct] no good, accuses you around the political shenanigans and noise outside.       When you finalise your report everybody is satisfied we went through a process that was fair and just so that at least we do not play to sound.     Every time I see a particular pointthat might made us to do and disturb you will pardon me, I will highlight it.     Well, Chair, I can put it on record, certain aspects of the remedial action were implemented.     And it was an ongoing thing.     And hence now, Mr Pretorius, we have this thing coded PAN 1, that is why those who arethere now must complete the work.  It is not about my performance assessment here to say at what stage did we do that but the most important thing, actions were taken, continuously reports were provided and there were certain individuals that were not happy about certain things.     That is why they requested, which is a public knowledge, they requested the office of the Inspector General please reinvestigate some of these aspects.    Because they were not happy with certain aspects of the first report.     And this is how far I could be able to assist you, volunteer.     Well, at the time the accounting officer, Ms Kudjoe. Ambassador Kudjoe was the accounting officer when I became the minister and then there was others after she left, on acting capacity.     And I want to hope that by mentioning the name under your protection I am not breaking the law.  I am saying it reservedly because accounting officers, they are generally known.     Pardon?     No, it is …[intervenes]     No, no, no, that is why I said it, Mr Pretorius, let us not have a problem.  I have said I am mentioning it because it is a generally known thing but immediately it starts to deal with operational matters, even if it is a DG, whether it is a DDG, I am not allowing, it is operational.  I know the law, Chair.     It is definitely so and…     No, no, let us not use operations.     If it has everything to do, Chair, with counterintelligence.      You know, sometimes these words are used wrongly.     And I want to do within the intelligence nomenclature so that that nomenclature is a nomenclature in law.     I would not recall when – which date he was appointed, but indeed he was appointed as a DG and I do not have the dates here.     The law if very clear how accounting officers and also in terms of the intelligencelegislation that the appointing authority is the head of the National Executive, which is the President.     Well, I did make my reservation, Chair, you are doing a [indistinct] again.  Now indirectly you want me to get into those remedial actions.     No, no, no, Mr Pretorius, please, let us help uBaba Zondo.  You own the questions, I own theanswers and if you want to probe, I am saying to you now this question is placing me to start to confirm matters that are in the remedial action, and I will not do that, …[intervenes]    But it is my answer.     Chairperson, you will help us.  Well, if Mr Pretorius decides to make opinions that has insinuation will you be able that you start to get into that?  I do not have intentions to do that because right now he is making indirectly a judgment that what I am saying I am wrong and I do not want to be starting challenging him.     I am saying immediately you raise the matter of prosecutions and it is your call ultimately when you finalise your report, I am saying is the same first thing that I was asked but in a different way.  Let us not try to actually stick to that direction because I haveresponded.     Which paragraph are you referring to?     No, no, no, remember I have given you my affidavit …[intervenes]     Mr Pretorius, please, let us help the process, do not do this.  I am saying this matter is in my affidavit, help me and refer me to paragraph because you are starting to mention a date now.  What if I give a wrong date and I start to mislead the judge?  I do not wantto do that.     No, it is fine, where you refer to dates, if they are not in my affidavit you will give me the source, then I will respond.  Chair, I do not want to confirm the date, I want to confirm that I did receive a notice.    No, they were received this year.     And the records in the Commission and secretariat including my legal team here …[intervenes]     They have the specific dates.     Well, Chair, in my affidavit it is self-explanatory on record I did receive the notices and when the notices were received they were referred to mylegal team and my legal team, that is here now, they started interacting with the secretariat of your office – the secretary of the Commission and it is clearly that we received the notices but there were documents we requested from the Commission and there are correspondence to that effect on administrative matters that I do not want to get into it because I want to get to the substance.     And – I was still concluding, Chair.     And I am on record that these documents were not furnished until these documents, most of them, we got them last night but which was an issue that I said, that there are some administrative challengesattached to them but that does not preclude me to engage on the matters that are raised in the notices but I want to confirm that notices were received and maybe they were received.  Others, they were received in the course of the proceedings.     Yes, I did receive the notices.      No, I will not recall that.     That’s not true.     No, no, no Mr Pretorius allow me to respond, you see, I was not going to put somethinghere.  One of the things…[indistinct] that I tried to do there have been frustrations both by the Commission’s secretariat not you in furnishing my attorneys documents and the – ultimately even SSA refused official requests there has been too many letters and if Mr Pretorius wants to deal with administrative issues around paperwork, I’m not in a best place to help him, my attorneys here can be able to respond because I don’t want us to spend the whole day dealing with administrative issues.  I said despite all these administrative challenges that have happened, including  receiving 305 pages yesterday in the …[indistinct] after seven when there were discussions that these documents are going to be delivered by 5 o’clock both to my house and ordinarily I would not be at my house now but my attorney requested me to do so for documentsto be delivered, they were not delivered, they were actually even brought electronically in the afternoon but that’s now why I’m here, to argue documents.  the issue is to say, do I know this document, if I know I’ll say so I’ll deal with the allegation placed on it.  If now, I’m going to be fighting over dates I’m not competent to do that.     Chair can – with your permission, Chair, that you indulge me, I’m happy that you have made the suggestion and my legal representative is correct, I’m amenable to that, I’m not going to be discussing details here, even in my affidavit, I am not accusing that this document, this document, it’s a broad general statement that I’ve made and the last point on a..[indistinct] Chair, I even insisted when there were certain things happeningthat, you know what, I want to deal with these matters there was even a suggestion to postpone for Monday and I refused, I refused.  I’m here today to say, even if you go long haul, I want to deal with these issues because some of them, they impact on my reputation and I’m happy that the administrative issues where there’s an issue what, those talk among themselves as you directed, we correct what we need to correct.     Chair, I want to respond, I’ve not said in my affidavit which document.  That administrative issue, as you have guided us, the lawyers must work on it but I am putting it on record because I received those documents, it’s not an opinion and I don’t want any aspersions to be cast on my legal team, let them…[indistinct] but we’re here on the serious mattersand they can be able to do that because the statement in my affidavit it says, some, then they will deal with that…[indistinct].     And [speaking in vernacular], I’m even prepared to answer, even, documents that are not here as far as I can help you.  I don’t want an impression that I never assisted.  I’ve instruction from my party and my President to cooperate.     Those issues, if there are going to be limitations because of documentation on a particular point when you deal with substance, I will advise you and you make a determination.     It’s very helpful.     I don’t have the record.     I don’t have them here.     No, I don’t have.     Yes, they never asked me for an affidavit, their methodology, I was interviewed but I’m on record on the interview they made and did the best ways to provide you with that report and remember the President actually, ultimately released the report in as much as it was a redacted version.     Yes, the spelling of the names, thank you.     Well, I don’t only deal with the matters of the status of law, I start to deal with the status of the constitutionality because constitutionality was a serious mater raised here and on record it must be started from 10/11 and you can proceed there Mr Pretorius.     Well, I just want to place on one or two matters [speaking in vernacular] that witnesses came here, and they created an impression that only two legislation matters and it’s only the constitution and the white pages and that impression is wrong, and I want to put it on record.  Intelligence, because of our past and where we come from and the abuses and politicisation and so forth that were used as an instrument that some of us got exposed to as a young person, including yourself andothers, in South Africa, is highly regulated and the constitution is very clear, that there will be national legislation and I’ve started to assist the Commission.  These are some of the national legislation as required by the acts of Parliament, Chair that govern this environment and on page 12 where, honourable Pretorius, you’re trying to refer to, in the doctrine of legislation making in South Africa you either produce a green paper or you produce a white paper.  Those documents, they are not equating to national legislation, but they relate to strategic intent, policy aspects but ultimately, ultimately, it’s the law passed by Parliament and assented by the head of the national Executive.  The assertion that was made about the status of the white paper, to say, not correct on record.     But can I just come in Chair, you’ll help me, Mr Pretorius because I don’t want to interject. Let’s not throw opinions in passing let’s deal what is the law.  The white paper is not the law.     I take the point.     Okay.     We’re on the same page.     Definitely.     Paragraph 16?     Okay, I’m there.     Well, this is a broad statement, I will not give specifics because here there are certain things that, it’s important, that one explain his role.  When you come into an institution you do what your colleagues – an institutional planning in military score recon just assess and very importantly there were matters that were very problematic and somewhere we deal with them, some of these things you see in the notices about behaviour this, accounting this, these are some of the issues that I’m referring to, just to give all the same way or the same word [speaking in vernacular] used, what do you call it, laying the foundation, insisting on laying the foundation but these are the systematic issues that come over time and here I’d want to be in a position that, after this foundation is laid by 16, started to respond to the question, what did you dobecause enterprising was giving, really nothing was done, probably you aided the worsening of the situation that’s why you’ll see how this affidavit is couched but this is an affidavit of my own subjective assessment, either informed by audit reports, informed by other things, I’m putting it on record as my foundation for engagement and also dealing with some of these issues, Pretorius, you remember these issues where people think about politicisation and all this, we’ll deal with them later on but these issues, they actually proceed even that time I was.  I never found a ship thatwas floating there were things that were working and there were things that were worrying.     Yes.     I want to do that but little bit cautious.     Because some of these matters, I will deal with them later on, on the specifics on the affidavit but generally there were witnesses.     And very serious one and some of them systematic.    And they don’t even start at the time of 2014, May, they start as far back as 1995.     When these Intelligence Services were established but till we start to engage on the meat we will engage, but the environment was there having its difficulties, there were things that were working and there were things that were not working, and I had to tighten up certain things.  Well, it will be a matter whether my efforts were the best I could or not, but we’ll then demonstrate it.     Well, if I’m referring to issues of political interference you will have to be able to make a reference to the constitution.  The constitution is very clearas our supreme law that when we speak on chapter 11 around security services, there are guiding principles, how they must do certain things and there are certain things they must not do and over years, there are certain things about political issues, political meddling or being security services used as an instrument to advance certain interest, whether factional, whether – whatever is that but it’s very important that I must insist what the law says, those are the principles.  This matter of political interference or political issues around how state institutions are being used, not a  new phenomenon.  As far back as the challenges of my movement of which I know that the leadership is coming here in the next few days to engage with you, those allegations were made at that time and they continue to be made at the time the other personcame in and they continue to be made even today, that’s the environment.  Whether the merits and demerits, it’s a different matter but it’s a matter which is called common cause, that’s what I in that institution and that’s what continues to be and it’s one of the matters that, even going forward, I will do and show that those guiding principles I referred to under Section 199 of the constitution, we do our best of our abilities that they are safeguarded and where there are witnesses we started to say, is it a witness in law, witness in policy, witness in leadership or witness interms of consequence management, that’s what I’m placing it on record.     Maybe, Chairperson, you are correct.  Let’s, maybe, probably before you look atallegation of political interference, there Security Agents because on how we arrive at the democratic dispensation.  There were people that were brought together, they never saw eye to eye.  They did things to each other that are terrible but we’re to forge a unity, prosperous in a democratic South Africa.  They were brought together, they had issues of prejudice, there are issues of how they felt among themselves, those issues never dissipated on one thing.  Even today the people that work for the Apartheid Security Forces was there in Security Forces and theirorientation and their side, and there are people that are coming from formal liberation movements in terms of [speaking in vernacular] they are there, and they are trained in a particular way.  You know how you see when there are problems in intelligence, you rent people they come and do peddling, peddling [speaking in vernacular], it creates certain stories, we’ll come and deal with them.  One of the stories they created about judges and create about people that they’re spies and yet you look in sutu, even yourself they will say things about you also and you’ll find people leaking documents, you know the law is very clear how information must be mandated, and it continues to happen today.  There are certain things and practices because on how we concluded our matters, they continue to be bedevil this and all of us, we should be party with asolution to help.  There are very good men and women there but there are also men and women whose conduct and whose orientation, actually is not taking the country forward but we’ll deal with that but it’s very important because people who came here [speaking in vernacular] they never gave an opportunity to explain how Intelligence is, how does it come from and so forth even they too, I can tell you, they are political animals, political players, and as an Intelligence person that has been trained, I can read what their end game but I’m not going to do that becausewe have – but it’s important to say, let’s not be selective on how far our challenges are so when you make a recommendation, probably far reaching reforms are going to be required to do that but just read a page – it’s not page, paragraph 17 in context because most of you that are here, we’re not Intelligence people, we’ve been on the ground, we know how it works and so forth, you interpret the law, thank you Mr Pretorius.     You are correct, but let’s qualify it,Mr Pretorius, as long as those parties, they don’t do anything against the law, the intelligence is everywhere including even in my own bedroom.  I can have a spy in my bedroom or in my home.  It is everywhere.  It is not that – is support the security of the state and its people and it will be there.  In intelligence it is very simple. They say that you must just know that someone – always note that someone is listening or someone is watching.  Well I always know that God is watching but that is …    No, no it is true.  When we will talk about some – some funny things that are even happening now about my team how intelligence is being used to certain things that we must say no to because unlawful things must    Thank you very much (speaking over one another)    Well we will gladly share what is our thought about how we can improve certain things.  I know His Excellency our President says certain things must be done they are there to support him.  But my views will not be    Let us probably with your indulgence Chair I am referring to matters of directives or regulations they are provided for in the law.  I might not be quoting the right one now here but the law is very clear about the powers of the Minister especially in the National Strategy Intelligence Act it has got to be amended over time andagain and equally there is this law called the General Intelligence Amendment Laws and it also – even the Intelligence Oversight Act it says in the cause of our duties to implement the law – the National Legislation we might do regulations.  Sometimes the regulations are in form of directives or guiding…    Well let me answer some of theseallegations while we are here.   1. There is no law – there is no law and these people were here they could not tell you Bab Zondo which law says the Minister may or may not use.  There is no law.  I will come to this directive but there is no law Mr    No I would want to help you Bab Zondo.    Because we have witnesses who come here and they do not share how intelligence environment works.  I will respond – my answer is very clear the allegations they are making that I was involved in operation I deny it.   I am on record.  But I want to assist this commission and remember we are not being watched here Baba we are also watched internationally.  Even other foreign internal agencies right now that are here at home and abroad they are watching and let us not actually create some stupidity of ourselves.   There is something that I want to put it on record.  There is no law that says Ministers or the Minister – let me use the word – the Minister or the President must be involved or not involved.  There is no law.  But let me just assist you and say do you know that when you run counter intelligence in the course of your national interests there are people that get to be recruited to assist you to push your national agenda or national interest. They are not on the same level.  Even the biggest intelligence organisation whether it is the Russians, whether it is the Chinese, whether it is the British Military Intelligence, whether it is the CIA even Presidents you can recruit a President.Other countries in terms of intelligence work they actually get Presidents that they want and interfere in other countries things where another – would you think that a President can be managed by June, would you think that a general in a country will be managed by June?  The levelsare not the same. Who then becomes everybody in intelligence is a recruiter.   Some they come themselves to be recruited.  We must be able to demystify certain things that have happened here.  There is no law but depending on how aggressively you push your national interests using intelligence because intelligence is not something that is new is actually centuries and centuries ago you will know.  For an example if tribes are not supposed to fight you will get your daughter to marry on the other side.It still happens today.  Even other countries they get their certain citizens to go and get to be married in other countries.  You do not know whether we are – we are actually staying with a spy or not.But I thought I should be able to say this thingbecause if I do not say it an impression will be created that intelligence which is information very important to make decisions can only be gotten to people of certain levels.But my answer I might have been long winded I never ran operations but equally so there is no law that says you can do this or you cannot do that.    Let me just assist you Mr – that is an opinion they made.  That standard they could not tell you where is it.  There is nothing in law.  I am very conversant with the legislation that govern intelligence it is an opinion.Probably going forward you might want to discuss the question why should be the role of politicians?  But also do not discuss the role of politician without understanding what is intelligence when everybody can become a recruiter as long as you advance your national interests and national security.And this is not a new doctrine.  Intelligence is a trade craft.  It has its own ways of working.  There are views that traditionally even big democracies even today they are still grappling with it because the more we will practice these things we find certain weaknesses.  So everywhere you will find it.  Even ourselves are not unique for dealing with that but this thing of a standard there is no standard here written.These guidelines – these guidelines or directives are    No just (speaking in vernacular).    (Speaking in vernacular).  I do not want to discuss methodologies.  When it is my time just indulge with me you will – when it is my time to respond I will make it on.    It is a chat between a father and a son.  I do not think it is material Chair.  The Chair was asking me to keep the mic on.  I told him that I have a preference I – for certain security rules into repeat.    Ja.    No I am here to support and help.    You see Baba Zondo it is very simple.  I can – I can do profiling how you speak, how you breath, how you do certain things and we have people now watching you there.  Remember this thing is not on a closed session.     May you Chair with the break and with your indulgence and the permission of Mr Pretorius just push for another hour then we take a break.    I am here to help.    I want us to conclude (speaking over one another).    Ja let us push for an hour.    And then we are trying to make up time.    I am comfortable Chair.    Well thank you very much Chair.  This does fall within the mandate Chair of intelligence services and you will find even a better answer – I do nothave the notes here for you Advocate Pretorius a definition of national security.It is in the National Strategic Intelligence Act.   It is very broad – very broad it compasses economy, environment – it encompasses everything and people they have views – different views even today that broad definition is a problem.  There are those views but I am not going to start to express a view but it is there in law what it covers. That is why Mr Pretorius there is something that is very important that you will see when we start to deal with something which is called National Intelligence Estimate which is paragraph 84.  Because National Intelligence Estimate on the basis of law whether – how National Security – National interest is defined and all these other things.  The country is required by law that it must have asecurity assessment.  That security assessment the law place it correctly that it is the responsibility of all the intelligence services.  There are three of them.  They come together in a structure called the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee and it is established by law – it has a code name.They do a threat security threat assessment then from there they look at all the issues as defined as part of the broader trust of the National – the National Security including National Strategic Intelligence.  What is NationalStrategic Intelligence?  It is there.Then they have pillars.  At a particular point I decided to share with you and the commission what were these areas of the National Intelligence Estimate?So that when government started to actually discharge its responsibility in terms of the law – the constitution but also in terms of the governing party manifesto that those that have won elections. They produce a strategic document called medium term strategy framework.  What are these risks?  What are these opportunities?  That information it looks at the totality of the state.  State I do not mean the executive – the state – our nation both from domestic threats and foreign threats then you produce this important document and every time we must start to work.  We must start to respond to these riskassessment tool.  But later on we will get into that.  That is why on 34 it    Before I respond to that I need with your permission Chair there is something here probably I will need – okay.  No, no, no I have got it right now.  You know your light is not good here.  On 36…    (speaking in the vernacular).  No I am going to come to this corruption issue now.  The NIE Ihave decided to say what were these pillars of the NIE?  And I want to put them on record so that we also demystify that certain thing that happened might have not been informed by policy position.The threats that we faced as a country they were classified into five areas and these five areas Chair without actually disclosing the NIE because the NIE is not a public document.  But this one Chair I am taking liberty that when I appeared in Parliament in the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence presenting my strategy plan, they approving the budget including what you call it – policy and budget statement.  You know those budget books.  These things say – Mr Pretorius on all my speeches I have referred them to – the pillars.  The first four pillars they are referring to issues thatare domestically in terms of domestic strategic intelligence and the last pillar are referring to intel – foreign matters.On the first pillar Chair there is a – there was a – our security architecture as a country it looks to the threats to the authority of the state.  It has certain elements in that document.  Violent community protests, violent industrial actions, violent in the transport sector, violent protests in the education sector, viper security, activities of private security industry and protective security.There is something very interesting Chair that youneed to be able to note on the first one.  There is always an adjective that has been used before community protests.Remember protests are allowed but could you see that there is always a qualification violent, violent, violent because the constitution allowed people the right to express freely, they can march, petition but immediately they do this qualification it borders on matters of the law.Because I do not want at a particular point in time the men and women who worked so hard to produce what we call NIE without as if they were not conscious just of the issues of the Bill of Rights.The second matter the threat was to the territorially integrity of the Republic.  We control and the management of border security.  Illegal migration.  We are not saying migration is a problem we are using also the right word    Well, it is not a specific statement but let us be on record.  Not everybody is a friend to South Africa.  We do have enemies.  That is how Intelligence works.  We do have enemies and we live in a world wherewe do not have enemies, we live in a different world.  Even our own friends – you know, there are those countries where we share certain things.  These countries, they will never hesitate, even if they are a friend, on matters of pursuing their national interest including even issues of dominance or economic advantage.We use Intelligence to do these things.  Some of these people, Chair, they live here.  Some, they are declared here in South Africa.  We know that this countryhave these people but in the covert world and counterintelligence, there are people that you will never see and you must never see them.When you catch them, they are in trouble but sometimes they do a slipup, you catch them, sometimes you do not catch them.  The duty for Intelligence is to influence, to get information so that you can make decisions.  You can have an advantage and a covert world gives you an advantage to recruit certain people of influence to advance a particular cause.Very alive that there are these other foreign intelligence in countries.  South Africa is not a small country.  Very strategic in terms of its location and of resources and others and influence and leadership, both here at home and abroad.  They must work on certain people so that these people knowingly and unknowingly, for wittingly and unwittingly, they must pursue their national objective.  This is what is happening and nobody, and I repeat, nobody is immune from being recruited.  They can even recruit a minister, they can recruit a president, they can recruit a judge, they can recruit a parliamentarian.  You can recruit, as long as you know what kind of information and influence you need and that is how, Pretorius, you should look at these things.How will you actually get an advantage if, really, you do not know these people in the influence of power?  You would find them anywhere.       Let us help you.  Let us help you.  Firstly, understand the doctrine.  It is not about matters of economy.  I am not referring in this sentence to the economy.  On our matters of government.  You know, countries, Chair, even today there are countries and governments that have collapsed because of operations of other intelligence services.  Governments have been removed.  It is not a hearsay.  It is not a story.  Governments have been installed, leaders have been installed so that people canget an advantage on all matters.  Immediately, your     It can be any citizen, it can be any organisation, both in the public and private sector.  We are all vulnerable in one way or the other to get and protect, to be used, whether we know or we do not know to push certain things or interest we do not know.  I have – Mr Pretorius have – I do not know.  We never had time to have tea or coffee.  Probably, one day we will have one.      We will have one.  You know, even businesspeople, you know, business – there are serious issues of intelligence.  Intelligence is information.  Do you know there is the biggest problem, even in private sector, called issues of espionage where companies wanted advantage?  You know it is a doggy-dog situation.  They want to have a competitive advantage.  Why you were put in an IP, your Intelligence Property laws?  Because you want to protect certain things.  This is the reality we live in.  Therefore, the answer, all of us, there is a possibility and a threat that we could be recruited, either we wish to or sometimes we do not wish to.  I cannot say who is a spy and who is not a spy, whether my wife is aspy or not.       Well, we are not ...[intervenes]      You are narrowing it if you say industrial trade unions.  If you speak about industrial action, it can be people who are organised or not organised but they employed in a particular sector or industry.  They started to get involved in certain things.  Remember the architecture.Very clear.  Immediately exercising their rights for petition and protest and deal with the issues at the workplace.  Immediately they do their qualification, they acted violent.  It will be a matter of national security and it cannot be ignored.     [Indistinct] Labour by clear definition, I am speaking about workers working wherever they are working.     We can try to put the languages somehow but I am using labour the way the word labour is known without any specificity.     I fully agree.     As long as it is so broad like you are saying it, Baba.     It cannot be narrowed.     Because I am always cognisant ...[intervenes]      ...what is our security architecture and framework.     It looks like in this particular area – and it is a fact – this particular area at a particular point and time ...[indistinct].  Remember the problems that were there, they are common cause and we look at the live – or maybe let me use this word that I never use.  You know, risk assessment is also having the gravy.  High-risk, low-risk and medium – low-risk and medium.  I am jumping.  I should have included medium in there.  But that is how it looks.  It is so scientific but it is on the basis of data.We do not act without data.  And the data – we have a process.  It is the ability to evaluate.  You know, evaluation is an important issue.  Well, there they use the word analyse.  Sometime the data will be accurate, sometime the data will be indicating as probably.  The probability.  And sometimes the data is false.But later on, we will deal with certain people who give us information and give us false information or they give you a hybrid of information, lies and truths.  And if you do not have the right instrument to do data verification.  But I will not go to the methodology.     Because the law does not allow me to go to a methodology.       But evaluation and analyses, an important aspect in the doctrine.     30-minutes, I agree to.     Are you providing me lunch [speaking vernacular]     [laughs]  Okay.     [speaking vernacular]     [laughs]       No, no.  It is fine.  My team will find ...[intervenes]     That is correct.     Well, remember you have given certain documents about certain project name, and when you have given them, those names were not chosen by those who chose them.  So in English to mean that justmake an example. A project is called Tin Roof.  What does it mean?  There are many examples where you would want to come to your annexure at a later point, but I am just giving you as a fact.  It does not necessarily mean that and at the very same time, those who are handling documents, there are clear rules how to handle certain documents. That is why I made a reference, what is the role of the minutes.  The minister must ensure there are policies.  One of the biggest policy imperative that had to be complied with, I hope they will help you as a commission, depending who is security vetted.Even if they cannot give you the documents, a document called operational directive, you will see there what these requirements are, how do you do certain things. But as I was saying to you it is a document classified, it is a document by law. It cannot be published even in the government gazette, but I will not go to it even myself.  I am saying you will have a better sense.     Maybe let me help you Mr Pretorius so that we do not take time.     Okay, because I understood and the assumption that I never understood is not correct.  You probably want to put the question the other way ...[intervenes]     Let me probably allow him to finish.    To put it differently.    But the reality, I understood it.   My apologies for interrupting.     Chairperson, probably let us assist so that we do not take long.  The accounting or theapproval authority, now that the policies are there, the NIE is there and everything, to run any covert operation and in terms of the law, which is the policies that are there, the person will have a sight of that document, is the accounting officer. It does not come to the minister.  That is why even in your packs there is not a single document that has anything to do with projects, with respect to authorisation that just came to me and you do not have my signature there, approving projects. Probably that is how we should be able to help each other.     Which paragraph?    Well, it is an area Baba Zondo, that probably when you conclude towards the end, we can discuss about it.There has to be some systems improvement.  Remember, I am appearing here in front of you.  Now I have a line of sight.  Of some of the documents that were not approved by the minister.  Now I am doing my own reference to say no, no, no but remember there are certain things that were reported to me on a basis of certain intelligence products. Now I look at these documents we have, but probably more details would have been given.  That is how the context Mr Pretorius needs to read in.    As I was saying Chair, on the line of sight on the documents I have ...[intervenes]     And the things you have given me here ...[intervenes]     I could see some words are so broad.    Without more prescriptive and you could see yourselves here ...[intervenes]     In the documents you have.  That is what I am implying to.  Remember, I am responding to notices with certain documents.  This is my observation.     You are correct.  I am not saying the documents have been falsified.     You are correct, Chair.  Read my    Well, it is one of the issues my learned brother here indicate it is a typo but you could see, the abbreviation has the F.  We just have to insert that.     Thank you Mr Pretorius just for highlighting it.     Yes, I have used this statement sothat it can help you Baba Zondo.  To deal with Annexure A.  You have an Annexure A here in terms of your summons.  In rule 3.3 where I am asked a plethora of projects.  Do you know this project, the project name, who is the project sponsor, how much and so forth? This 43 is answering that question.  It is not in my domain and I will not be even able to help you.  I am not an approving authority and that is why I am even referring to you on paragraph 42, to say look who is an approving authority, what are the instruments that are in place for any consideration to be made. But your Annexure A, which I will not be able to help the commission.    You are running too fast.  You are saying paragraph?    Okay.    Just for a second, you are on paragraph what now?  The part that you are reading?    No, no, no I am fine but I was just, is it just a statement broadly because I have seen 45, 46, 47.    No, no, no this one I am very, if I could see it now, I want to help you.  Here we have people so that they can prove a story.  You know, a story and lies that minister is involved and minister branch operation. This point is clear even in this affidavit and Rule 3.3 notices. There are certain instances where certain people are making statements that minister got involved with an asset for an agent.  I will not have been involved with an agent, but ultimately the buck stops with me.  If someone comes and complains I am not saying I am ill-treated. Either this thing being given by members of parliament, either even given by the agents themselves or by my principle which is the president, that so and so hasa problem.  That will be a time when I will say fix this problem.Fix this problem.  It does not necessarily mean you are running the project.  I have instances and let, probably with your permission, I can give them now because I do not want to waste your time, and if ...[intervenes]     No, no, no Chair, I want to deal with them now.     I will repeat my answers, because the other issues, my affidavit is self-explanatory.  Youknow, let us make an example.  We have a project name called Lock.  We have a project name called E-Wing.  You have it in your packs. These people, they come ... that one, that person has not come to testify here as an example.  Someone purports that this minister got involved in an operation.  I am not, firstly there is something that I must put as a reservation on record, because I am going to use the name, the project name that are given.  There is a misstep that happened here.  Eitherunknowingly or knowingly.  Certain people come here, they name certain agents, especially the agent under the project name called Lock.  It is irregular.  You do not do that.  Even if that information is in the public domain, you do not do that to divulge names because it is not you who put it in the public domain.Then there is this guy called Tiemie on the other affidavit by Steven.  This guy is a well-known guy.  The same matter was in the public domain.  He has issues and these issues, they come to my attention and the president and what do you do?  Ultimately you must go in or deal with the problem.  Because I do not want us to be going around the very same thing, someone speaks about the creation of a union and you put a name here of a person.  You do not do that.  Youdo not do that and I will also not do it because I am very cognisant of the law. But then there is a problem.  You turn away as an executing authority and do not solve a particular problem.  I will then allow Mr Pretorius at that point in time, when he wants to ask certain details, but I am placing it on record.  If there is a problem, those who are in authority, vested with authority, they have a duty not to ignore people and get to those who are responsible to solve problems. That is why I might have taken long, because I donot want my affidavit to be interpreted by other people, otherwise and this affidavit in mind is also helping you to clarify certain issues, but when the detail is required ...[intervenes]     I will be able to give you certain things that I am allowed to or the thing that I would not be able to do.    But I thought let me be able to do that because there is a narrative.  When you intervene, it is like focal interference.  When you intervene, there is a problem.  It is a matter that must be regarded you ran operation. I wanted that clarity to be there.    No, let me just help you.  The denials and I have given the context because everything is on record.  The things that have been said here toimplicate me by all these individuals, are incorrect.  They do not even have a shred of evidence, Chair that they have to demonstrate that. They were sitting here Chair.  All of them, those three that appeared here, they told you in [indistinct].  They told you.  It is hearsay.  This is what they say about this one, this is what they say about this one, but at the end when they concluded, they told you they do not have evidence. They are on record.  After they have spoken for the whole day they told you they do not have evidence.  Ultimately what did they tell you as a fall-back position?  No, no, no project Vesa is incomplete.  That is what they told you. There is no evidence.  You know, I am not a lawyer. I am just a pure scientist.  I only know water, but I also know intelligence and I deal with facts, not fiction.  They never gave you evidence.  They say I took money, as an example. You have it on record here.  If someone must take money there is a paper trail and you do not have my signature there.  It is on record.  Someone says I broke the law, they never told you.  Someone says they were standard in intelligence. They are not there.  There is one matter, when MrPretorius will want to come to certain detail.  Chairperson, project Vesa is incomplete.  It is on record.  They gave you.  There is a person called Dorothy.  I just wanted, without bringing your meeting into, your commission into disrepute.  Someone in the commission they have decided to put a document and even another document that has been submitted by the lawyers of Dorothy, where the matters you want to discuss about Dorothy, I know now.  Dorothy has furnished them. Furnished them with an affidavit that have not been included in my pack.  Dorothy is on record there.  She never brought money on that thing, but that is why I have indicated Chair, there are also additional people.  Let me just help you.There is other names here because other documents came yesterday.  We have someone called an inspector general of intelligence.  There is a Rule 3.3 that we only received that probably last week if I am not mistaken, I will not be accurate on time. Do you know something so funny Baba Zondo?  You know if someone is going to give you a report, you cannot come here.  This is one problem Baba Zondo when it comes to the commission, where people they will think that the commission is being used. You need to ask us the difficult questions.  There are people who came here, but they have actually gotten away with murder.  They have actually by their own conduct, politicise this which is not your intention.  I believe in your bona fides.  I believe in your bona fides Mr Pretorius.  You have an inspector general of intelligence.  He comes on a 3.3.  The minister of state security directed a deputy minister of state security, who then directed an official to give bursaries to certain people. Those minister, the deputy minister has never said here on record that I actually did that.  I was not even interviewed.  These are the things on 50, that these allegations and these things you are trying to actually implicate me, are not true. Unfortunately in the intelligence Baba Zondo, in the intelligence they use a particular platform to get a particular narrative.  Here you are sitting with political animals.  You know political animals that have their own issues?I will demonstrate at a particular point with a matter of judges, where one of these witnesses called Steven as an example, he lies here.  He has not came here.  My legal team had said no, no, no but do not speak about people who have not came here. I said no, I am not going to allow Baba Zondo to think that I am hiding things.  In the affidavit he writes, he claims that I introduced judges to him.  In the affidavit he says he does not remember the judges I introduced him.  he is then asked by the then acting DG hey man, try to find pictures here so that you can be in a position to actually say no, no, no but minister ran something about judges. Then ultimately in the same affidavit in the documentation here, he says he cannot be in a position to confirm which judge.  Do you know, this witness who was an acting DG comes here to you and say I do not, Baba Nfumati, in a very leadership way, he says no, no, no but let us not try to create this impression about judges. I do not want to venture there, but no, the acting DG comes – but I have some circumstantial evidence.  Inthis affidavit before the end I can tell you this character called Stephen is the one that right now, as I speak, they are working on a false alert to implicate a judge as if judges are bought and they are bringing the institution into disrepute.  In the affidavit they say no, no, no, they do not know about it.  They are running the operation.  That guy is a [indistinct] he is the same guy who chose to lie about certain politician and a head of Chapter 9 institution and said that these guys are a CIA, that guy.  And when you say no, no, but produce reports here, that this judge –these people are CIA, we open up, say no, no, no, let us even open up a case.  Then we have a situation where the information was not forthcoming until I left.  As I am standing here without any fear or favour or contradiction I know there is a judge they are trying to frame when a judge has never received money and I want to place it on record, I have never given an instruction that a judge must be bought and in terms of my knowledge, there is not even a single judge that has been bought.  It does not necessarily mean that these judges, the honourable judges, you do not have your own missteps, the balance and checks that are there are very adequate.These are some of the things, insinuations that have been made here.  I never wanted uBaba Zondo to waste your time and go to each detail.  That is why mylaying of foundation, what are the sixteen, what, what, what, I just wanted to give you a sight of these things but these things that they are saying here, I am record, I deny them.     Only denying them, uBaba Zondo, they have never presented you with a shred of evidence.  When Mr Pretorius goes to details we should be faster because where you do not have my signature I do not want us to be boring each other on matters that are reallyinconsequential because this is evidence but where there is a knowledge – but these are the issues, the country is waiting, judges are being paid, judges are being bought.     Now Chairperson, let me help you.  You know, you are trying your best, your system cannot be bullet proof.  I am saying to you I am not going to come and lie here.  I am saying to you in that position of theCommission’s team, the lady was trying to come and show Mr Pretorius right now, there is that affidavit and I will not tell you, there is even the advocated that represented Dorothy here and remember, all of us, via the legal teams, I am saying to you Dorothy has submitted an affidavit, I am not going to be discussing that but that affidavit in the – that I know it is in the possession of your team, that affidavit does not say that I took money and I do not want us to go there.     You will be in a particular position where I will help you with certain aspects but I just put it on record, let us not it a meal out of it and at a particular point [speaking in the vernacular]     Let us investigate …[intervenes]     But do not raise your voice please, let us respect the Chair.     Chair…      Chairperson, I agree with your decision, it suits me and I was not going to hide this matter from record.  No mistakes can happen but let us allow them to look at it including the legal representative of Dorothy.  Then I am fine.      Chair, let me come in.     You see, let us not complicate the work of the Commission and throw stones.  I never used word of conceal matters and so forth.  You know whenpeople they start to express opinions and try to make others look bad, that is not my intention.  You have made a very sound ruling, I respect you.  Let them go and do this thing.  If there is an error being made there, let us not try to be adversarial, please.  I have just put it on record, I am respecting your decision.  Well, there are the other issues that there is declassification and so forth, it is fine to respond to but someone must not to start to say I have used words like concealing, do this, I was just bringing to your attention and in a good spirit we have handled thematter well.     Chairperson, I am on record.  I say it has been brought to my attention.     And I can even tell you, Chair, remember I am in intelligence, I am not actually going to divulge any secret or any person. I do have the copy and if – remember we are dealing with certain …[intervenes]     No, no, no, you I misunderstoodme.     I will never use those words.  That is why I am comfortable and I would be very, very wary immediately people started to say I have accused the Commission.  I will never try to bring your Commission into disrepute.  I put this matter on record now in that good spirit you have done, let them look at it.     And if I am making an error in judgment on what I have, I will come and say regrettably there is an error.     But immediately we start to be venturing who is bringing the Commission into disrepute, that is not – I am not actually at that point.     Definitely do, we have a country to build for you and me and our children’s children.  That one I guarantee.      Okay.     Why cannot you use this - Mr Pretorius, these things A or B or what?     Let them just show me just quick – so that I can run quickly because the team you brought,they taught me about A, B, C, D.     No, no, that is easy now, when you say C it is easy now, I am there.     Yes.     Okay.     Ja, that is my very fancy signature, Mr Pretorius.     Which paragraph?ADV PRETORIUS     This thing is very faint.  Which lineis talking Ministry?     Yes, I see.     Ja, I see the one start at the programme.     Okay.     No, no, no, I can see it now.     Ja.  I see in this one – let us place it on record.  Minister does not approve projects.  The naming to say it is projects approved by minister, it is a wrong naming because in your records there is not even a single project where I am the approving authority.  I do not even want to interpret what it says but that is what the lawsays and this is what the documents will have.  Therefore I will not be able to assist Mr Pretorius when he starts to ask which projects were approved by minister.     5 point?     No, no, no, I can see.    No, no, no, as I am saying to you,it is misleading because you are having a document and I am just seeing it now here, Judge Zondo, Minister does not approve projects, these are clear and everything you have here in front of you, very clear stipulated, there is no approval by minister.    But do not read it that way.  Do notread it that way, why will you approve 130 million when the ministry for projects is allocated 20?  Read this document properly, not in the eyes of the people who come and testify here only.  Here this what we call it in terms of the PFMA and in terms of the Secret Services Special Account Act.  At a particular point there has to be an adjustment of budget depending whether the budget is adequate or not and that is allowed in terms of those two legislation and that affidavit, if this document, you want to read it selectively, you will actually mislead people.  There are a number of programmes – there are programmes there that were not performing well, they requested reprioritisation  and the reprioritisation, Chair, it does not say it was only meant for projects, there was a reprioritisation for the entire budget of SSA and I am required by the law, theSecret Services Act that at a particular point when the recommendation comes to me, I look at the recommendation, I approve it.  After I am approving it, remember on the Secret Services special account, that information even before you spend the money you must send the approval by the executing authority to the other executing authority, which is the Minister of Finance.  Look at the date here, 16 November 2015, those are the times around adjustments when they are being made and the fact that there is some kind of an insinuation in that documentthat we are approving a project is not actually what do you call it here, supported by facts and to suggest that the total amount for the projects was 130 like Mr Pretorius is suggesting, not true.  Just check that table you are referring me to.  There are a number of programmes, there are a number of proposed budgets and then the total for all of them, this is what it means.     Well, it is very simple, when we use the word programmes there are programmes as defined by the Public Service Regulation.  Any organisation in the PMFA, it has a programme structure and in each programme 1, programme 2, programme 3, like theministry, as an example, it falls under programme 1.  There is domestic intelligence falling under what and under it there are sub programmes.  This is what this approval is about.  It has nothing to do …[intervenes]    No, no, no, programmes are the structural arrangement.    In terms of the requirements by the Public Service Regulation that you must have a programme structure.    And then it does not matter under what programme where a particular project can be implemented.  That is my answer.    Yes, it will be under a programme.    The project does not supersede theprogramme.    Ja.    Thank you, Chair.    No, there is no misunderstanding, as soon as …[intervenes]    I am there.    I have put it on record that the reflection calling it Minister ’s projects, it will have been used incorrectly and there is nothing supporting that because remember your first question was to say which projects?  I am on record for you, minister does not.     And the other view that you put in to say no, no, no but all this money was going to projects, like these witnesses were trying to insinuate.This document when it says Minister ’s Project is fundamentally wrong, and it is something that I see here and is something that is not even a practice and it is not even documented that can say this is Minster ’s Project but the whole submission Chair, do not lose the essence of the submission.  The essence of the submission someone comes here because sometimes we must not beat up on the bush.  Let us just go to the matter.  Someone says no, no but it is the Minister decided to actually give special operations for budgets, that submission here is a proof that they gave R130million.  The heading is clear, it is a secret services account at certain programs, needed resources.  And in my own affidavit, if you noticed Chair, that I am even saying that it is certain programming projectswere actually over running budget.  And I thought that I should be able to do that but I see what Mr Peters is referring to the naming as Minister ’s Project.      To do that one.    That is my handwriting and that Chair, is in line with 5.2.     Where you actually do not agree with the recommendation it is always crossed out but it, ja.     The one that is remaining Chair, is the one that remains.     It is normally in terms of the calendar of adjustment and so forth.  They happen around September, October, November but it depends, it is not only that it is on a specific date.      Read it, read the heading Chair.      If you want to reprioritise the budget, follow the Secret Services Act, there is a law and the most – the action for the utilisation on unexpended balance from the budget, blah, blah, blah, blah, required by programs in the mid-year review.  That is the heading, that is the purpose, self-explanation.      Of the budget.     Because they cannot move - the authority to reprioritise the budget lies with me, in terms of the Secret Services Act with the concurrence of finance.     Until I do that nobody must touch the money.     Yes.      Of, under cover?     Under cover what?     Ja, that is what helps me.     Maybe you will help me.     Remember the team that hasbrought the documents in the morning they might have packed it otherwise, but the A’s, the B’s, the C, the D they have, its annexure what?     Oh, three?     Okay, thank you for doing that.     453?     Okay I am there.     Yes, I see.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.      Yes, I see that.     I never issued an instruction and please note that if I had issued an instruction that had financial implication, any executive instruction will complywith Section 64, Sub-section 64.1, 2 and 3 of the PFMA. Instructions must be in writing - I am not actually – let me not waste time, no instruction was issued and if any person says there was an executive instruction, he will produce to you that has financial implication in terms of the PFMA Section 64.     I see that.     And the answer is that if someone says there is an instruction from me on this date, that has financial implications and I am not aware of any such instruction, please ask them in terms of Section 64 of the PFMA to furnish the Commission.      Well, those who put it here they will have to help.     Four, five?     Okay.     I see that.     The law provides it because there is an Act retained earnings clearly define what are the conditions to do but in terms of this document it is their own conversation there.  I am not even involved in that conversation.     I have responded Chair, if someone says there is an instruction, let them give you in terms of Section 64.     I am saying Chair with due respect, if there is an instruction issued to me, as requiredby the law, because I cannot ask people to do something outside the law.  Let them put it here and then I will deal with it, but there is no instruction here.     Chair I have said if there is an instruction I have issued it has to be in writing and if anybody carries an instruction an executive directive or instruction outside the law, I cannot be held liable for that. And if the instruction was issued and the instruction was illegal, the law is clear what we do, ultimately the matter must land with the National Treasury and the matter must land with Parliament, which is good.     No instruction.     Yes.     Yes.     Yeah, that is my signature.     Yes.     Yes.    Page what?     Okay, I see, yes I see.     Yes.     Okay, yes.     Yes.      Yes.      I do not agree with you; it is not written here.  It is your proposition.    I do not want to speculate, remember, when they do projects I am not the approval authority to say this is a project plan how does it look like.     No.      Chair, let me help you, I am not going to comment on things I am on record right now that I am not part of the approval authority.  These are projects and I will not actually have the project concept document.  And Mr Pretorius does not try to get an answer out of a stone, this answer applies to all projects.      And secondly, I will not want youto comment and speculate on something that I was not privy to this project plan as per the approved document.      But Chair by they are the same, because these are both projects.      And the difficulty I have, projects there is a clear mechanism that I have explained.     Firstly the submission must not be read in part.  The approval was for the utilisation of the unexpected balance to fund refurbishment of infrastructure, property acquisition and lastly, covert projects.  And when it comes to projects, and those project details, they are notin my page.     Remember the approval - let me help, the approval in terms of the background, go to 2 point what – is it 2.1 where it speaks that if you want toreprioritise budgets and be able to take it from other programs to other programs, you have to get the Minister ’s authority, that is what it means.  Let us not put it the other way around, it is self-explanatory as I was empowered by the law.     Ja.     Yes, including even the purpose itself.     Yes, I see do.    Yes.     Yes, I do.     I will, I will not disclose that and in this document, there is no such disclosure.     Chairperson, the document is self-explanatory, there is nowhere in this document that says we are approving projects.     I read the document.     But also the line also want to create an impression, let us not lose - I want to put it for my own record for you. The purpose of the approval is not amounting to approval of projects but there you have a description, what these things mean.      No but on page 44 the approval is     No, let us not leave it out because we are using one document.  I will have a difficulty Chair with your permission.  Where is - you know what, you go and select one point, let us read the whole thing - what is the approval as on record.     Where you reading that?     Okay, page 36, sub-paragraph what?     No, no I just want to be sure, are you referring to 1.1?    There is no word, yes that is the purpose clearly defined.     I am saying that is the purpose as you see there it is clearly defined what was this meant for.     Yeah, that is - those are the one that you see them outlined.    I am going to break my arm – this thing is heavy.      Remember where I come from Bab    It is like when I said assets it does not mean the financial assets you know.    I am on Bundle 02 now.    I have got it now.    431 ne?    Well Chairperson this is the part thatwe spoke earlier on if you recall and you asked Mr Pretorius, my team and the team for Dorothy to have that short discussion and I suppose to start to – to want me to start to engage on this document it is going to be problematic until we have actually sorted that particular point.  That is my – that is my comment.   And – but without actually trying to stop the interaction but you have made a ruling that there is a process because I have made a statement and the Counsel – Honour his learned – my learned friend here on behalf of Dorothy there are certain things you have said.  Let them conclude that thing and if this will be the only outstanding matter in particular with Dorothy when we are able to clarify the existence or the non-existence as I was saying of that other document.  I will be able to find a way to come either in a form of an affidavit or what – a supplementary one to clarify for you.  But at this stage I think we are going to be having this up and downs on a matter that is on the table right now.  That is my request.    But I will…    Thank you.    Well I would also ask this Chair with your permission the comment that monies were – were sent to my house that is not true and there is a process.  You seeone of the things we must deal with is that it is to create a different organisation just where it may be needed.  And if there is any person who alleges that I took money and against the policy directive and the control measures that I have referred to in the Ministerial Payment Directive and in    Yes,    And if there is such the person who alleges that they will give you the time, the date and there is always a document that those who receive it and those who deliver it they all sign.   I have never said that way.  I said any person who takes money from the agency the Ministerial Payment Directive was the process the OD is still.  You cannot take cash without internal controls.      No I am on record Chair.  There is no money given to me.    It does not even matter whether it is operations.    For every acquisition you made there are clear rules and processes and there is also an accountability mechanism and internal controls.    The affidavit is clear there is no evidence to say the money was delivered.  There is no evidence to say the TA was signed or not.  When you present a TA the TA is a temporary advance.    I am dealing with it Chair.    My answer …    There is no money I received.    It is M9?    And then on the cover?    Yes but you are spoiling our tea party.    He is spoiling our tea party now.     I have no comment.     Four hundred and...?     3-18.1-39?     No, no.  I am there.  It is sub-paragraph 13.     Where my name is referred to.     And my answer.  It is a denial.     Thank you.     Yes, I am there.     Yes, I can see.    What is the number, again?     No, no.  Yes, the subparagraph.     2.3.       No, no.  I am onboard.  I see them.     And I have given on the other page.    If he can just refer to the numbers, then I will respond.     Well, where specifically my name is mentioned, my answer, it is a no.     You know.  Sorry, can I interject here?     Maybe Chair I can also add...[intervenes]      I want to come in, Chair.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Chair, I want to come in because it is my reputation here.     You see, Chairperson.  I repeat.  I have utmost respect.     I never wanted to deal with some of the things happening in your office for a particular cause.     This document was brought by the investigators this morning.  Even my lawyer does not have this document.  They brought this document in the morning.      What I have done, Chair, to assist the Commission.  The issues referred to on 3.3, I have furnished the affidavit.  I will not comment on this document that was given this morning and I have not read it.  But those guys, when they came this morning, I know it is coming from Project Veza.  These documents that I have allowed myself, even under constraint, to speak to, they were sent, even this bundle.  Late hours,yesterday in the evening.  I went through this document until two a.m.       That this one that he says from SSA, it has been declassified.  I was not given but the instance of the accusation made about me, not the consideration of other people, I have responded to that issue, like I am dealing with the question of the...  But I am not, Chair, going to get into the document that was given this morning.     If we are assisting us(?), Chair. These document written Exhibit YY-13 ...[intervenes]      The people of SSA they came here.  Ms K who was running the project, they have told you this Project Veza is incomplete.  Someone is bringing a conversation of other people of an incomplete document.     But to save time and reserving myright, I am not going to comment on Exhibit YY-13.  And I am prepared, Chair, despite the constraints I have been subject to, because I am of the view there was no malice from the Secretariat.  I will deal with issues on Bundle 1 and Bundle 2.     Okay.     For that ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.  But let it alsobe on record, this one so that South Africans know what are we dealing with.  SSA, the acting Director General then, has a lot of correspondence from my legal team, requesting documentation.  These correspondence was also copied to your offices and I hope you had sight of them.  Not a document has been given to date by them.  And I do not want to deal with the motive that they continued to politicise and weaponize using this platform.  That is why I am happy with your ruling but where I am uncomfortable, like I have told you about the exhibit that they have just given.     I am not venturing.  But that is why the Commission has been caused problems.       We are even in court now because other people that are implicated by people in SSA, they are refusing to give them documents.     And the instruction that was given by His Excellency when the then President and our current President was that we should do whatever it is to support the Commission.     But there are certain institutionsand SSA in particular, not the whole institution, the then Acting Director General, who is deliberately ensuring that we do not receive documents so that the objective that we wanted to paint here can actually fly.  But I am happy.  You have called us here now.  We are able to have the right to reply to certain things.     But let us just put it on record.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      I am there.     Paragraph 15?     These statements are false and I deny them.    Well, on 80 I was not involved in projects as we spoke earlier on, on those day to day.  It is in my affidavit, I will not be able to refer you to.  On 81, on the first paragraph, I deny that he came to deliver cash as he is stating there. On 82, I denied that I gave him the instruction to go to the airport and give the money to the ANC women’s league.    It is still the same one we are using?    Okay, where there is zero to 300.    I am there.     You said 48 to 51?    I see the content.     Well Chair, I did comment on this statement earlier on if you recall and they claim some of these malicious statement that have been made and putting the judiciary in disrepute.  My affidavit is clear.  Nopayment, no direction was actually ever made to judges and I have actually indicated to you Chair and I am very serious, this is the pack.You know [indistinct], they are found outside but they are also found in intelligence.  Where certain people even give one information, and even lies.  This is the same person, I am on record, who actually accused certain politician and the head of a chapter 9 institution and he continues to do so here. At the end of this affidavit, on the 3.3 that you sentme, this same person agrees that he has no knowledge of this thing and I am repeating it with heavy heart, because not all men and women intelligence are good.  There are many of them who are working hard to keep our country safe, but this one, those actions I hope the leadership at a particular point will deal with it. But the reality as 48 says, there was no money delivered to me and as it speaks about me on 59, and I deny, it is 50 of these numbers.  It is 50, I also deny it, including 51.     Yes, I do see it and it is the very same omission that we made earlier on when I was testifying at home and I would gently accept that Mr Pretorius and your team including our team will do that.     Then next paragraph I would like to refer you to, is paragraph 12 of the same affidavit.     Paragraph 12?    I am there, Chair.    No, I do not want to do that.     Chairperson, you will have to assist us here, before I comment Mr Pretorius, whether you want to keep us long because these things you arereading, they are not part of the Rule 3.3 notice.  They are extracts.  I am going to comment, but if we go this route Chair, with respect there are specific things. I will comment on this one, but I will want us to find a more productive way because I was not given the full affidavit but the extracts, because here the just of the matter is that this person alleges that I introduced him to judges, and the answer is no. I never introduced him to judges and I never issued any instruction or by any directive that the judges must bepaid, and it is an important issue that we are clarifying for the nation.  So that these kind of people do not come here, when you hear someone say no, no, no his relationship went bad and so forth. I am not here to do that.  I am more of a leader to get into that level, but let me help you Chair so that we can disperse with this matter, as I have denied this thing.  I am not saying I am denying a meeting or what because I cannot recall.  If you want to go to that part.  Go to paragraph 33 and 34, under SSA 02, 307.  This same guide Chair, he cannot even say who are these people and this is the kind of an evidence that must be presented to the nation and create innuendos on a hard fought constitutional democracy we fought. I will not undermine it and I will never be party to that, where judges are actually insulted.  This guy on  his own words, he says he will not be in the position to do that, even despite the operation that they are running with Mr Jaftha, the then acting DG, just to try to prove their weaponisation, that is the word they use here. Weaponisation and politicisation.  They are trying to find a judge to make a scapegoat.  Even if one day they can come to you or anybody and insult that judge, because now I even have an idea which judge are they trying toactually insult, when an affidavit is written that he has no kind of a recollection.I will help that particular judge, because you will actually even have to do those method of telephone extrapolations and so forth, but these are some of the kind of people.  This one the main issue I actually made an instruction.  I introduce judges, answer is no.  I instructed them to actually bribe judges or pay judges, the answer is no and the own affidavit of this person, self-explanatory.  Thank you.    This one Chair, I am dispersingwith this one.      [Vernacular – 00   No, this is very profound.  You know certain actions we do either by omission or commission.  We have a security risk to this democracy we enjoy and this thing I refuted with the content it deserve.  That is why I was actually even, sometimes I have a feeling well lawyers are lawyers, you studied your own profession, I studied mine, you need to follow certain things. But you have something self-explanatory at the end.  You know what, I do not have evidence and I was hurt because you know, you actually was involved when I took my oath the last time and you sit here this man is taking an oath with me here.  Probably he thinks I am in his pay roll.  No, they can criticise judges like any other person but it should not be an easy thing to make inferences without proof.  Well, judges and all of us, we are mere mortal.  We do certain things. That is why there are balancing checks.  That is why we are having that particular structure and chain.    And I am happy for public interest, on this specific matter.  I am very clear on this specificmatter.  No introduction, no instruction and I am just saying please be on alert because intelligence is good but it can also be dangerous. And people who know how to play around depending on issues of, you know certain people are paranoid.  If you hear something about you, you become paranoid.  Intelligence must be evidence based.      I have dealt with that, Mr Pretorius, but very interesting that you should do as an observation, if you read 33 and 34 and take into account Mr Jafta’s testimony, of another allegation despite this affidavit, Chair, I have circumstantial evidence of a particular judge.  These things are serious and they must not be done in our name, people must bring thisinformation and I hope you will not allow them to get away and I am happy that you are clarifying the position of the judiciary as headed by His Excellency, the Chief Justice Mogoeng-Mogoeng.     [Speaking in the vernacular]  Okay, I am there, Mr Pretorius, from page 52.  We can proceed.     Chairperson, can I …[intervenes]     Chairperson – just a sec, Mr Pretorius, you by omission or commission, I have a very serious problem with this affidavit now especially when Mr Pretorius is reading.  One, if these people worked for intelligence, these people that have been mentioned – let me finish it, there is a very problematic issue, you cannot – you cannot at any stage – I know it is not your affidavit, Mr Pretorius, because certain people decided to do their job to say declassification and classification.  Now we are being made unintentionally to speak about people’s names. You always respect that cardinal principle and this that is actually appearing here is a problem and but I also do not want to fall into a trap just to disclose indirectly or directly any secret entrusted to me in terms of the oath you gave me.  But [speaking in the vernacular] it does not get to be done because I am seeking from the point of vantage(?) I know certain names and I know their status whether what is their role, they should have actually done certain things but you do not do it.  Probably uBaba Pretorius just going forward, he can refer to us, probably omit certain names. It is the biggest risk that while I am trained on this thing, uBaba Zondo, I do not want to accuse at a particular point.     What I will prefer, Chair, there is always a misstep, certain things they will fall through the cracks.  This doctrine inasmuch as how we feel about certain people, it must be respected.  I made an earliercomment that is unprecedented in the intelligence environment to disclose certain information, methodology, body, mean, whatever structure that is being used that could unintentionally reveal certain names.I made an example for you, that there is a reference of a name in what we call it Project Lock and then there is no reference of a name on a project called Eewee(?).  When the two individuals are prominent names you do not do that.  Then there is a same mistake that I pick it here, I do not have a problem, Mr Pretorius must continue to askme but where he sees a name of a problem, let us not do this while I am sitting here so that I just – that is my instruction to assist you.     But because I have it you will see the name is in the document where people’s names.  Unless the name of a person is about the title or the responsibility but immediately it becomes an operational matter which is a covert operation, where you see a name, you do not call it.  But if it is about policy, about titles and all these other, anyway, you can do it.     I do not want to be…     Ja, I am – my English word isrunning, you know, being complicit.     Ja.     Remind me where we were?  We are on page…?     Thank you, I am there.     We are on page – on 53?     Yes, I can see the name.     Thank you.     No, no, no, I am familiar what you are speaking about but the cardinal principle, Chair, anything that is covert-related whether it happens to get into the public domain, the authority, which is this case, the authority in law, which is intelligence services even ifthe name is there, you do not do what people have already done.  Will be able to go to this but I have given my advice so that we do not waste time.     Chairperson, I will need the help from my legal team.  There are certain things that I am going to say here that I want them to pay attention so that they can assist me.  There were certain documents that I received last night on a WeTransfer – I do not know whether that is the platform you use – and certain things I saw and there are certain things that these allegations are made.  I might not go on each point in the paragraph but there are certain things I want to put on record.  This is one matter that was brought to my attention about difficulty of an intelligence operation going wrong and people theycome here to you, they make affidavit, they have been into the papers.  I am speaking about Blank – this Blank 2, Mr Pretorius, and it has been very difficult, very difficult because in intelligence you always have to safeguard the secret nature of operations.  But when something goes wrong and the complaint comes to you, in this case a complaint came to me and when this complaint comes to me, already they are legal papers.  Legal papers are being taken to court.  Not an opinion, it is a fact, they are taken to court and I am the respondent in some of thesedocuments, Mr Pretorius, you see here.  But some of this evidence, without getting into that operation, one, people so confident Mahlobo creates a union and I have chosen not to defend myself in public.  The documents in your possession, the alleged union – I will use this word because I am trying not to indirectly or directly divulge secrets – the alleged union.  The documentation in your possession and the affidavits that are here, they allege that this incident happened around 2013.  Even the documents that are coming from the Department of Labour in your possession.  But people have been saying this minister, my apology, is meddling on matters of rights for workers to belong and the dates are not corresponding.  When did this guy become a minister?  25 May 2014.  And someone has the audacity “This minister creates union.”  Itis here, on this 3.3.  Just check the documents.  You know, I like evidence because it is factual.  I will not speak about that thing, Deputy Chief Justice and Chair, but do not incriminate me on things that there is no correlation.  Those dates that are there are not correlating.     No, I am saying that someone says here on record “Mahlobo created the union”, a fact.  And I am saying your own documents at your disposal, the alleged union created was not from the 25 May of 2014,the documents in your possession, they are showing you otherwise.  I went through them last night. Number two, I do not want to deny that this person did actually took us to court and then this person, the responsible managers whose operation had a misstep, had to actually correct this thing and it is the manner it was corrected but there is no instruction that I say you know what, every time you receive a problem, you cannot say people must deal with it, they had to deal with it but there was no instruction to say give money, do this, I say solve the problem because the problem was brought to my attention.  But to lie and say that because I had to get better involved to say that that agent, the matters of the agent must be attended.  They attended the matter the way they deem it fit.  Then they insinuate in another paragraphhere now, Mr Pretorius, is to sign off an involvement in operation.   We will go to the others now and I am happy to give you this information.  In as far as these others you will come to, indeed there were complaints and my affidavit from time to time, complaints from public, from parliamentarians including assets for agents and this is one case.  Thank you.     Thank you, it is correct.     It is correct.     That one is correct, you have it there.     But this one think that Baba [indistinct], certain operation can go wrong and you will not be a bystander under the circumstances that you are talking about and it should never and ever be construed as running an operation and fortunately here your Commission has assisted, you have put dates here, you have put documents, I am fine.     Ja, it was finally settled.     No instruction.     Well, that is what I am told because I had never had sight of the settlement agreement but the responsible managers manage – who manage the problem that has often intelligence, operational failure(?). Chair may I…?     I am not sure for – because I have had to look at the evidence leader, he has been standing the whole day and I am a youngster, I should in actual fact be the longevity and together with the Chair, I am battling to understand now where you get this energy.  Can we have about five to ten minutes and also that will allow me to go to the bathroom, Chairperson.     He has done a very good job, it is not easy to stand there for all the time unlike us who are seated.     And I am on your corner, you can hire me to be your shop steward.       And then you will be the employer – I will carry some black cards that will not [indistinct].     Thank you, Chair.     Are we still on the same page we were before?     Okay.     Y5, okay.     165, okay.     Well as I have indicated the issue that when the problem came to me I did ask the responsible project managers who handled the matter, and indicated that matters of intelligence if they go to Courtthey become so damning and I never gave him to say this is the amount this you must be able to pay.   I only said we do not have the hundred and something million that is required, find a way to deal with the matter because it was their operational failure, but the quantum’s I deny them, I agree that I asked them to actually engage with this asset that had problems, that had already been brought to my attention.     We are running too fast now, my cover page?     YY8, of?     I am there Chair.     Firstly let us start with this person, this affidavit, because I want to address it.   I do not know this person, and in the very same affidavit this person is actually when I read your Rule 3.3 notices Chair, [speaking in vernacular], it is hearsay, he alleges that he came to my house with one of the senior managers whowas driving and he says that this senior manager I made him to account why this asset mentioned here is not being paid.   I have never met with Shadow, and I have never discussed this issues.  All the issues that Shadow refers to here, because I do not want to waste your time, I deny them.     Let us deal with Mr Shadow, so that we do not deal with a – what do you call it, smoke and mirrors, this guy Shadow never brought this person or interacted with me, and I deny the things that he is saying here, because I am going to be speculating of even of a person that never set foot into my house, and he is one funny character, even if you look at his profile here.    Look at the profile of this guy and that said inasmuch as we do have good men and women this guy that I have never even met, even on a single day, comes and tells stories that no, so and so said about this or said about something else, that cannot be the work of the Commission, but for completeness for this affidavit my answer I refute it.    What?     What kind of report?     It is under cover what?     We can proceed.     Can I just with your permission Chair?     Mr Pretorius dealing with a nextannexure P where is the affidavit because now I am just dealing with a report.  I want affidavit so that I deal with people what they say to implicate me because this is one report I have not actually even read it, probably yesterday and I will not be able even to help you now.     My preference say through Chair is that I do not want to deal with Project Veza.     Project Veza and internal SSA investigation, I am not even party to that participation.  If members of Project Veza or anybody who participate in Project Veza let them give you an affidavit Chair, then I will deal with it.   And I agree with Mr Pretorius on the other second part, but annexure P I need someone to - remember the people who came here were managing Project Veza, they were able to actually put this thing on an affidavit.  But this document also Chair, with your indulgence I have not read this one here, Mr Pretorius.  You can find a way thatprobable if you want to come back, we can agree with the legal team of a way of how we handle it.      If there is an affidavit I will respond.     Someone taking ownership of what Honourable Pretorius is saying.      No, you have done all your questions?     No, I have an issue.     That one I have indicated even to the leadership, the Head of the National Executive despite challenges we have gone through in the organisation we assigned to we will give some views and then it will be up to them to deal with those view.   But our experiences there, the good things we did and the missteps, they can be able to serve as a lesson.      Well what I will do because normally Chair, you give us an opportunity of concluding remarks.       I might not have to come and appear here but I will definitely put it through the Secretariat those certain things because I have views to, other than the other thing that people were implicating me on but I have views because they debate around the intelligence services all over the world, it continues rageon.  Even in the best of biggest the oldest democracies, let me not use the biggest the oldest democracy that I have we all have to grapple with it from time to time.      Thank you, Chair.     Yes, Chair Mr Pretorius and my legal team, they will have a discussion, even if it means I must come just for a shorter period if we can find time in your tight schedule, because only this document of which we can give. But the other one will also even if dependingtheir final agreement, will even by that time, I would have tried to do some write up.      It will already be furnished here and then depending on your ultimate decision, we will decide how to handle it.  But for your own completeness as well assisting this process to read of ourselves of the challenges experienced over time while still tending this democracy, I will clearly do it.     No, we are very happy Chair, that our team needs to do where there is really, really concrete matters that has to be done, so that at least you have the completeness even despite your time constraints.      Sorry I think what I did earlier is an error that I misunderstood your 15 minutes and you see me in chambers.  Maybe let me understand the directive from the Chair.      We would await a correspondence from the Commission it is from us, we just have to file.    Okay, we owe the Commission ourselves.      Noted Chair, thank you.     Chair, before you close I must thank you.      Thank you with your Commission for being patient and thank Mr Pretorius and the Secretariat, despite their issues with my learned representative, mistakes in the cause of duty they do happen.      On a lighter note, Mr Pretoriuswhile you are getting into work, you must find time, we have agreed on a strong coffee, [speaking in vernacular]     And you need to give him time, he has been working so hard.

Well thank you very much Chairperson and to Mr Pretorius and the other colleagues from the commission.  Firstly we just want to – to thank you including my legal team to thank you that you have invited us here to come and assist the commission and – because one has a responsibility to do so but it is going to be important that before we go to certain issues (inaudible) this thing by the  I will definitely do that Mr Pretorius.  What...I never checkedChairperson who was in the employ in the Intelligence Services before I got into office.  I will repeat ... [speaking vernacular] Okay but ...[intervenes] ...[intervenes]   There are two names he mentioned, that that report had an adverse finding on two individuals.  The names were mentioned here and it is my responsibility to help the Commission that I do not want your Commission, Chair, that sometimes it gets unwarranted attacks and I must be very conscious in assisting you that we do not do that.  There were two names.  But where it is general information, it has nothing to do with …[intervenes]  Because those are wrong intelligence words.  Well, the record of my participation will be with the panel itself, I never recorded myself but there the secretariat had his own record, I participated.  My apologies (speaking in vernacular).  I am saying on the basis of law the powers ofthe Minister are very defined but for intelligence to work we must create rules.  This document called Operational Directives is one of the rules that is very important and policy making is the responsibility of the executing authority which is the Minster. This is one of the important issues that for all the issues that are relevant to counter intelligence I do not want us to use these words Special Operations because this work is about counter intelligence.There had to be rules because there were problems – the problems were there the first thing you do as a Minister – hey what do we do let us strengthen the law or let us strengthen the regulation.These two that I am mentioning here Mr Pretorius are not the only two – there are a number of them – they arecalled Operational Directives and I think certain elements have to do with HR and certain elements have to do with a covert operation and so forth and I am placing it on record because the witnesses that came here they created an impression we worked willy nilly and these ones I am putting there.   Someone is taking notes somewhere.  No, no, no.... special arrangements... [speaking vernacular]  I do not want to get into interpreting these things as if I am there.  Chairperson, there is no instruction I issued.  …[speaking in vernacular] because it becomes more useful, what is the law, law that you not touch these monies under a certain condition that is what is the essence of the submission.     ...of an internal discussion between people in SSA.  I was not given to and I am not going to deal with it.  And also on record, Chair, because one of the things that we must not allow is to create perception because ...[indistinct] strong.  In politics, they mean a lot.  I know the settlement but ministers do not get into contracts.  I never signed any settlement agreement.  Well, this affidavit is not explaining how SONA processes work and I do not want spend time here explaining how it works.  I never got on operational matters of SONA, there is a structure there a Deputy Chief Justice you attend the very same structure, why we were taken to Court is called [indistinct] joins.  Those are the people who run things and is responsible Ministers, we get to be briefed and I did in mytime as a Minister, when there is a SONA I will receive a security assessment report but to say I had a sitting with these people, what, what, what - the answer is no. 
ADV VUMBI:  Chair with your permission.     Chair we represent Dorothy.   And we do note the submissions and we accept same to proceed accordingly.    Yes Chair.   Chair it is Advocate Vumbi I am on instruction on brief from P G Matseka Attorneys.   Thank you.    Thank you.    Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Chair I am having serious difficulties here.     Firstly we are dealing with my client which wefound out on the last hours that my client will be dealt with today and we had…    Will be part of the – the proceedings of today.  And then we had to take it upon ourselves to contact the commission so that we must present.  So I think right now Mr Pretorius is dealing with my client but I do not have a bundle or anything that I need to refer to right now.  I am just working with the little knowledge that I have from consultation and from whatever that I can relate to which is in my file but I do not have a bundle from the commission and they are dealing with my client and I do not think that is…    No not even that they will be dealing with myclient today was notified to us.  We had to go an extra mile because of the media statement that came out that Minister will be appearing here today.  So for some reason we felt that it means also my client might be implicated or somehow.    Chair if I can make this simple.  I am communicating with the legal team here.    As they are talking.    If they can just maybe – because I think she issaying it is the affidavit that my client did provide to them.    So if it is that which they are going to be dealing with only.    I can just have that affidavit.    They can give me that document.    And then if it is the only thing that they will betouching on then I do not think there is any problem I can always just refer to the affidavit.    May I come with a suggestion?    And I think that is the proposition that the witness was trying to say.    Not 00   It will – it will enhance the efficiency of this.    Hence we will also have to discuss all theaffidavits that have been filed.    I think that is – at this juncture that we need to do that.    Thank you.    Ja I have got a copy Chair and I understandthe – it seems like they are not getting my point.  My point is not that we did not submit the affidavit.    My point is what they are touching on right now I should have made – been made aware that we will dealing with his affidavit today so that I can be able to follow.  So I am just getting a surprise as and when Mr Pretorius is talking.    So I am saying if my client will be part of theproceedings today I should have been notified and given only those parts of which they are going to be dealing with which includes my client not that we did not submit the affidavit.  We did submit the affidavit but what you are dealing with I must be made aware.  I think that is how the commission operates.    Correct.    That is correct Chair. 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
ADV PRETORIUS:  You say that   Well, it is still not clear from what you say here Mr Mahlobo.  The statement in paragraph 38    Perhaps I can finish.    It is me that does not understand and so I am trying to clarify.  In paragraph 38 you talk about what I presume are official records.  The submission, the project plan and a project budget.  Now am I to understand that these do not reflect the true nature of the operations and projects that they refer to?    But ...[intervenes]  MINISTER    So I understand that you are not saying that the documents have been falsified in order to hide the nature of the project.  As I understand what you are saying that the full detail of the project would not necessarily be reflected in the official records.  Am I correct?    In paragraph 41 and 42, you make it clear that the SSA is required to comply with the prescriptsof the public finance management act, it should read.  I presume that is the Act you are referring to.  The secret services account Act and the ministerial payment directives and internal policies which govern covert operations. You, I take it that Public Management Act, PMFA ...[intervenes]     Right and then at paragraph 43 you deal in brief with the funding process, the submission that is drafted for approval of the project and its financialresources.  The appointment or assignation to a project manager and the like.    If one looks at paragraphs 45, 46, 47 and 48 ...[intervenes]   45.    46, 47 and 48.  The allegations here or the statements here, appear to indicate that unless there are financial irregularities brought to your attention in the form of a report, you would only know about things when briefed about them during the intelligence brief, and by things I presume you talk about covert projects.  Correct?   Well, perhaps I am going too fast.     48 says   Well, I am going to go into detail in relation to the allegations made at the time.     In paragraphs 50 and following, you place on record certain denials at a general level, concerning evidence that has been led, which may implicate you or may not implicate you.  If you wish to highlight any of those denials, please feel free to do so but we will be going into detail now.     I see that each page is initialled but I do not know what my learned friend wishes to make of a change in font, but be that as it may, if I may continue please to the next affidavit.  That is Exhibit YY7, in Bundle SSA2.    Page 300, yes.      This appears to be the affidavit of a person with the pseudonym Steven.  If I could refer you please to paragraphs 48 to 51.  I will give you the page now.      310.  Three one zero, SSA2.      Yes.  I confirm the typing is not very good.   It looks like 4B.  49, 50 looks like SO and 51 looks like S1.      But paragraph 4B or 48 reads, under the heading further information regarding the payment of judges by Minister Mahlobo from SSA covert funds.  48    I am not going to put the other paragraphs to you because there is one name, pseudonym that should have been changed and if necessary I will put in more detail to you at a later stage, but I would first like to have the names in paragraph 51 changed Chair.    Alright.      12.      This deals with the state of nation address in 2015 and from paragraph 12 to paragraph 32, the circumstances which are public knowledge because they have been dealt with in several court cases, giving the background to the state of nation address are deal with but I would like to take you to, unless you want to go into the background I would like to take you to paragraph 23.    “Soon after 12 February 2015 and arising out of the public outcry and the legal challenge by the South African National Editor ’s Forum, SANEF, over the incident the then minister of the SSA, Mr David Mahlobo, Minister Mahlobo, instructed me to meet with him at his official residence.  My driver droveme to his residence and remained in the car, while I went inside the house.  On entry into the house I went through to the lounge where I found Minister Mahlobo and no one else was present at the time.”    23.    Page 305 of SSA2.   Paragraph 24 reads   Apologies Chair, I am just looking at the 3.3 notice sent to Mr Mahlobo and it does include the passages that I am referring to.    It does.     For the sake of complete, I am sorry Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Just from our own point of view, these are quite serious allegations and therefore obviously any time that is required ...[intervenes]     In addition to that Chair, my learned friend I might point out to him, has the ability to re-examine ...[intervenes]    Yes.     One way or the other Chair, and I am sure Mr Mahlobo would agree.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  Thisrelates to the application SEQ18 of 2021 Mr Gigaba’s application.  I have spoken to his Counsel Mr Solomon.  Mr Solomon has informed me that he is not available at seven o’clock tonight to move the application.     Thank you. May we be excused?     Thank you. 
ADV ADONISI SC:  I do not want to interrupt as I would do, but as I normally say Chair, it is to protect the rights of my client.  We have made a qualified affidavit.  I think it is prudent of me now to say that this individual affidavit, despite the fact that my client has already somehow commented, this is a person who has not testified once. We, if you have reference to paragraph 50 of our affidavit, we deal briefly with it to say we cannot at this stage deal extensively with the expert of statement  ...[intervenes]     I was told to take of this mic.    I have been exposed before Chair, sothat is why ...[intervenes]     Okay.  Chair, I was merely making a point that we should not for the record that this individual despite my client because he has already commented on some, that we deal specifically because we have already qualified our, paragraph 50, if you were to be directed, we cannot deal extensively with the extracts and statements of people that, who have not testified. But in view of the fact that the notice and the rule says you can comment or otherwise you have tried to an extent, unlimited.  But there is also a great concern of this particular paragraph or affidavit Chair.  You will see, and I will understand the ...[intervenes]    Yes, correct Chair and I take wisdom from the Chair.     However, I have other further legal arguments to seek your guidance.  Maybe let me put it that way.  The discovery of these documents, you will see that the very same affidavit that is being read out to the witness, I just unfortunately cannot locate with the pagination that was done.     But I am taking it from the discovered notice.  You will see that it is not even signed.      Maybe just to guide you Chair, because the numbers at the bottom will remain.    Despite the pagination that we use in this commission.    It is page 46 where the signature of the deponent had to appear.  If you look at the number at the bottom.    Yes.     Yes, thank you Chair for that and hence I stood up.  It was not objecting, it is just to seekclarity.    Not only that Chair, the last point if I may.  If one has regard to the whole affidavit you will see that the font changes.      If one has regard to the whole affidavit ...[intervenes]    Correct Chair.     Thanks, and hence I said Chair I then, I understand the difficulty of extrapolating and all that Chair, because then you will be tampering with the but I need to protect my client to not to comment to things that are not proper.Chair, one of the things that I have noted with this affidavit probably because they had to extract on it, thefont changes.  You will see if I were to guide you to paragraph 32 for instance, which I in the document that I am using, is page 11 Chairperson.You will see if we were to compare it, quickly glancing Chair with paragraph 50 that the fonts are different.  Moving on to the highlighted version.  So I am not sure whether Chair will be technically acute then to guide me on that one, what will be the discrepancy and how does that happen to a document.     Thank you Chair, thank you for theindulgence.
