CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius.    Good morning everybody.  I thought I would do without a jersey this morning because I thought it is beginning to be warm but I remembered that this venue is very cold so I put it on.  So I see you also do not seem to have a jersey on.  But you might not feel the cold here the way I do.  Yes are we ready?    Just one second Mr Pretorius.  The lightingcould be better than it is I think.  I can see – I can obviously see Mr Pretorius but it is rather dark.  So I think the technical people will do what needs to be done.  Yes.    Hm.    I am sorry again Mr Pretorius.  It may be – I do not know if it is that light that is behind you. I do not know whether they normally put it there and it is – ja okay.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius please continue.    I am sorry.  I am trying to get them to helpme with the lighting.      But if I am wrong about thinking it is normally somewhere there then – then maybe I just misunderstand – ja that is much better.  Yes.  You may continue Mr Pretorius.    Just to make sure I follow.  If the contractin which Free State department may participate I a contract relating to the Gauteng province/government does the Treasury or does the regulation of instruction mean that simply an expansion of the scope of the Gauteng contract include Free State but otherwise everything else is the same 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244contract?  At a practical level if one says, it is not creating a new contract how would that work practically?    Yes.ADV PRETORIUS SC   Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.ADV PRETORIUS SC   So would it as you understand it would it 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244amount to saying in the context of Free State and Gauteng in effect would it amount to Gauteng saying to the party with whom it has a contract you go to the Free State and provide the same services and then that is what happens.  The addendum would effectively say that.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes okay.    I just wonder... I know I am interruptingyou.  I just wonder what unlocking of opportunities there should be in the public service with government work?    Yes.    Yes.    H’m-h’m-h’m.    H’m.    A facilitation fee.    [laughs] Or “Cost of Business”.    Ja, development, “Business Development Fees”.    Because if I normally do this job for R 1000,00 I am not going to agree to do this job for R 500,00 just because you must get the 50%.    So the price will have to be inflated...[intervenes]     ...to R 2000,00 or whatever.  So I still get, at least, what I would normally get if not more.  So but then you get your own but in the process the one who pays, pays 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244an exorbitant amount.    H’m.    Yes.    Ja, okay.    It is very strange.  I saw that and Iwondered what it meant.     I wonder - when I was looking at that in the agreement, I wondered to what extent – I mean, the impression I got, I do not know about you, when I saw it, itwas like the department was not going to have to pay anything and that, of course, that sounds strange but that is my first impression of what it meant but you say that it was understood by those concerned that the joint venture would see what it needed to do to make sure that the 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244department had the budget.     Ja. ADV PRETORIUS   Yes, okay, let us take the tea adjournment.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     So you, before we adjourned, you were making the point that Blackhead or the joint venture subcontracted the work to MasterTrade and MasterTrade subcontracted the work to another company.     Yes.     Ja because the effect of all of this must be that the entity that did all the work, if it could do the work or the price that it charged it must mean that a reasonable price for the work cannot be too – much higher than more or less what the entity charges.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     And I guess ultimately one of the questions or the government – relevant government officials is on what basis did they believe that the price that they agreed to pay was reasonable when there were, as a matter of fact, entities who could do the job for far lower.     In terms of the price.     And, of course, if it is shown that the job could have been done at R50 million, R40 million, R20 something million but the department paid over 200 million then if that is shown then there must be a way of getting back from the people who did not do their job or who decided to conduct themselves in a certain way to the     To get as much from them as possible.     Okay.     I mean, what must be clear is that the author of the spreadsheet meant that – I mean those initials refer to somebody.     And they refer to somebody who, according to the author was to be paid a certain number.     And Mr Sodi – because if he’s still alive and he was the 50% of the joint venture must be able totell us who was that, that was to be paid that amount because you are part of the joint venture, you ought to know, I would imagine and of course it’s quite interesting if the initials seem to be similar to initials of somebody who has a role to play in the whole project.     And then it becomes difficult and we’ll see, maybe Mr Sodi will explain, it becomes difficult to 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244accept that, between the two of them, Mr Sodi and Mr Mpambani, didn’t know all, you know, who everybody on the list was.     Ja.     Ja, okay.     I mean if I write – if I prepare document meant to communicate something to you I would use – if I use initials it must be initials that I think you understand or you know and of course if you don’t know you will ask me when you get the document, what does this mean?     So not MT?     MasterTrade, not MT?     You said OM you didn’t mention the     Hmm.     Mr Jimmy Tau is represented by initials, as well, in the document?     So, he knows what those initials – who they refer to?     Hmm, yes okay.ADV PRETORIUS SC   What is your estimate of how long theexpert might take?    Yes.  Well maybe – maybe we should start with him.  We have about twenty five minutes – thirty minutes and then we take lunch and then after that – ja.    Ja.    What happened to the lamp that was supposed to be next to the witness?  I see it is not there. You would not know anything about it Mr Pretorius but it is those who – who know – who know what I am talking about.  It is supposed to be next to the witness so that if they have to read anything they can do that.  So if it is going to be disruptive to take it now then during the lunch adjournment it 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244should be placed next to the witness.  If this is the one so that if the witness has to read anything they do not struggle with seeing the writing.      Would it be convenient – I know if we say Free State 1 we will know which bundle we are talking about but do you have any objection if we called it Bundle FS1?    [Laughing] let us make all of them BundleFS1, 2 and so on.    Yes no that is fine ja.  Just so that – you know if it is Free State 1 without bundle one does not know whether Free State 1 means something else different from bundle.    Ja.  So Bundle FS1.    Yes.  And you asked that to that statement that affidavit be admitted as and marked Exhibit TT1.    Ja.    Yes okay.      Yes.    Okay.  Alright.    But it does – it appears somewhere else?    In – okay in one of the bundles.    Okay.    Okay so I think to the extent that in his statement/affidavit he refers to that document maybe then one must make a note as to where it is to be found.    Ja.    Ja maybe…    Ja it may be attached maybe the last page 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244of the statement is 23 maybe it could 23a, b, c, d.    Up to the end.  Ja and then it is more convenient.    Ja Okay alright.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    I do not know – you may be seated.  I do not know whether the transcribers would have heard the responses from the witness.  He did – ja they did not they 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244indicate they did not hear the responses.  I am going to ask that you repeat the oath.  Please take off your mask so that they can hear when you – and Mr Registrar keep the two – two and a half meters distance.  Maybe he thought you were too close that is why he put on his mask.      Thank you.      I am sorry do not speak too far from the microphone Mr Roets so that I can hear.  Ja.    I am sorry Mr Roets Mr Pretorius asks you the questions but you are telling me the stories.  So make sure I can see – see you as you tell the story because sometimes that is important to understand what you mean.    I think it is time for the lunch adjournment.    We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume as two o’clock.  We adjourn.    Okay, let us continue.    So are you saying that if you have notdone any work in relation to a particular house or a particular set of houses, it would not be appropriate to just walk and look at the roof and say, “Okay, that one is asbestos.  That one is not asbestos”.  So are you... would you say that professionally it could not be a reliable way of identifying houses that have got asbestos or this asbestos on the roofto just look at the roof with a naked eye?  Or are you saying, it can be reliable but not all the time.  What do you say about that way of doing things?    Okay.    What are the chances that those entities, maybe particularly Blackhead, could be quite active in theindustry without you knowing?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MR ROETS   Are you able to say in the light of how 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244much time, how many years you have spent in the industry and in the light of what I conceded to be high-profile status that you seem to have in the industry because you told me about your involvement in the drafting of regulations and so on?  Are you able to say whether out of those... I think you have said three hundred and something entities involved in the whole country, are you able to say you are familiar with a certain percentage of those that are quite active?  Or is    It is difficult, yes.  Okay.    Yes.    Ja.MR ROETS   Yes.  Okay.    Okay.       Actually, if you have not done that,     And there was a reference I think in the documents to the scope of the work being audit and assess, I think or assessed and audit, I think audit and assess.  The audit part I take it means identify the houses 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244and tell us how many or which ones, is that right?   And assess is then what you have…[intervenes]     The auditing portion but not the assessment.     Properly or at all.     Okay.     So, in other words, are you saying that as the product of an assessment which it is supposed to be this report that they, Blackhead and its joint venture partner, was lacking in quite a significant way?     Okay.     You mean in his statement, you said in his report.     Ja.     So what you are saying is very important and I just want to make sure that you are quite definite 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244about it.  If you are not so sure you need to say so.     Because Mr Sodi is going to come and give evidence here.     Are you quite satisfied and are you quite definite that this report really is of not much use for purposes of any effective eradication of asbestos and therefore whatever Blackhead and its joint venture charged for it when its mandate was to – or included to assessasbestos, this report is of either limited use or no use at all?  Is that something you are quite definite about?     Or you want to put it a little lower than that?     And you say that the assessment would have to be redone.     Yes.MR ROETS    Yes, okay.     Yes, so FS9?     Okay.  ADV PRETORIUS SC    Yes, for what it is worth, if there has to be a renumbering such as the one they have done here with the black numbers, I think they should try, if possible, to put it also – to put those numbers also on the right side of the page because when you are paging through youcannot see where it is, it is difficult to see so you go according to the red number pages, page numbers, but then those are not the ones in regard to this particular one bundle that one is following.     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, yes.     No, that is fine, it is just that when you page through, if it is on the right hand side, it is easy to 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244see.      Ja.  Okay, you said page 3?     Okay.  Now is this the type of information that was contained in the report in relation to a particular house?     Now, if you look at information that Mr Pretorius was reading to you on page 3, in respect of this house, how much of the information given there is really relevant for purposes of assessment for asbestos. MR     Is the roof type of any relevance?     And finishes on the wall?     Visible wall cracks?     No value whether the house is extended 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244or not?     Solar geyser?     But to just say solar geyser, yes or no.     It doesn’t mean much.MR ROETS    Yes, so roof material, asbestos, that’s fine but the rest is either irrelevant or marginally irrelevant?     Ja.     Okay.ADV PRETORIUS SC    Now, this might be difficult to say but you must tell me, if for purposes of an asbestos eradication programme, because that’s how it’s read, it seems, if for that purpose you are given the task orcontract to do an audit and assessment, what percentage of the job would you say is represented by the auditing part of the job, in terms of importance?  Is that something you are able to say is it 50/50 percent is it 20/80 or is it difficult to say?     But if this job, the way it was done, would require, as you have said, if you are asked to do the next phase which was meant to be eradication as I understand the position.  If it would require that you re-do the assessment would that not mean that in fact, you would not need their auditing because you’d have to, necessarily audit as well?     So, would it be correct therefore, to say, for the purposes of an asbestos eradication programme doing auditing without doing an assessment doesn’t help anyway because an assessment can’t be done without auditing?  Therefore, if an assessment has to be donewhatever auditing may have been done before becomes redundant because you are going to go to every house anyway, would that be correct?     You can’t do that because you will have to go to every house and therefore you will get to know how many houses are there.     Yes.     Hmm, okay.   I’m sorry we’re moving back to…[intervenes].     And then we go to 21 – page 21.     Okay, alright and the 21 even on this Bundle FS1 is the black 21?     Okay, alright.     Now, when you say, in paragraph 41 of your statement how long it would take to do this kind of job, to what extent is that based on your own experience of being involved in this kind of job there in the past years?     Okay.     Okay but what I would like is that if there’s any information that you didn’t get which the investigators may have access to that they make an attempt to get you that information and if necessary you 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244can do a supplementary statement or affidavit to supplement your evidence to say, when I prepared my affidavit/statement of 30 July 2020, in respect of this aspect this is what I had but I since had access to the following and I stand by what I said or in the light of this further information, I have a different view and this is what I wish to say, that’s what I’d like you to do, is that alright?     Okay.     Tell me, if the Department had consulted somebody or somebody who has knowledge and experience of the type of job that Blackhead and Diamond Hill weregiven to you do  you think, based on your experience that they could have agreed to pay so much money for the auditing and assessment of asbestos in this project?     But what I’m talking about is, you see, I’m a Judge if I’m going to give somebody a job to, electrical work in my house I need to have an idea what electricians normally charge because otherwise if I don’t have an idea about that, I could be charged an arm and a leg and I wouldn’t know and then I pay and then I find out later that I paid far more than I should have been charged.  Now in the context of the department I would have thoughtthat, unless the people who made the decisions have the knowledge and he experience of what is required in this type of job and what should be charged, unless they themselves had that knowledge I would have expected that they would seek a professional who could advise them, to say one, is this price that is being proposed here a reasonable price in the industry for this kind of job and if this advice was no, this is too much then they would go back to Blackhead then Diamond Hill can say, no, no we can’t agree to that but if they were told no, no, no, this is areasonable price and they are able to rely on that advice then they will go along. So, my question is, whether you think, if they had consulted somebody who might have the same kind of experience as yourself in this sector, whether that person would have advised that the price they agreed 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244to pay was reasonable for this kind of job.      Yes, yes and you say that based on yourexperience in the industry, a reasonable price for this kind of job would have been between R20million and R30million, is that right?     Ja okay.ADV PRETORIUS SC   Thank you very much Mr Roets for coming to assist the Commission, thank you for coming to 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244give evidence, if necessary we’ll ask you to come back but if – possibly try and spare you with the trouble but if there is any further information that can be given to you, which you had not been given to you, which you think is important in order for me to have a proper and correct picture of your evidence about his project, please talk to the investigators and the legal team so that, that can be done, so that one will have a correct picture.     Thank you very much, you are excused.MR ROETS    Mr Pretorius?    So if he is not here, I beginning to wonder whether the commission should not just issue summonsesagainst – you know against everybody because it looks like the stage at which we are more and more people come up with some or other reason for not appearing.  And whereas in the past just notification to people seemed to be enough at least for most for them to come and appear.  But now we issue notifications and people either do not come or send emails to put up one or other reason for saying they will not be able to come.  So it seems that we must really seriously consider compelling everybody.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. Yes.  So I think that probably eachwork stream must have a look in the weeks ahead and see people who have been notified to appear and apply their minds to the question of a summons even if a notice to appear has already gone to consider whether a summons should not be issued to make sure that people will be – will be here.  And if their – because then failure to appear when there is a summons that has been served will be a criminal offence.    Ja.ADV PRETORIUS SC   Ja.  Mr Mokhesi was supposed to appear 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244tomorrow?    Yes.  I guess that – well I would be handing down my decision in relation to Mr Fuzile’s application for Leave to Cross-examine Mr Van Rooyen tomorrow at ten.  So I guess that if Mr Mokhesi has not made a substantive application – what was his reason for – oh is it the lawyer who says I am not available within six days?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Well I think in that position we must be here at ten o’clock when I finish with my decision, we will be expecting him to be here and if he is not here – I mean if he is here to make an application for a postponement, we will deal with that.  If he is here and he is able to give evidence we continue.  And if we are here and he is not here to either make an application for a postponement or give evidence then we will have to deal with that default on his part.    On his own.    Yes.    So we will be here.  If he is not here then we will – we will look at the situation and necessary decisions will be taken.    Ja.    Ja no that is fine.  Okay we will then 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Yes Chair.  The evidence to be ledthis week or for most of this week Chair involves the Free State and a particular project that took place in the Free State, the Asbestos Project it has come to be known as.  Evidence was led by Mr Dukwana last year in relation to the conduct of that project and since then there has been an extensive investigation on the part of the commission and the fruits of that investigation are contained in the bundles now before you Chair.There are a number of bundles that you have.    Okay we will look at that Chair.    In any event Chair you have a number of bundles before you which contain both the …    Alright I will wait until all that is in order Chair.    Thank you Chair.  The bundles in front of you contain the statements or records of interviews with a number of witnesses that have been the subject ofinvestigation some of whom you will hear from this week.They also contain the report of the present Public Protector who made several findings in relation to the project.  There are court papers I will refer to those in the course of an opening. There are transcripts of the interviews 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244which may become relevant in questioning.  There is certain additional documents but what we have done because this investigation involves a range of issues both broad and some of fine detail the investigation team has with the assistance of the legal team prepared a comprehensive investigators report in which all the fruits of the investigation have been put and analysed so that you have in Exhibit TT18 which is in Bundles 8, 9 anda complete record of the investigations and an analysis of the interviews of witnesses.That investigation report has been signed by theinvestigators and will be referred to in the end.  But it does at the end of the day comprise an analysis of both documentation produced during the course of investigations as well as the transcripts and statements relating to individual witnesses and it is a comprehensive document.The witnesses for today Chair are two.  Firstly, a Mr Roets who is an expert in relation to asbestos.  The reason he has been called is that this is more than an issue of procurement and state expenditure as well as the distribution of the benefits of state expenditure. It is also an issue as to whether the Free State Provincial Government has carried out its duties, constitutional duties in fact in relation to the preservation of health and welfare of its inhabitants particularly in relation to the prevalence of asbestos and low cost housing.  And that 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244is another aspect of the evidence that you will hear this week.  In order to assist Chair in presenting a comprehensive record of what actually occurred in relation to the Asbestos Project I have taken the trouble to prepare a rather lengthy opening which will record the story from beginning to end so that when one gets to aspects of the evidence in due course it will all fit into an overall picture and be understood by the commission and by the public hopefully in its proper context. So if I may just address you in regard to that Chair?  The evidence in relation to the substance asbestos will be given by the expert.  The substance asbestos in its various forms was in the past particularly pre-1994 Chair because of its various qualities used extensively in housing and industry and elsewhere.  But particularly in low cost housing.  And what is so sad about this series of events they – it is still there.  It is a risk to life.  It is highly dangerous.  Causes a number of serious health conditions and commendably at least initially the present executive took a number ofdecisions to eradicate asbestos.What happened however is that hundreds of millions of Rands have been spent on this project but the asbestos is still there?  People are still exposed to the danger of asbestos with few minor exceptions but they do not affect 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244that principle.  That evidence will be given by the expert.Then Chair a number of persons have been involved in this project and it is well to name them so that their role can be understood when reference is made to them in due course.  Mr Dukwana a former member of the Executive Council and MEC in various portfolios in the Free State government has already given his evidence.That evidence has been contested by amongst others witnesses who will come forward this week.  Mr Mokhesi is the Head of Department – Free State Department of HumanSettlements.  It is that department under the rubric of which this project was carried out.Mr Matlakala who agreed to give evidence today and will address you in relation to his evidence in due course is the Head of Procurement Free State Department of Human Settlements.  Mr Makepe is the Chief Engineer in the Project Management Unit the PMU of the Free State Department of Human Settlements.  He did some verification the extent and quality of which will be addressed in evidence. There is a Mr Ignatius Mpambani often referred to as Ego.  He was a member of the Joint Venture which obtained the contract through the procurement processes which will be the subject of extensive evidence.  He was unfortunately recently murdered and is therefore not available to assist the 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244commission obviously.  Then there is a Mr Sodi who is the CEO of an entity called Blackhead Consulting PTY Ltd.  He was the other member of the Joint Venture.In evidence Chair you will hear reference to Mr Mpanbani or Mr Sodi but it was always in their capacity mostly in their capacity as members of the entities which form part of the Joint Venture which is at the centre of the evidence.There is a Mr Sydney Radebe he is the Director of asub-contractor.A Mr Manyeke a Director of a sub-contractor to the sub-contractor and those details are informative.  There is a Ms Diedericks who is not going to be called this week.  She is the former acting Head of Department Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and the involvement of Mr Sodi and Blackhead Consulting in the Gauteng project is relevant for issues which will become clearer later.Mr Thabani Zulu will appear this week.  He is the –was the Director General at the National Department of Housing.  He is now Director General at the Department of Energy.Mr Magashule a former Premier of the Free State.Ms Cholata who has given evidence. 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244 Ms Morake who has also given evidence who worked in the office of the Premier.Mr Martin Zwane is another sub-contractor but sub-contractor to the Joint Venture.Mr Matow [?] an engineer who was appointed to work on the asbestos audit and Mr Jimmy Tow [?] a beneficiary of monies emanating from Blackhead Consulting.All those persons feature in the story that is about to be told this week.  The story begins Chair in Gauteng.  In Gauteng apanel of service providers was appointed.  There were two panels that were appointed ultimately.The first panel was a general panel to do work of a general nature in the area of housing.The second panel a much smaller panel was appointed to do work on the eradication of asbestos.I may say at this stage that you will hear of various phases of asbestos eradication.  The contracts one is deal with here are merely for the assessment of the prevalence and existence of asbestos in low cost housing.  The idea wasto identify the extent of asbestos in low cost housing to meet the needs – constitutional rights in fact of people who could not afford housing of their own and were as it were stuck with housing containing asbestos and could nothing about it.There is no evidence of any competitive bidding that 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244occurred in relation to the appointment of either panel.  That was because of the procurement processes which followed.  But we know that a panel of eight contractors was appointed to do an asbestos audit in Gauteng and they so on the basis of instructions to perform work within the rubric of the panel appointment.The price that Blackhead charged or the assessment not the eradication, the assessment of the existence of asbestos was R650.00 per unit and that documentation is contained in the bundle. That procurement was declared at a stage irregular by the Auditor General.  Importantly Chair there was no individual contract in existence between Blackhead and the Gauteng Department relevant to this evidence.  At the time that contract was – and I use the word loosely transferred to the Free State.  Nor is there any evidence that a fair tender process preceded the conclusion of any contractual arrangement between Blackhead and the Department of Human Settlements in Gauteng.You will hear the detail or more detail of the precisetimelines involved but at a stage a procurement process was entered into which I will describe in a moment which allowed Blackhead and I stress Blackhead for the moment and allowed the Free State Department of Human Settlements to participate in the contract in Gauteng. 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244 That process was entirely flawed for a number of reasons and we will deal with it in detail in a moment.  The other aspect of the Gauteng evidence Chair is that the evidence of Mr Sodi shows that the profits were massive.  Sodi is clear that he paid – he was paid for his investigation assessment of the prevalence of Gauteng and the areas that he was asked to do.  He was paid almost R230 million or in the region of R230 million and his profit on his own version was in the region of R100 million.He says that all the others involved in the sameproject but in other areas in Gauteng their profits ranged between 50 and 60 percent.  That evidence you will hear in due course.  But I stress two things.  No contract was in existence at the time the contract in Free State was signed.  Secondly the Gauteng contracts do not appear to have involved any competitive bidding whatsoever.  And this all a background to the fact that the contracts in the Free State did not involve any competitive bidding whatsoever.  And that casts a shadow over the Free State procurement processes. There are two aspects to procurement in the Free State.  The one is what is called the participation process the other is the unsolicited bid process.  Both were entirely flawed.Treasury Regulation 16A6.6 is the one relevant to the    Yes.  We have consulted with a person in Treasury who may well have to come and explain it to you but we have his views recorded.  Those will either be presented in the form of submissions but insofar as a practice has developed under the rubric of the provisions and the regulations it may be necessary for him to explain those things in more detail.    Where there is a contract for sale of goods for example.    Free State – well Gauteng would enter into a contract with a supplier for a 100 widgets.    Only 80 would be provided and soanother entity could engage or participate in that contract to obtain the other 20.  That is the principle with goods.    Of course, with services it is different.    Because services inevitably are as you would point out and as underlies your question Chair services are inevitably confined within a particular personal relationship or relationship between contractor and entity.    So we understand that it is miscible for the services to be extended, the practice is that it should be done by way of an addendum to the original contract.  But other than that all the terms and conditions must be thesame.    The parties must be the same.    The services must be the same.    The price must be the same.  There can be no adjustment to suit particular conditions because then it is a new contract.    Yes.  The steps would be the following Chair.  There would be a competitive bidding process in Gauteng.    It would produce a contract with aparty on certain terms and conditions including price. The nature of the service is what is important here.    The price is what is important and the party that was party to that Gauteng contract is also important.  What happens then is with the permission of the Head of Department in the receiving entity and the contractor agree that Gauteng contract stands it is still in existence but the Free State may participate in that existing    Not a new contract.    Although the services inevitably will be in a different region.    And that would require an addendum to the existing contract.    So it is an existing contract entered into by means of a partici – fair bidding process competitive bidding process with a particular party under certain terms and conditions of the contract.    None of those requirements were metin this case. But I will deal with it in details.    The first point Chair is that different parties were involved.  In Gauteng it was Blackhead Consulting PTY Ltd.  Sometimes it was described by another name but for present purposes we can accept Blackhead Consulting PTY Ltd in Gauteng.  In the Free State it was a different party.  It was a joint venture between Blackhead Consulting and Diamond Hill Investment.  That was a rarely be entity to which MrMpanbani operated.Now one may say that this is really a minor distinction what is the difference between Blackhead and the joint venture.  But the significance is this Chair.  Mr Mpanbani according to Mr Sodi had no knowledge or 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244experience or capacity to deal with asbestos eradication.  He contributed nothing to the contract at all save to unlock the opportunity in the Free State through his contacts with officials in the Free State.  For that he got 50% of the income.  Now anyone who fairly and responsible examined this contract before signing it in the Free State would say, well why must we pay double the price charged by Blackhead for doing all the work?  Well they did not do all the work and that is part of the developing story Chair but let me notdistract you.  Why would we pay double the price charged by Blackhead which is the entity with the experience and capacity supposedly to a joint venture?  This does not make sense in ordinary and legitimate circumstances.So the participation contract going to a joint venture is significant and it is more than just a heading or a title of a party.The second thing that should be noted is that it is apparent from the correspondence between the officials who enabled this participation process both on the Gauteng sideand the Free State side but what was transferred was not a particular contract with Blackhead.  What was transferred was the panel participation and the panel – the panel arrangement was transferred.  So in other words, either 50 or 60 in the general panel arrangement or 8 contractors in 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244the asbestos removal arrangement that was transferred.But what resulted on the Gauteng side and what was accepted was one contract with one entity the Joint Venture.So there is a huge question mark – in fact it is not even a question mark – there is a huge problem and irregularity in relation to what was transferred from the one side and what emerged on the other side.A panel arrangement on the one side.  A particular contract with a particular party on the other.  And that correspondence will be dealt with in the evidence to showthat.But the other point is that the Gauteng contract had expired.  Both the panel contract and the original – well the original panel contract the narrower panel contract particular – particularly aimed at the eradication of asbestos and any arrangements that might have existed with Blackhead they had all expired.  So at the time of the participation there was nothing in existence to participate in and new contractual arrangements had to be made on the Free State side.  Of course, the joint venture on the Free State side, notBlackhead, and I have explained that Chair, was appointed not as a participant in a joint... in a panel arrangement, which the officials purported to allow participation in, but was appointed in its own right with its own price.It was now no longer R 650,00 per unit but R 850,00 per 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244unit.  Different price, different terms of conditions, different parties, no contract on the other side.On every count it must have been, and we will submit in due course, apparent to the officials who were dealing with this process that there was no lawful justification as participation and the relevant Treasury Regulation for the contract in the Free State.What is important is that the participation process allowed the contractual arrangement to be entered into the Free State... in the Free State without any competitivebidding process.The fact that there was no competitive bidding process and that it was not transparent, just two of the requirements of the Constitution, Section 217 means that one could enter into a contract that is entirely inflatable.And it seems not unreasonable Chair to draw the conclusion at the end of the evidence, which we will submit to you, that the participation process was really quite a clumsy sham to cloak the Free State Department contract with the joint venture with veneer of legality and successfullyon examination.So in the event Chair, what happened in the Free State was an entirely new contract, an arrangement was entered into with a new party on new terms and conditions including a higher price without any transparent competitive bidding 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244process having been entered into.And as a result, the third requirement of Section 217, an entirely non-cost effective arrangement was entered into.  Now several state officials participated in that process Chair.   The initials of some of them appear in a document presented to the Commission by Mr Dukwana entitled “Cost of Business”.And against initials of people whose initials happened to coincide for the moment Chair because we have got to go through the evidential process, with officials involved in thisparticipation process, where are sums of money allegedly disbursed in whole or in part to them.That “Cost of Business Schedule” has been the subject matter of extensive investigation and the evidence in relation to that will be presented to you in due course but I will deal with it in more detail later on.And then it is perhaps important to emphasise because we are coming now to the participation of Mr Mpambani in this whole venture and project.We emphasise that the appointment of the JV entitlingMr Mpambani and his entity in the joint venture with 50% of the income of the project, effectively doubling its price to R 255 million.All... he had no expertise, no capacity, no ability to contribute to the work, except he had to unlock the 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244opportunity through engagement with Free State ...[indistinct]For that, he was... he became entitled to half of R 255 million but that was the value of his engagement and I will come to more of that in due course.Then there was another process ...[indistinct] would say it can be Chair.  The origins of the contract that was ultimately entered into, arguable had a different procurement source, one equally deficient in law, we might add and we will make those submissions in due course, and it happenedas follows and these were the facts of significance.On his own admission, Mr Sodi and his entity, Blackhead, made significant profits in Gauteng, R 100 million.  And he, therefore, saw that there was a similar opportunity in the Free State.So Mr Sodi and Mr Mpambani meet at a function in Welkom and they meet again later to discuss a possible Asbestos Project in the Free State.The initiative, therefore, for this project does not come from any entity in the Free State which is anxious to protectthe lives and health of its inhabitants, rather it comes from Mr Sodi and Mr Mpambani.By all accounts, it appears that Mr Mpambani was well-connected and influential politically in the Free State.  It is apparent from the evidence of Mr Sodi, and this will be put 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244to him when he comes on Friday, that Mr Mpambani had no knowledge or experience of the asbestos removal.In Mr Sodi’s own words and in the words of the partner, his task was to “unlock the opportunity”.  For this he would get a 50% share in the income of the newly, the formed venture, what we referred to as the joint venture.Mr Sodi is explicit.  It was his job to engage with the officials that would allow this project to continue in order to ensure that the contract was granted to the joint venture.    Well, exactly.  Well, we have a system in place.  It is clear.      Where there is a need for work to be done.    There is an opportunity for all to    Now one must... the opportunity here was not for a contract to be given generally to contractors out there for a fair bidding process.  The opportunity was for the joint venture to do the work.  That was the opportunity 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244that had to be unlocked.    What had to be achieved through engagements with the officials was a particular contract with a particular party.  For that, the idea was, at least in the beginning, that Mr Mpambani and his entity would get R 127 million for unlocking.    That is all.  That is all he could do    Yes, one can label it in various waysChair but what happens here is that ...[intervenes]     [laughs] Or “Cost of Business” is the ...[intervenes]     Yes.  But if one takes away the label and looks at what happened, two persons with an interest in state contract get together.  The one says, “I will do the work or I will ensure the work is done and there is more to come on that score.  For that, I will get my R 127 million.   All you do is, you go and speak to certain officials to make sure I get the contract but please make sure I get the contract.  I do not want any nonsense with competition and an open bidding because I am going to charge a lot of money.  But that is all you have to do.  Go and speak.  And for that you can get have R 125 million, round it off to R 127 million commission”.It is the facts that reveal... the task of Mr Mpambani was not simple to do what was lawful and proper by the way of“Business Development”.  It was to ensure that the procurement process was so arranged, and one could go to so far as to say manipulated, to ensure that the contract at that price was obtained without a competitive bidding process by the joint venture.    Precisely.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.  Chair, that is exactly right.  That analyses is exactly what happened here.    What is interesting is the corollary to that.    The person investigating the value for money in that contract before signing on behalf of the department would look at it and say, “But you are doing allthe work for R 1000,00.  Why must we pay taxpayers money for “Business Development” and unlocking opportunities for your JV partner?”It does not make sense.  And so that is also ...[indistinct] but of course, the person who is examining the contract, arguable were the persons unlocked.  But we will come to that during the course of the ...[indistinct]     Subsequent to the engagement between Messrs Sodi and Mpambani Chair, they did make anapproach for Mr Mpambani for his R 127 million commission or “Business Development Fee”, went to see the HOD of Human Settlements in the Free State and they said, “Give us a proposal”.  Alright.An unsolicited proposal was prepared and presented and 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244it resulted in a Service Level Agreement being entered into.  Now this Service Level Agreement, as you will learn in due course, was deficient in a number of respects.It did not contain any information as to the overall price.  That is the price per unit.  So there was no mention of R 255 million in the service.It had a different price per unit to what happened out there.  It had a number of provisions regarding an interim what had to be done to earn the payment, which apparently, were ignored in the execution of the contract. But what is interesting about this.  There was no budget for this project.  One must recall, this initiative did not come from the Free State department.  It came from Messrs Sodi and Mpambani.They went and said, “Look, let us do this work and enter into an SLA”.  So the money had to be found somewhere.  So what the SLA, the Service Level Agreement said, quite oddly, is that the joint venture would see to the funding of the project.  Now that is an extraordinary clause.    Yes.  Well, clearly it cannot have meant Chair that the joint venture would pay for the project itself.  It was not, as will be apparent and has been apparent in the Gauteng in the business of charitable work. 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244 And clearly, it was not its intention to go out and as it were a crowd fund, the project, by way of public donation.  What it meant, clearly, in the context Chair was that the joint venture and in particular Mr Mpambani would continue to complete the unlocking of the alternative process by ensuring that sufficient budget re-arrangements were made to allow the Free State to pay for the project.In other words, there had to be some “environment”, it is the word that is used, or any other arrangement, a reallocation of priorities for another arrangement to makesure that the budgetary provisions were changed or altered in such a way as to allow the Free State to fund the project.So all this unlocking of the opportunity was happening without a budget provision.  What happened was that matters were so arranged that the budget was... became available and that is where Mr Zulu will testify.What ultimately happened, of course, is that the funding came via the national department from another province and that was done after the approach, not before the approach.But once again importantly, for the conclusion of theService Level Agreement, no competitive bidding process was entered into.Now where one has an unsolicited bidding process Chair, there is a requirement in order to safeguard the fiscus that all the arrangements inherent in the unsolicited bidding 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244process must be published by a request for a quotation.So that is where transparency comes in so that there is publication and any bidder, any organisation can say, “Oh, the joint venture is going to do this work for R 255 million.  I can do it for R 50 million.  I want to put in a competing bid”.There was no transparency.  No request for quotations was issued in this case.  It was entirely secretive.  So there was no ability for the department to test the market, assuming, as we must when we start Chair, that all the officials in the Free State were acting in good faith andproperly.They would receive this proposal.  They would look at it.  They would see that they were paying half of R 255 million for the “Commission Business Development”, whatever you want to call it sonically.Or in Mr Sodi’s own words “unlocking the opportunity and engaging the officials who facilitate the project”.  They would say, “But why are we paying for that?  That is your costs.  That must come out of your amount”.But they would say, “Look, we are not experts in this. Let us test the market.  Let us see whether your price can stand open and fair competition as required by the Constitution.  Transparent, fair, equitable, cost-effective, says Section 217 of the Constitution. “They did not do that.  No request for qualification was 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244entered into at all and that should have been done in terms of Treasury Regulations and Practice Note.Nor was there any due diligence exercise conducted in respect of the joint venture.  Had that been done, the contract would have been examined and it would have been discovered that at least half the joint venture at that stage had no qualifications to do any of the work.But in any event, if one goes... that is the factual position Chair.  If one goes to the law, none or very few of the requirements for the consideration of an unsolicited bidwere met.  In order for an unsolicited proposal that does not go to an open bidding and tender process to even be considered certain prerequisites are laid down by Treasury.   There must have been a comprehensive and relevant project feasibility study to establish a clear case. The product or service must involve and innovative design.  No innovative design here, you had eight contractors in the Free State and the expert will tell you that there are many that can do what was done.   It must involve and innovative approach to projectdevelopment and management, no evidence of that and it must present a new and cost-effective method of service delivery.   Clearly, as the facts will show here, none of those provisions were here and so it is difficult not to draw the 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244conclusion in this case that insofar as this contract was sought to be justified by reference to the unsolicited bid process this was again nearly a sham to cloak an entirely improper and irregular procurement process.Chair, let me deal briefly with the budget issue.  I have stated that there was no provision in the provincial budget at the time the contract was entered into for the R255 million cost of the project.  To cater for the non-existence in the budget of a budgetary provision for this project, for this R255 million, that clause that I referred toearlier, was put into the contract but the costs – the joint venture takes all responsibility for dealing with the costs of the project.  So you have here a department entering into a contract with a contractor who says do not worry, department, I will see to the costs and that had to be achieved and that was achieved …[intervenes]     There can be no other explanation for those facts.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes, Chair.       And that latter company did most if not all of the work on its version at a fee of R21 million onthe version of MasterTrade for a consulting fee of R5 million with MasterTrade paying the expenses.  But, Chair, I will – perhaps it is appropriate to deal with it now.  The details of the subcontracting arrangements and the prices attached to these are a matter of intense dispute 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244between all involved so the joint venture is suing the department for 30 million unpaid.  Blackhead is suing the estate of the deceased partner in the joint venture.  One subcontractor is suing the main subcontractor.  So there is a flurry of litigation between all these parties, each alleging something else but what is manifest in all this is that there is no legitimate or reasonable comparison between the cost of the work actually done in the region of R50 million, probably much less with its built-in profit and     That is the point for present purposes.  The details we have, the various versions we have, they are all in the investigator ’s report.     Yes.  The final subcontractor in theline bid to do the work at R21 million.     And on its version made a substantial profit.     But that detail will come out in the wash, as it were.  But what it does show is that the value of competitive bidding because any one of these entities could have bid in its own right for the contract.     If the contract had been properly advertised and properly opened to a competitivetransparent bidding process.       Yes.     Well, that is the purpose of aproper bidding process, a transparent bidding process so that all parties who can do the work and wish to do the work can put in their bids on a fair competitive transparent basis and have those fairly and properly assessed.  Of course, in order to justify a contract for this work at R255 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244million one could not have a fair competitive bidding process.  It had to be avoided at all costs and was successfully avoided in this case.     Exactly.  You will see further on in the narrative that the matter was investigated by the Public Protector, the current Public Protector and a report – I will summarise the main findings in the report and is in fact being investigated by law enforcement agencies at the moment.      Chair, so to summarise in relationto the subcontractors the joint venture, or 50% of the joint venture because the other 50% is busy unlocking opportunity, the 50% of the joint venture arranges for subcontractor one, MasterTrade.  MasterTrade’s quote for all the work are a small and not monetarily significant part 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244of the work, R44 million.  MasterTrade then says to ORI, you do the work, I will keep an eye on you, 21 million.   The expenses, according to ORI, for the work and the contract of the second subcontractor, approximate R9 million, so these details are important but it is all relative because this is a squabble in a confined space, as it were, whether it is 5, 21 or 44 million.  The truth is that all those figures pale in comparison to the overall price of R255 million and it is not I think the task of this Commission, Chair, to work out which of the subcontractors in theirvarious disputes is correct, the point is clear, in relation to the overall cost to the fiscus of this project, and the expert will tell you a little more about the quality of the product for R255 million was paid and you will hear in a moment, Chair, about where some of this money was disbursed. Chair because the expert will deal with some more detail in relation to what was done in relation to this contract, we have already told you that the service level agreement was sparse and unprofessional, quite frankly.  But according to the Chief Engineer of the department, MrMakepe, his idea of what would be done, not contained in the service level agreement, was that the houses containing asbestos would be audited – in other words, the number of houses containing asbestos would be audited and there would be an assessment accompanying that in 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244relation to detail that the expert will explain.   Those houses would be labelled or identified with geo- positioning, GPS identification, there would be some details provided regarding the structural integrity of the houses. Does not seem that that was done.  In other words, if the house is about to collapse then the whole house should be simply be demolished and rebuilt and also removing asbestos in a house which was not structurally sound has its own dangers and all that information would be collated in a report and provided to the projectmanagement unit so that they could go take the next step. Now, Chair, the way this is done of course is that sit at a desktop computer and you look at aerial maps of the region and you say that looks like and asbestos roof.  You then train people from the community to take a laptop – or not a laptop, a device, to the house and take a photograph of that house and all that information then is collated and put into a report. Mainly there would be a picture of the roof taken because remember, the SLA, Chair, talked about roofs ofhouses, not water pipes or pressure boards or anything like that and that data is then used to produce reports.  Notionally, that date then allows the second phase of the project to take place at a later stage which the business plan and the SLA appointed MasterTrade to do.  But the 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244expert will tell you this has to be done properly because you are taking out a life threatening substance, you are  exposing fibres, those fibres are carried in the air, people breathe them and they, quite frankly, die. I have referred to the several disputes between the parties involved but again they are disputes within the confines of a limited amount of funding.   The established facts show, just to summarise, the provincial government undertakes to pay R255 million.  MasterTrade quotes R44 million to do most of that work,bar R10 million.  The MasterTrade's quote of R44 million includes a R17 million profit, right, and there are expenses listed differently in the evidence of different witnesses.  So, for example, MasterTrade said they would spend R3 million on data for the digital devices to take the photographs.  The expense list in ORI’s subcontract is 60 000.  So there are all sorts of question marks when one digs into the detail of even the reduced amounts of 44, 21 and the like. So just if one takes all those versions together -and again perhaps this is an area of too much detail for present purposes - it is all in the report in all its detail – either the second subcontractor, ORI, a Mr Manyeke, does all the work for approximately R21 million involving R9 million expenses, so more than 50% profit.  Or between 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244them, MasterTrade and ORI do the work for R44 million, less expenses, or according to Mr Radebe of MasterTrade, the field work is done by Manyeke as a consultant for R5 million.  Whatever version finally went the day in the courts there is no question of a gross overcharge in contract between the joint venture and the department. Then there is the question of invoices, Chair.  Once again it seems that the payment of invoices and the recordal of work done to justify the payment is wholly inadequate and bordering on the improper.  Or, notbordering, simply improper. It may be – and this requires further investigation, but it may be that the documentation which accompanied the payments of the invoices contained gross misrepresentation.  There are documents which show, Chair, when a payment, for example, of R50 or R30 million is paid, in a column in the document that asbestos was removed, but before taking that further, it would require an answer.  We do not have the answer yet, but there are huge question marks around, firstly, the adequacy of thedocumentation accompanying payments and secondly, regarding the representations made in those documents. Ultimately, audit reports were provided, several reports were provided as a result of the conduct of the work under the contract, the joint venture contract and 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244these reports of part of the documentation before you and the expert will examine one of those reports in a lot more detail because one cannot assume that even though R44 or R21 million was done, the work was properly done, the work was done with sufficient care and caution to guard the rights of the people in the communities who were living with asbestos roof over their head. But what happens, Chair, is that after the payment of R230 million, R25 million outstanding, the subject of a court case at the moment, the Public Protector began aninvestigation and produced a report, the current public report.  And so once that report came out, the head of department, Mr Mokhesi suspended further payments to the joint venture and that was at the stage where R230 million of the R255 had been paid. In summary, the Public Protector, having investigated the matter through the Free State office made the following findings.  I will just deal briefly with the main findings of the Public Protector.  Firstly, a complaint regarding the violation ofprocurement processes in the awarding of the asbestos contract was substantiated.  The Public Protector found that the participation element – you will recall that was the first device used to avoid the open tender process – was improper because, quite simply, there was no existing 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244contract that was participated in, a new contractual arrangement was entered into with different terms and conditions and what the Public Protector said was that the participation process requires the same service provider, absent in this case, the same services, not clear on this, and the same price, certainly not there, not existing. Then, Chair, the Public Protector also found that insofar as it was sought by anyone to justify the procurement process followed by reference to the unsolicited proposal rubric, that too was also flawed andunlawful, particularly because there was a failure to issue the request for quotation.  In other words, to publicise this arrangement so that other parties could enter the fray if they wanted.  If was simply described as an abuse of the procurement system. Secondly, Public Protector found that the service level agreement was in contravention of the department’s own supply chain management policy because it did not actually reflect what was said in the unsolicited proposal or the appointment.  So it was a poor document in allrespects and also contravened the department’s own supply chain management policy. What happened in the Free State, similar to what happened in Gauteng, is that the Auditor-General of the Free State declared the procurement as irregular, released 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244that report on the 31 July 2015 and Chair, you have expressed concern about what happens to these reports, what is their effect, do they result in any concrete action that is required by their content?   Well, after the release of the report, declaring the procurement irregular, the department still made further payments of R139 million to the service provider.  In other words, that report was simply ignored and severe findings, including findings of wilful misconduct and gross negligence on the part of the accounting officer, MrMokhesi, were found to have existed by the Public Protector. And then a further finding, the allegation that the services provided were not cost-effective and the department did not receive value for money, that was found to be substantiated.  So much seems clear even from the brief survey we have given you of volumes and volumes of documents relating to that issue.   What the Public Protector found on her investigation was that the evidence and documents provethat the project was one hundred percent completed and reports were generated by the ORI Group.  That is the second subcontractor, the first subcontractor to MasterTrade.  First subcontractor MasterTrade, second contractor ORI.  The Public Protector found that the fee for 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244all that work was R21 million and all that work was done and what is interesting, is not only was the fieldwork done by the subcontractor, the second contractor, but also the production of reports was done largely with its participation. We referred earlier, Chair, to a complaint about the advanced payment, the finding was that that was irregular as well but for the reason that the original contract was null and void as being contrary to all the procurement prescripts.  But I have already pointed out to you, Chair,that that prepayment of R51 million was more than enough to cover the costs of the whole contract.  So before any work had started, the contract was paid. And what the Public Protector has directed the Premier to do as a result of the report is to investigate the accounting officer in terms of Section 84 of the Public Finance Management Act and to report the conduct to the Hawks and the South African Police Services and those processes are underway.  There was also a direction that the Director of Supply Chain Management in thedepartment, Mr Matlakana be investigated.  We will hear more about him later, we have just received a letter from his legal representative which will, despite his own agreement to attend, undertaking to attend today, explains why he has not attended or purports to explain. 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244Then, Chair, two close the circle on the asbestos project, there is the evidence given by Mr Dukwana in relation to the costs of business figure.  Now this schedule, Chair, has been investigated at great length, it has been put before Mr Sodi of the joint venture because it is a document related to the business of the joint venture and emanating from joint venture records.  So it has been testified to directly.   It records several abnormal business expenses.  It records them in a way that is abnormal and it shows, on the face ofit at least – and I stress on the face of it because that is where we are at present, payments to persons or entities from the income received, the 255 or 230 as it turned out, million rand.  Where the schedule shows what may be termed a legitimate business expense, in other words a subcontractor expense, the payment to MasterTrade, it is recorded to the last cent in that schedule to MasterTrade, no initials MasterTrade is recorded there as the sub-contractor receiving forty-four odd million Rand in a precise amount on that schedule, but where it is arguablethat some concealment is necessary because it’s an abnormal business expense, one see’s merely initial.  Now, the question is, is it just coincidental that those initials are – happen to be initials of officials in the Free State involved in facilitating that or are – is there some other 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244explanation, there doesn’t seem to be another explanation?     Yes.     Correct.     One will recall, at the beginning of the narrative, Chair, Mr Mpambani undertook to unlock the opportunity to engage the necessary officials to facilitate the grant of the contract of R255million value to the joint      The persons involved in that process, initials which are the same as their initials, let me put it that way for the moment rather than saying their initials here on that schedule as the recipient of money.  04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244Mr Sodi says, this is a record of sub-contractors, I don’t know what these mean.  So, when a person with initials coinciding with the initials of an official in the Free State, who’s participation and cooperation was necessary to unlock the opportunity appear on the schedule as being entitled to, on the face of it, R10million.  R10million goes out of his business, he says, I don’t know where R10million of my profits went but he says, Chair, and in a strange way this has its own logic to it, he says, Mr Mpambani prepared this schedule, he did it in my office on my computer and Idon’t know where my profits went, I can’t explain where tens of millions of rand of my profit go, I’m happy to accept that what he did was correct.  The – but of course as far as the initials were concerned it is correct, it is correct, I stress, that they went to these officials, monies went to these officials, that was his job.  Now was the payback time for having unlocked the opportunity and he had to organise it, but there is correspondence between the party that the investigators have produced, email correspondence between Sodi and the deceased, MrMpambani which stipulates that Mr Sodi is to see to these payments and Mr Mpambani will see to other payments and that evidence will be before you.     And the fact that those initials coincide with the initials of the officials who participated in the facilitation of the project.     And Mr Soni, in time, but Chair, the payments have been – certain payments from the business have been traced by the investigators and I’ll come tothose in a moment.     But whatever – for any business valued – Mr Sodi’s business, there will be evidence at around 2014/2015 turned over in excess of a billion rand it was a very, very successful business and he was custodian of billions of – at least more than a billion rand.  For that business to record the expenses of a R255million contract in the manner in which it was done is to say, the least, extraordinary.  The only logical explanation for this,unusual recordal of business expenses by reference to initials, is the necessary the need to conceal, at least to a certain extent.  The – we must deal with, particularly the allegations made by Mr Dukwana and the response to those allegations by Mr Zulu, Mr Zulu said that document is 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244simply a piece of paper to which no credibility at all can be attached. Now, whatever the value of that observation at the time Mr Dukwana gave evidence as you are aware Chair, the investigators have taken the matter much further and so in relation to deciding the authenticity of the document, apart from answers to questions given this week there are certain factors which, no doubt, you will take into account in assessing its authenticity and its reliability as a source of evidence and we will make our submissions to you in this regard but firstly that document has beenadmitted to be a document relating to the business of the joint venture in the asbestos project as being prone to and testified to in consultation by Mr Sodi.  He says that, that document was prepared on his computer in his office by his erstwhile JV partner, Mr Mpambani and what he said was that it reflected, largely costs payable to sub-contractors, in other words expenses of the business.  I’ve pointed out that certain expenses, initials certain expenses which would, otherwise appear to be legitimate, full description of the recipient of funds. I’ve dealt with the issue of the initials which coincide with the initials of officials and it was Mpambani’s work to secure the cooperation of those officials in facilitating the conclusion of the contract in the manner in which it was done and on the terms.     Yes, well the first question is, this document obviously reflects the recordal of an intent.  Thenext question is, was that intent carried out and that’s the subject matter of certain evidence and investigations that I will deal with in a moment but just looking at the document, TZ cost to business R10million, TM cost to business R5million, AM cost to business R10million, OM cost to 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244business R1million, MEC cost to business R2.5million, then we have a name MasterTrade not cost and then names of others who were involved and…[intervenes].     I’m sorry?     Not MT at all nor the person SR in MasterTrade.  Now, to say, as the person in the joint venture running the business, running this side of the business, remember Mpambani’s job is to unlockopportunities, that I don’t know where twenty to thirty million rand of my profits is going, is extraordinary – an extraordinary proposition at the least, exactly your point that one would assume that those initials would be known unless there’s some very convincing explanation why I, as 50% member of a joint venture would allow tens of millions rands, simply to be dispersed to destinations of which I have no knowledge.  When, if that was so, that he didn’t know, at least there was a duty to enquire why this coincidence between the initials of officials and thebusiness that I am responsible for and the legislation is replete with the red flags in that regard and I’ll deal with just one aspect of the governing legislation on corruption later.So, Chair, I dealt with the document containing the 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244initials which coincide with initials of officials involved in facilitating the programme. The document also contains an accurate record of amounts paid to sub-contractors, for example, MasterTrade which we know, from other original evidence to be the correct amounts paid to them.  So, the content of the document is authenticated by reference by other original record.  Fourthly Chair,  many of the other payments to persons bearing initials or entities bearing initials have been investigated and they are dealt with thoroughly in the investigator ’s report, I’ll deal with somein a moment, just by way of an example but what is important is, those payments do not relate to work actually done, so for example, payments to Mr Tau or payments involving Mr Tau, Mr Tau’s entity and the explanation simply is,  from Mr Sodi who acknowledges that payment says that, well that’s just something that I do from my monies I pay out but why these should be recorded as business expenses, of course, is another question as opposed to simply a gratuitous donation.  The payments and the relevant circumstances surrounding the paymentsare summarised in the investigator ’s report and if I may deal with one or two, simply to put the full picture of the whole project and its outcome before you by way of this opening address.  Bear with me a moment – the evidence of Mr Dukwana was clear that according to his evidence 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244the amounts reflected on the cost of business schedule were paid as gratification in relation to the Free State asbestos contract.  Now, as was correctly pointed out by you, at the time, Chair that, that was insufficient evidence to actually implicate a particular person and thereafter the investigators were tasked to do their work which they did and the results of their work, I will deal with in a moment.The allegation, and I stress at this stage, an allegation because we have to go through the evidential process is that TZ would have referred to Mr Thabani Zuluwho was the former DG of the National Department of Government at that stage and what is reflected is a payment of R10million.  Now, whether that is correct or not, it’s merely an allegation at this stage made by Dukwana to which Mr Zulu will have full opportunity to respond but what we do know is that Mr Zulu will have full opportunity to respond but what we do know is that Mr Zulu was, at least, involved if not instrumental, firstly in the participation contract and secondly in the budgetary process of unlocking funds there.  The second initial TM, isalleged, and I stress again alleged, to be the initials of Mr Thimotsi Moeketsi also known as Tim, the Accounting Officer and Head of Department Free State Human Settlement.  It is alleged that R5million was/would be payable to him.  What we know is that the initials TM 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244appear on the spreadsheet and we know that he was involved in signing the contract, involved in the participation and the unsolicited part of the contract, the signing of the SLA payments and the like, he’s the Accounting Officer and in terms of the Public Finance Management Act he cannot escape liability, he can delegate but it’s very clear in the legislation that he retains accountability for that.AM we know that the former Premier ’s initials were AM, Mr Magashule and we know there has been evidenceof certain payments made to his office for present purposes but the legislation is clear, whether you receive an amount of money for yourself or for others it still qualifies as an offence in terms of the legislation, we’ll deal with that in more detail in due course.  OM, whether coincidentally or otherwise is the former MEC in the Free State for Human Settlement.  MEC, the MEC at the time was…[intervenes].     And then MasterTrade is there by name, an accurate reflection of the true facts it’s 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244established by facts external to the document.  The identity of others has not been uncovered. Martin clearly refers to Martin Zwane who received monies, there’s and invoice for him issued by him for R1.5million which is reflected in the cost of this in the schedule.  Steve, there’s a Steve Matau, an Engineer who was paid for engineering work done on behalf of the joint venture an amount of R1.2million and there are others including JT, Jimmy Tau who also received money as the investigators found out and the last name is Diedericks which must, obviously refer to Margaret-AnnDiedericks the former acting Head of Department in the Gauteng Department of Human Settlement.  She is the one who signed the participation letter from the Gauteng side thus facilitating the conclusion of the contract.Mr Sodi has been interviewed and he’s given much of the evidence necessary to, at the very least, determine the authenticity of the document, it’s not a fabrication it’s a real document with real information.  The costs reflected there on his version deal, principally with sub-contracting costs, there’s no explanation for how all those persons withall those initials coinciding with officials’ initials would have been involved in sub-contracting there’s simply a profession of ignorance in that regard and here you made your observation about that.  He says, that document was attached to emails he received from Mr Mpambani, he says 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244that he acknowledges the receipt of directions from Mr Mpambani to deal with the persons highlighted in yellow although he denies making any such payments.  He acknowledges that it was prepared on his computer he says that Mr Mpambani worked in his office but he would not speculate about the initials, save the concession in relation to JT, Mr Jimmy Tau.  He gives an explanation that he appointed Mr Jimmy Tau as his Business Development Manager after the – Mr Tau’s retirement, but he does acknowledge that Mr Tau received money generated fromthe profit in that particular content and then there was an upfront payment recorded on that schedule of R4.4million which was acknowledged as being correct.     Yes.     Yes.    Chair the witness who has been set down – two witnesses were called for today.  A Mr Matlakala who agreed to come today but we have learnt recently through his appointed lawyers that the – he claims he has 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244reason not to appear this week.  He was not summonsed but he was – he was here or to be here by his own agreement.  We will deal with that after the long adjournment.  I just need to update myself on the correspondence received this morning.  And then the expert who will take up some time now and this afternoon.  I do not know whether Chair you wish to take an early adjournment or whether we should use the half hour and adjourn as normal between one and two?    At least an hour – an hour and a half.    If we may Chair.    Thank you.    Chair in the under Free State 1 is Exhibit TT1.    I think I could accept that.    Yes we will do that – we will replace this.    Sure.    So in Bundle FS1 for the recordExhibit TT1 is the statement of Mr Jacobus Roets.    TT1.  Chair at the moment and I think this has something to do with the lockdown measures.    It is signed but not commissioned.    I must just check that.    If you will bear with me.  Yes Chair the intention is that it will be attested to but of course the witness can confirm that on oath now.    The document.CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chair.  The expert has examined a report around which there will be no dispute.  It is a report dated February 2015 emanating from the Asbestos Project and will comment on that.  That is not attached here to this it should have been but it is not and itwill be referred to in one of the bundles.  It is in Bundle 8 – FS8 at page 270.  The witness will be asked to identify it however.    And it is in front of you.      Yes Chair.  Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    And there is no quarrel about its    Or its identification and the witness will confirm that.    Yes Chair.    And for the record it is to be found at page 270 of Bundle FS8 but it may be that it should beattached to the final affidavit.      When it is attested and numbering arranged accordingly.    Yes Chair.    Thank you.  So before we start Chair may the witness be sworn?    Oath.    Before addressing Mr Roets Chair if Imay just emphasise one aspect which emerges from the narrative as a whole and particularly from the evidence of Mr Roets is that not only are we here dealing with the duty to deal fairly transparently and cost effectively with state funds in procurement processes and in the execution of contracts 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244under the auspices of provincial or national government but we are also dealing with another issue here Chair.  The state and through the state the executive has a constitutional duty to provide adequate housing and to safeguard the lives of the inhabitants of the various communities in the country.  The question arises and you will hear from the evidences is whether these duties have been carried out.  We know that just from the small survey that we have done in this investigation of hundreds of millions of Rand being spent in the manner in which has been alluded to in this case but theroofs are still there and the roofs with all their dangers are still there.  So whether the constitutional duty of the executive has been carried out is a question that will need to be addressed and we will address it in submission.  Mr Roets your occupation?    Right and do you belong or are you a member of an entity which …    And in terms of which you carry outyour work?    Right we will come to that in a little 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244more detail later.  But you have been asked to give an opinion in relation to an asbestos audit conducted in the Free State by the Free State Department of Human Settlements in 2014/2015, is that correct?    What are your qualifications?    Would you tell the Chair please of    And do you have any experience in relation to asbestos in particular?    You may address the Chair as the Chair.  Right just be a little more specific there.  We will come back to it in a moment in more detail but when you say you were involved in work relating to asbestos there arevarious stages of that work.  What are those stages?    If I understand you correctly in order    I understand from your paper that asbestos fibres may be released from asbestos material intothe air and then as you say they are ingested into the lungs.  Once that happens is it curable?    If one is exposed to asbestos fibre in the manner you have described is it life threatening?    The prevalence of asbestos as you have stated has given rise to concerns on the part of the legislature and legislation has been passed controlling orpresaging the eradication of asbestos, is that correct?    You just tell the Chair about that because one of the matters that the Chair will look at is whether there has in this case been compliance with that legislation?    Let us just take a step back.  We omitted to deal with blue asbestos.  What is that and how prevalent was that in South Africa and in South Africanbuildings?    Now we dealing in this – sorry.    Oh yes thanks.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Roets, we were dealing with the legislation governing asbestos at the time.  As I understand the position, and to summarise, prior to 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 2441994, there was legislation but that legislation did not govern building materials which contained asbestos.    Right.  So before 1994, there was nothing governing the use of asbestos in a house?    Alright.  And we are dealing here mainly in this case with low-cost housing.  The houses that we are dealing with, when would they have been constructed in the manner?    Perhaps, mainly pre-1994.  Would that be fair?    And when were the regulations promulgated that dealt with asbestos containing materials, including materials used in houses?    Right.  And then the steps taken against asbestos got more stringent, and what happened in 04?    And importantly for the present case, what happened in 2008?    [Indistinct] requisite?    Alright.  We may have to obtain that for the benefit of the Chair but it seems to me that there was a level of requirement from 2008 that asbestos be eradicated from buildings.    Now to become more particular or more detailed in relation to the facts of these case.  You deal in paragraph 22 with the process and the requirements for the identification of the asbestos.  Please tell the Chair    Right.    Can one do it by reference to a digital map?    If I ...[intervenes] CHAIRPERSON   Well, several points arise out of that and your evidence after the long adjournment.  First point is, what is the effectiveness of an aerial photographic view, such as one would get on a computer, of a suburb?  Can that be relied on to identify asbestos roofs?    Right.  The second point is.  If I 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244stand outside the house and I take a photograph on an iPad, what would the position then be?    Oh, I understand you to be saying Mr Roets that, it is one thing to say that house has an asbestos roof.  It is quite another thing to assess for the purposes of eradication, a program of eradication, the condition of the house for the purposes of planning eradication?    And I understand that any rational programme with asbestos eradication involves prioritisation exercise where you take the high-risk asbestos containingmaterials as a priority and the lower-risk as... further down the line.  Am I correct?    Right.  Now this issue will come up later when you deal with the report but when one comes to the stage of removal and disposal, in other words,eradication of asbestos, let us say in a house, who is empowered or authorised to do that work?    I think you have already told the Chair that when you remove, you release or it generate 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244fibres and that it creates a danger for the public and the workers themselves.    How would you then conduct an assessment?  We are going back now a stage from the removal?  I think you have said quite clearly that the assessment enables a proper eradication process and certain... the assessment must have certain features or qualifications thatwill enable the removal to take place and you will comment on the report that was generated in this matter against that background.  But how would you properly in terms of the relevant regulations conduct an assessment?  Then if you could just briefly outline the steps.    You say in paragraph 29.11 that your company does work at a flat rate per day in relation to asbestos identification assessment and report.  Is that correct?    What is that rate per day?    And how many houses can you do in a day on your requirements that you have set out in your statement?    So that would be, if my arithmetic is correct, approximately R 300,00 per unit?    And you say, you would have to add to that administration, travel and accommodation costs?    Right.  In relation Chair, the asbestos from the Free State, you were approached by the investigators and asked to look at and comment on certain documentation.    The principle document is your reportof 2n d February 2015 which is in Bundle FS8 at page 270 but that document is before you.  Is that the document you have looked at?    You say you have worked in this 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244industry for some time, decades, in fact.  Have you come across Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited in the course of your work?    And have you come across Diamond Hill Trading 71 (Pty) Limited?    Right.    You were asked to comment on the unit price of R 850,00 for assessment and also the proposed cost for the assessment of R 1 350,00.  That Chair was the original price proposed in the proposal to the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements.But I understand you are unable to comment on that because you have not seen the work clearly defined.     In your opinion were they defined sufficiently to allow, if they were complied with, a proper programme of eradication?     Before you go on and for the benefit of those of us who are not building experts, what is a bill of quantities?     And in order to obtain that information would one need to do another assessment?     In paragraph 35 you summarise what might be your evidence in relation to assessment you say the condition of the roof needs to be looked at, you need to establish how many residences are at high risk of potential exposure, what houses should be prioritised foreradication and in addition to that the specific information that a bill of quantities would provide, how much asbestos, where, in what condition and how embedded in the residence it might be.     You are asked a question by the     Then you were asked by the investigators and you put it in your report, the price of R32 760, which was the price in the proposal for the removal of asbestos in this case.     And your estimate cost?MR ROETS    You were then shown and had regard to the report before you of 2015, of 2 February     And you were also given a report by the investigators of houses that they looked at, is that correct?      If you would just comment on the contents of the report as you do on page 19 of your statement and following.     I do not want to confuse you or the Chair and I might have done so, I apologise, let us deal with the quality of the work as appeared in the report rather than anything that the investigators may have done.  Just put that aside for one moment.  The comments you have just made about the audit and assessment in the report, do they apply?     It appears from the documentationthat we have and the investigators have obtained that the whole purpose of the audit and assessment was to enable a second phase of removal and eradication.   We have touched on this before but in your report at page 20 you answer the question whether in your 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244opinion the report that was produced, the final audit and assessment report …[intervenes]     In his statement, I am sorry, at page 20, paragraph 38.     In your statement you answer the question as to whether the report in its final form there could be used as a basis for an effective eradicationprogramme, removal and eradication programme.     What is your answer to that question?     What would they have to do in     Alright, the point that you are making would be more graphically made by reference to the actual documentation and the report itself or attached to the report.  Can I ask you to go to FS9, Chair?     FS9, this is the investigator ’s report.     Yes, I took great care this last weekend to ensure this was done in accordance with your instructions.     And in future it will go in top right.     No, it makes sense, it makes sense.     Page 3.     Well, what does it give you?     So if one looks at page 3 of bundleFS9, right, and one sees there in relation to a particular house certain information.  You have got the erf number, you have got the GPS coordinates and then under the structural assessment report you have a photograph taken from a distance, the picture of the house is partly obscured 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244by bushes.   You then see that the information contained there is roof material, asbestos; roof type, pitched; house type, single; finishes on wall, plastered; visible wall cracks, no; house extended, yes; solar geyser, no.  That is the full assessment of that particular drawing, is that correct?     Now that information then is collated with other information to tell them the municipality that houses of this type or qualifying under theseconditions or items of this nature wit items of this nature, there are say a thousand in this district, a thousand in that district, but this is the sum total of what occurred.     So if I took this page 3 that we’re talking about and I gave it to you and I said to you, MrRoets, please tell me how much it would cost and what you would have to do to remove asbestos from this house, what would you tell me?     You did a calculation just to illustrate some of the issues raised by the Chair on page21 of the – not of the report but of the FS1 Bundle Exhibit PT1 go to page 21 of Exhibit PT1 if you would in the final paragraph, you did a calculation …[intervenes].     We’re in FS1, I’m sorry yes in FS1.     2-1.     Yes.     Look please at the secondparagraph on that page.     You did a calculation based on certain assumptions, you said if there were 300 000 houses assessed, which is the number that was in the documentation in this case, correct?     Alright go back to – do you see the     Look at paragraph 2 if you would 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244please, you did a calculation.     On certain assumptions, now we know that the number of houses that had to be assessed here was not more than 300 000.     Correct and we know in the final report that 155 workers were trained over a few days and were set to photograph houses.     So, you say it might even be less?     Alright in paragraph 41.2 on page 24 of your statement TT1, you say what you would do in a project of a similar nature if you were briefed to do so.     And cost? MR     For a project taking almost 3     Is there anything you wish to add in relation to any of the questions you’ve been asked or in relation to your report?     Thank you.CHAIRPERSON    On that, Chair, two things on youranswer to the Chair, you mentioned firstly information given to the contractors by the department as to what was required of them, you say that was information that was inadequate?     But you then went on to talk about the second category of information that you were given.     And you commented on the fact that, that information was false, that we should note that,that is precisely the information that the contractors gave to the Department.     Chair, the witness that was to follow is Mr John Matlakala he is the procurement person in the Department in the Free State, Human Settlements Department in the Free State.  Much of the arrangement for this week happened before you asked me to deal with the evidence and lead the evidence Chair, so what I say I have only, in a broad detail, I’ve taken instructions over the long adjournment.  Mr Matlakala was informed on the 14 t h ofJuly that he would be required to attend at the Commission during the week of the 3 r d to the 7 t h of August.  He was then informed on the 27 t h of July that he was required to come on the 5 t h of August, that date, he was informed, was changed when we arranged the detail to the 4 t h of August 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244and at all stages, he agreed that he would come on the 4 t h of August.  Then on the 3 r d of August, yesterday, we received an email from Mr Matlakala saying that he was no longer represented and he would tell us when he was represented and when he could then appear.  In response to that a letter was drafted and sent who – to Matlakala advising him that he had confirmed his availability a date had been reserved and he must attend and if he has anything to say about his appearance and representation, he must apply to you Chair, it’s not in our province asevidence leaders and as investigators to grant or refuse postponements and the like, when dates have been arranged and this was told to him in a letter dated 3 r d of August 2020 confirming that he was required to appear today.  We received a reply today from Mutlaw attorneys representing Mr Matlakala, who said or who say in the email that they act on behalf of Mr Matlakala that they acknowledge that he was required to provide oral evidence    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.  One of the significant differences between the witnesses or many of the witnesses – not all – many of the witnesses that are now presenting 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244evidence before you Chair is that they are in one way or another implicated.    And are being called to account.    So it seems there the reluctance is creeping in.    Well not creeping in – rushing in.    Yes indeed Chair.    Yes.    Yes the – Mr Mokhesi acknowledged    Agreed to attend.    Agreed to attend during the week and then on the particular day – tomorrow.    It seems he only gave his attorneys six days or short notice.    For the attorney to prepare and briefcounsel.    Counsel that they want to appear has Covid and the attorney says he has not had enough time to prepare.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.      And that against the background have – of having to appear and having been given every opportunity to appear and answer the case.    That was made.CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chair.  In the meanwhile, I will communicate your directive to the evidence leaders.    In regard to summons. 
INQUIRY RESUMESCHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue, Mr Pretorius? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?MR ROETS   Do you have any objection taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?      Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help meGod.    Please state your full names for the record?    Do you have any objection taking the prescribed oath?      Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    All rise. 
MR ROETS:  No – not.    Yes.    So help me God.    Jacobus Carel Roets.      I do not.REGISTRAR   Yes.    So help me God.    Occupational Hygienist.    Ja.    Yes so we are accredited by SANAS in terms ISO 17020 and we approved inspection authority by the Department of Employment and Labour.    Yes.  That is correct.    Yes for the past thirty years more or less I have been practicing Occupational Hygiene and since the start of my business or career I have worked for Transnet ChemicalServices where I have started dealing with asbestos because they transported asbestos throughout South Africa.  So I started monitoring and assessing and assisting in the eradication and removal of – of spilt asbestos and cleanup of asbestos throughout South Africa.    Ja thanks Chair.    Yes Mr Chair.  When we do asbestos work the first thing is to actually identify if there is a problem, the risk associated with the asbestos and the work that needs to be done.  So we will most probably start off with doing an inventory or assessment of asbestos in terms of the regulations that was promulgated.  Once that you know where the asbestos is, how much of asbestos there is and what is the risk – the potential risk of exposure then can – you can go and set up a plan on how to mitigate or put in thenecessary controls for this asbestos and if you need to remove asbestos because it is in a poor state or the risk of exposure is higher than you need to draft a plan of work and submit it to Department of Employment and Labour for their notice.  This plan is normally approved by an approved 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244inspection authority before any work is done.  And once this plan has been submitted to the Department of Employment and Labour they will – or the work will commence after about thirteen to thirty days because of the notice periods that you need to provide.  And the work then that follows is done by a registered asbestos contractor that is appointed by the Department of Employment and this appointment or registration used to be done annually but nowadays the term or the time is actually set on three years – every three years we must reapply for their approval.  These are the guys thatwill come in and under their training they will remove the asbestos in accordance with the approved plan of work in a safe and responsible manner and the waste will then be transported to a registered hazardous waste site.  So it cannot be disposed of in a normal waste or landfill area and once that it is deposited in that hazardous waste site they will receive a safe disposal certificate that the waste is properly disposed of and will be managed in time to come.    Well as we know and nowadays you can actually transplant lungs into a person so it is possible if asbestosis is identified in a person that with the medical knowledge that we have got nowadays that you can actually cure a person but you will definitely give him a very hard life because the symptoms of asbestosis is that the hard calcified areas in the lungs will actually tear away from the soft tissue of your lungs when you breathe and your lungscan start bleeding.  So it is a very bad illness to have and what you actually die of most of the time is a lack of oxygen.  Because what happens you decrease the effective gas exchange area in your lungs so where you need to pick up oxygen or uptake oxygen in your lungs and give off carbon 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244dioxide from your lungs that area is getting smaller and smaller because of the calcification of the portions of your lung and so yes people are still dying today of asbestosis and mesothelioma.    It is life threatening definitely.    Chair yes that is true.    Chair yes we have had asbestos regulations since 1983, 1987, 1989 and then it was changed again in 01 and 2002.  There was a little bit of errata on the regulation that it changed.  So the current regulation that wehave got is called the Asbestos Regulation 155 of 2002 and this piece of regulation different to the old of 1987/1989 regulation that we used to have also includes asbestos containing materials.  The difference between raw asbestos or friable asbestos and asbestos containing material is that 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244the friable asbestos is asbestos as mined as it comes out of a mine where it actually carries a very high risk. So it is not bonded in anything.  So the previous regulation specifically talked about the raw asbestos and handling and controlling workers exposure to the friable or the raw or the high risk materials.  In 2002 the new asbestos regulation also includes asbestos containing materials which is now the roof sheeting and the facia boards and ceiling panels and floor tiles.  All these materials that contain a percentage of asbestos which may be anything from 14% up to 54% ofasbestos depending on the manufacturer and so the regulation calls for certain control measures the employer and self-employed person that he needs to control any exposure.  If he employs any people to work on asbestos that there needs to be some controls in place to ensure that he does not inhale asbestos or he is not exposing anybody in the public to airborne asbestos fibres.    Blue asbestos or also called crocidolite asbestos is the most hazardous form of asbestos that you do get.  Basically because of the aero dynamic properties of the material and the – the extent of the chemical inertness of 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244this asbestos material.  It breaks off in very small needle like fibres.  It is very small – less than 0.2 micro metres in size.  So once that it becomes airborne it stays in the air for extended periods of time because of the aero dynamic properties in its weight so it does not settle out.  So once that you have started with asbestos work and you emitted this asbestos through your activities it is possible that this fibres can even blown from that specific work environment with a very far distance from your work environment.  So the blue asbestos is the fibre that is actually a straight needlelike very small fibre that can penetrate right through your lung into the chest lining and mostly this is the type of asbestos that will cause mesothelioma.      Chair, yes, that is true.  The ’89 Regulation did not cater for asbestos containing materials.  So this was overseen during the assessment of asbestos and used all over South Africa to manufacture building material.    No, not asbestos containing materials but the friable asbestos.  If it was insulation material that they usedaround the geysers, for example.  So that would be legislated.    Well, we have been mining asbestos in South Africa for many years.  So manufactured all over these periods.  So no specific time of manufacture but ever since they actually started mining the asbestos and using it inbuilding materials, various houses have been made.    Even after 1994 to some extent because there was not legislation preventing the building with asbestos 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244containing materials up until 2001.    The regulation, the Asbestos Regulation 155 of 02, was promulgated in February 2002.    In 2004, roundabout 2004, the EnvironmentalMinister at that time banned the use of any new asbestos, this asbestos containing materials.  So, yes, it was more stringent.  You are not allowed to use anymore asbestos in new products and then the transport of asbestos and then the use in any building materials was banned at that stage.    In 2008, was the physical letter that was written by the then Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk whobanned the asbestos or the use of asbestos and also suggested that we should start implementing a phase-out plan for asbestos and try to eradicate asbestos if it is maintained and if you can actually remove it, it should be removed.     A written ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]     Ja, a written up in regulation on the environmental side.  So if we understand it, we are dealing with two departments.  We are dealing with the Department of Employment and Labour on the one side and we are dealing with the Department of Environmental Affairs on the other side.  So itis two different pieces of legislation all together.    Ja.  Or either maintained in a well-maintained condition.  Kept in a well-maintained condition Chair.  Or like I said, it should be removed, if at all possible, that it be removed but in terms of the Labour Regulations, it was not...    That is correct.  That will be correct.    And this is a record.    Okay.  To actually identify asbestos, it is a destructive test.  So there is no instrumentation that you can used to identify asbestos, press it up against a panel and it will say that this is asbestos.  So it is a physical destructive test.  You need to break off a piece of this material and send it for analyses.  For a trained eye you can with some certainty say that it isasbestos because of the condition.  We will look an amount of fibres where it is in the asbestos containing material.  You can say that this material is suspected of being asbestos containing material but to totally positively identify any such material, there is an analytical way, a technical way that we need to analyse the samples to positively identify.    No, then the ...[intervenes] ADV PRETORIUS SC   No definitely not.  The reason why I am saying this is, because even at a later stage Chair, asbestos was in the same plant manufactured or as the new tech material that is nowadays used, it has got the same profile as the old 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244asbestos panels.  So it is possible that if there was any renovations done in one of these houses, you will definitely not pick it up.  So you cannot say with certainty from a picture that this is asbestos.  You can certainly say that there is a profile.  We call it the Big Six Profile on the big roof sheets.  So you can recognise a profile but you cannot positively identify asbestos in that way.    Chair, in this situation if it is low-cost housing and you have done some homework in terms of maintenance and repairs to any of these materials, there is a big possibility that you can actually identify with some certainty that it is asbestos material or suspected materials.    Chair, if it clearly says it in the document that 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244that is asbestos, I would not go as far because, like I said, there is a possibility of maintenance and replacement with other materials, as well as, the possibility of other asbestos containing materials within the same property, like ceiling panels and botched walls and window sills, which will definitely not be identified by just looking at it from the outside.    Chair, thanks.  Yes, there is a possibility that you can make a good estimation of quantity of asbestos or asbestos containing sheets or something that looks like asbestos by doing that way, but the whole purpose of the assessment in terms of the legislation, is to look at the risk, the potential risk because of previous damage to these panels.   It has been weathered and there is a bigger risk now because the fibres have actually loosened and available to become airborne.  So one needs to have a close inspection of this material to do a proper inventory and assessment.    Chair, yes.  What we normally do from an assessment point of view, is to go and look at this material, assess it.  And look at the condition and if it is ceiling panels, for example, we would break off a piece and send it for analyses to make sure that it is asbestos or not.So, yes, it is very helpful if you can quantify and writeup all the asbestos material on a proper bill of quantities because that will assist you in later removal plans and costing of such a project.    Like I said Chair, the only thing that you willachieve by that is to get an assessment perspective of asbestos containing materials.  You can see the profile but apart from that, it does not help you any... in actually assessing the condition of the asbestos.    It is still the same issue Chair, that you cannot actually talk to the quantity, as well as, the quality of the asbestos or the condition and it will not assist in any way of eradicating asbestos or setting up a bill of quantities.  The purpose of doing a proper assessment is to actually prioritise asbestos containing materials that is in a poor condition so that they can be removed or that can be removed at an early stage so that the cost can be spreadover a period of time that is reasonable.  Maybe a five or a ten year phase-out plan and I think that is the reasoning behind the legislation.    Yes, Chair.  I think the main purpose of the legislation is to ensure that the people, the residents of thatproperty are safe, remain safe and there is no risk of exposure.  So if you just go around to identify for potential asbestos materials, it will not assist in the final purpose of such an assessment.  It is to see what is the risk.    Yes, Chair.  That is the purpose.  From experience we can see that, for example... if I can use another example.  If there is a hailstorm that comes through some areas, you will see that most of the damages are in the valley of these big six panels.And it is due to the fact that the weathering over a period of time has caused these panels to wear out, a littlebit thinner and thinner, and then hail will damage these asbestos panels.  And so when you do the assessment, you would want to see if there are any cracks in the panels, what is the condition, is there still one centimetre thick material, and that will all give you an indication what is the potential risk in that house.    Yes, Chair.  You are definitely correct.  The whole purpose of the regulation in terms of The Occupation, Health and Safety Act, not only the Asbestos Regulation but 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244any regulation connected to it, is to control the risk to people, residents, employees that work in that environment and...  So in this case, the purpose would be to remove the material that is now as this has got a big risk to cause exposure and then over a period of time to phase out all the asbestos in an eradication programme.    In terms of the legislation, asbestos work is done by a registered asbestos contractor Chair.  And these contractors are registered with the Department of Employment and Labour.And they go through a screening process, submitting the necessary documentation to ensure that the people that are doing this asbestos work is well educated.  They train.  They go for a medical... working on aheights training and these are the contractors that are approved to work with asbestos and remove asbestos and disposal with safety.    [No audible reply] [Microphone not switched on.]    What the normal assessment would be... would involve is to do a desktop study firstly, to identify when this asbestos or material covering roof would have been placed on it, more or less.   So that one can get an idea of the timeframe that the material was placed on the roof.  The second option would be... well, the standard is actually go to the site and investigate.  Get access to the sites.  Sometimes it is difficult if it is houses because you need 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244to get access to the house to actually go inside and view the house from the inside to assess the condition of this material.  And like I have said previously, the building material or the roof sheets used to be manufactured up to 54% of asbestos in cement materials.  So if there is a high concentration of asbestos in this building material, obviously, the risk, potential risk of exposure will be higher.  And if this material is then in a poor state ofmaintenance, it will mean that the panels can break easily and you need to assess this in terms of your procedures that you will follow to remove the asbestos.So the contents of my assessment would be a close visual inspection, taking of a sample to assess what is the amount of asbestos and the potential risk within this material.And then also look at the condition and prioritise which materials are the worst and then put up a plan to start taking    Chair, through the legislation, there is a 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244guidance document out that outlines the format of such a report, certain requirements that needs to be on the report like that plus an example of what information is required out of this report.  Like I have said previously, the location of any such asbestos, more or less, an estimation of the quantity of the asbestos, what is the condition of the asbestos, what type of asbestos it is, what controls have you got in place already to mitigate the potential exposure, and what lack or recommendations are there to maintain the asbestos in agood condition.So all this information will be captured on an official record that needs to be obtained and kept for 40-years.    That is correct.    Currently, we are charging R 3000,00 a day,flat rate.    Chairman, in terms of this project, it was done 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244on the low-cost housing, the estimation of anything between  m² and roughly about 40 m².  I would suggest that we can do per person about ten houses a proper assessment per day.    Roughly.  Yes, Chair.  That is correct.    Yes, Chair.  We have got a basic cost ofadministration fee of also R 3000,00 per day, for example, an inventory report.  So that can be split amongst ten houses.  So another R 300,00.  So roughly about R 600,00 for the assessment, as well as, the admin costs towards that.    That is correct Chair.    Yes, Chair.  That is the document.    Never Chairperson.    Never Chairperson.    Chairperson, currently I think there is around... the last figures I have seen, there are around 290 odd registered asbestos contractors in the country.    I do not know and do not work for all of them.    So I cannot say that they are not active in the industry.    There are so many... I, certainly, have dealt in different industries with a lot of asbestos contractors, as well as, people involved in drafting such inventories.    One need to have a look at the legislation.  It does not call for a specific person or entity or body to this inventory.  It calls for a competent person to do such.    But as soon as they are removing or handling 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244asbestos, they definitely must be registered.    Yes, Chairperson.  When I actually had a lookthrough the documentation provided to me, I was provided with one report, final report, as well as, five examples of assessments that the company had done and also the original proposal that was provided by the municipality.And in these documents, I do not think I have had enough information to make a clear statement about the costs, this thousand odd three hundred rands.  It certainly looked a little bit high in terms of the amount of houses that needed to be assessed but... ja, I do not think    Yes, Chairperson.  At the time when I assessed and went through the documentation, it was clear that there 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244was very little in terms of defining the words “audit and assess” and for me that was problematic and to look in this final document if they actually achieved or done that was required in the original quote, so that was one of the problems, that the terms were not defined properly in the document.     Even the proper eradication purpose orproposal, one needs to have a proper bill of quantities to quote on the said project of abatement or removal of or eradication of asbestos in the area.  So if you can assess and properly define the amount of asbestos you can actually give a price, a costing to that.  If you have not done that, you have not assessed the risk of potential exposure, I think it is very difficult to put up a proposal on the eradication if you do not have that information.     Bill of quantities, Chair, is the amount of asbestos, amount of houses, amount of asbestos in each house and that you need to define in terms of squaremeterage, in terms of the weight of asbestos because it comes into play when you have to calculate the amount of travelling that you need to do in terms of transporting this waste to hazardous waste site, the time spent on the site, the amount of labour that you need to employ to remove the asbestos and the amount of personal protective equipment that needs to be provided, accommodation maybe in that area, bins that you need to organise to place this asbestos waste in for the transportation as well as the cost for the final and safe disposal of the asbestos, so allthese things are published in what we use as an inventory, we just call that a bill of quantities, we can actually send and circulate that to potential registered asbestos contractors so that they can actually put up a price to remove or eradicate the asbestos.     Chair, through the five examples that I had from the different assessments that they have done, no, definitely not.     Chair, yes, this assessment will definitely have to be redone to get a proper bill of quantities to     Chair, the report that I had in front of me dated the 2 February 2015, in terms of my view of this, it is a scoping report of the potential problem of asbestos in a region or a district and that is as far as it goes.  It does not give any clear indication of how much asbestos there is and what is the potential risk to the residents or people in the public and does not give any indication about that.  Soja, in terms of proper assessment, I would say that this is not a proper document that can be used.  Maybe on a high level for parliament it might be a good document for them to use to see what is the potential risk but in terms of eradication, definitely not.     Yes, there is certainly some pros and cons doing the assessment.  When we physically go out and do an assessment we try to remove a piece in areas where it cannot harm to the residents and the procedure would call for new ceiling, the portion where you actually removed and broken out a piece to seal it so that you do not cause additional risk to the residents.   But in terms of your question, it is also a matter of education of the people that stay in a residence like that. So if the community did not properly educate the residents of a property like that on the potential risk and exposure risk and sources of asbestos fibres while staying in a house you will find some of the residents might be busy with alterations themselves removing some asbestos 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244because of damage and they did not maintain it properly in the past.   So in this proposal document you will see words like asbestos containing rubble, meaning stuff that people already removed from their houses and put on sidewalks and so on, so this asbestos is lying, there is a potential of vehicles travelling and pulverizing this material lying in the road or on the sidewalks or dead spaces and then pulverising and causing additional exposure. So if you leave the asbestos as is, you do noteducate the residents on potential risk and tell them not to drill into the asbestos and put up fixture and put in any alterations or make alterations to these materials, there is a risk that the fibres may be released during these processes and people will be exposed, they will inhale the fibres.  And especially in certain areas like the Northern Cape where the crocidolite or the blue asbestos have been mined, there is this additive effect, so in the environment there is potentially already some fibres and if you then also go break panels in the sand and the break panels youwill add to that risk of exposure.     Ja.  Yes, Chair …[intervenes]     Yes, Chair, I would say that the first portion on the stuff they have done might be the first portion, the audit portion.     But the assessment portion is lacking.CHAIRPERSON    Yes.     Yes, I would say so.     Yes, that is true, Chair.  It will definitely 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244assist in spreading the cost over a period of time.  We can prioritise high risk areas in terms of asbestos that was maybe put up first or residence when he is busy renovating, doing some repairs to their roofs or already removing asbestos panels and breaking it.   So this assessment would be used to identify these houses or residence or so that they can be completed first or handled first and then the rest, panels that is in a good condition, maybe there was a plan by the residents to paint and seal the panels properly and nicely.  This will be a lowrisk and they can be dealt with at a later stage.  So you can spread the costs of eradication over a period of time.     Yes.ADV PRETORIUS SC    Yes, Chair, the calculation that I did is taking into consideration that there is a proper bill of quantities set out to the amount of asbestos in each area.  What is the distances that one need to travel between these areas that will all help and assist you to do a proper costing of a project like that for the removal and tender process.     That is correct, yes, Chair.     The five examples, Chair, that I received gave a Google Maps picture of the property which Iactually by accident opened up on my computer and looked, it is exactly the same, and then also a street photo.   Somebody that took a picture from the street to show that this is asbestos or a big six panel on the roof 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244with a comment that it is asbestos.   Apart from that, there was comments on the walls that was cracked in some areas but there was no comments on the condition of the asbestos with potential risk of exposure and even size.  The only size that I got was a document that was pulled off by I think the investigators at a later stage, 2018 or something, that gives a municipal size of the property itself but not the dwelling, the house, so there is no indication of how much asbestos we are talking about on any of the examples thatI examined.     Ja, Chair, the five examples when I examined, it definitely does not show an assessment ofasbestos and even audit, it will give an indication of there is asbestos on this house because of the picture that they have taken and with the assumption that it might be asbestos.  But apart from that, this whole report is structured around the structure, the integrity of the house 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244itself, the building, the bricks and so on but very, very, very little information other than a potential number of houses in a certain district, that is all that is outlined in this report.     Yes, Chairperson, it was definitely lacking.  If you look at the original proposal it called for the auditand assessment of asbestos and it also called for assessment of asbestos contained in rubble and I did not find any information in the reports about any rubble lying around.  So even if you have to quote or tender on such a project you did not have – or you do not have all the information available and as you previously say, audit would be a good description of what was done and the latter portion was left out in the report as well.     Yes.     Yes, Chair, my answer to that was that this document is not useful at all and it will not assist any of the contractors to effectively plan and cost such a big project.  So, ja, ineffective …[intervenes]     Okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Chairperson, what I want to say and I think that I am comfortable in saying about this is that the proposal, the costing that they originally have done per house, if I use my calculation and experience will definitely cover the cost, it will be a very high cost but it will coverthe cost, that this report that they have submitted will not give you the necessary information to accurately cost for a project like that and to remove a project because you cannot assess the risk, you do not what equipment to use, how much asbestos to transport, to what is the transport 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244requirements, how long this project is going to take to remove.  So that information is definitely lacking in this report.  It will not give the ordinary person on the street or registered asbestos contractor enough ammunition to do this job properly.     According to me, I think the assessment needs to be redone.     Yes, Chair, these are some of the examples that I was provided to look at and if you look at theinformation it is very lacking in terms of identifying the potential risk of fibre release.     It actually just say that the roof material is asbestos.  On this particular example, it gives you a partial picture of the house and it is also saying that it is a pitched roof where in this case it looks more like a flat roof.  Talking about a pitched roof and a flat roof, it will assist in quantifying the amount of asbestos because you multiple if you have got a square meterage of a dwelling ora house and you know it is a pitched roof, you can put in some calculation to get a closer estimation of a quantity, so it is important to have a correct information but apart from that, this report that they have got per house does not give you any information about the asbestos.   04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244I have seen this -  maybe stepping off - in terms of a training that was provided to the guys that was doing the assessment, the example of training that was provided, it did not give the necessary information to the people that is doing the assessment to say this is what asbestos looks like.  So only an example of the form, the shape of the material but nothing about any other types of asbestos that we need to have a look at.  So that information should filter through to an assessment like this so that you can do     That is correct, that is all the information that was provided even in the final report, they only give amounts of houses that contained asbestos, not quantities or nothing else, only so much percentage of this district’s houses contains asbestos.  That is all the information.     That is correct, yes.     That is for information that is provided in the final report is they numbered the amount of houses that was inspected and then they used this information to say such a big percentage of the houses in that specific district contains asbestos.       Well Chair, I would definitely say, I will submit a cost as soon as I went back to the site and 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244assess the condition and the size so that I can give a proper cost of that.     The type assist – if you have got a size ofthe ground, square meterage of the house, the pitch or the type of house will assist, in this case it will not assist even the picture on that, you can’t clearly see that it is Big 6 type of  panel it looks like a galvanised sheet rather, so if the person that did the assessment is not teached properly, educated properly, how to identify asbestos then this might be misinformation …[intervenes].     Finishes on the wall, it’s got no bearing     No Chair no relevance.     No relevance.     No relevance.     Potential relevance if it’s a solar geyser versus, maybe an old geyser that they’ve got insulation around, it can be problematic but the solar no, no relevance.     No relevance.     Yes Chairperson, if you look at the original proposal the only thing that comes out of it for this specific example, it’s the asbestos roof.     And that’s the only information.     Yes, Chairperson when I eventually were 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244asked to look at this, my original thought about the proposal versus the report is, it was a good document for Government to find out if there’s a problem in a specific district and that’s all.  No information that is relevant for anybody to go remove or eradicate it to control asbestos at all.     I would say that the audit, Chair, would give you a good idea of how big is the problem and if you have got a problem, so in terms of, let’s call it, high-level management of asbestos or high-level knowledge about asbestos in your province or in certain districts it’s a verygood tool.  In terms of eradication, and I think that is what the original purpose was, it doesn’t give any information on the assessment of the asbestos.  So, in the context of the original enquiry or purpose of this, I would say that the audit is about maybe 10% and the assessment would be 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 24490%.     Yes Chair, I totally agree with that statement, I think we have found out that there is asbestos in thatdistrict now, so I think the audit portion is gone you don’t need that information for the eradication anymore and the biggest portion of work would now require the proper assessment and setting out the bill of quantities and prioritising worse or better cases to start your work with.     Yes, Chair, that would be correct if one maybe looks …[intervenes].     Ja.     Yes, Chair, I think in terms of looking at future, maybe the audit will give you a good idea that I don’t need to visit that specific district anymore because there’s no asbestos or there was no asbestos identified soI will not focus on that area or there’s a very low amount of houses, I might have a look at it at a later stage.     Or use it as a training operation maybe, a training project but the focus for moving from hereon forward would be the assessment 100% on the assessment, I would not spend that much time on the audit.     Of FS1?     Yes.     Sorry Chair, I think the pages is messed up in this copy.     Okay.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.ADV PRETORIUS SC    That’s correct with a statement, Chair, in the final report that they had trouble with people being absent coming to work and some labourer issues so it might even be less than 31 days but the time stated in the report is 31 days.     It might even be less.ADV PRETORIUS SC    That’s correct Chair.     Yes, Chair, I just for interest sake, started  with a calculation on the amount of houses, I think that they even mentioned that they had to do 6 000 houses extra, additional that they went to and they trained 155 people of which, some of them left and didn’t return and some of them were absent on several occasions and I did a calculation on the amount of houses, time spent in thesehouses at the end of the day came out to about three to five minutes that they have to spend to assess a house, take a picture, log the data into the hand-held device that they were provided and then submit the information to a central data base and then travel still to the next dwelling or the next house and do the next assessment.     That’s correct.ADV PRETORIUS SC    So, the assessment for 300 000 houses in my capacity, in my business, I’ve got 7 personnel that is trained to do this so I will probably plan, because I need to take all my people to the site and assess the asbestos, 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244spend proper time, allocation of each house to properly assess that house, photograph, capture all the information so that I can set up a proper report for this.  I worked, roughly take about two to three years to do an assessment a proper assessment of this nature.     Chair, yes I’ve been involved in several projects like this for the mining industry and we spend, roughly about 30 minutes per house – 30 minutes to 45 minutes, a lot of the time is spent actually gaining access to a house because people tend to go to work sometimesand so you will battle to get into a house and sometimes you have to set up a specific time after work to go assess houses like this so definitely hinders your assessment and time that you have to spend but I would say anything between 30 and 40 minutes spent per house to properly 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244assess and log all the information plus time spent on the final report to get all this information into a proper bill of quantities.  So, in total I would say round about 30 to 40 minutes per house, estimation.     No Chair I’m finished.     Yes Chair, certainly when I had a first look at the information there was definitely lack of definition interms of the requirement from the requested side to our side, what is needed, so guidance for the contractor maybe on, what is meant by the words audit and assess and what is the outcome that I would like form such an assessment.  So, information like that there’s definitely – if there was 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244any, would assist in making proper comments.  In all this information I had five examples of houses that was assessed, I would have liked, maybe one or two of examples of bigger dwellings, bigger houses, houses that might also contain facia boards and ceiling panels and see what is the information that was actually recorded on those houses so that one can make a fair comment about asbestos other than roof sheeting because what I’ve seen from information that I’ve got is that, firstly, these 155 people that was used there might be a problem in terms ofhow they were actually told to assess, what’s the level of training that were provided.  The little information that was provided in the final report, certainly did not tell them what does asbestos look like and I think that should have been the first thing that came out to, let’s call it, declare somebody competent to do an assessment, to do asbestos assessments so that information will definitely assist more to make comments about it but information provided and the final product that was provided in terms of the final report certainly show that there was no clear indication inthe beginning of what is required, what do I want.     That’s right, thanks Chair.     Yes, Chair, I was just looking at the amount of money that we’re talking about and the original – the proposal, I think, 36 or 37 pages long of information that will be done of which one or two pages was about the asbestos and the rest was about the structure and the engineering of the project and then the appointment fromthe other side was two pages for R255million to assess and eradicate or the first phase as they call it is the assessment – audit and assessment of the asbestos but ja, in terms of my view of the documentation that was bracing this whole project, it was very, very limited.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct, that’s the information that was provided to the Department as a final product, you’ll find examples that I did receive that was their final product in terms of their assessment, it’s got very, very little information.     I think, Chair, that if they were provided some assistance from people in the field that has got 04 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 244knowledge of such projects, they might have thought that this money is a little bit too much for such little work.     Yes, Chair, definitely they benchmark with the assistance of approved inspection authority or one of these asbestos contractors that handle such a big contract, they will definitely make a better decision on the amount that they have to pay for this type of work and also to define, in terms of the documentation provided that this is what I need.  The product, at the end of the day, need to be in line with the asbestos regulation.     That is correct, Chair, I’ve actually estimated a lower cost, my costs in terms of time spent and resources spent, I think came out to about R8million to R9million and then I even went to town and called it R20million so that we can just compare it, but ja the cost is definitely less than R255million.     Thanks.     Thank you Chair.
