CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning Mr Zuma, good morning everybody.  Are you ready Mr Pretorius?    Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius I think Mr Sikhakhane indicates he wishes to say something.  Let us allow him.   Yes.    Hm.   Yes.    Why is it a problem?    Hm.   Well I would – I would agree that preferably when we are done with questioning the witness or Mr Zuma about the evidence of a particular witness then we are done.      But I do not think there would be anything fundamentally wrong if one realises after that witness has been – the evidence of that witness has been done that maybe there was somequestions that were overlooked that are important provided Mr Zuma is able to deal with them.  The timing if need be one can look at that.  I certainly also may have something in regard to Mr Maseko that I might wish to say but it is important that – preferably it should be structured in a way as you say that when we are done with one the evidence ofone witness that should be so but we all know sometimes that later on one might think something and then say you know there may be unfairness if we do not deal with this.  So my prima facie view is that as long as Mr Zuma is able to deal with it I mean from my point of view even if it was to be said well maybe it is not the best time to deal with it when we have started with Ms Hogan.    And have not finished with her maybe we must finish with her and then before we go to the next witness…    Then – that for me is fine as well.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    But I must also say I was going to raise with Mr – part of what you say I was also going to raise with Mr Pretorius.  On mybundle.    After we had dealt with Mr Maseko’s evidence and Ms Mentor’s evidence my bundle suggested the next witness was to be Minister – Mr Nene.    That – that is in terms of mine.  I am assuming that his is the same and yours is the same.  So I was wondering why he moved to Ms Hogan before going to dealing with Mr Nene’s one.  But – but I will hear what he says but the principle of an issue a questionbeing raised after we think that we are done with one witness I think there is no problem with it.  But it may be that – there may be nothing wrong to say let us finish with the one we have already started but maybe before we go to the next one then let us cover whatever may have been forgotten.    Yes.  Yes, yes okay thank you very much.      Yes.   Well I     I would not want to fix a hard and fast rule but even for the transcript it may be that it is convenient if once we have started with the evidence or questions relating to the evidence of a particularwitness we finish that – the questions relating to that witness and then before we go into the next one if there is anything to catch up with regard to previous witnesses we do that.  I do not as I say – we do not fix as a hard and fast rule but I do not think it would prejudice you either.   Well let me say this.  I have thought of saying this before but I am going to say it now.  The legal team of the commission is there to do a certain job.  The legal team for the former President is there to do a certain job.  I am there to do a certain job.  All of us have our own jobs to do.  The legal team for the former President has no power to prescribe to the commission’s legal team how to do their jobnor has the legal team of the commission has power nor has the legal team of the commission power to prescribe to the former President’s legal team how to do their job.  They may have views about each other’s way of doing their respective jobs but in the end each side needs to do what it has to do.  One with a view to allowing the proceedings to proceed as smoothly as possible however without comprising their own position.  So those are the two things that I think would guide all sides.  Whatever I also do in terms of questions I allow, rulings I might make they are aimed at 1. Ensuring a smooth a flow of proceedings as possible.  Fairness to all concerned but without anycompromise on my part on the job that I have to do.  So when either the former President’s legal team makes any submissions to me which they are entitled to make as to any objection to certain questions or any objection to anything I will look at it in the way that I as Chairperson should look at it.  If they are right I will uphold them.  If they are wrongI will reject their submissions.  I will do the same with the legal team of the commission.  And if questions are asked to the former President that I feel are unfair I will intervene.  If questions are asked that his team or even he feels maybe unfair if I feel there is nothing unfair with them I will allow them.  So to the extent that the commission’s legal team may feel that the counsel for Mr Zuma is trying to control anything the legal team of the commission must resist that.  The commission’s legal team must do its job and resist anything that may not be appropriate.  Mr Zuma’s legal team they will also be trying to do their job in terms of protecting their client if they think there is anythingunfair but if the legal team of the commission believes there is nothing unfair they have to – to make that clear.  And where I need to make a ruling I will.  Whereas yesterday I think a discussion might produce a result that allows us to proceed I will do that.  So – so I just want to say and I think in regard to that I want to point out that it is important to draw attention to – in terms of the role of the legal team to draw attention to Rule 3.2 of the Rules of the Commission.  And I draw this just so that there is no confusion.   “A member of the commission’s legal team may put questions to a witness whose evidence is presentedto the commission by the commission’s legal team including questions aimed at assisting the commission in assessing the truthfulness of the evidence of a witness.  Subject to the directions of the Chairperson the commission’s legal team mayask leading questions.” I do not understand – it is not my understanding that anything that the – that Mr Zuma’s legal team has said either in the past two days or today.  I do not understand that anything they have said is something that suggests that Mr Zuma should not be asked questions aimed at establishing the truthfulness of any of the issues and the commission’s legal team is free to do its job the way they believe they should carry it out and if in doing so Mr Zuma’s legal team feels there is a problem they will raise it and if necessary I will make – I will make a ruling.  So I think that on the issue that was raised by Mr Sikhakhane a fewminutes ago my understanding is that he understands the attitude taken by the Chairperson and he mentioned something that was of concern.  I think once I have explained – I had explained my attitude he was not rigid about it.  Thank you.    Have you got the right one Mr Zuma?  The right file?    On the spine it should be written GG[b] on the spine.  If it is written GG[b] it will be the right one.   Okay.  Thank you.    Does that mean that the deployment committee would have a list of people with indications of what their qualifications are, what their experiences are, in what sectors and so on so that whenever they are consulted by a Minister in regard to a particular post they could go to that list and see who do we have in our list who havequalifications that are relevant for this post and experience and then we could – they could say here are some of the people you could look at or is there no list they work – simply work on the basis of people that they know?    Thank you.       And are they elected or appointed at (intervenes)?    Would it be the NEC that would appoint?    Okay.    Do they have – that is the Deployment Committee – do they have a term like whenever there is a new NEC that new NEC appoints a Deployment Committee for the duration of the life of the NEC or they were appointed at a certain stage and they continue irrespective of the change of the NEC or what is the position?    The term of the NEC?   Yes, okay.    Yes, okay.    Okay, ja.    Well I do not know whether Mr Pretorius might have been accurate in suggesting to you that what Ms Hogan says in paragraph 23 in the second sentence that she is suggesting that the – there might be bias in favour of people put up by the DeploymentCommittee but I do see that in that sentence she says and this is a sentence that Mr Pretorius did read. “It cannot be that closeness to or Membership of the ANC, or any of its Alliance structures (or to factions within the structures), should be the determining factors in the selection of candidates for senior positions.” My impression is that she seems to suggest that Membership of the ANC or of the Alliance partners is the determining factor that either the Deployment Committee looks at or those in Government whoare given names by the Deployment Committee taken into account.  That is my understanding of it.  I do not know whether now that I have read it to you – you also have the same understanding of what she is saying but if I am correct it is important to put your understanding of what the true position is.    Ja.  No I …    No.    Well the – I mean counsel for Mr Zuma will indicate fithey have a problem but my – my inclination is that since the issue of the Deployment Committee is being raised here if you have questions relating to the Deployment Committee on which you think Mr Zuma can assist in enlightening the Commission you should be able to put those. He has indicated that the Deployment Committee is chairedby the Deputy President.  He was Deputy President at a certain stage.  I am sure he therefore chaired the Deployment Committee.  So he should be quite well informed at least how it has been functioning and I am sure he will – he will assist us as far as he is able to.    I …    Maybe I can just say Mr Zuma that sometimes a witness will be expressing his or her view but it may be important if youknow – you have knowledge in relation to the – that issue to indicate whether that view is correct or is justified or not but you may elect that you do not want to enter into that but I am just saying that because the way this is put here suggests that the Deployment Committee might not be doing what you have testified it is doing. You have said that the Deployment Committee looks at people within the organisations who have certain skills.  So that when there are positions in Government that need to be filled they are able to say to Ministers here are some names.  We are not saying you must take them.  We say they must go through the normal appointment processesand – and ultimately the Government functionaries make the decisions.  That is my understanding of what your evidence says.    But this sentence suggests that her understanding is that people who might not be deserving to be appointed to certain positions are suggested or put forward by the Deployment Committee    And you might say you agree with that or not?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well …    Hm.    Hm.    Well …    Well you – you might say it would be wrong to say somebody must be appointed simply on the basis of loyalty to the partyand on no other basis …    But if loyalty to the party is one of a number of factors including qualifications, experience and whatever then you – you might have – you might have – you might say there is nothing wrong with that.  I am not sure.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm, hm.    Yes.    Yes, okay.   Yes, okay.    Hm.    Well let me say this that as you will have seen when you read her statement …    Later on she talks about maybe to put neutrally certain challenges that she says she met with in trying to have CEOs appointed to certain SOEs and – and Boards and it may well be that insaying this she is trying to indicate that these problems of factions affected  - ultimately affected maybe governance in SOEs and so on. So I – I am just saying that at this stage but I am – I am quite happy to leave it to you when you are given a chance to comment to make your judgment at this stage if you do not think it is – it isimportant but and – and Mr Pretorius if he feels that he – he – it is important to have your views he – he will indicate but the first opportunity is to get – for you to get a chance to say oh this is what this witness is saying and this is what I have to – I have to say about that if I have anything.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Well …    Well let me – let me say – say this.  The – the ANC is the ruling party and has been the ruling party since 1994.  It may be that certain things that it does or certain things it does not do may be said to affect Government in certain ways.  With that understanding it is possible that there are certain things that are really party things.  Thatare ANC that the Commission might have to look – look at insofar as it can be said that they may have had or they may have a bearing on how Government has been working or how it has dealt with certain things. So I just want to mention that.  It might be difficult.  There might be different views as to which one falls legitimately within that ambit which one falls outside but I just want to say it might be that just because certain things are things that happen within the ANC it maybe that they cannot be excluded completely because of the status of the ANC being the ruling party but obviously somewhere one must draw – draw the line.So I – I think that I would leave it to Mr Pretorius to see how it deals with it but I think what – what the Commission – what one would be looking at is that and what everybody would be looking at is that as the former President of the ANC you would be very knowledgeable about its structures and processes and therefore youare in a position to enlighten the Commission on anything. If there are views that are expressed which do not correctly reflect the ANC you are in a position to say no that is not the ANC.  This is the ANC’s position and to the extent that the ANC – where you think the ANC needs to be defended in regard to how it is impacting on Government it maybe that you would do that.  Maybe that it is somebody else.  I am not sure. So I would leave it to Mr Pretorius to see how far he takes it but as long as you know that whenever these questions are put to you first and foremost it is an opportunity to comment if you – you think youshould and if you do not think you want to comment then you can say that.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    No I – I think – I think that way of responding probably is important because in effect I think you – you are saying she may be saying these things because of certain specific instances that she knows of but you are – you are saying your understanding and your experience of how the Deployment Committee and Government handles these things is the following.  So yes thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    We will take the tea adjournment and resume at half past 11.  We adjourn.    Before Mr Pretorius proceeds I just want to go back to an issue that we dealt with earlier about loyalty to a party and appointments.  You posed a question and I do not know whether you expressed a view, and I want to establish that, you posed a question asto why loyalty to the party should not count in an appointment, whether somebody should be appointed.  Did I understand that part correctly that you posed a question along those lines, or did I misunderstand?    Oh did you express a view?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes, maybe let me just ask is it your understandingthat loyalty to the ruling party or a political party should be a factor in appointments that are made in government?    Yes no I think I understand you to say loyalty to a party should never be the only factor.    That part I understand.  The question I ask is whether it should be a factor at all, whether you ...(intervention)    So, and I’m simply asking it because you and I had an engagement earlier on around that, and I thought you had asked the question why should it not be – why should it not be considered, but I think you have said no you were not asking a question, so then I think maybe it might be good because somebody else might have understood the way that I understood, it might be important if you have view on that to make it clear what your view is and – because it leads to the question of what would have been expected of government ministers, and the President himself, and the Deputy President who sits on theDeployment Committee, when among the names that they see for a particular post they see somebody that comes from the deployment committee, were they expected to take into account that this must be a loyal – this must be somebody with loyalty to the party or were they not supposed to, and you can answer in terms of your understanding which may be right, which may be wrong but your own understanding with the experience that you have both in the ANC and in government.    In the appointments yes.    Okay.    Yes, okay well as you explained now I had some things to the effect, it’s not the only factor, so I go back to the question whether as far as you know with your experience in the ANC, with yourexperience in government, is it something – was it one of the factors that at least the ANC as the ruling party expected government ministers and the President and Deputy President, to have regard to when they select who should fill certain positions.    Not necessarily?    Okay, yes.  Okay thank you.  Mr Pretorius?    I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, you said he said the next in line that might suggest as if you are saying he said the next on the list, whereas he said he didn’t – he wouldn’t know details about the list so you might wish to – you might not have intended that.    That would – would that be, you’re talking about a DG now, Mr Gama wasn’t going to be a DG but you are making an example?    In the case of a DG would that selection committee, that the relevant minister creates or establishes would it includecabinet ministers?    And would it consist only of members of the Executive or it could include people outside of the Executive?   People of the Executive, okay.    That is in the case of a DG?    Even board members.    And CEO’s ...(intervention)    And CEO’s of SOE’s?    Okay, thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius?    Ja.    Okay.    And not just choice, you were right, your only choice.    Well I just want to say this is one of those parts of her statement where it is quite important that your answer be the answer that is really to the best of your recollection because the way she has put it is quite emphatic and so it is important to distinguish between you don’t recall and I didn’t say it or I couldn’t have said it, so that one can understand it.   You could not have said this?    Yes.    But certainly that’s the impression that comes out of that paragraph.    That’s the impression that one gets when one readsthat paragraph, that you were saying this is my only choice and you were not prepared to look at another candidate.  That’s my impression of what she is saying.    You could not have said so?    Mmm.    Are you saying you do have a recollection of the fact that at some stage you got to know that Mr Gama was facing somedisciplinary process but you can’t say whether you were told that in a meeting with Ms Hogan?    You are not sure about that.    Yes, yes, and is your recollection that that was known at the time when an appointment of GCEO of Transnet was supposed to happen.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Maybe I could say this and maybe something thatcomes later in her statement.    I’m saying I want to say something that maybe comes later in her statement.    Maybe the noise of the aircon might be affecting us, we will see what we can do if it interferes.  I think at some stage in her statement when one reads it one gets the impression, and I want to put it no higher than that, gets the impression that she may in regard to these appointments whether of a CEO of an SOE or the Chairperson of a Board that she would be putting forward to cabinet that she would want first to have an idea whether the President has no problem with t he particular candidate.  That’s the impression I get, she might not be saying that, and in a way when I read that I thought well maybe if you are going to a certain meeting and you want to put in a proposal youmight want to check with certain people who are important in that meeting if they have any problem with your proposal, because if they have a problem you might wish to rethink, but if they are fine you will confident to then take it forward to a bigger meeting.  That’s what I was thinking.  So it may well be that to the extent – if she did come to you with the names maybe that the idea was to check whether you had any problem with the names.  Would that sound like something that would happen at cabinet ministers?    It does happen yes.    Yes.   Yes, yes.    Yes, okay.    Yes, okay, thank you.   I guess that amounts to saying you can neither admit or deny that, that’s what she says and it’s possible.    Ja, okay.    What would you have – what do you think would havebeen your view if she told you, as she says she did, that there was a rigorous selection process that had been followed by the Board considering a number of candidates, one of whom was Mr Gama, but that after considering all the candidates the Board had recommended Mr – is it Maseko?    Mr Maseko, do you have an idea what your normal reaction would be when a Minister comes with names after a process like that, would your natural or normal reaction be if that is what the Board wants and you are happy then it’s fine or would your position be just give me some more information about this candidate or all these candidates, I want to look at them, I want to scrutinise them or take it to cabinet and we will see what cabinet says.  What would be your normal reaction when a Minister comes with candidates – a candidate’s name after such a process?   And maybe I could ask this as well?  Do you have any recollection whether in such a process when a Minister comes tocabinet with a name whether he or she would include information about other candidates who were not successful according to the board or it would just be in – for the information about the candidate that is being recommended, is that something that you are able to remember or is that something you do not remember?    Okay thank you.     Okay I am sorry I think Mr Sikhakhane has got something.    Yes.    Please come forward so I can hear you.    No, no, no, no.  I said you can make submissions and everyone must do their job.   Yes.    Hm.    Well Mr Sikhakhane sometimes you have a laid down process and you have a different understanding of persons of what the actual process was that was followed.  Sometimes a laid down process is not followed so the question was meant to get what his understanding was of what the process was as opposed to what the process was that was prescribed by law.    Yes.    It is has got to do with whether where it is alleged that as it is here that he said he had only one choice of a candidate.  Whether it is possible that the – his understanding of the process is different from what is laid down.  Genuine understanding.   Well Mr Sikhakhane I have just said to you – you can have a law that says this is the process and you can have people who are supposed to apply that process having a different understanding.  And the question is aimed at establishing whether his understanding –what his understanding was of the process.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And again Mr Zuma I just want to say that where you do not know feel free to say that I do not know.  Thank you.    Mr Pretorius.    I was not sure – I am not sure whether…    That was an answer – whether there was an answer or not?    Oh.    Okay.    426.    Hm.   428 I think.  Did you say 438?    At the top.   428 at the top.  Must I ask somebody to come and assist you?    Yes.   Yes could – Lerato.  Go and look for page 428 at the top.    On the right one.    Yes.  Each time we talk about a page it will be the red numbers at the top.    Yes okay.    Oh okay.    Well you had to deviate yesterday at some stage.  Ja okay.  Do you want to read it and then put your question again?    Are you reading it from page 27 up to 28 – 428.   Okay the paragraph he is going to read Mr Zuma starts on the previous page which is 427 at the bottom and continues at the top of page 428.    Page 427.    But I think he must see it as well.      Can you see it?    42 – 32…    Ja.   At the bottom.    Yes okay.    Let him get there first.    The – the microphone must be able to catch the response.    Yes.   Was your answer yes?    Yes okay.    Well he says no comment.  No comment says he hasno opinion on the …    Maybe before you make a final answer on that or move on to this I see that in – at the end of that report Ms Barbara Hogan was asking you to note the contents of the report …    And to approve that the – to approve the submission of a Cabinet Memorandum recommending the appointment.  I am – I am saying – I am mentioning it because earlier on I think you did emphasis that Ministers would come to the President for the President to note …    Before certain matters where they would then be taken to Cabinet.    Yes, okay thank you.    Well I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.   I think I may have interrupted both you and Mr Zuma. You had asked him a question whether he had responded to this report and I think he had indicated that he thought he had …    But you might not have finished.    Yes.    Yes.  Well I want – I want to know the answer     No but I want to know the answer.    Yes.  Mr Zuma did you respond to this memorandum if you remember – this report?    You cannot remember?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So normally you would allow …    You would grant the approval that a Minister is asking for unless there was a problem?    (Intervenes).    Yes, yes.    As yet?    Yes.    Yes.   But as to what you did with regard to this one you are not able to remember or you are able to remember?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    So if – if ever the President were to say to a Minister no do not take this one to Cabinet as yet I want to discuss something with you about it.  It would be something quite important?    If it is not something so important the – the idea would be to say take it there we will discuss at Cabinet?    Yes but in the Presidency would there be records of any correspondence if for example - you cannot remember now – but if you did respond by way of a memorandum to the Minister or a letterwould you know whether there would be such a record in the Presidency or you would not know?    To Ministers?   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes, okay.    Okay.    Yes, okay.    Okay.    Stop it?    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Yes, okay thank you. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Okay.    Yes, okay.    You – you put two questions at the same time Mr Pretorius.  The one was whether he was aware of that.    The other was whether he has comments.  He has already said he has no comment.  Were you aware of that at the time?   That paragraph?    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    Page 448 but the paragraph Mr Pretorius you said what paragraph?    I cannot see 4-0 at page 448.    Page 4-0-8 or page 4-4-8?  Let us talk about the page first.    Okay.  I may have misled Mr Zuma.  I thought you said 4-4-8.   Hm.    4-0-8, okay.  That is the page.    Let us get there first.  Let us get there first then we can talk about the paragraph.  I am at page 4-0-8 and I can see paragraph 40.  Are you there Mr Zuma?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment now and we will resume at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn.    Let’s proceed.    What is it, just repeat for me the page Mr Pretorius and the paragraph?    Ja.  Paragraph?    Okay.    Yes.    Hmm.    I think it is fair to say that as President there would be certain things that you might not know because they will be dealtwith by officials and other people and that there will be certain things that you would be expected to know, I think that’s fair, fair comment.  Where there may be difficulty, and I think we can have a look, and I did say earlier on you are free to say look I don’t know that, I wouldn’t have known that you know, and I think Mr Pretorius may going forward have to maybe apply his mind more in terms of what is important that you are likely to have known or to have dealt with to the extent that maybe some of the questions might be questions that might not have fallen within what you would have known, but I think what he may be trying to do is to make sure that in the light of the allegations that MsBarbra Hogan has made for example that you interfered with the processes of the appointment of for example the CEO, Group CEO for Transnet, and she goes into details into her interactions with you on her version.It may be important for the Commission to understand for example when you go to that report that Mr Pretorius took you through to say do you remember having received this report, did you note some of these points that she made for example that the Board had made a certain recommendation.  Some of those may be important because when a decision has to be made as to whether what she says you saidwas actually said or whether you said it or not, it might be important to have that full picture, but at any time feel free to say those kind of details wouldn’t have been part of what I would deal with, and I would simply say to Mr Pretorius as we go forward do have a look in terms of what’s important for purposes of Mr Zuma in terms of what you arelooking at, so in principle I accept the point that there may be details that as president you wouldn’t know but I think that maybe that Mr Pretorius doesn’t want a situation where he doesn’t put certain things to you only to find that later on they become relevant in terms of what exactly happened and then you have not been given a chance, that’s my thinking of what he is doing, but I think going forward it may be that he might wish to bear your concern in mind as he goes forward.    Yes?   Yes.    Yes.   Well to a certain extent we are at that point because we have dealt with a point where she says she had a meeting with you,where she briefed you on the process for the appointment of the Group CEO at Transnet, and she says at that meeting she told you that the Board had recommended a certain candidate after considering a number of candidates including Mr Gama, and she says she was shocked and disappointed when you said, according to her, you have only one choice, that is Mr Gama.Now that seems to me if it is true what she says happened may well be an interference, I am not saying it is, it may well be an interference, I am not sure.  You might be able as you say to say a President and a Minister would discuss such issues as – a Minister ofPublic Enterprises would discuss issues as to candidates to be considered but the President if he has a view would express a view but would not be saying his view is the only view or the decisive view and that gives me at least another version to say well she says this is what was said but you say this is what happens, not what she is saying.  So in terms of that report Mr Pretorius was going through it because he is still looking at that issue and I did indicate earlier on that in terms of her statement of – in terms of accusations that she makes that’s one of the very important accusations that she makes that must be dealt with properly, so it may be that there are certain detailswhere you say look I really don’t know that part, and I wouldn’t know it as President and that’s legitimate, so I am saying I hear your concern and I want to urge Mr Pretorius to bear it in mind as we go forward to try and avoid details that you might not have known about as President.      Yes.    Well let me make this other point and some of this might be something that I need to explain, if for example as we have in relation to this accusation that she makes that you interfered with the appointment process in relation to the Group CEO of Transnet she says you interfered and you say no I never interfered and actually it is not true that I said I had a choice of the candidates, not even to speak about one – only one choice, or if I said anything about candidates all Imay have said was maybe Mr Gama might have been okay but let’s go and talk at Cabinet, or you might say I don’t think I expressed any preference in either way and that’s not how I normally dealt with these matters and that’s not how as far as I know a President deals with these matters.At a certain stage she might have to be called back to deal with the fact that you have said you couldn’t have said that and because in the end I may have to make a finding as to did the meeting that she talks about take place between the two of you, and is it true that you said what she says she said, and when I look at that I can’t look just at that, I have got to look at a number of factors relating to the circumstances of the whole matter.  That’s where some of the things might be relevant.      Yes.    Well maybe the paragraph by paragraph might not be the best way, it may be that Mr Pretorius must look at the gist of certainportions of her statement and be able to put those to you rather than paragraph by paragraph there.  There I think you may have a point there, you know Mr Pretorius will respond but it may be that he needs to look at a number of paragraphs and get the gist and put it, particularly because your version is I could not have said this, this isnot how things have worked and therefore it might not be helpful to go into certain details because my version is it could not have happened and I am now putting my own words – it may be that you say couldn’t have happened this way because if it happened this way it would have been improper and I wouldn’t have done that kind of thing.So if it is fine with you I want to urge Mr Pretorius to look at trying things that way and let us see how it goes and if there is still a concern then you can raise it again.    Yes.    Well – were you still in the middle of saying something, I don’t want to interrupt you.    Were you in the middle of making a certain point, I don’t want to interrupt you?    Well you see when Ms Barbra Hogan gave her version to say you interfered the Commission didn’t accept what she said as true, as necessarily true, that’s how I should put it.  Equally when you say what she is saying is not true, the Commission doesn’t necessarilyat this stage say what you are saying is true, at this stage the Commission is  hearing different witnesses saying what they have to say on certain issues, there will come a time when the Commission must weight up all the evidence and see and decide what it decides is true, but at this stage it – just because you have said what she says happened is not true the Commission cannot say that is the end of the matter, it must still look at all relevant circumstances so that when at the end of its work it has to weigh up and decide it has a full picture, that is the attempt, to make sure that it has a full picture from all sides before that time comes.  Maybe I should allow Mr ...(intervention)     Yes.    Yes, let me hear what Mr Pretorius has to say.    So I think maybe what you should try and do is to try and avoid the kind of details that might not help in deciding what actually happened with regard to this incident, and just bear in mind hisconcerns, his concern.    So we will bear it in mind.  If the attempt that will be made after some time it looks like it still does not meet your concern please feel free to raise it again.  Sometimes it is not as easy as it is but Mr Pretorius will try.  Okay.Mr Zuma is not agree – oh I’m sorry, Mr Sikhakane, I didn’t see your hand.    Yes?    Okay, how much time do you need?    At three o’clock?    Okay I will give you, we will adjourn for 30 minutes, we will resume at three.  Thank you, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES    I had said we would resume at three o’clock it did not happen.  That was because there were still discussions that were going on.  As you know we adjourned because the former President had expressed certain concerns with regard to the details or questions or some of the questions that he was being asked and his counsel expressed those concerns as well and requested an adjournment so that the former President and his legal team could reflect on the situation.  The – there has been a discussion involving me and the legal team of the commission as well as the legal team for the formerPresident.  They – both sides made a certain suggestion which I have agreed to.  This commission would like to make sure that as far as possible it takes everybody on board.  At least it should make attempts as far as possible to do so.  The former President has expressed certain concerns and what has been agreed is that there should be anopportunity for both the commission’s legal team and the former President’s legal team to look at the concerns and see whether a way can be found in which they can be accommodated without the commission’s legal team compromising their job that they need to do in terms of the investigation.  It has been decided that we should adjourn the proceedings for the day and we should not sit tomorrow in order to give a full opportunity to the commission’s legal team and the former President’s legal team which would involve the former President as well because he is concerned in the matter to see whether a way can be found in which his concerns are addressed without the commission’slegal team compromising any part of their obligations.  We – I must take this opportunity to say that I said yesterday I think I said it yesterday that I believed that all sides were trying to find solutions to whatever issues arose and I indicated yesterday for example that the former President’s counsel or legal team indicated that they did not want Mr Pretorius to be looking over his shoulder as he was asking questions. They did not want to keep on raising to raise objections.  They were going to raise objections only if it was something really serious.  So there have been an issue now they will come together and they have discussed and a decision has been taken that let there betime to look at issues and see if common ground can be found so that then we can continue.  So we are therefore going to adjourn the proceedings until Friday morning.  I am confident that a way that there are reasonable prospects that a way will be found to make sure that we can proceed with a certain understanding.  So we will have to wait untilFriday but tomorrow all sides will be interacting with one another – with each other to try and see how or the concerns that have been raised by the former President can be accommodated.  I am confident that it ought to be possible to find a way.  Unless there is anything that counsel for the former President or Mr Pretorius wants to say I am happy that we adjourn.  I think both indicate that they have nothing to 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair thank you.      Mr Zuma I would like to go back please just to two brief matters dealing with evidence yesterday.  In relation to Mr Maseko as the CEO of GCIS I understand from your evidence and I understand it to be correct that that post is the equivalent of a head of a department post.   And that certain provisions of the relevant legislation would apply.  I do not intend to debate those provisions with you but I need in fairness to ask certain questions about the process leading up to the termination of Mr Maseko’s employment as head of GCIS and the transfer to the Department of Public Service and Administration.  And as I understand your evidence you made no decision…    May I just say Chair.    In answer to that.  Very often when one considers overnight the evidence given, the questions asked and the answers given one understands that it may be appropriate to put certain issues to the witness concerned in this case the former President.  Not only in order to ensure that the questioning has beenfull and proper and in accordance with the mandate of investigation that the commission holds but also in order to be fair to the witness.  Because from the evidence certain conclusions may be drawn particularly in relation to the evidence of the former President in relation to the transfer of Mr Maseko which requires in fairness confirmation of certain facts or certain facts to be put to him so that when later it is sought to draw conclusions from that evidence the witness has had an opportunity to comment on those possible conclusions.  So there can be no unfairness that happens regularly in proceedings particularly of this nature where there are vast amount ofissues to examine.  And I also have a question in relation to Ms Mentor.  I am not sure that it is not appropriate now at the beginning of the day to deal with it but if you say I must wait until Ms Hogan is – matters are finished…    I am happy to do that it is not a problem.    It certainly will not Chair but what I do find particularly disturbing is the manner in which control is sought to be exercised over the way the legal team has planned and is asking its questions.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Zuma yesterday when we adjourned we were dealing with the evidence of Ms Hogan and she had testified as was pointed out to you in regard to how Chief Executive Officers and board members of state owned entities were appointed in the normal course and she described a process with which I understood you largely agreed and that appears at page 403 ofthe bundle GG[b] – GG[b].      Do you have apge 403 Mr Zuma?    Red number yes.    Having set out in her evidence the normal processes or processes that she recorded as normal she says in paragraph 22 something different.  She says that in practice however and I am referring to paragraph 22 there were parallel behindthe scenes processes.   “As the ruling party the ANC had expectations that they would have influence over who was appointed to boards via the deployment committee of the ANC.  When that ANC came into power in 1994 the deployment committee played a useful role in identifying appropriate candidates from among the ranks of progressive forces to fill crucial positions as the state at that time was staffed entirely by the previous apartment government appointees.”A matter that has concerned the commission’s investigation is how senior people in the boards and executive posts of state owned entities are appointed.  Whether those appointments are appropriate or have resulted in the appropriate fulfilment of tasks and whether that has influenced in any way what has happened in the state owned entitiesover an extended period.  And one of the issues raised by Ms Hogan was the issue of deployment.  Does the practice and perhaps you can help us with your knowledge and experience to understand the deployment process if it exists – understand why it exists and understand how it is exercised and what influence it plays in appointments at state owned entities at board level and senior executive level.  Could you tell us a little please about deployment?  If it exists firstly and secondly if it does exist how it is employed or utilised as a manner of influencing selection of board members and SOE’s and senior executives in SOE’s?   As I understand it there are three issues that you have emphasised and I would like to understand them to see if I have it correct.  The first is that the deploymentcommittee of the ruling party is involved in decision making from time to time in the appointment of board members of state owned entities and senior executives.  Do I understand that correctly?    It is involved I was getting to that.    It is involved in the process of appointment either in hearing from Ministers what – who theircandidates might be and giving input on that or suggesting candidates to the Minister that – in that process.    I understand you to also say that the deployment committee is not decisive in that process but that thefinal decision would rest as I understand you with the Minister following the selection procedures interviews and the like.      Is that correct.    Who would ordinarily sit on the deployment committee Mr Zuma?    Thank you.  Mr Zuma on page 405, paragraph 28 and following Ms Hogan relates her experiences inrelation to Transnet, and appointments within Transnet and certain of the detail of her narrative mentions engagements with yourself and I therefore need to put them to you for your comment.  Just by way of background in paragraph 28 Ms Hogan refers to the resignation of Ms Maria Ramos as CEO of Transnet in February 2009.  She then says that the Transnet Board, after a careful selection process, and extensive engagement with the then Minister of Public Enterprises, Brigitte Mabandla, recommended Pravin Gordhan.  Do you know of those events, it’s not necessary to go into any detail but just by way of background to what follows?   Yes, and she says in paragraph 30 a week later Mr Gordhan withdrew his candidature and several months later he became the Minister of Finance.  That again by way of background.    But what she says in paragraph 30 is that what she describes as a fiction arose at the time which was untrue that Siyabonga Gama, Mr Gama, then CEO of Transnet Freightrail was second on the list of preferred candidates for theposition of Transnet CEO.  She says there was no such preferential list.  Do you know anything about that?    Preferential list.  She says that at the time there was a belief or an understanding amongst some, afiction she says, that there was a list of preferred candidates and that second on that list was Mr Gama, do you know anything about that?    I’m sorry.    Now do you say there was such a list, she says there was no such list.  If you let me just ask you to look at paragraph 30 and read to you what she says. “A fiction arose at that time which was untrue that Siyabonga Gama, Mr Gama, then CEO of TFR [that’s Transnet Freightrail]was second on the list of preferred candidates for the position of Transnet CEO.  There was no such preferential list.” Do you have a comment?    Alright, that would have occurred shortly before or after May 2009.  You say there was discussion about the next in line, Mr Gama, being appointed to the position.  But she   Well what did you say about Mr Gama being discussed in the absence of Mr Gordhan?  I understood you said that his candidature was recommended by some as being the next person for consideration?  I do not want to get into a debate aboutin line or lists or anything ...(intervention)     ...that’s districting.  Sorry?    And did some feel that he should in the absence of Mr Gordhan ...(intervention)     ...be appointed to the post?    Okay.  The selection committee you’re referring to what selection committee are you referring to?   Right.      In paragraph 31, again by way of    Okay.    In relation to the further search    And she says   In any event if we could go then to paragraph 33 because this now becomes directly relevant to your own involvement Mr Zuma.  She says in paragraph 33 at the bottom of   Is that a fair summary of what was discussed?    Then in paragraph 34 on page   Please.   Well perhaps in fairness we should take it step by step Mr Zuma.  What she says is at that meeting you informed her that Mr Gama was your only choice for GCEO.    Your choice for GCEO.   Yes, I understand two things from your answer Mr Zuma, firstly that you would not have said that, secondly as I understand what you said that a statement such as thatwould show that this was a complete deviation from the proper process.    It follows that the second sentence would also not have been part of that conversation but let me not make any assumptions and let me put it to you.  I informed him, that is Ms Hogan informing yourself, that that was not possible and that Mr Gama was not the Board’s choice and I could not override the Board as they had undergone a very professional selection process.  Do yourecall that being said at the meeting?    And then do you recall being informed that Mr Gama was the subject of an enquiry?    Do you recall being informed by Ms Hogan at that meeting that Mr Gama was the subject of an inquiry?    In the last four lines of that    And do your comments apply equally to an SOE as well as a Government Department?    It’s just been brought to my attention that your comments might have been directed at government departments, rather than State Owned Entities.    She proceeds in paragraph 35 Mr Zuma to say the problem was that President Zuma, two of mycabinet colleagues and elements within the ANC and the Tripartite Alliance, including the Secretary General Gwede Mantashe, were very vocal that the candidate of their choice, Mr Gama, would become the next GCEO of Transnet, despite the fact that the black dominated board of Transnet after a rigorous and professional selection process wereclearly of the view that Mr Gama was not an appropriate candidate.  Her comments then are extended insofar as they relate to support for Mr Gama to arrange with other persons and entities, or persons rather, do you have any comment on that?    Yes.    If I may just put it to you on abasis that is fair to you, she says they were very vocal about it.    Yes, do you have any knowledge of that?    She said there was vocal support and widespread vocal support for Mr Gama to be appointed as the next GCEO of Transnet.  It may be that she implies, maybe not butperhaps I should put it to you that it was well known that many people supported Mr Gama.    What was your view Mr Zuma about the appointment of Mr Gama as GCEO of Transnet?    What was your view as to whether he should be appointed or not?    Yes.    “In this regard …”    Then if we may proceed to page 434 the conclusions of this section relating to the process from a factual point of view are set out in paragraph 3.4.5 on page 4-3-4.  Do you have that?    The first bullet – if I may    The third bullet reads   The next bullet reads   That this had the Board’s approval and Executive authority approval?    And then in the last bullet the    Do you agree with it?  Do you disagree with it?    Do – do you accept that?    You do not wish to comment or because you have no issue with it?    That is what I wanted to clarify.  Do you have any issue with that …?    Just before we leave the report Mr Zuma again this is really a – a request for some information and assistance from you.  If one goes to page 446 this is part of an opinion …    Yes.    Yes.  I will come back to thatChair.    Because I just …    Do not want to leave the report now and I am (intervenes).    Allow me to do so.    Well …   Before we leave the report or memorandum that was given to you I would just like to ask you onequestion to assist you.  If you have no recollection or ability to answer that is also fine but if one goes to page 446 red 446.  At the bottom of the page paragraph 5 you will see reference to a Protocol and under    Yes.    There is just an interesting paragraph quoted in the next paragraph under the heading    Yes.    We have heard this morning in relation to the appointment of Board Members of State Owned Entities your comments Mr Zuma and I think you said it was normal or happened most of the time.  Correct me if I am wrong but the Minister wouldengage with the president from time to time to discuss candidates.    Is that correct?    Did this apply to Heads of Government Departments as well?    That practice.    Chair I am about to go back tothe statement of Ms Hogan.  Perhaps I should just conclude.  Paragraph 40 on page 408.    40 on 400-and – page - red 408.    40 – 4-0.    4-0-8.  Chair have I …?    4-0-8.    Oh, 4-4-8 I am sorry.    I am following instructions.  Red 4-0-8.    Paragraph 40.    In that paragraph she said that she sent the memorandum to you.  She describes it as comprehensive report on or around 28 July 2009 and then she says in the last    Right.  Chair would that be aconvenient time?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Zuma if we could go to page 408, we had dealt with paragraph 40 before the long adjournment, do you have that paragraph?   408.    40, we had completed paragraph40 and I would like to go on from there.    Well Chair if Ms Hogan implicates in her evidence Mr Zuma directly we are not only duty-bound to put it, but it is fair to put it in all its relevant detail.  If Mr Zuma cannot remember that is the end of the story, but if a report dealingwith a particular request and stressing the urgency of the request is addressed to Mr Zuma and Mr Zuma says he received the report and he considered its contents then its contents may or may not be relevant but certainly should be put in the sense that Mr Zuma has a chance to comment, so that when submissions are made at the end of the day one just does not say here’s the report, Mr Zuma acknowledged receiving it, he is in a sense – must be accept to have agreed to its contents.  That would be unfair.  But I understand the complaint in relation to stressing detail and I am about to get to the gist of the matter now, in which I will putas up to this point at least in broad summary what Ms Hogan is saying to enable Mr Zuma to answer.    Right. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes.    I hope so.  That is…    Ja GG[b].    403 the red ink?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Yes there is a deployment committee in the ANC.  The ANC took a decision that given the fact that it was a ruling party.  It is given that position because it has won elections.  In other words people in the country feel that the ANC can lead them better on the basis of its policies.  Now the ANC has an interest once it has put its government because the government would have come as a result of the ANC having been accepted by the voters that the programmes and policies that it is putting across would indeed be implemented.  And therefore it took a decision that there must be some assistance to government in terms of finding people todo specific things.  And also Ministers as they search for people to put into positions they would also rely to the party to say I want to deploy so and so or a person in this kind of position is there any person capable for this that you could recommend etcetera.  In other words the interest of the ANC is to ensure that there are [indistinct] who willimplement the programmes appropriately.  So they interact with the deployment committee in the process as you would be looking for somebody you – where you head hunt at times.  At times they do not have to come to the committee if they have got individuals they believe that can do the job.  But once that is done then the processes of the government will kick in.  And at times the Minister might say look I think I have got a better candidate I do not think this one will fit.  The deployment committee assisted that process because its aim is that things should be done.  It does not impose them whether you like it or not it is a discussion that takes place and then once that process hasbeen done there will have to be a government process as well wherein people go through interviews.  Where the Minister appoints or put together a number of colleagues to help in the process of interviews.  A person perhaps that the deployment committee felt this could be the right person to this position might actually fail the – the interviews.  So it is not that once you have taken that decision then it is a foregone conclusion because you might find that the person does not have the necessary things that are needed for a particular job.  It is all done to help that when you make the - or you put people you do not just get restricted to one person.  There is a variety of people that you look at. And that is what happens.  And Ministers will go to the deployment committee to say I am looking for a person or the deployment committee could say Minister we have people that you could look at.  So it is a process that fits into the process of the government the one that comes from the political – ah what you call a – deploymentcommittee.  In other words it helps the government firstly to make the candidates available and also to look at specific people.  At times the committee has nothing to do because there will be no need at all and the Minister could be knowing what they are doing, find somebody and bring that somebody.  It does not mean that each and every person who gets appointed goes through this process.  That is generally how it works.    The deployment committee does not necessarily appoint.  It recommends.    In the process.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes correct.    They do not necessarily keep a list for that.  I think it happens that the ANC knows – the party knows its people and it knows some of them, their capacities.  Some may not know.  So when that situation arises they will then look at those.  It might be some other lists etcetera.  Once they know what type of – or what type of person is wanted to assist the process.  Not that everytime it happens they must go to the deployment committee to look at a list not at all.  At times it does not happen at all.  But when it happens that is a recommendation the deployment committee will make to assist those in government.    Sorry?    Sorry.    Yes.  The people – there are people who are appointed ever since it has existed.  Normally it is the person who has been chairing.  It would be the Deputy President.  Why the Deputy President because the Deputy President is a Deputy President of the party and Government.  He would also understand what is needed in Government. So you do not have a person who is chairing this Committee who knows nothing about what is happening in Government because he would not be able to assist to get the kind of people that are really needed in Government and – and that is why he sits there to chair. Some of the members of the Deployment Committee would be Ministers of a particular type. Also who will be knowledge about what happens in Government.  So the – the members are not just members handpicked because they are there.  They are people who will help this process.   Appointed – appointed by the structures – senior structures of the movement.    Yes absolutely.    No he does not sit.  He does not sit but can – if he has ideas about things he can also interact withthe Chair whatever but does not sit.  It is the Deputy President who chairs.  The highest kind of officer would be in that Committee.  The President no.    Ja.  It – it goes with the term.    With the term, yes.    You might find new members if there is a new term but you might – you do not have to be appointing and appointing in the process of the five years.   So that is how it goes.  It goes together with the term.    At times because they might –they might recommend if they know some people who have experience in the Boards.  They might recommend if that kind of activity comes.    Government Departments in what sense?    That could also – that couldalso go to …    Ja.  Particularly …    Particularly at the leadership level of the department.    Well I do not know.  This would be her views as an individual but the organisation has taken a decisionto have these kind of structures …    Because here she is just expressing her own views.    This is not accurate.  The views are not accurate because as I said setting up that Committee there are Ministers who serve there who have the institutional memory who serve there chaired by the Deputy President who sits in the Cabinet and every Cabinet Committee.  So it is not a correct argument that she is putting.  She is just expressing her view.    No.  I think she is still pursuing her argument really.  How she is looking at this.   That is how it is – it is her view but the manner in which we – we handle this is the manner in which I have just explained.    Well I do not know what she – she thinks should happen.  Why the people who must be appointed should not come from the people who either – the people know and they know the experiences and in the process of that the people who arehere are people who would be known either because of their profession or their performance but also that are people who would implement the policies appropriately and who – who might – who may not be opposed to the policies that made the party to be elected to Government.    Yes I see it so.  That is part ofthe elements.    That is why I was saying she is of course putting her own views on - on the matters.  In other countries for example when one party wins elections and let us say to clarify the issue it has been the – the opposition wins the elections.  When they come to the office they do not take people who are there.  They removeeverybody out and put their people. It is a general practice in the world.  We are not even doing that.  It is a question of how the party looks at not only to the members.  Even those who are not members at all.  That is what we do.  In other countries it is extreme.  They come even with a sweep everybody elseof the new party because they must implement the party policies that was accepted by the people. You cannot take people because the opposition would not do so.  So – that is why I am saying she is just raising more - her views about this.    Yes generally.    Ja generally.    That is what – that is what it is.    I think once again she is expressing her views.    She is expressing her views because as I was explaining the party cannot just allow a situation where you take anybody anyway that we have no knowledge of.  Now those people including her they – whilst they are because of their loyalty to the – to the party - to the organisation.  They believe in the policies of the organisation.Now who will say deliberately let us forget about those people and just find some other people.  I do not understand the logic.    I am explaining this because it maybe her own view because of certain cases.  She may be aware of if such a thing happened.  It is not – it is not meant to take your friends this one if you are a member of this.  You do not take your friends.  You look at – because the Committee discusses it would discuss what type of a person we want.  It is not going to be which friend we take. I think the point she is make – she is putting a point her ownpoint because she might be having an experience of that nature but in terms of the process it is not done in the manner in which she is putting it.    Hm, yes.    Thank you, thank you Chair.  I think the – the last sentence is very clear.  She has views.  She –maybe she has some experience and then she is saying look when we do this selection it must not be based on - on these things that she is talking about but for example the way she is putting it must not be an award for loyalty.    No Chair I am – I am just making the point.    If you say it must not be loyalty to the party.   Why should you no – not take people who are not loyal to the party …    If they have …   Skills and everything.    You know them.  They are people who interact all the time.    Why must we say no because you are loyal to the party we are not taking you.    Hm.    Yes absolutely true.  I am not necessarily saying all other elements that she is putting here …    You should.  The fact that sheshould – it should not also be loyalty to the faction etcetera.  She is expressing a view.  She must be having a particular experience because indeed you - you cannot have a – a kind of a Government which is based on factions.    That is not the issue.    I am not saying the statement is wrong …    But …    It is her view because she must have come across something.    I am sure.    I am saying those people look at the capabilities and suitability’s of people not whether this person agrees with me politically or whatever.    No I – I am not saying loyalty covers all of those elements.    That is why – that is why I made a very broad point as an example that there is no party in the worldthat wins elections and then forgets about the supporters and the people and look for other people who do not know whether they are going to sabotage your work in order to make you to lose the next elections.    Well Chair I am not sure how deep we get into these issues.  I was trying to indicate that she is expressing her own views here.  I do not know whether I should now debate those views because it is not true after Polokwane.  It is not true that people entrenched their own sides.  It is not true.  There is evidence that comrades that would have been on opposite sides in terms of supporting a candidate.  They were put in these structures of Government and other places.  It is not true.  I am not sure whether Iam keen to debate her views.  I was trying to run away from this because …    She is expressing her views.    Hm.    Hm.    No my problem Chair is that here is a report to – to the Commission.  It gets into some happenings in the party and they are not accurate.  They are not accurate.  We willend up now discussing the ANC politics because I do not - if – if you put that statement generally you have got to do …    Your selection fairly …    Partly it cannot be that as – as for an example the Deployment Committee it is a Committee.  You cannot have that Committee with almost everybody coming from a particular faction.  It cannot be.  People there are – they – they are not appointed on the basis of that.  They are actually appointed by thestructures. You know firstly the – there is a working Committee that this looks at this then the NEC that appoints these people of the Deployment Committee.  You cannot say the whole NEC is a faction and therefore it has appointed its faction.  I am not sure we want to get intothose discussions.  That is why I kept on saying looking she is more or less expressing her own views.  She was part of the process.    I am not sure we want to debate that.    No Chair.    For an example she quotes a particular conference …    And what happened thereafter.    Now it is not true.   Also …    This process is very thorough.  If for example you talk about selecting other Heads of Departmentwhatever - whatever are the processes even if the process started with the Deployment Committee once the Minister if you take the DG has gone through the process.  Firstly it is a Committee that sits to interview and there would be scoring at the points as they interview and you cannot say somebody who has scored very poorly because he is my – he is in my faction …    No sorry about his work would I want this one.  It is never done.  It is the process of the people who are sitting there who might not necessarily be in one grouping politicallybecause they are looking at are we getting the right person.  That process is taken to the – this Committee is small.  What then they recommend finally is taken to the Cabinet Committee and the Cabinet Committee is – is a big Committee. The President, the Deputy President participates in those discussions discussing these very individuals.  Then the Cabinet Committee recommends to the Cabinet that – that person wherever that person started will end up being discussed by the Cabinet to take the final decision.  So I do not know how do you succeed to have your clique with you because these people who are meeting here they mayhave different views about these matters. They are looking at the capability of the candidate and it is discussed there now with the entire Cabinet.  In fact there is a serious debate even discussing individuals in the Cabinet.  Some people would say look this candidate is not right.  I know these are the witnesses’etcetera.  At times the Cabinet will say we are not accepting this candidate.  It is not just like as you – you pick and walk.  The process is thorough.  That is the point I am just making.    No I did not pose a question.    I was just explaining what happens.    Because that’s a universal thing.    Parties cannot take people who have -  who do not like party to come and work for the government of that party, that’s a point I was just making.      No I am not necessarily saying that should be the case, I am saying political parties, globally, once they win elections they take their people to the government to place them, because those people are expected to implement the policies, so loyalty goes without saying, it is not the only, but it does not mean you cannot take somebody who is a professional, who is willing to participate in government.  I was just dealing with it insofar as it appears here as a point that was made.   Yes.    No that’s ...(intervention)     No what I was saying, I was not saying that it should be one of the things that you said for it does not even arise generally in the discussions.   The problems that it is here as if it is a big factor, it is not.     That’s why I – rather than to getinto the details I was saying all parties in the world when they win elections they bring people they trust, people who are loyal to the party, people who have got professions, it’s not a factor, it’s not the only factor.  In fact in the discussions you will find that this issue has never arisen are you loyal to the ANC, you can’t.  That’s why I was saying these are individual views perhaps emanating from individual experiences I don’t know.    No not necessarily.    When for an example advertisements are made for a particular position, many citizens in the country, some of whom we don’t even know they belong to which party or they believe in what policy, they apply and they go through theprocess, no one in that kind of interview ask the political issues, it does not feature, it is as a given.    I think that happened ja.    Yes.    There was no?    Yes, I remember that ja.    I say I remember that.    Well I may not remember the details of who was in the list or not but all I know is that Gama himself had also applied and I know that Mr Gordhan as well so when he withdrew his candidature, and I think the discussion was this – the second one, instead of starting another process, because Gama was known, he had worked there for a long time, his capabilities and everything, and in the process those who were doing the process feltthat here is a man who will fit in into this kind of situation.  There was then I think a bit of a discussion, you know people who wanted that we should have another round or something, but at the end the – this process that I am talking about that many people get involved the view – the view in the process was that but this man we know him, he hasbeen working here, he is capable enough, and then at the end I think there was kind of a stronger view that no let us take the decision that we should take him.It was a process of the discussion, particularly from I think the Cabinet Committee even to the Cabinet, so it was a discussion, it was not one person talking to the other, it was that process I talked about that produced that result.    Because he had applied himself.    Ja, he as far as I remember hehad applied as well for the job, so in a sense in the selection committee I think he was one of those who had applied.    Yes.    Yes, yes, that’s what I remember.    The Minister, the Minister if he or she wants to appoint a DG, she then forms a panel that will be interviewing people.    Ja, an example yes.    Yes, yes, cabinet ministers and deputy ministers as well.    No generally people of the Executive.    Ja.    Not only the DG, even board members.    Even board members.    But the process is the same.    Absolutely.    I’m not sure because the withdrawal of Pravin brought some activities, and I might not have – I may not remember everything, but there was activities, this may be so, it may not, but I cannot remember exactly.    Well I don’t remember exactly now whether – but the name Sipho Maseko I remember, I can’t just remember the background, the details.    Hmm.    Yes I do.    Yes.    May I just read it.    I don’t remember myself saying these things.  How could I have said this when somebody is being charged with serious charges, and I would say no take the person, I don’t remember me insisting on this.    Was?    No, I can’t recall.    It couldn’t be like that, we don’t work like that.  As I say there is a process that determines how becomes either the winning candidate.  When – or what the Ministers attimes do they will come to the President just to brief the President, and only to discuss whether we should do this or not, and I am not even fond of making such determined statements, I would not have said this, not at all.    I think I will say I could not have said this.    No.    Because it means I would also be undermining the process itself, at a level when the Minister consults you might express a view or not, but it does not determine the final decision, because the final decision must be a product of the process.  I would not have said this because I would have been saying this is myperson, finished, it does not work like that.    Not at all.    No I could not have said that.    No.    Absolutely because I would be saying there was no need for discussions.  This is a choice I’ve made finished.  No.  The process doesn’t work like that    I don’t recall this.    Sorry?   Yes there was a time where Mr Gama was accused, I remember the period.  I’m not very sure whether we discussed this, I think it came as just a report about Mr Gama, not a discussion whether we should take him or not.  That’s why I’m saying these answers that are put here that I said them I don’t remember having said this.    No.    In fact it was a well known fact that Gama faced charges, everybody knew in the country.    Yes.   Because the allegations against Gama took a long time.    Yes.   I’ve got difficulties with this report because a consultation that the Ministers do they will be reporting, they will be saying this is what has happened, and me as a Minister this is what I think or the Board this is what the Board thinks, and then is there any other process that is going forward you report that, and from the position of the President you say fine go ahead, when things are okay you would come back.  I don’t remember discussing an individual like Gama to say this cannot happen, this is my choice.  I could not have said so.      Yes.    Okay.   No, normally ministers would come to the President before, it’s not just a thing which perhaps doesnot happen, it does.    Ja, to say the DG I am recommending this one or whatever for the President to know.      They could also engage in the discussion, it is possible.    And the President might have views and say we will check this or whatever, but what I am saying the President can’t say you can’t do this.    Because that decision must be taken by the collective.    Sorry?    Even the State Owned Enterprises they come as well.    Well I’m not sure here because she is now including many people.    Around this name, she knew ...(intervention)     That’s what she is saying.    I don’t know, I don’t know because you don’t meet as an alliance to discuss those matters, those are just government matters.  So I am not sure, as you can see this is really pulling everybody to an issue of a specific government putting the Secretary General and everybody else, we never discuss this with the Secretary General or other Alliance people.  As a Minister maybefrom the human point of view people must have been coming to her, I don’t know.    I’m sure as Minister because they also do consult with the Unions, because at times Unions have views about people who are appointed for the fact that she said people are vocal, it means she has maybe been canvassing or talking to many people.    Yes.   What?    I think I was looking at the process that whatever happened at the end that would be the decision, I did not put my preferences on Gama or whoever.    No in fact in the majority of cases that is what the Ministers do.  To say here is a process.  The board looked at this.  They prefer this one.  The Minister might give some details and it might not give some details to say therefore the process is moving forward.  Boards recommend.  The boards themselves know that their recommendation could be accepted or not accepted by cabinet.  And that there is no process that can be stopped halfway.  It would just be to alert the President about what has happened.  Partly because in the cabinet the President would be chairing most of the time.  The debate would be among the Ministers. Just making the President aware that these are the issues and the Minister could also express her own preference and the reasons why he or she feels this would be the right person.    At times – at times the Minister would give information about others for an example you might say there were so many candidates, this one is one.  The concentration would be on this one.  In the process of the discussion people can say, let us hear number 2, what was he – what was the kind of thing?  Or theMinister could mention it even at the beginning.  In other words it varies how they present the matter.    Yes I remember slightly thatthere was something that had happened between the two.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I remember that.  I do not remember the detail but I remember the incident.    I think there were murmurs about the victimisation whatever.  I do not remember the details but I know that this as I said the Gama thing was a well-known thing in the country.  The problems that he had with the – with the company.  But I cannot remember the details.    I think there was some conclusion but I do not cannot remember exactly how – what was – how the final conclusion was.    Okay.    No I received the report.  It was just a report like all other reports for me to know.   I read it.  I read it.    But it was a report like all other reports.    What page are you in?    4 –     Yes I have got it.    No I have…    I have got it.   Hm.      No I was saying yes there was.    I thought I – I thought I nodded [indistinct].    Oh okay, okay, okay.    Sorry where are you?    426.    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Which one?  I was just looking at the – at page.    Because I mean paragraph.    Page 30 – 3.    428.    Yes.    You can do so.    Is it page – even on the right what you call it.    Oh okay.    Yes okay.   Fine I was looking at the paragraphs.    What is the paragraph?    3…    3.2.5.    Yes, yes.    Yes I think so.    Hm.    Yes.    I think so yes.   Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    (No audible reply).    Okay.    Okay, okay.    Okay.    I think so.    Hm.    Yes.   No, no comment.   Sorry.    I said no comment.    No I do not have an issue. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    I think so.  I think I responded ifI remember.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  There were so many memorandums.    You know – if they come like this unless there is a problem …    Where you could say this – no I cannot move generally.   They – because you are not deciding the final thing.    Let us allow the process to go.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    At times Ministers do not even come.  At times they send the document …   And look at the document.  What is important is that if at all there is a problem I will then indicate that no do not take it to the Cabinet right now …    Until we discuss but generally …    It is just – it is just a formality.    Ja.    No I am saying I am not able to remember …   Because they come all the time (intervenes).    To remember one in the …    Many of them …    Because it is not coming – it is not coming for me to discuss.   It is to say this is what we have done.    The process has come up to this point.    We are now going to the Cabinet.    Normally if I did not for an example say anything the memorandum goes.    If there is anything that is particular I would then say Minister, memorandum so and so there is aproblem I would like to discuss with you …    Or I will discuss the problem.    It does not mean if for an example I did not respond.    Then the – the memorandum does not go.  It goes a process …    Particularly the officials they will be talking more.    For example the official from the Minister will say to the official who deals with the Cabinet things.    Is – is – has the President said anything on this one.    He will say no, no nothing noproblem.  It goes.    I am just saying and there are many.    Where that happens.    I think if we take that process.    It did not necessarily – even if you do not agree with it or not.    It must go to Cabinet.    Yes.   Yes absolutely.    Absolutely.    In this process we do not necessarily write to …    To the Ministers.    Either you ask the Minister to come to say I seek the clarification or so.    Or you talk to the – even to the official …    From the Presidency …    Or the people who are in charge of the Cabinet itself.    The Secretariat.    You say tell Minister so and so there is this kind of an issue.    Maybe we will clarify it in the meeting or whatever.   Unless the matter is more serious …    When the President feels this –this cannot pass.    Simply because the deeper discussion about anything here will be in the Cabinet.    The President at time might feel this one but I should not …    Delay this …    But in the meeting the President will say at his own time.    Minister just clarify this one.    It depends how it goes.    Yes.  It is – it is the Cabinet Secretariat who do the up and down whether the thing must go or not go and whatever.  For the President is to look at the thing.  He wouldbe aware of what is happening.  Also with an aim of guiding the meeting properly and the Secretariat if there is something for an example because they know the process that they do not think it is fine. They could even deal with the department on their own to say please put this right or something …    Or alert the President.    Yes I remember it slightly, ja.  I think there is.  I cannot remember the details in it.   There was a protocol.    No.  No comment.   Yes I think there was this …    Provision, ja.    I think so.    Yes I said so.    Hm.    Ja, it …    It would.  It would apply as well.    Paragraph?    400-and …?   Ja, I am there.   No I do not – I do not remember.  As I said earlier if the report comes in the majority of cases for the President to – to understand and read the report but not necessarily to respond at all material times because that – the report does not end with the President.  The reports are - the final area of looking at the report is the Cabinet.    Chair I’m sorry, I’m sorry to make this interruption.  I have a problem.    I have a problem because I am being made to go through the details that are the details of the officials and expected to remember every other detail on the work that generally is done by the DG’s and the officials.  The, the, the question this morning, we have gone into those details.  I have a problem because Iam not an officer or cabinet secretary, those who take minutes etcetera.    The manner in which I think I’m being asked questions on the details that I cannot even remember properly, because I was not working with those details.  Now naturally this will have its own results, the results that would make the Commission to take some conclusions.  Now I thought there are serious issues or policy issues that one could be bogged down to deal with.  Now if we take this document either the DG or the Secretary forCabinet or something they would know everybody – they worked on it, and I am not sure about the purpose of me having to remember where the i’s were dotted and the t’s were crossed.    I hear you Chair, I hear you, but my problem does not go away.    For an example the allegation as put forward by the Minister is that I interfered.    I don’t know what does that mean, I don’t know, because a President talks to his ministers about the work they do.  I don’t understand what is it, if for example there were to be an appointment of an officer, they consult with the President the President might have views insofar as discussing that thing.  I don’t understand this very broad word “he interfered”, in what way?     We are not getting for example that point.  We are going to paragraph one line I don’t understand, that’s my problem.    Chair the allegation is that thePresident interfered, and she makes the statement which I have – I mean responded to.    I would have never said so, because I don’t as a President, I can’t say I want this and it succeeds because it is going to go through the processes, even if I talked to her.  No matter what was the end of the discussion, the matter is going to a discussion which will determine even if – just for argument sake I had a view that view might not work at the end.  Now I have answered the question that I never said that.  That must be the understanding of theCommission.Now if we go through the details I just have a problem, because I am no longer dealing with that allegation as it were.    Chair my problem you see if she said I came and I said (indistinct) with this one, it is my only candidate.   And I didn’t do so, these matters where you take the decision it is at the cabinet.  In the Cabinet all members including the President has a right to express a view in the Cabinet.  Now that’s why I’m saying I have a problem with the – if I’m looking for that or the Commission is looking for that kind of thing, that now I must go through the detailed page by page, paragraph by paragraph.    Chair I hear you and I appreciate what you say.   I am being really cross-examined, very thoroughly on the details and I don’t know what will be the outcome of that.    Sorry?    No I was just making the verysame point that if we are looking on that particular allegation you know as I was – like dealing with her report insofar as what happened in the conference of the ANC for an example about groups or cliques or whatever.  I said she is expressing her own views here, and these are matters that even any ordinary ANC member will take issue with that, inthe manner in which she has written her stuff here.Now I’m saying if I go through all of that and the Commission is not taking my answer to the question whether I interfered or not, even if I’ve given the answer we will still go to the details.  For me what other answer must I give that will make the Commission to be satisfied, is it to go to the details in one form or the other?    But the details Chair they will include me not remembering these details because they are not even mind and I don’t know what would you do where I perhaps am saying I cannot remember, I cannot comment, you will weigh all of that, that ismy point.    If you made me to go through every other thing here which it could not be my, (indistinct) of my activities, and that is why I have got a worry. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  Chair as I said I am sorry to break what I promised.    I do think this is problematic.     We get a list of names of people that are going to be – well whose evidence is going to be dealt with, right?    Andy my client has to deal with Mr Maseko and it moves to Barbara Hogan.  And when we dealing with Barbara Hogan my learned friend goes back to – I think it is a problem.      Because I think – I think we need to have a structure about what we doing.    It is quite difficult because we think we done with a name and it is back.  I just – it is a – I think it is a procedure [indistinct].    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.   We may have made a mistake Chair because we saw a list.     We were quite keen to move to Minister Gordhan.    Quite quickly.    But – and the name was shifted.   But it is fine we – I think the Chair is making a reasonable…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes [indistinct] [mumbling] structure there is nothing but I will take what the Chair suggests.    Chair.    This is – this is poor.  This is really poor.     I know you said Chair I cannot tell you about your jobs but I will now.    Chair this is …    I must say this is poor.    This witness right comes here – you have Annexure D which tells you what the process is.  This is no expert in those processes.  You have it in Annexure D in your document and you are told by the Minister.  I do not think it is fair to ask someone who was head of state to explain to you the process of selecting people when you have the document that tells you from the right person.  I donot think it is fair to this witness.    Then Chair if I may ask?    What has that got to do with fraud andcorruption?    Chair I do not know.  This is really poor.  He – he has told you what he – that he could not have said it.  We have spent 35 minutes on a question my client has answered and he is – you are asking him – you are not asking him what – whether he wanted a deviation.  He is being asked about how does the process unfold.  You have a document that tells you that.    Okay thanks Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Who would ordinarily sit on the Deployment Committee Mr Zuma?    Who would ordinarily sit on the Deployment Committee?  Is it appointees of the party?  Is it people who fulfil particular posts?  Can you assist us there?   Would the sitting President sit on the Deployment Committee?    One more general point by way of introduction Mr Zuma.  Does the Deployment Committee involve itself with the appointment of Boards of SOEs or Board Members of SOEs, Senior Executives in SOEs as well as appointments in Government Departments?  As well as Government Departments?    Well an appointment to a Head of a Government Department for example.  Would that be something that might fall within the …    Jurisdiction or ambit of the activities …    Of the deployment?   At paragraph 23 on page 404 Ms Hogan expressed some views - quite firm views in fact on the usefulness of the Deployment Committee and the effectiveness in effect    Yes.    No I understand.   I just want to take a step back and explain why these questions are being asked because it is a matter of concern or a matter that is part of the issue that this Commission is investigating and that is how senior appointments in SOEs take placebut let us move on.  She says that – in paragraph 23 in the second    Yes I understand that.    What I think she is saying insubstance is that the Deployment Committee would inevitable favour for appointment to important positions in SOEs persons who are close to or members of the ruling party and close to or members of Alliance structures.  That there is a – there is a bias in their favour in the activities of the Deployment Committee in the process.  I think that is what she is saying.    Do I understand from what you are saying that the Deployment Committee would consider as an important attribute for appointment to Senior Executive positions and Boards the ability or willingness of a candidate to implement policies of the ruling party.  Is that correct?    Chair as I understand the purpose of certainly this tranche of questions and answers Mr Zuma is in a unique position given his history and association with leadership in this country over the past many years to assist us in this and I would not want to confine the questions and answers to the precise wording.  It isan issue that is raised and we might narrow the questions and answers to closely if we simply …    Deal with the precise wording and opinion of Ms Hogan.  We are interested in this investigation in how the President can – former President can assist us and understanding the issue of deployment.    Thank you Chair.  If I could just then attempt to understand your evidence in relation to the activities of the Deployment Committee in appointments that we have discussed.  Your emphasis is not so much as I understand it on closeness or Membership of the ANC.  Your emphasis is on an ability and willingness to implement the policies of the ruling party in those posts.  Have I gotit correct?    Is that correct?    Thank you.    She says in the last sentence of    Yes.    Just to summarise then.  As I understand what you have said Mr Zuma about the issue of loyalty is that loyalty is an indicator of the willingness and ability to implement the policies of the ruling party.  Do I understand your evidence correctly?   Is it part of it?    Alright.  Can we move on then to what is said in paragraphs 24 and 25?  I am not sure it is appropriate to enter into an historical debate about the issues raised by Ms Hogan in paragraphs 24 and 25 and I will try and summarise it and if you wish to take your time to read those paragraphs please do so but what she has said is that after the Polokwane Conference which she describes asdivisive there were factions within the ANC and these factional battles as she calls them in the ANC had an effect on who was appointed.  She    Okay.    I am about to move to a new topic. It is 14 minutes past.  Is this a convenient time?    In relation to SOE board appointments do I understand it correctly…    Chair to just make one comment from the legal team’s point of view on this issue.    At the beginning of this commission you made it public that its task and the task of the investigators and the legal team was to try and understand in relation to its terms of reference what happened.   To try and understand how it happened.    And to make recommendations inregard to the correction or assurance that it – whatever is found to have happened ultimately in your recommendations would not happen again.    The appointment of persons to state owned entities is an integral part of all three legs of that inquiry.  It is something which is being debated intensely up to now by other witnesses and it is something that the former President with his knowledge and experience can assist with and I am quite sure he is willing to assist with it.  He is not being accused of anything in thatprocess.      In any event Mr Zuma if we may continue.  In paragraph 36 the deponent to this affidavit Ms Hogan raises another concern about Mr Gama’s candidacy and it was a report that he had been engaged in a contractual relationship with a cabinet colleague Mr Nyanda.  Did you know anything about this allegation at the time?    Yes.    And do you recall that there were allegations about the propriety or lawfulness of those engagementsbetween Mr Nyanda and Mr Gama.    Do you recall anything about – you do?    She goes on in paragraph 37 to say   Alright.  She does note in paragraph39 on page 408 that Mr Gama was later found guilty of unwarranted criticism of Transnet executives a charge serious enough to warrant dismissal.  I do not what to go into the details of the inquiry and the charges but that is what she says.  Do you recall that there was a guilty finding in relation to Mr Gama’s inquiry?   I think to assist you it will become clearer later so we can park that for the moment.    She says in paragraph 40 on page 408. “On or about 28 July 2009 I sent President Zuma a comprehensive report attached hereto marked D withannexures detailing the selection process.  The strong motivation for the appointment of the candidate that had been recommended to me by the Transnet board.Details of the procurement irregularities under investigation by the Transnet Audit Committee.  The Corporate Governant aspects of CEO appointments in including the legal opinions prepared by Mr Michael Katz and Advocate Wim Trengrove SC in this regard.  However President Zuma did not respond.”Did you recall receiving such a report?  Would you have read it or would a subordinate of yours have read it and advised you?  What would the position have been?    Right.  And did you note it, did you read it or did you ask somebody to advise you about it.    Right.    Right.  Paragraph 40 – the report itself is at page 422 of bundle GG[b], Exhibit GG[b] and it is headed Decision Memorandum.  It is addressed to you as President from Ms Barbara Hogan.  It is dated the 28 July 2009.   422 – red 422.    I am sorry I thought you were looking at it.    Thank you.    Let us leave aside the legal advice contained in the report for the moment.  We may return to it if it is necessary or you want to but there is a summary of the report at page 423 which says in paragraph 2.1 “Following the resignation of Ms Ramos the boardinitiated a CEO recruitment process to ensure continuity in Transnet business operations. As a consequence of the withdrawal of the boards unanimously recommended preferred candidate Mr Pravin Gordhan it says it should not be the board extended its search for a suitable candidate and has now recommended a further preferred candidate with two other short listed preferred candidates for appointment as CEO.”    He is still reading.    I am sorry did you not – I missedthat.    Thank you.   Thank you.    Sorry.  It is just that the record would not pick up a nod.    We may be filmed for other reasons but not for that reason.  In paragraph 3.13 she summarises the object   Page 426 paragraph 3.13.    I am sorry I …    426, red 426 paragraph 3.13.    Do you have it Mr Zuma?    Yes.  She says   That is in very, very broad summary the process.    And I think you have agreed to that.   She then details the recruitment and selection process of the CEO of Transnet that was followed and she goes into some detail in paragraph 3.2.2 of the type of procedures conducted in such a process by the board’s corporate governance and nominations committee.  Probably not necessary to go into any detail but just to remark that there is a thorough process of examination of candidates on a number of criteria.  You note that.    And that is in accordance with yourown understanding?    The paragraph 3.2 various candidates are mentioned including Mr Gama and several others and then in paragraph 3.2.4 by way of background there is a recordal thatthe board unanimously recommended Mr Pravin Gordhan.  But I would like to go to the next page if I may?  Because we know that his    I am sorry.  Page 428.    If you want the first paragraph.     428.    Are you holding me to that DCJ?    Yes may I read it to – perhaps I should go…    Yes correct Chair.    Paragraph 3.2.5 on page …   Red 427.  I am going to read it. “In addition…    Alright.    3.2.5.    On the bottom of page red 427.    Do you have it?    It reads   Right.    That sentiment is repeated in    And then it concludes – well a conclusion in paragraph 3.2.12 on page 429. “After the interviews were conducted the corporategovernance and nominations committee recommended three preferred candidates who could fill the position of CEO namely Mr Sipho Maseko, Mr Tau Morwe and Mr Kgomotso Phihlela with full and unanimous support of the Transnet board recommended Mr Sipho Maseko for appointment as CEO.” And then it goes into the reasons why he was recommended.  Were you aware of that recommendation?    Then there is a section of the report addressed to you dealing with the further processes particularly those conducted on Transnet’s behalf by Ernst and Young and others in relation to various matters relevant to the board’s conclusion.  And if    Paragraph 4 – page 433.    Paragraph 3.4.1.  Do you have it?     “As executive authority and shareholder representative of the state it is incumbent upon the Minister of Public Enterprises to exercise the rights of the shareholder to appoint the CEO of Transnet ingeneral meeting.  In keeping with company law and corporate good governance codes such as King3 it is important that the shareholder engages in a meaningful and constructive fashion with the board in selecting a CEO to the lead a company – to lead the company.” Do you have comment on that?  Would you agree with that sentiment?
