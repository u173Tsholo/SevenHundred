CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Kennedy, good morning everybody.    Yes are we ready?    Oh.  What page?    Yes I have got it.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    The affidavit of Mr Talib Sadik starting at page 665 is admitted as Exhibit W26.1 together with its annexures.    Yes okay.  Please administer the oath.  Good morning Mr Mantsha.  Good morning.  Yes.    Thank you; you may be seated.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Cilliers would you like to place yourself on record just from where you are?    Yes.  Thank you very much Mr Cilliers.  Yes Mr Kennedy.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes no that is fine.  Mr Mantsha you may address me.  Yes you may do so.    June/July 2015.    And maybe – maybe before I forget do feel free to hand them to the legal team so that they can assess them and at the right time they can make them available to me.    Yes.    Yes okay alright.    Okay alright.    Okay.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    No, no, no that is fine.  I understood him also to be feeling free to hand them in but I just thought it is better that the legal team sees them first before they get to me.  Ja.    Yes Okay.      Yes.     You say, the former...?     CE?     Oh, okay.     Which minister was that?     Which minister was that one?  The Minister of Communication that you are advising?  Who was it?     Would it not have been Ms Faith Muthambi?     H’m.  Okay.     Okay.     Thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Mantsha.  I just want to say maybe two things arising out of your evidence because what you have been doing is giving evidence about your experiences and those of your board during your time and your understanding and your perspectives of what happened in regard to certain matters.   The one is the one you just mentioned namely to what extent politicians – maybe political issues might sometimes interfere with commercial decisions or with business at state owned enterprises and – so that is something that one may need to look at, what form it takes and what impact does it have on a business, when does it happen and so on.   A former Chairperson of one of the SOEs gave evidence here some weeks back and said to me oh, I know these politicians, oh no, these ministers, you know, they like, you know, coming into the SOEs because they look for business opportunities and he said I know them, I have, you know, been around, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So one does not know, what one wishes is that SOEs be run in a manner that would make them sustainable and profitable so that they can, you know, fulfil their roles.  But that is the one part. The other part I want to mention is, you see, it is a pity that sometimes people do not come to the Commission to give the Commission information about matters that are relevant to the Commission because if we get told one side of the story and we never get told the other side or another side then we will decide on the basis of one side.  We will make findings on the basis of one side of the story but we want to hear all sides of the story.  Everybody knows how from 2018 I have for a long time been making public announcements to invite everybody who has got information that is relevant to the Commission to please come forward, give us information.  Some people did come forward, others did not come, others came late, so there are those things.  So I have no doubt that when the Commission finishes its work there would still be many people who do have information that should have been given to the Commission but who did not come forward, you know, which is unfortunate but, you know, we can only do so much. Now I am raising that because it is also relevant to your evidence in Denel because Mr Salugee gave evidence last year, you know, and you will remember that the Commission wanted to get statements from you and information to hear the board’s side of the story.  You know, we said please, here are statements from Mr Salugee, see what he says about you and the board, give us your affidavit because we want to hear the whole story.  I do not want to go into it but we struggled.  We struggled. Now, of course, you are here now, we are happy that you are here but the only thing that is unfortunate is if we had got maybe some of the information or your side of the story last year it could have given us a lot of time to investigate certain matters.  When we get it now we are close to the tail end of our work, some of the investigators have left, so it might not be so easy to do the kind of investigation that we would have liked to do into some of the matters that you may raise, you see?   For example, I may be mistaken but I do not remember that when Mr Salugee gave his evidence he talked about – I may be mistaken, he talked about the issue of the loan that you are talking about was it with Nedbank?     Which I think you say was at the centre of their suspension and so on.  Now he may have spoken – maybe I have forgotten but it is quite an important matter to look at because it deals with the question of were the suspensions based on allegations of wrongdoing on their part, of failure to do their job properly or were the suspensions based on something else and the impression one got when evidence was given before and when evidence gets given, you know, recently, is towards the view that it was something else, you see?  But we do not hear your side of the story we will not hear about those allegations, you see?  And we will form whatever view based on what is before us whereas if people come forward and say here is another side of the story, that helps us because we want to hear all sides of the story.  There is no such that you do not want to hear.  So you understand that?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes. MR     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  No, that is fine.  Thank you, Mr Mantsha.  Mr Kennedy?     Yes.     Yes, I think, Mr Mantsha, Mr Kennedy seeks to establish whether you are in a position to answer questions based on this affidavit.  So, in other words, you remember what you said or whether you need to refresh your memory or not?     Yes, okay.     Ja.     Ja.  No, that is fine.     Yes, when you are too far it will not be recorded – your answers will not be recorded.     Eyesight?     Is it the light or just eyesight?     Oh, is it?     Is it too dark there?     Oh, okay, okay.     Oh.     Or when you answer you can move forward a little bit and then move back.  Okay, alright.     Ja, maybe we should adjourn for ten minutes or so, I do not know.  Do you need time to refresh?     As we go along.     Well, the only concern is whether that is not going to slow us down anyway.  I think maybe let us take the tea break.  Let us take tea break.  What do you think, Mr Kennedy?     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Is 15 minutes, 20 minutes fine, Mr Mantsha, to go through them?     Okay, let us make it twenty minutes, that takes us to twenty five past and my watch says about five past.     Ja, okay.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, you were able to go through the affidavits Mr Mantsha?     Okay, alright, thank you.  Mr Kennedy?     I am sorry, maybe let’s do it this way Mr Kennedy and Mr Mantsha.  Maybe let us say, let us do it this way you asked Mr Mantsha whether the – once you have confirmed his signature and he deposed to the affidavit before a Commissioner of Oaths you ask him whether the contents are true, then he can say, Mr Mantshe you can say they are true and correct except certain corrections that you will make in due course, during your evidence.  Then when Mr Kennedy deals with that then you can say in that paragraph here is what should be corrected and this is what it would say.     I think let’s do it that way, in that way we can get the affidavits submitted and then we start with questions.     Ja, ja.     The affidavit/statement of Mr Lugisani Daniel Mantsha starting at page 330 is admitted as Exhibit W22.1.     You don’t want us to finish with this?     Ja.     The statements/affidavit of Mr Lugisani Daniel Mantsha starting at page 337 is admitted as Exhibit WW22.2.     Look at the black numbers.     H’m.     The affidavits/statement of Mr Lugisani Daniel Mantsha starting at page 342 is admitted as Exhibit W22.3     I am sorry Mr Kennedy, well I am not sure Mr Mantsha whether there was any misunderstanding between yourself and Mr Kennedy in terms of what he sought to establish.  I understand you Mr Kennedy to seek to establish whether Mr Mantsha was confirming that what Minister Brown told the public about him was correct?     Yes, now that may be important Mr Mantsha because this was a statement where you were being appointed to a State owned entity, the public wants to know the people who are being appointed and the Minister tells the public certain things about those people and the public might say well those people are experienced so we have comfort, or they might say but these people have no experience, so I think it is important for you to be able to say if there is something that is not accurate that the Minister said in the statement about you, or if you say no there is nothing inaccurate then it is fine, but I think the public would be concerned if the Minister has told them who you are and what experience you have and then you are not able to either confirm or say no she got something wrong.     Correct, okay, alright.     I am sorry Mr Kennedy.   It will be important in due course to compare Mr Mantsha’s description of Denel’s position when the Board that he chaired came in with for example what I was told by Mr Mhlontlo, because I did ask him what the position of Denel financially was when he and the other executives were suspended, because they were suspended within about three months or so after the new board had come in.     That would be important in due course to compare and see if it sit he same.     Ja, okay.    Yes this is what…    Because the paragraph you wanted to correct here.     Would you remember, more or less, when you met them for the first time?     Yes.     Maybe just the year.     Oh, around 2014?     Okay.     I am sorry.  I am not sure that your answered the question.  I think the question was whether Mr Salugee ever disclosed to you anything improper that Mr Salim Essa may have or the Gupta’s may have asked of him.     Yes, okay.     Oh, okay.  Then ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay.     I...  Certainly, we do not want to speculate, number one but number two, the question or your previous question that Mr Kennedy had asked, I think was legitimate to say, did Mr Salugee ever share with you or report to you what he has told this Commission had happened, namely that Mr Tony Gupta sought to get him to agree to take money.  So that was a legitimate question, to     Okay alright.       Well, let me ask you this question.  I have seen how you have dealt with that meeting in your affidavit.  I think you said you were asked to make comments and you had no comments because you did not even know what LMT was at that stage and all of that.  Did you have any appreciation of why you were asked to attend that meeting?     So, I just want to make sure I understand this.  Are you saying that there had been a discussion between yourself and Mr Salugee along those lines on how to handle these requests for meetings by certain people from the outside people?  Or are you saying there had been a discussion between the two of you? MR     We, being yourself and Mr Salugee?     Okay.     Now I may be misunderstand.  I thought that that meeting was quite early in your term.  Actually, when Mr Salugee gave evidence, the impression I have of his evidence is that the meeting – I think he spoke about two meetings if I am not mistaken that he said he had attended at the Gupta residence in which you were present.  I may be mistaken.   But the first one, at least, if there were two.  He said Mr Salim Essa was the first person to tell him about you being the new chairperson of the new board.   I think he said, actually, Mr Salim Essa put it to him on the basis that he wanted Mr Salugee to meet the new person or somebody who is going to be the new chairperson of the board or a new chairperson of the board.   But certainly, I gained the impression that one, he did not know, heard of being told by Mr Salim Essa that you were going to be the new chairperson or you were already the new chairperson of the board.  That is the impression I got from his affidavit which you have read.  I do not know whether you got the same impression.     Even before the meeting in which involved Mr Salem Essa, yourself and Mr Salugee?     Or you might not recall?     Or you might not recall the sequence.     Is your recollection that your first interaction of him was independent from Mr Salim Essa?     Or you cannot remember?     It was independent of Mr Salim Essa?     Yes.     They knew each other.     Yes.     Yes. MR     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m.     Ja.     H’m.     Okay.  Mr Kennedy.       I think he said there were some that he – there are occasions when he travelled in his personal capacity …[intervenes]     And there were occasions when he travelled in his capacity as Chairperson of the board.     Is that right?     What page?     Yes.     Well, I think the problem, Mr Cilliers, is that the witness did not say he wanted to explain his answer to this question, he said he wants to explain about I think where he is getting to, or something like that.  I think that is where the problem lies.  If he wants to explain his answer to that question, it is fine and if then he later on asks a question that he thinks where he is going, then at that time he can answer and explain and, of course, in due course in re-examination you can pick it up and get him to explain whatever might not have been clarified.  I think – unless I did not hear him correctly, I think that is where the problem is.  If he wants to clarify his answer to this question, no problem, but I think he nods, I think that is – if that is that, there is no problem, but I think he was saying I think I know where Mr Kennedy is going and I want to clarify it before he gets there.     But in the end he will get a chance to clarify whatever he wants to clarify, it is just a question of timing.     Let me go back to the witness.  What did you want to do, Mr Mantsha?     You wanted to give context to your answer?     To the question.     Okay, alright.  I think you can do that.     That is Ashu who?     Trowler.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Ja.     No, no, that is fine.  I think that related to the question, it was a context to the question.     We are five past, Mr Kennedy.     Ja.     Ja, I think we should adjourn.  I am sorry to everybody that we cannot continue and finish but I have spoken to Mr Kennedy and to Mr Cilliers, we will make arrangements for Mr Mantsha to come back and to continue and finish.  That will be arranged in due course.     Thank you very much, we are going to adjourn for the day.     We adjourn. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good morning Chair.    We are ready thank you Chair.  But before we call or ask leave to call the next witness Chair may I raise a point that follows from yesterday’s proceedings?  You will recall our first witness yesterday was Mr Sadik a current acting GCEO of the Denel group and he undertook to provide by way of an affidavit the settlement agreement that was concluded between Denel and Ms Africa the former Company Secretary of Denel. That undertaking has now been fulfilled and he has provided an affidavit.  May I take you in Bundle 12 – Denel Bundle 12 the support staff have taken the liberty of inserting into Bundle 12.    The affidavit.  It is at page 665.    That is a very brief affidavit from Mr Sadik.    The one he promised yesterday.  And attached to that is a document headed Notification of Termination of Service.  And following that from page 669 is the actual termination of employment agreement.  This is the settlement agreement that he referred to.   And if I may draw your attention Chair in particular to page 676 paragraph 7.1 sets out the package equivalent to twelve months salary, an ex gratia amount of R1.6 odd million  so it is R1. – yes R1.642 million.    In her case.    May we then ask leave to have that admitted formerly as an Exhibit in the commission?  Mr Sadik’s affidavit was previously admitted as Exhibit W26 we would ask the – leave for this affidavit with its annexures from page 665 to be admitted as Exhibit W26.1.    Thank you Chair.  May we then ask your leave to call our next witness?  It is Mr Mantsha.    Thank you Chair.  May I direct your attention to the fact that Mr Mantsha is today assisted by a legal team of our learned friend Mr Jaap Cilliers.    From the Pretoria Bar instructed by attorneys Denga.    Thank you Chair.  My learned friend has requested an opportunity for the witness to address you briefly in some introductory remarks.    Where is subject to your guidance and ruling. We have no objection to that.    It is our process.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, may we start by just requesting your leave to introduce formally into the evidence the affidavits that Mr Mantsha has provided.     Mr Mantsha, do you have Denel bundle 8 in front of you?     Sorry, would you just speak into the microphone rather than nodding?     Yes, you have that.     Just remember it has to be recorded and transcribed possibly in the future.     So please do not just nod, try and bear in mind that.     If I can take you please to page 330 and the page numbers are printed in black at the top left hand corner.  It is not the pages on the right hand corner,  in red.  Okay?  And I am simply going to give the last three digits of this rather long number which starts Denel 08.  Have you got page 330?     And that appears to be – what is referred to as a statement but in fact appears to have been an affidavit.  If I can take you to page 336, is that your signature?     Sorry, there are two signatures.  The top signature, is that yours?     Well, let me just complete my questions first before you do that.     You signed this in front of Commissioner of Oaths after taking the affirmation, is that right?     Right.  What is it you want to raise about the affidavit?     Are you referring to page 331 paragraph 5?  Mr Mantsha, are you referring to that paragraph?     Yes.  You have raised this presumably because there is – you have reflected on the correctness of this affidavit and picked up that there may be an error relating to your allegation that Mr Burger attended a breakfast at Melrose Arch, is that right?     Right.     I see.  So is it incorrect where you said that Mr Burger also attended that meeting?     Okay.  So you would need to delete     May I ask you with your legal team’s assistance please, would you be willing to sign a further supplementary affidavit to correct that?     Alright and will you provide that to the Commission please?     And we will then furnish that to the Chairperson through the formal processes of having it admitted.  Is there any other problem that you have picked up in relation to this affidavit?  Have you been through this affidavit in preparation for this hearing together with your legal team?     I see.  You want an opportunity to read through it because you want to check it now?     Yes.  Is there anything else you want to draw the attention because what I am trying …[intervenes]     I understand that, I am just trying to go through the formal process of getting you to confirm under oath here that the affidavit is correct.  I accept that there may be some details you cannot always remember but that Is not my question.  The affidavit was signed fairly recently.  If we look at page 336, it was signed on the 28 August 2020, is that correct?     Now you have, to your credit, drawn attention to a point of detail that you felt needs to be corrected and that is the Melrose Arch breakfast and that Mr Burger was not in attendance and we thank you for that.  Otherwise, can we take it that you are – you confirm, as you did before Commissioner of Oaths in August 2020 that the affidavit is true and correct?     Right.  Please do not sit too far away from the microphone, Mr Mantsha.     I can understand, the documents have to be a bit of a distance from you.     Can I perhaps suggest respectfully that – yes, you either move the microphone or move yourself and if you need to put the documents above the desk then perhaps that will help.     Alright, thank you.  So do you confirm that the affidavit subject to the correction about Mr Burger and the Melrose Arch breakfast the contents are true and correct?  Mr Mantsha, you are attorney, is there a difficulty with the question?  I am asking you can you confirm that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct?     I see.     Yes, thank you, Chair, it is pity that he did not read it beforehand.     But bet it as it may.     Yes perhaps – these affidavits are extremely brief.     I think there are three affidavits he will need to read, they are all – the next one is, for example, a page and a half and the next one a few pages.     Perhaps we can take a tea adjournment and you can read through them.     Thank you.     No, twenty five past.  Thank you, Chair.     Thank you Chair.   Thank you for doing so Mr Mantsha.  So if we’re looking at page 330 – I’m  sorry just give me a second, yes page 330, have you been through that affidavit?     And apart from the correction you have already made reference to on the next page, paragraph 5, to Mr Burger, having to be deleted there, apart from that, can you confirm now under oath that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct? MR      Yes, Chair can I just so that we have some bit of framework for how we are going to deal with it, are you going to add to something?       Okay I prefer you not to add to anything at this stage.     Oh I thought you said yes when I asked you.     Make a correction, that’s fine, yes, paragraph?     Yes we have dealt with that, what else?     Paragraph 7, yes?     Sorry, before you move from that I don’t understand, you said you wanted to make a correction rather than adding something, is there a correction here, is there something wrong here?     Thank you Chair.     Yes, we can then make some progress, thank you Chair.     Thank you for the guidance.   Mr Mantsha are you happy to proceed on that basis?      Right, so subject to any changes you  may want to indicate in the course of your oral evidence at this stage are you happy to confirm that subject to that the contents are true and correct?     Right thank you.  Chair may we then ask leave to have this affidavit at page 330 admitted as an exhibit in Bundle Denel 8 as Exhibit W22.1.     Thank you Chair.  May we then proceed Mr Mantsha to the next affidavit in the bundle, it is  at page 337 to 338, it is a two page affidavit.  Is that your signature as the first signature on page 338?     And that was signed in front of a Commissioner of Oaths on the 28 t h of August 2020, correct?     Have you been during the tea adjournment through this affidavit?     Are there any corrections you want to draw attention to now or will you deal with anything further in the course of your oral evidence that you would like to?     You will deal with corrections later?    Subject to that do you confirm that the contents are true and correct?      Right and your third affidavit I believe is at page 342.    I beg your pardon, quite so Chair, thank you.       May we ask then leave to have that admitted as Exhibit W22.2.     Thank you Chair, and there is a third affidavit Mr Mantsha that you will find at page 342.  At page 345 it appears to be your signature at the top, is that correct?     Two, sorry, five, 345 there appears to be your signature at the top.  345 Mr Mantsha, do you have 345 on the top left.     Is that your signature at the top Mr Mantsha?     Thank you.  Again subject to the same qualifications that you may want to add or correct at a later stage subject to that you confirm the contents of this affidavit?     Thank you.  Chair may we then ask formally for leave to admit this affidavit from page 342 in Bundle 8, as Exhibit W22.3.    Thank you Chair.   Now Mr Mantsha in the opening statement that you gave you indicated that at a certain stage in 2015 you were appointed as Chairperson of the Board of Denel, correct?     And you served for how long?     Your appointment, can I take you in this bundle to page 422, this is Minister Lynne Brown’s public statement relating to your appointment as part of the new board.  Do you have that?     Two.    So it was on the 24 t h of July 2015 the Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown made the following, made a public announcement where she says following cabinet approval, she has rotated the Board of Denel, Mr Daniel Mantsha is appointed as the non-executive, as a non-executive director and as the Chairperson of the Board with effect from 24 July 2015 for a three year period.  So you would ordinarily in terms of the three year appointment have carried on until the 23 r d of July 2018, is that right?     But you didn’t – sorry may I just ask you please not to sit too far back from the microphone.  Thank you.   I know these things can be a bit tedious but I am afraid I just have to remind you otherwise we could have problems with the recording.     Thank you very much.   So did you resign, I think you said in February 2018?   Is that right?     Right, so you didn’t serve out the full period of the three years, you resigned a few months before the end of that three year period, is that right?     And why was that?     Was it personal reasons?    And then Lynne Brown, the Minister then sets out at the foot of the page a brief summary of the profiles of the non-executive directors being as follows;  “Mr Mantsha obtained a BJuris in 1991 and LLB in 1993, both from the University of Venda.  He is an attorney who has acquired valuable experience over the years in Corporate Finance, Transactional Advising, Business Management, Commercial Law, Media and Communication Law, Administrative and Constitutional Law.” Does that accurately provide the facts as to very briefly your background?     Yes so I am asking you whether it is accurate?     You can’t comment on whether she has been correct in saying for example you have got a B Juris and an LLB, surely you would know.     Well is there anything wrong in what she has said?     These kind of things?    Right, and in addition to what she has set out of course you had acted as an advisor to the then Communication Minister, Ms Faith Muthambi, correct, you told the Chair that earlier.      Right, it refers to you having apart from your experience and ...[intervenes]      Yes I did ask that question.     Alright thank you.  Of course this was a very brief summary of some of the main points, no points there are other facts relating to your experience and so forth, one being that you had been the advisor to the previous communications minister, Faith Muthambi.  Were you the legal advisor or a special advisor or a policy advisor to Minister Muthambi?     I see, and just by way of background, have you ever previously managed a commercial business or a State owned business or served as Chairperson of the Board of any such business?     Your own business meaning what – your attorneys firm or commercial businesses?     Right, okay and then she refers to some of your areas of expertise such as communication law, media law, administrative and constitutional law.  Have you also had experience in labour law?  Have you also had experience in labour law?     Thank you.  Alright while we are at this page I would just like to note something that Minister     So you arrived as a new broom as it were in Denel as the Chairperson at Denel.     There were some others that had crossed over from the previous board to the new board, Minister Brown refers to that earlier on, it is actually Mr Johannes Motseke being reappointed for purposes of continuity. So you arrive at somebody new in the organisation of Denel.  Are you able to tell the Chair please overall what was the state of Denel both as a business in general and in particularly in relation to financing when you took over as its Board Chairperson in 2015?     Thank you.  Now may I take you in the same bundle, bundle 8, to page 330 which is your first affidavit.     Yes.    We will do so thank you Chair.     Mr Mhlontlo – I beg your pardon, Mr Mantsha if I can direct your attention please to page 330 that’s your first affidavit, that you signed as we saw on the 28 t h of August 2020, was that at the request of the Commission?  Did you sign the affidavit at the request of the Commission?   Right and that is after as I understand it that the Commission sent you a Rule 33 notice directing your attention to what Salugee had said in his affidavits, correct?      Right thank you, and if you look at     Yes.     Sorry I am not sure that you followed the question, we are at page 331, correct?    In your affidavit, this is what you signed, you say 4 at paragraphs 89 to 90, do you see the heading?      And you say    And it is 89 to 90 I am simply wanting to establish, that is 89 to 90 as numbered in Mr Salugee’s affidavit, correct?    Right, and so it goes on for the rest of your affidavit.  So – and the Commission thanks you, or the legal team thanks you for providing this affidavit in response to the Rule 33 Notice, and then if I can take you please – and sorry, then at page 335 of the same affidavit you are referring to a further statement of Mr Salugee and you give your response to that, correct?     Right.  Then your next affidavit, we will get back to the contents, some of the contents of that at a later stage, I am just getting out of the way some – just the sequence of  how it was done and the formalities. 337 is your next very brief affidavit, again also signed on the 28 t h of August 2020, and this time in     Right, then we have at page 339 a letter from the Commission itself in the person of its Secretary, Professor Musala, you see that at page 341?     And that was dated as recently as 7 t h October 2020 so about five or six weeks ago and that requested you to provide by the specified dates you will see in paragraph 2 an affidavit to respond to the questions set out in paragraph 4 below, and give your full version in relation thereto, and then there are a number of questions set out at page 340, paragraph 4A to G, do you see that?    And just by way of example paragraph    Is that right?   And you responded to that in your latest affidavit at page 342, is that right?      And we see at page 345 that that was signed by you in front of the Commissioner of Oaths on the 14 t h of October 2020, which is about a week after the letter was dated?      Right, so it was specifically a response to that request, correct?     While we are at it you were asked of course to provide a full version to justify the decisions.   Now we looked at the affidavit at page 342, am I correct in suggesting to you that this is a very brief affidavit?      Yes.  And it gives very little detail not so?   For example let’s take you to page 343, paragraph 7, you were asked to justify the decision relating to the formation of Denel Asia and you simply say it is set out in both the PFMA Section 52, 54[2] pre-notification of Section 51[1][g], you had nothing to add to those documents is that right?     Yes, and then you attached, helpfully you attached the documents that you referred to as Annexures A and B to your affidavit, correct?     And we find those from page 347, is that right?     Now an indulgence was granted to you at your and your learned counsel’s request and with the approval of the Chair to allow you to give an opening statement, which you did, over some fair period this morning and we are grateful to you for providing detail to the Commission.  What I just want to raise very briefly with you is the concern that the learned Chair raised with you earlier which is – is there any particular reason why the considerable detail you have given to us at your own request in your detailed fairly lengthy opening statement was not provided in the form of the affidavits which you were specifically requested to give, not just a version but a full version, any reason for that?     May I take your Mr Mantsha and I am encouraged to hear that you feel a measure of reassurance from the remarks made by the learned Chairperson in that regard, but may I just ask you to look again at the letter,     And then the Chair – sorry not the Chairperson, the secretary of the Commission, Professor     I am sorry just speak up please.      I was simply asking you to look at the document in light of your earlier evidence that – that people had made findings against you that you had been tainted by state capture and a simple point is that is not apparent from this letter, not so?    Thank you the…    No we are not asking you to repeat anything – please do not Mr Mantsha we have precious little time and we would like to move on.  So if you want to say anything you have not said already you welcome to do so subject to the Chair’s guidance but I certainly do not want you to repeat anything.  Thank you.  Can I now take you to page 321.  This is a further letter from an official of the commission.  This is dated earlier than the one we looked at earlier and that is the 19 February 2020, do you see that?    And that was issued by – on the following page 322 by Ms Bridget Tshabalala the then acting secretary of the Judicial Commission, correct?    Did you receive this letter?    Yes you received it in February did you?    Right.  And thereto the commission’s official then says in paragraph 2. “This letter serves to confirm that the commission is looking into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud involving several public entities and other organs of state pursuant to the commission’s terms of reference.  As part of the investigations into the affairs of Denel SOC Limited and the greater scope of the state capture inquiry we are investigating various matters involving yourself.” Would you agree that they are not saying we have made any findings?  They simply investigating allegations that have been made by other, correct?    Yes. And would you appreciate particularly as an experienced and qualified attorney with knowledge of constitutional, administrative law and the like that of course is a matter of law.  Nobody can make findings that have any binding force in any event in relation to the commission’s work other than the learned Chairperson of the commission, Correct?    Right. And then the – the acting secretary says this – paragraph 4. “We have compiled a list of questions attached hereto as annexure A which you are required to respond to in the form of an affidavit detailing information required including supporting documents where possible.”    And you received these questions at the time you received the letter that came with it?    Right.  And I am just going to look at the headings so that we see what the questions relate to.  Paragraph 1 on page 323.  It is the Gupta’s and Associates    So we should not read into it any deliberate refusal to cooperate?    Yes.    Yes.    No I understand and I empathise as a legal practitioner.  It is true that sometimes we – we tend to give more time and attention to clients’ interests and sometimes our own.  But this was not something like a plumber’s bill that you had to pay.  Although plumbers are also important to deal with.  This was – this was something very serious that came on behalf of the Chairperson of a Judicial Commission of Inquiry appointed no less than by the President and relating to huge matters of public importance it just seems to me a little problematic that you confirm having received this and overlooking it.    Okay.      Okay thank you.  Alright thank you Mr Mantsha can I just before we leave this.  Were you dealing with clients in your professional capacity as an attorney to assist them in relation processes of this commission concerning those clients?    Right.  Okay thank you.  Now is it also correct that we as the legal team requested you to cooperate with the legal team in preparation for this hearing by consulting with us?    Yes.  I would like to ask you one final point about the level of cooperation or the level at which you may have cooperated or not cooperated and that is this.  When you look at the fact – these facts you do not respond at all due to an oversight you say to a very detailed list of questions which as the Chairperson – sorry dealing with matters which the Chairperson has already referred to as something that the commission would have welcomed if you had assisted from the beginning. It could have saved some time. Secondly the fact that when you did cooperate and we thank you for that by providing the three affidavits that we have taken you to they are extremely brief.  In fact very sparse.  I can give you as an example at the other end of the spectrum for example a witness who testified yesterday Mr Burger who – who himself has been the subject of a number of allegations and he felt – he felt he was innocent and wanted to clear his name.  He put in an affidavit.  I believe it was the main affidavit was 188 pages just the affidavit let alone many pages of annexures.  That may be an extreme example because others have given more like 30/40 pages whatever.   That the third point is that when we as the legal team asked to consult with you you did not consult.  It is true that your attorney wrote back – did give a response at least that was not overlooked and indicated if there was anything specific we could raise it with them but not to have a consultation. It just seems to – sorry I will give you a chance to respond may I just finish the question. Can I just suggest to you that unlike many other witnesses not all…    Not all witnesses in this commission both in relation to the Denel stream and other streams.  The commission has had a range of varying responses or non-responses from witnesses it just seems that your response appears to have been very patchy.  Please respond.    Well on behalf of the legal team may we say we commend you at least for coming today and we thank you for that.  And can you confirm that you will cooperate fully with the questionings – the questioning that we are going to put to you?    Okay.  When you refer to interrogation of course that is a term that for example in the apartheid era had terrible connotations of torture and so forth.  You in fact have never been interviewed by the investigators, not so?    Is that correct?    So you have not actually been interrogated.  In fact you said you did not want to subject yourself to interrogation, correct?    Yes but that is not your own personal knowledge, is it?    Yes.    And just a final point on this.  The request for the consultation that I was referring to earlier that was made by the legal team was not made by the investigators.  There is an investigation team and a legal team  In fact that will be clear if not to your own legal team it would have been clear very easily from a – any casual look at the – at the commission’s website. Now we were the ones as the legal team asking you to cooperate by way of a consultation which did not take place.  So surely any perceived – any perceived heavy handedness on the part of investigators that you yourself had not personally received should be surely irrelevant to a legal team three members of the Bar wanting to consult with you.  And instead we are simply told in an email well if you want to raise anything specifically do it by way of email but we are not going to join you in a consultation even if as we permitted they had come along to the consultation.  We were quite happy.   We had plenty of consultations with various witnesses where they have accompanied by their legal representatives and we have heard out the legal representatives if they had any difficulties.  It just seems to us as the legal team to be a little disappointing and concerning that the attitude on your part has been so resistant and so suspicious about the commission and its work.    Alright thank you.    Alright thank you Mr Mantsha.  May we now deal with some of the events that took place in relation to your chairpersonship of the board of Denel.  If we can take you to one of your affidavits – if we can take you to page 331.  You there are dealing as we have established already with a response to various statements made by Mr Salugee in his affidavit and what you say if I    What are you referring to then?    Sorry involved with?  Just please try and speak up a bit? MR    Yes.    So are you referring to the contract – there has been a great deal of evidence we do not need to cover again.    Unless it is necessary.  There was a – there were three contracts that we have been dealing with primarily in evidence the past few weeks.  The one is the Hoefyster Platform Hulls contract.  The second was a single supply contract between DLS and VR Laser and the third was a similar single supply contract between DVS and VR Laser.  You aware of those three contracts?    Right.  Are you referring here to the agreement relating to the Hoefyster Platform Hulls?    Yes which one?    Yes which one does that relate to of the three Mr Mantsha try and help me?    Yes.    Yes.    Right.    I fully understand that I am simply quickly trying to get to the point.  Was that the agreement, the first agreement that related to the Hoefyster Platform Hulls?  Is that what you referring to?  That is my understanding of the facts but it is your evidence not mine.  So if I am wrong the answer is no it is xyz.  If the answer is yes the answer is yes.  Is it the Platform Hulls contract or is it the single supply contracts?    And when you entered into the company you saying that had already been concluded some time before?    And we are in agreement with you the Hoefyster contract was signed in 2014 before you started in July 2015.  Right thank you.  Now when you say you were appointed as chairperson by the then Cabinet of the Republic that was when the Cabinet was chaired by the then President Mr Jacob Zuma, correct?    Yes.  Now reference has been made to the fact that and if it is not a fact you must correct it please that at a certain stage you have acted or may still be acting for former President Zuma, is that correct as an attorney?    So you confirm it?    Right.  Were you acting as Mr – former President Zuma as his attorney at this stage when you were appointed as the chairperson of Denel?    Not.  When did that come about?    2018?    So that was some years after you were appointed as chairperson of the Denel board?    After you had left the board right and that was in February that you left.    Or in any way?  You were not as his attorney.  Did you know him socially or through business?    I see.  And what was the nature of your knowing him?  Was it a social contact or business contact?    Right.    Okay and then former President Zuma’s son Duduzane have you acted as his attorney?    At any stage?  Not at all.    Okay thank you.  Alright now I would like to – you to please then refer to your paragraph 7 at    Of your affidavit.    Yes.  Right.    Alright thank you.  So when you said in your affidavit  “I did not request to meet Mr Salugee” Is it possible that you may have you just cannot recall?    Okay.    Fine.    Okay thank you.  At this stage were you already the chairperson of the Denel?    I see.  So then I would like to go back right to the very beginning before you became Chairperson did you know Mr Salugee at all?    Did you meet him for the first time when you became chairperson?    Right.    And had you prior to your appointment as chairperson of the Denel board had any dealings with social or business or political or anything with any of the Gupta family or their business associates?    The media industry?     And that included their ownership of the New Age ...[intervenes]      And also ANN7 Television Station.  Is that right?     Okay.  So you had met them.     Okay thank you.  And at that stage or any stage before you assumed the chairpersonship of the Denel Board, had you had any dealings social or business or political or otherwise with Mr Salim Essa?     Okay.  Would you describe as your relationship as a friendly one?     Yes.     Were you aware that Mr Salim Essa was a close business associate of the Gupta’s at that stage?     Right.  Now, I have referred you to the passage in your affidavit where you deal with the meeting at the Gupta residence in Saxonwold.     Was that one of – was that the only one that ever took place at their residence or were there others that you attended meetings at their residence in Saxonwold?     So you only went to the Saxonwold residence once?     Yes.     Sorry, then I do not quite understand what you meant when you said it was the first and the last ...[intervenes]      ...meeting at the residence.     I see.     And when was that?  Was that before or after you had assumed the chairpersonship of Denel?     So you started, as we have seen, in July 2015.     One of the people who attended was Mr Salugee, correct?     And he was there as the then DCEO of Denel, correct?     Now we know that you started in July 2015.  We also know, unless you correct me, that Mr Salugee was suspended in September 2015.       So barely three months after you had started as chairperson at Denel.  Presumable, you say you think it was after you started your chairpersonship.  And I am not trying to trick you up on there.  It could not have been after Mr Salugee was suspended, not so?  It must have been before his suspension.     Yes.     Sorry, you say, they come from?     Yes.     Now Mr Mantsha, did Mr Salugee ever disclosed to you anything that might have been improper coming from the Gupta family or their associates conveyed to him in that prior relationship he had with them?     I would like to read to you ...[intervenes]      If I may draw your attention to one of the affidavits that Mr Salugee has provided to this Commission.  Is it correct that you were asked by the Commission to have regard to his affidavits and in particular to particular passages, to pay particular attention to that?  Is that correct?     And that is why you, in fact, responded to some of those in the affidavit that I have take you to that you have signed, correct?     Okay.  I would just like to read to you, I am not going to take you to the actual affidavit.  But Chair, it is at the Denel Bundle 10 at page 801.  I do not believe it is necessary for your registrar ...[intervenes]      ...to bring it out.     I do not want to waste time and I do not think this should be remotely controversial.  This is what Mr Salugee said.  I am simply going to ask Mr Mantsha if – when he says this, if that was ever conveyed to him, Mr Mantsha.   This is what Mr Salugee said Mr Mantsha. “It was Rajesh Tony Gupta who asked me why I did not “take money like everyone else”. As I have indicated, I rejected his advances. I assumed he meant that there were individuals who at request, this was contained in my original statement.” Did he relate to you at any stage, particularly while you were chairperson of the organisation, that Mr Gupta had specific – Mr Tony Gupta had specifically asked him,     What do you think about it now, now that you have heard about it?  Presumable, you must have seen that in his affidavit.  Am I right?  Or am I telling you this for the first time?     Yes.  With respect, I think it is really for the Chairperson to decide whether you can be expected to answer the question.  Why I suggest to you that perhaps you should is this.   And here, I am not putting to you, for example, that the     Thank you, Chair.  Would you not agree Mr Mantsha that you as the Group Chief Executive Officer...  Oh, sorry the Group Chairperson of the board would have expected Mr Salugee, if this had happened, in his capacity as Group CEO, to have reported to you?     Surely, this is the sort of thing you that you would expecting to report.     Thank you, Chair.  I just want us before we get to the time where we are going to adjourn.  Just to pick up a point that you have raised earlier.   And that is that Mr Salugee did not tell you that he had been told by Tony Gupta that why do you not take the money like the rest of you, and you confirmed that that was not told to you and you only discovered that in the course of what has come out in this Commission.   Can I just ask you hypothetically?  If you just put yourself in this situation just to assist the Commission.  If you had known that from Mr Salugee, if and when you assumed your position as chairperson of the board and the CEO had disclosed, as he should have, that he had been made this improper approach by Mr Tony Gupta in the context of VR Laser a Gupta associated company doing business with Denel.   Presumable, you would have taken that seriously.  And secondly, quite apart from what Mr Salugee should have done by laying a criminal charge or a complaint to the South African Police.   Presumable, it would have affected your attitude as Denel chairperson as to whether any business should be done by Denel with VR Laser or any associative of the Gupta’s if this sort of improper offer was being made.  Would you agree?     Yes.     Yes.     Exactly.  Particularly, because, number one, legally you should not be doing business as a state-owned institution with anybody who is offering bribes to your most senior member of management, correct?     Well, do not worry where I am getting to.     Just answer the question where I was at not where I am getting to.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Exactly.     Right.     I understand that but ...[intervenes]      Exactly.     No, I understand your evidence and frankly, with respect, you do not need to repeat it.       We have heard your evidence that it was not reported and my question is put in a hypothetical basis.  What if he had done that?   So the one thing would be that legally it would not be appropriate for a state institution to do business with any entity that is offering bribes to its senior employees or to any employee for that matter.   There was a second aspect, not so?  And that is this.  That surely you do not want to reputational damage to the person... Oh, sorry.  To the entity of which you were the chairperson because that could be hugely damaging, correct?     Of course, we know exactly that exactly that type of damage has happened to Denel because of the allegations of State Capture, not so?     Right.       Alright.  Thank you.  May I just conclude, if I may Chair with just a question or two on a further aspect you have raised in the opening statement.  And that is that you yourself did not receive anything improper from the Gupta’s or their associates, correct?     And you did not receive any inappropriate benefit from them?     And you complaint that false allegations were made about your travelling overseas at their expense and you told the Chair, as I recall in your opening statement, you did travel a number of times overseas in your official capacity as chairperson but that was always at your own expense, correct?     Your personal capacity or – I understood you earlier to say, I may have wrong, I understood you earlier to say in your official capacity as the Chairperson.  Was it in your personal capacity?     Then I missed that and I apologise.  As I say, as I recall.  So there was some on your own personal behalf and others in your official capacity as Chairperson.  Let us just deal with the – when you were travelling in your official capacity.  Presumably Denel should have paid for those costs, correct?     So they did.  Right and when you travelled for your own personal benefit, who paid those costs, the travel costs?     So you paid that yourself.     Okay, can I take you please in the same bundle 8 to page 465?     465.  This is an invoice, it appears, where Travel Excellence, apparently a travel agency, was invoicing West Dawn Investments in October 2015 for certain travel arrangements on Emirates.  Now October 15 was a few months after you assumed the Chairpersonship of Denel, correct?     Right.  And this appears to invoice West Dawn Investments.  West Dawn Investments was a shareholder in VR Laser, correct?     and West Dawn Investments was part of the Oakbay Group of companies, part of the Gupta business empire, not so?      It seems so?     You cannot dispute that, is that right?     Okay.     Well, please do not qualify my question, you can qualify your answer.     Yes.     So are you saying – you said December, did you?     2015?     Are you saying you only learnt for the first time in December 2015 that West Dawn was involved in VR Laser and that the Guptas were involved in West Dawn?     Yes, I am not asking you where you got that from, I am just trying to – indulge me, please.     I will just take you step by step.     You did not know before December 15 …[intervenes]     That West Dawn had an interest in VR Laser and that the Guptas had an interest in West Dawn.      So, in other words, the time that this invoice was issued in October 2015 you were not aware that West Dawn had an interest in.     Okay, thank you.     Yes.     No, Mr Mantsha, please, you should, with respect, know that lawyers tend to …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.     Are we at…     Thank you, Chair.  Would this be a convenient time?     Thank you, Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed affirmation?    Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm. 
MR MANTSHA:  My names are Lungisani Daniel Mantsha.    No.    I truly affirm.    Thank you Chair.  I appear before you Chair as the former Chairperson of Denel board.  So I am going to speak as far as the acts, decisions of the board that I led as a Chair and I serve as a non-executive director as taken as far as it relates to issues which have been investigated by this commission. To the best of my abilities I will try to recall.  As we know this is five years ago.  I might not have certain details. When you hear me talking about we I would be referring to the colleagues that I served with at the board. And I will also deal with any matter that might relate to me in my personal capacity.  So I think it is important to place a number of issues into perspective to give the Chairperson the context and to give the commission legal team the context. I think we all know the – some of the decisions taken.  They were in the media and there were a lot of speculation about what could have been the motives. I think just to start let me explain the formation of what is known as Denel Asia.  And I do so Chairperson on the basis of the information within my knowledge and the information which I – it has been relayed to me. For a start Denel went to India on its own twenty years or more before my appointment as a board chairperson and my board in 2015. But what then happened Denel got blacklisted in India and reasons being they were accused of engaging in illegal activities inter alia corruption and bribery. So ever since then there has been litigation between the authorities in India and Denel as a result of those allegations.   My understanding is of course the authorities in India and here they had discussions to try to resolve the matter.  The matter was also in the Supreme Court in India and that litigation dragged for a long time. So as far as twenty or twenty five years before my arrival Denel had targeted the Indian market  They went there but from what I understand they went with the wrong way. During the February – I thin 15 as I understand the litigation and the dispute between the authorities here and India I think came to close – I might not be able to relate the date or the year whether it was 14 or 2015.   So when that matter was resolved I think February 15 Denel sent a delegation to India to just try to feel the situation since at that stage in February 2014 the matters were resolved.  And Chair as I have taken the position from July I am not sure about the date but July 2015.    Ja.  So the process at that stage in February to engage that market we were not there.  Then during the induction as a new board the inductions are normally presented by the Executive Management of the company and the leadership of the department.   Of course the department will take you through the protocols, the regulatory environment as far as the company relates to them and of course the management will take you through the strategic issue, the direction where the company is going to go and all sorts of things. At that point I do not remember exactly who has handed to me a document called Not Verbal.  Not Verbal is a diplomatic language. A communication between one state to another and that document simply say well the dispute between Denel and the Indian Authorities has been resolved. That is fine but of course during the induction as the executives are trying to project you know the current business, the future and everything.  So Indian market has been always a very important market for Denel because even the studies at that time as presented they were showing the fastest growing market. So that was fine.  My – the meeting of my board – the first meeting was on the 10 September 2015.  In that meeting of course we have been taken through discussion of the previous board and you know the strategic issues of which again the expansion of Denel into that market because maybe just to give a little background. The foreign market of the Denel it is mainly – it was at my time it was mainly in the Middle East.  And that market had its own complicity.  And of course the domestic market which is the South African Defence Force I think it  is – it is an open secret that every budget vote I think we can go as early as ever since the dawn of democracy the defence budget vote is decreasing all the time because of course the Sovereign has got pressing issues.  To a point where the domestic defence market cannot sustain the company.  So that is a strong argument made.   And Chair I happened to have the – the minutes but of course I do not want to hand them to you unless if you permit me to do so.  Which has captured the presentation on the 10 September of my new board.  And in that presentation there is an overview.    Well Chairperson with your direction.    I am fine to do that.    I am fine to do so.    I will do so.    So – so at that stage…    Thank you Chairperson.    Then a presentation is made of the markets that the company should go to and a resolution on the 10 September were thought by the executive that said the executive must be mandated to explore the Indian market.  Basically to go and see if we cannot set a company now the formation of the company. So a resolution was presented – I mean was approved the board as requested by the management.  And ever since then work was being done by the management and the management briefing the board on what was happening as far as that process is concerned. So I must say to you Chair that that process was undertaken in terms of the PFMA.  That process was undertaken in consultation with the department and in consultation with the National Treasury. There have been a number of meetings where the executives met National Treasury and met the Department of Public Enterprise to discuss the timeframe of when to submit and what information is required. And this a matter of standard.  When a state owned company intends to form a Joint Venture or go into another market you have to get the permission from the executive authority.   But before you get that permission you must give a pre-notification to the executive authority to say look I am going to form this or I am going to this market for these reasons. The executive authority will ask you the questions; would make whatever inputs are concerned and that position was done.  To a point where the formal applications were made I think they were submitted around 15 December – around somewhere – somewhere 15 December or 13 December I do not recall but before they  were submitted again there was a meeting where the whole process was explained and the urgency of the matter was explained. In terms of the context I am trying to give Chair is that the journey of Denel to Asia or to India started almost thirty or more years back.  And when Denel was freed from those corruption and whatever thing it eagerly wanted to enter the market.  And the urgency Chair was triggered by a number of reasons. One reason was at the time when we took over in July Denel debt level at that stage was very high.  If I remember well the Denel had over R8 billion facilities with the banks.  This relates to – because when you tender for an arms procurement whatever the thing there is always guarantee payments, bond and what have you.   So Denel was R8 billion and was left with like R2 billion in terms of the facilities it had.  Denel at that stage owed Nedbank and ABSA over R4.8 billion and at the point I think the creditors from just suppliers small and medium companies I think it was over R200 million debts which were over 200 days unpaid. So there was a very serious cash problem and also compounded by the transaction which Denel just acquired LSSA for over three quarter of a billion and Denel had no funds to service that kind of transaction. So the company was in a dire, dire need to actually find new market and try to generate some revenue.  So when I look at it Chair by the time my board came in Denel was already a sinking ship. The debts level were too high.  That is why in terms of the transaction which I will talk a little bit because it has triggered the suspension of CFO and the CE then.  The advice at that point was Denel could not be able to service any debt and if Denel wanted to take any debts like LSSA it must request the Sovereign to try to put the money So we are in that situation and my board was committed to save the sinking ship.  And the only way to save the sinking ship was to try to make decisions to try to get the new markets where you earn revenue. So there was no rush to the decision of Denel Asia as I have already explained when it started.  So the situation was not getting better but the applications were sent.  The department was sensitised on the urgency of the matter and I think Chairperson one appreciation should be Denel unlike Eskom does not get any guarantee from the state. If the South African Defence Force wants equipment they can go to anyone else including Denel.  So we do not have reserved – Denel does not have a reserved market be it domestic, be international. So everything that it does it has to compete and as you know Chair business it is about opportunities and the opportunities are not there all the time.  And the business that we talking about is a very hard business.  One is not selling cell phones.  One is selling weapons of mass destruction and the consumption is the state – is to state to state. So it is a very difficult business to get involved.  It has got lot of red tapes.  It has got lot of regulation that is why other people call arm dealers whatever the case might be.  It is not a simple business.  So when you enter that business you have got no time to slip because when you look at it you compete with big defence companies coming from big countries like United State, Russia, China and others who have got more financial muzzle to – to take you off the way and political muzzle to just get deals away. So it is a business that requires serious agility and you have to take decisions and try to execute because it is a very difficult market. So all of these is sensitised to the department but then the applications were made in terms of the law. The applications of course after thirty days the law says if you do not get an answer from the executive authority in thirty days you must assume that it is granted. The law is there for a reason and of course as law abiding board we acted according to the provision of that Act and we even went further to try to get a declaratory order that we complied. But Chair I must say to you that when you apply these commissions from Executive Authority which is Public Enterprises and National Treasury because Denel had to get approval from National Treasury on the basis that National Treasury has given a guarantee. At that stage I think it was R1.8 billion. So whatever transaction you have to do National Treasury must see it and look at it. So from that point the company was launched.  All the regulatory matters were followed and something that we did not know there was a political situation in the country and in terms of that political situation in the country certain events happened in December 2015.  And those events were leaked to the establishment of Denel Asia. All sorts of connection were made.  Relationship between other people to other people and this is how it happened.  But I am here Chair to explain the basis upon which the board took those decisions and the information which was before the board. This information was not only before the board but was before National Treasury and the Department of Public Enterprises.  This included a proper business case, the due diligence report which have been done to all the parties. But by that stage the partner that Denel had picked to go to the Asian market with instead of looking at the business case of the formation the politics overwhelmed the business because of the leans of the partner and all the explanations which were portrayed in the media. But that as it may it created problems for the company.  We wanted to do business not to deal with all sorts of things, political issues and other things which were playing out in the media.   We then decided as the responsible board to say look our intention to go to the Asian market was firstly and inter alia with all the other things.  Our engineers are sitting idle.  There is no work.  We have got no cash.  The young generation of engineers are not getting expertise because we have got no work.  And the employment situation we will be forced to retrench many people because there is no business. So we considered many factors.  I think all of it is said in the applications.  We considered many factors but our conclusion was it is in the best interest of the Republic that the – the following entity would and a foreign currency to the Republic.  Anywhere the Republic was 51%.  Anywhere the Republic was not putting a cent into that investment.  The Republic was making available the expertise of its engineers and the technology. The partner was putting R100 million to have that business work.  And Chair you would know that in any business you can never give guarantee that the business is going to be successful. You know the true heart of an entrepreneur is to take a chance and calculate the chance and I certainly tell you that the chance that was taken, the company had worked on it for many years and even before my arrival and the arrival of my board the company has gone through that process.  The company was satisfied that the proper case was made that is reasonable prospect that we going to be successful in that business. And as responsible board we took that decision.  But you might not aware Chair in terms of the governance procedures of how the things come into play.  I think it is important because you – you sit with all these allegations and I must as I sit here share my experience with you on certain things that the protocols that follows. The executive of the company generate a business case.  They bring the business case.  Before they bring it to the board the business case goes to several committees of the board.  The Social and Ethic Committee will deal with the social aspect of that business case.  The Audit and Risk will deal with the business case and all sorts of things.  The HR and or – so it goes to those committees and those committees look at it.  It comes to the board and then the board will hear the reports from various committees and deliberate on them and deliberate on recommendations of various committees. And either say management we agree with this or we do not agree with this or go and make a follow up on this.  And when you look at this the transaction that I am briefing about there was extensive work done to try to cover certain areas.  But be that as it may Chair I just want to clarify and correct the incorrect information which has been played for some time that the appointment of myself as the chair and the board was to initiate the Indian/Denel project and it is not true.  The project was there before we started.  Yes the project as I said was to the best interest of this country.  Was going to create employment; was going to – as you know that Defence companies do lot of diplomacy, and defence companies do a lot of due political work.  So in totality from the due political point of view, it was great for the country.  From the diplomatic point of view, it was great for the country.   But as state-owned companies, something that I am sure Chair you have observed many times from the witnesses that you have listened to.  Sometimes politics overcome a business case.  And with respect to the Chair.   My conclusion and my experience with this as the chair of the board in my board.  The politics and the events which were happening at the time, which we had no control of.   It is only when I listened to people talking in this     The former CE.     Mr Salugee.     So we had a very good working relationship and part of the discussions we had, of course, was the situation back at home.  At that point, of course, we realised     [No audible reply]      Chair, this was – this was in 2014.  This was around 2014.     Yes, indeed.     Okay alright.     Indeed.     Ja.       So I have known them in that capacity and, you know, we interacted in that capacity.  So you know, that is the relationship I had.  And beyond that, of course, I had relationships with a number of the stakeholders that I related to them, arising from that.   So in conclusion of what I have just said.  Just to put the record clear.  The board members that I have served with, they have served Denel and they have given everything and they have served with integrity.   There is nothing that they have done which amount to any element of State Capture as it is, you know, put.  They have suspended, yes.  But they have suspended on the basis of the facts before them.   They have settled, yes, on the basis of the facts before them.  They have decided, of course, to proceed with decisions to enter the new markets on the basis of the information which was presented to them.  Nobody told them what decision to make.  I think, of course, the Commission has got access to, you know, to the records. Because you see, a board of directors mainly acts through the meeting, through the resolution, through the deliberation and it is very clear there, that certain considerations were made which are black and white and which can be asserted(?).  And those were the basis of those decisions, nothing more.   And Chair, just to add.  I have travelled to our biggest markets in the Middle East and I was shocked to see that the majority of people who operate in those defence companies are South Africans.  And the majority of them worked for Denel.   Very competent engineers, who go there with an investing mind.  So, of course, the intellectual property in the space, it is in the head of an engineer.  And the product that they were making that side were actually better than the product that we are making.   And those states have got big pockets.  They had new factories.  They had new infrastructure.  So as a chair I could see that we had to do something because this is what we call our biggest market.   It is nothing more than people copying form us and tomorrow they would not need us.  So we tried what we could do.  To then say, we must then get into new technologies for the company and there had been a lot of research and we got into cyber space and all sorts of things.  So we tried to make sure that the ship should not sink.   But of course, given the fact that, you know, the sovereign is pressed(?) with lot of challenges in terms of service delivery issues.   So spending money on the defence company becomes not the most priority.  And to have the sovereign, to still retain some defence capabilities, it means that the company must be agile enough and try to take the opportunities.   But maybe some of the issues that, of course, you are confronted with Chair – and I must say, in terms of my own experience, the regulatory framework in which Denel operates in, it is not good for the company because the company competes at a global space.  Locally, it has got no - there is no preference that they must be given a contract by South African Defence Force.   And if you have a regulatory involvement, I think a lot of entrepreneurs will tell you that one of the big enemies of business is ridged regulatory environment because business in its nature is opportunities and they arise anytime and agility is very required.   So that has been also a frustration.  And if you see     Yes, yes, Chair.     With respect, Chair.     Thank you very much, I do understand but I think my experience in relation to the Commission, the manner in which people who manage the operations - of course, this has nothing to do with the Chair – it creates an impression of other people are being accused of doing certain things and, you know, when you start a process by trying to [indistinct] 07.22 other people, they of course feel insulted, they feel angry and they do not feel they have to cooperate because they have been already judged. So I think that is the problem that we see playing it out, I think it is the responsibility of many of us who had the opportunities to serve in different capacities to share the experience and Chair, with respect, I think if that was the approach – I am speaking for myself – if that was the approach, Chair, I am more than willing …     …to sit, to debate..     It was not anything but this has nothing to do with the Chair.     And I think lot of people would want to come and share their experience with the Chair.     And say look, this is what I experience and, you know…     This is my account or this is the journey I have travelled.     Yes.     Yes, this is bundle 8.     Yes.     Okay.     Thank you.     I do, I do.     Ja, indeed.     Yes, it is.  But may I then say something about this affidavit?     Okay.     Yes.     Well, I want to raise an issue just for correction about the breakfast meeting in Melrose.  I think I assumed that Stephan Burger was there but on recollection, he was not there.  It was myself, Mr Salugee, Mr Ntshepe and Mr Essa.     Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.     Well, somebody reminded me.     When I was asking about that meeting.     Yes.     Yes.     Indeed.     Indeed.     No.  No, not really.     No, I think you can take me through it.     No, I think the broad thrust of the affidavit I remember.     As I said in my opening, Chair, this is five years or something ago.     There could have been other details that I omitted.     Yes.     Yes.     I just have a little bit of problem with …[intervenes]     Eyesight, ja.     I think it is just the sight is failing.     Ja.     No, no, no, it is, I cannot read when it is [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes, I am actually trying to read to see if there is any other detail that I [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I though, Chair, I could read it as is.     As we go along rather than to waste time.     Indeed, Chair, indeed.     Yes Chair thank you.     Yes I have been through this page.     Yes, I am going to ...[intervenes]      No I am not adding.     I just want to make a correction on.     I have already indicated paragraph 5.     And then I have got paragraph 7 again.     Yes of course it is many years ago, the correct position is who called who I have no recollection, and then I have paragraph ...[intervenes]      Well ...[intervenes]      Indeed.     Indeed.     Correct Chairperson.     Correct Chairperson.     I did look at it.     I would deal with corrections.     Yes.     Indeed.     340?     I can see it.     Indeed.     Indeed.     Correct Chair.     I resigned around 2018 I think it was, towards the end of February.     420?     I do.     Correct.      Thank you Counsel.     I think so.     Correct.     Well personal reasons.     Yes.     Well Chairperson this is not a statement from me, this is what they wrote.     I cannot comment on that.     No, of course I do have.     Well I don’t want to comment on the statement issued by her department, yes I have got experience in these kind of things.     Yes.     Correct.     I think it is correct.     Well I was appointed a legal advisor but when you advise legally there are policy matters, there are political matters, so I advise across the board.     No I have been always managing my own business.     No my attorneys practice.     Chairperson a lot, a lot.     Correct.      Correct.     Chairperson I think I have already alluded to it, when the new Board, which I was part of, Denel was already a sinking ship. Denel was already owing creditors, mainly small and medium enterprises over 200million and these invoices were more than 200 days.  Denel at that stage was owing Nedbank and ABSA over probably I think it was R4.7billion. Denel facilities with financial institutions which was mainly used for issuing guarantees in contracts was at that stage R8billion plus and Denel was left with around R2billion. So the financial state was dire at the time, compounded with a transaction that Denel has spent R855million of which Denel did not have that money.  So it was catastrophic.    Yes.     Yes.      89 to 90?      Okay, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.        I do.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.      Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct.      I think Chair I have already responded to the Chairperson that the approach that investigators and officials of the Commission they use when it comes to people like myself who were in the service of the country and that we have acquired certain information and we have – we should provide the Commission with the information.  I think as I have explained the approach of trying to accuse certain people of being either a nebulous of State Capture, either being involved with the State Capture because either by association of – or otherwise, it doesn’t send an incentive to people to come and talk because the question that Counsel is asking me you would assume that the Commission is obviously very conscious with its own timeframes, you would assume that if for example these are actions of the Board, the Board acts through its meetings and the actions of the Board by law are recorded in the minutes and in the resolutions. So you would expect investigators to ask questions because they cannot find the answers, but when you are being asked things that if it is being investigated it should be easy for the investigator to find that I must say Chair I am actually indebted with explanation that you have given to me but of course unfortunately Chair we are not dealing with the Chairperson, we are dealing with the people who are employed to do this kind of work and indeed if the approach from the beginning is that the Chairperson has explained to me and what my – I mean Counsel is conveying now it would have been a different approach, completely.      That is correct.     Well with respect Chairperson both act through High Courts.     Both acts through the Courts and Chairperson I don’t want – I am not here to justify anything, I am here to explain what has happened, what I have experienced and when a question comes to me to say justify the decision, the decisions of the board are contained in minutes in the board resolutions and it is simple and easy for the commission to understand the basis upon which all these decisions were taken.  Sorry Chair.  That is why for me because these were not my personal decisions.  It was fair enough to refer to those documents which has contained these decisions.  It was not to say I am not cooperating.   If you ask me questions in my capacity as a Chair I will then give you the actions of the board which are contained in the minutes and in the resolution.  So that is why I attach this document because then you see this was the reasoning and that is why these decisions were taken.  If Counsel wants to get to a point that I was not cooperating that I reject is not correct.   I have already expressed to the Chairperson that the message out there – not only to me but to many other people. It is different it is not the Chairperson who is communicating with us.  It is not the Chairperson who is telling us this that the message out there is accusation and accusation and lambastes people as enablers of state capture and given all sorts of names.  But if the idea from Counsel is to say you were not cooperating that is not correct.    I think Chair I – I think I have already explained myself.    The reason why I reacted the way I have reacted. I do not think it is – I have to repeat because otherwise I would be repeating what I have answered.    I do.    I do.    Yes the letter was received.    Ja – yes it was received in February.    Correct.    It is correct.    Indeed.    Yes.    Chairperson I did not reply.  It was purely a matter of oversight.  The moment in time when this letter was received by my office there were very serious matters that I was handling for other people that relates to the work of this commission.  It was an oversight on my side.  The letter received; the letter is put in the file and at this time there were matters that… ADV KENNEDY    Not at all Chairperson.  I think the next minute I got into this is when now the bundles are being sent.      And as preparing with my legal team of course we then picked this was not answered.  But as I explained Chairperson my apologies to that but it was clearly, clearly oversight. Sometime we forget about our own personal matters and focus on ourselves – on other matters and this was a very difficult time in my – in my life.    When that was received.    Well Chairperson I cannot say more than the apologies that I have given.    And the reasons for me not to react and to    Well amongst other things yes.    Well I got that request Chairperson true but I am sufficiently represented a very senior attorney on my side and a very experienced senior counsel.  My attorney responded to say no whatever you want you can tell us and then we can look at that.  There was no idea of trying not to cooperate.  There have been correspondences between my attorney and the commission as far as that request is concerned.    My apologies Counsel.    Chairperson what is happening I think Mr Burger eluded in his affidavit.  What these investigators who are employed by the commission they interrogate people to accept whatever narrative they are coming with. So I of course do not want to subject myself in unfair process.  It is not correct that there was no reason for me not to consult with the commission.  The reasons given by the commission were not such that we can form a conclusion that look the commission is out here; it is asking us this information because of very good reasons. So there has been nullified, there has been people being put under very serious interrogation.  And of course I did not want to subject myself to that.  I have got a legal team which is capable of whether it is  500 pages of an affidavit we can do but in conclusion Chair if all of this is meant to show that I disrespected this commission that is not true. I cooperated to an extent on the basis of the information that I have.  I did not of course want to expose myself to what I regard as unfair tactics by some of the commission’s investigators.  So I did not want to get involved.  But at no stage as I said Chair when you explained to me and if that was the message that everyone out there is getting as the Chair has explained we would have been the first day came here with loads and loads of things and say Chairperson I want to share this with you.   So again if Counsel is trying to say I did not cooperate with the commission it is not correct.  On the face of other documents that I might not have responded to I profoundly apologise Chairperson.  Here I am. I am here to engage.  I am here to explain the part of my board.  I am here to explain my part.  I am here to share whatever experience that I have that might be relevant to what the commission is looking for.  And I am here in good faith.  That is what I can say Chairperson.    Well with respect Chairperson I mean I do not think I have to answer that.    Ja but I…    It is correct.    But yes I have read the evidence of people who have been subjected like Burger who described.    Well I would not – I would not – it is not my personal knowledge.    But he would not have said that if that was not correct.     Well Chairperson I cannot say more than what I have said.    I – I have cooperated to an extent where I thought my legal position is and I have not obstructed the work of this commission.  I am here.  I am here to explain what I know to the commission. I have already told you Chairperson that the manner in which things have been done is such that it – people resent it because either lack of the reasons or a proper    No.    Well Chairperson what I am referring here is VR Laser had already signed an agreement or a memorandum with Denel and VR Laser was already involved in Hoefyster Project which was like – is it eleven    And this was of course long before my appointment.    Yes.    Yes.    I am referring here to the first agreement.    That I have been told.  The first agreement which Denel has entered with VR.    Well I think Counsel if we take the sequence of this relationship.    Between Denel and VR Laser.    You will then see that the first agreement which was signed between VR Laser and – sorry Chairperson – between VR Laser and Denel was signed some time before our appointment.  I am referring to that first agreement which Denel and VR signed.    That is the agreement I am referring to.    Well my understanding of the agreement which was signed it was a relationship agreement partnership agreement.  Yes it covered the Hoefyster Project.  This is my understanding as we entered into the company.    Yes indeed.    President Zuma yes.    I think it is a public knowledge.    Of course it is [00   No.    Well I – I acted for former President as from 2018 if I…    Yes.    In fact after I have left them.    Yes. 2018.  Right.  Did you know the former President Zuma before your appointment?    Well knowing him how?    Of course I knew President Zuma.  I know any other business to do with him.    Well I met the President in political meetings.    And ja that was it.    No.    No.    Well Chairperson firstly let me correct the wording of this statement.    Yes.    Who requested who Chairperson.  I do not recall I will make a supplementary affidavit on that despite many years ago.  Whether I attended this meeting yes I did.  I attended this meeting at the Gupta’s residence.    Of course it might have been possible that I am the one who conveyed.    The meeting to him or he is the one who conveyed the meeting to him.    Or Mr Essa could have been the one who conveyed the meeting.    At this stage I think I was.    No I did not know Mr Salugee.    Well I think when we were in London and when we were trying to share experiences we then got to a possibility that we could have been met – we could have met each other around 1992 in a particular political event.    So when I was sharing my recollection of the event so he also described his and said I was there.  And there is a high probability the person I have met him in 1992 it is him.  So – but beyond that no.    Well Chairperson as I have already indicated I did met the Gupta family. They are stakeholders – they were stakeholders in the media industry.    In the course – in the course of my advising the then Minister of Communication yes I did meet them before.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Well, Chairperson I would not remember.     I would not remember exactly the month, the date.     No, the year, it is around 2014.     Yes.     I have known Mr Salim Essa, I think, as early as, probably, 2014.  And I did not have any dealings with him except, you know, social conversation and how are you and what have you.     With Mr Essa?     Well, I did not have a friendship with him.  Yes, he is – Mr Essa is a very friendly guy.  So he would greet, he would engage people in a conversation.  So.  Ja, that is all I can say.     Well, the time I met him, of course, he was already related with them.     Yes.     This was my first and last meeting.     No, no, no.  I am referring to this matter.     I have been there several times.  I cannot tell you how many times but I have been there but ...[intervenes]      No.     This was the only meeting and the last meeting where there was a discussion which indirectly related to Denel.     Yes.     Well, of course, it was after I was appointed.  I am not sure which month, whatever the things but I think it was after I was appointed.     Ja.     Yes, Mr Salugee.     Indeed.     Correct.  I think so.     This meeting?     Okay.  I think, let me just put something in perspective here.  How I understand the relationship between Mr Salugee and Mr Essa.  My understanding of the relationship is, they come from the same locality.     They come from the same locality.     From the same area.  They were friends and friends way before from where they come from.  And as I understand, Mr Salugee with his exposure to the defence business helped Mr Essa to negotiate the sale of the VR Laser South Africa.   So there was that cordial relationship according to my understanding of where they come from and where they were going.   And again, I repeat Chairperson.  I assumed that the friendship and everything meant well.  I, of course there is a rebuttable presumption that we all meant well until we proved otherwise.   So that is the context of the relationship, as I understood it, between the two.  A long relationship, from the same area.  Mr Salugee helped Mr Essa to acquire the VR Laser business.  That is my understanding Chairperson.     Well, I think – I should say that I got along very well with Mr Salugee and we had number of one-on-one discussions.  We would make, we would have coffee.  I was supporting him, he was supporting me.  I did not, as I said, I mean, the relationship I assumed it meant well.  So was not suspecting that people are meeting because there is anything.  I was not suspecting Mr Salugee of anything.       Chairperson, I do not remember anything like that.     Yes.     It is correct.     Yes.     No, no.     Well, of course, the allegation relates to Mr Gupta.  It does not relate to me.  So.  Of course, I really do not have to answer that.  But all I can say, it was never conveyed to me.     Well, I think Chair.  Let me reply as follows.  It is my concern irrespective of anyone for officials of public entities to accept bribes.  I am completely against that.  So if indeed a situation like that had occurred, of course, I am concerned about it.   But just to go further.  There was no situation under my leadership of the board, in my board, where there was a contract which was presented to us and we were supposed to approve that contract.  Never.   Of course, there is a Denel Asia matter which relate to Mr Essa as a shareholder of that company.  And just to put it into proper context.   I am not here to speculate Chairperson about what other people said that other said to them.  I think it is up to the Chairperson to look at that kind of evidence, whether in terms of the mandate of the person is something that the Chairperson should express anything.   So I am not going to speculate, other than to say, I am completely against it.  Have I known about that, I would have sharply raised that matter but I cannot comment in a matter like that as a matter of fact that it happened.   I do not know it happened.  I think Mr Gupta must be given that benefit of doubt to actually put his version.       No, Chairperson.     Well ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, firstly.  We all have got a legal obligation to report crime to the police.  The first thing I would have expected Mr Salugee to do, was to go to the police and report that so and so has attempted to bribe me and these are the reasons and opened a police case.  I would have expected that.   And of course, I would have expected Mr Salugee to raise it with me, to say look this is what is what is happening.   But what I know Chairperson is that the only meeting that I have attended when Mr Salugee was present and Mr Essa was present in the Gupta residence.  There was a discussion about Mr Salugee assisting Mr Essa to buy out the private shareholders of LMT.  At that stage Chairperson, I did not even know what LMT stood for.  So.   And that discussion was fairly in terms of what I was listening there.  The discussion started to that Mr Essa wanted to buy out the shareholders of LMT who were private shareholders and Mr Salugee was assisting him as he assisted him, according to my understanding Chairperson.   I was not there when it happened but my understanding is.  Yes, he assisted him with VR Laser.  My understanding is, he is assisted.  In that meeting, they were discussing assisting Mr Essa with LMT shares.     Well, I think, I understood why I had to attend the meeting.  You know out of the private discussion     And Mr Salugee.     But I would deal with the politics of it and concentrate on the business.  So we were working on that basis to say, I would deal whomever the politician is, I will deal with that rather than for you to have pressure.       Well, Chairperson the reality is.  The appointment was made by cabinet.  I am not sure if it was May or April, whatever the case.  That cabinet decision, I think 24 May or whatever the case may be.   So, of course, people in the space new that the cabinet has approved a new board.  I cannot confirm the discussion between Mr Essa and Mr Salugee.  I was not there.  All I can say is what came to my knowledge.  Immediately, when the former, Mr Salugee knew that I was appointed, we started to have interactions.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Chair.     I cannot recall the sequence, which meeting came first.  That I cannot recall.  We had our introduction meetings and we discussed where we want to work, what we expect from one another and we really struck a very good relationship.  I liked Mr Salugee.  I think – I respect him.  I think he did the same to me.  So we were getting well together.     Yes.     Yes.     Look, I think...  Chair, you are asking me a very difficult question because, as I have already said to you.     Mr Essa and Mr Salugee ...[intervenes]      They knew each other.     And he was strangely(?) ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]      I do not know.     But when I met Mr Salugee for the first time, he has never mentioned to me that he has requested to meet me because of Mr Essa.     I took it, he is meeting me as the new chairperson of the board.     And even the discussions we had were confined to the truth.     How are we going to work together.  He briefed me about certain challenges that the company was going through.  It was not about other people.     Ja.     No, of course I would have been opposed to that.     Vigorously.     And I would not want the business to be associated with those kinds of things.     Well, true but I think where you are getting to ...[intervenes]      Ja, but let me answer you because ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Because I have already answered you.     Whether a bribe was offered by Mr Gupta or anybody to Mr Salugee.     I do not know.       You are asking me to a hypothetical situation.     I have already explained to you that I am opposed of those activities.     And anyone where those activities happened, if that person is law-abiding, would go to the police before he goes to anybody else.     That person would report it to the authorities and that person would report it to the board.     Yes.  My board has got no record of that report.     Yes.     True.     Yes.  Chairperson, just to add on that.  The internal protocol of the company.  There is a whistle-blower mechanism.     There is internal audit.  And of course, Denel operating in the environment it does, where there are a lot of attempts of underhanded matters.  There are vigorous mechanisms to try to enforce non-corrupt practises.   So internally, the mechanism – he, of course, did not even have to disclose the whistle-blower.  A very protective system within the company.  It would processed by Internal Audit.   Internal Audit had outside people and all sorts of things.  Yes, side activities cannot be tolerated and we would not have tolerated it had we known an activity like that indeed took place or it was reported to us.     Indeed correct.     Correct, Chairperson.     Well, Chairperson let me just correct.  I did not travel at their expense. I have travelled at my own expense.  As far as the – any benefit is concerned.  No benefit I have received.  And those travelling that he is referring about, I did so in my own personal capacity.  The …[intervenes]     Well, that is absolutely very wrong.  I think I was very specific.     Indeed, Chair.     Yes.     Indeed, Chairperson.     Well, they have always covered those costs.      I have always covered my costs.     I have covered my costs.     Indeed.     Yes.     Yes, it seems so.     Ja.     No, no, no, I am not disputing that.     Yes.  Can I just qualify the question?  I knew that West Dawn …[intervenes]     Okay.  No, no, no, I will qualify my answer.     Yes, Chairperson, I knew in December that West Dawn is a part of the VR.  And how did I know this?  I knew this, Chairperson, as a result of a due diligence report which was conducted on VR in the process of the work of Denel Asia who are the shareholders, how much is this shareholder receiving.  Yes, I knew.     December 2015.     Ja.     Well, Chairperson, I knew for the first in 15 as a result of the due diligence.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes, Chair …[intervenes]     Chairperson, can I just explain about…     About what counsel is getting to.     Chairperson, I wanted to give context following from the answers that I have given which …[intervenes]     To my answer.     To the question that was asked.     Ja.  And, Chairperson, what I am saying here is, as far as West Dawn is concerned, I have already explained when did I know that they were the shareholders but in terms of my travelling arrangements, I have arranged my travelling through Ashu(?) who runs a side business and Ashu works for the Guptas, he runs a side travel business.     Ashu – I think Ashu Trowler(?)  Something like that.     Yes.     And how did this happened?  This first happened with my trip to India.  The first trip to India and I have arranged through him, he told me the cost and I have settled with him.  So the information that appears, West Dawn who or what, of course for the first time when these documents are given to me, that is where I see this.  So I cannot say how was he running his business.  But all I can say, is I pay for what I was supposed to pay.     And he was assisting me with that.     So but I cannot really take the Chairman any further.     About whether West Dawn or no West Dawn or which account, I cannot take the Chairperson further.  
ADV CILLIERS SC:   As you please Chair.  I am indeed the JG Cilliers I am a senior counsel from Pretoria.  I am instructed by my learned attorney who is sitting on my left hand side Mr Denga on behalf of the witness.    Mr Chair maybe if I can just interrupt it is not a situation where Mr Mantsha has any reservations of handing it in he is just worried about maybe confidentiality situations between him and Denel.    So he has got it available and he is willing to hand it to you.    It is only that he – I did not enough time to prepare on these issues.    It is a question of his – worried that he does not want to breach the confidentiality situation with Denel.    As you please. 
MANTSHA:   …my experience in terms of the regulatory environment as I experience it, the relationship with our politician, of which I have respect to them, where I think commercial interest have been sidelined because, you know, politicians are politicians. So with that, Chair, I think – speaking for myself, I think it is all the basis of an [indistinct] 08.42.   I just wish to point on specific paragraphs.   There were matters that of course preoccupied and it was an oversight on my part and I omitted. And to that Chairperson of course I am sorry that there was an oversight on my part and I did not respond to this.   The South African Defence Force appointed Denel to execute a project called Hoefyster.   Well, Chairperson the state-owned companies operate within a political environment.  And we discussed that look ...[intervenes]    What they were talking between themselves, I do not know. 
MR CILLIERS:  With respect, Mr Chairman, the witness has the right to explain an answer and that is all asked and Mr Kennedy should [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]    But, Mr Chair …[intervenes]    Mr Chair, if I may respond.  A witness has the right to put an answer and/or a situation in context and I know there is time constraints and it seems to me Mr Kennedy attempts to get to certain point before we have to take the adjournment but, with great respect, the fact that we have limited time left, only a minute or, we are already over out time, should not force a situation where the witness is not afforded a fair opportunity to put in context whatever he wants to put in context.     As you please.
