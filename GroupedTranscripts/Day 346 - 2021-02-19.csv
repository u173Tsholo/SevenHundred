CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning...  Good afternoon Mr Seleka.  Good afternoon everybody.     Good afternoon Ms Daniels.     Good.  Are we ready?     Yes, okay.     Did we wake her up quite early?     [laughs]      So you are not an early riser.  So.  [laughs]  But after this, you can go to bed early.     [laughs]  Okay alright.       Ja. ADV SELEKA     Ja, administer the oath again.       Okay thank you.  You may proceed Mr Seleka.     Will you just briefly remind the public what you will be dealing or tell the public what we will be dealing with today.     Ja.     Yes, I have got it.     Oh, so it is this other bundle that I have got here?     Okay alright.     And that has got to do with?     H’m?     H’m.     Okay.     Ja, I have got it.     Well, Mr Seleka.  I wonder whether they could quickly paginate it, even at this stage, so that when you refer to pages, then we all have the same pagination.  All she would need to do is, just put like 1079 and 8.  From 8 one to the last page.     On the left-hand corner.     Then when you refer to pages, you just stick to the pagination.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Well, if you think that is fine, we can go on with that.     Let us see.  Let us try it.     Ja.     With that affidavit?     Okay alright.     Ja.     Okay alright.  Oh, and also for its admission?     Okay.     Okay.     I guess what we should do is.  Since the certificate of authentication is separate, we should admit it separately and give its own exhibit number and her affidavit which you were saying with the...     It is...  I mean, I do not know – it seems to be separate although on my reference here it is one side of the same page as the first page of her affidavit. ADV SELEKA     H’m.     H’m.     Yes, you see.  Our normal... or she – or the Vice Consul General has also signed whereas commissioner of oaths.     I guess the certificate of authentication relates to authenticating the actual affidavit and the commissioner of oaths, at the end of the affidavit, serves the normal purpose that is certificates ends.  It does – but it does seem to me...  Do you have it as on the same page as her first affidavit or you have it as a separate document all together, the certificate of authentication?     Ja.     Oh, so it is not part of the affidavit itself?     You see, it is a standalone.     It is a standalone document.  Then this is the affidavit.  I think we must give it its own exhibit.     I think you can just confirm with her, confirm the certificate of authentication with her and then we can admit it.     And who has got the original of the certificate of authentication?     You have it?  Oh, okay alright.     Ja.     Okay alright ...[intervenes]      It is not sent through ...[intervenes]      ...in the meantime but you confirm Ms Daniels that this is the certificate of authentication that was signed by the Vice Consul in regard to your affidavit?     Yes.     Okay alright.  What exhibit number must we give it Mr Seleka?  It will be separate from the exhibit number of the affidavit.     Okay the certificate of authentication signed by the Vice Consul of the South African Consulate General in Los Angels which appears on page 1079 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U18.4. CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION OF DANIELS MARGARET DANIELS IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT 718.4     And she has confirmed, if I remember.     The affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret Daniels which starts at page 1080 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit U18.5. AFFIDAVIT OF SUZANNE MARGARET DANIELS IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT U18.5     I am sorry ...[intervenes]      I am sorry Mr Seleka and Ms Daniels.  Please do not forget your question.     And please do not forget your answer Ms Daniels.     I just want to go back to the resolution.  The – because you are giving evidence Ms Daniels to say Clause 2.1.4 of the Resolution appearing at page 580, Bundle 18 gave authority for the issuing of a guarantee, is that right?     Yes.  Now I just want us to explore that a little bit before we go forward.  There is no reference in the resolution to a guarantee, is that correct?     So to the extent that one would say that clause 2.1.4 authorises the issuing of a guarantee that would have to be on the basis that clause 2.1.4 implies such authority or is wide enough to include a guarantee, is that right?     Ja, I would like us to just explore that because I want to make sure I understand your reasoning correctly.  The resolution that is said to have been required, which I take is the resolution that was given     But that – but was that going to precede the conclusion of the coal agreement or was it going to come after?     Yes, so if it was going to …[intervenes]     Yes, go ahead?   Are you saying in terms of the agreement that was concluded there was provision that the supplier would be paid upon signature?     Where do we find that agreement?  I just want to quickly have a look at it.     442.7?     Are you going there, Ms Daniels?     Do you recall the clause that says what you are talking about.     Well, I see clause 6.1 of the agreement at page 442.8.  Ms Daniels, can you hear me now?     Ja, clause 6.1 may be the clause you are     6.2 then says    So but now – okay, what the resolution   It simply says they were being authorised to negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement so it did not require them to come back to the board and say are these terms and conditions acceptable, can we go ahead and conclude an agreement, is that right?     Ja, the three officials were basically even a blank cheque to agree to whatever terms and conditions they thought were acceptable without having to go back to the board, is that right?     I accept that if the board gives you the authority to negotiate and conclude an agreement, you have not obligation to go back to the board, that would be I guess on the basis that the board has confidence that the three officials knew what they were doing and that they would were doing and that they would act in the best interest of Eskom, I would imagine.  Would you agree that such a bank cheque …[intervenes]     …be given on that understanding, generally speaking.     Yes.  And then what they then went on to do, the three officials, I assume, was to go and conclude an agreement which said they should – Eskom should issue a guarantee, that is clause 6.2, I think, that we read.     And it may well be that once the board had given them that wide authority that the board should not complain if they acted – they issued a guarantee but the resolution, by the mere fact that it authorised the three officials to conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement which I understand to be a prepayment, did that not necessarily imply that the agreement that the three officials were authorised to conclude was an agreement that allowed a prepayment, a payment for coal before coal was delivered.     Yes.     Ja, of what it was.     Ja.     Yes and therefore, the issuing of a guarantee in favour of Tegeta in circumstances, if this interpretation is correct, in circumstances where the resolution authorised in effect the payment of cash, the payment to be made was no worse than what was authorised and actually – I am not sure, it might have been – if they had taken cash and given it to Tegeta to this amount they would have acted within the resolution, is that correct?     Yes.     Issuing the guarantee as opposed to paying cash certainly did not put Eskom in a worse position than Eskom would have been if cash had been paid in advance.     Mr Seleka?     I wanted to just explore this.     You are free to explore it further and feel free to indicate anything that might indicate a different interpretation or understanding.     724?   No but this one cannot have …[intervenes]     Bundle 18 cannot go to 7 something, it goes up to 597, black numbers.     H’m, my one.     Yes, it is 18A.     No, I am not on the page you are talking about, I am saying I have got bundle 18A but it does not go to page 700 and something, the last page is 597.     Ja, okay.     Salient points.     Ja.     To the extent that it makes a difference but in terms of what is written here.     Yes, I wrote here previously when one of the witnesses was giving evidence, compare this document with the one at page 724.  I think we compared it on that occasion.     Ja.     Remember that, Mr Seleka, the point which I wanted to clarify with Ms Daniels was simply about whether the issuing of the guarantee was authorised by the resolution and nothing else.     So the question of who the idea of guarantee came from.     Obviously that is separate but it was simply the question of whether the three officials and Ms Daniels could say that the issuing of a guarantee fell within the authorisation in the resolution.     So I just want to make sure.  Obviously at some stage you will indicate what your thinking is but you can go ahead.  So I think she – Ms Daniels confirms that the idea of a guarantee came from outside of Eskom.     Ja and we can see that the document she attaches to her email, which is the email at page 725 and the attachment is at 726, we can see that the attachment insofar as it relates to the guarantee that [indistinct] 27.09 is the same as the document at page 724.  If there are any differences they will be minor.     Well the question I am not sure that it went beyond that.  You may, in dealing with it Mr Seleka the question of whether issuing of a guarantee was authorised for purposes of assisting me because Mr Singh's presence there does seem to me that the resolution was wide enough.  But it may be that there is something I am missing that you might be able to point out.  It seems to me that this could be compared to a situation where I authorise you to pay somebody from my money in cash R100,00 and instead of paying them in cash you issue a cheque.  How can I complain, unless that other person complains but the agreement was cash, so by you giving me a cheque but I do not see how I can complain, if it does not make a difference to the other person that you have given a cheque, if they are happy with a cheque.     In the end if the cheque is presented, then honoured money will go out and in terms of what I had authorised you, cash would have gone out probably earlier than, cash would go out by way of a cheque.  The only complaint I can have, about you issuing a cheque instead of cash is if I think that the issuing of a cheque will prejudice the other person or the other person will complain because of whatever delays there may be before they get cash but if the other person is happy, I do not see why I would have a problem with the fact that you issued a cheque.      Ja, no, no I do not have a problem with that that is important.  It is just that all along I have understood that there is an issue about whether the Board had authorised the issuing of a guarantee.     And obviously, we need to apply our minds to that but if the reasoning that indicated is correct it seems to me that the Board cannot complain or should not complain or blame the officials for issuing a guarantee in circumstances where they had authorised them actually to pay even cash, you see.     So obviously we can look at other issues, if there is no indication that this construction of the resolution is wrong but if there is anything that suggests that it is not sound, we can look at it.  But on the face of it, that seems to be the, that seems to me to be the position and therefore the Board should have no grounds to criticise the officials if they did not apply their minds to the resolution that is there problem.     Well, you see, it seems to me that one has to start with what authority the three officials - what terms and conditions the three officials were authorised to agree to in terms of the agreement, and it seems that the Board gave them a blank cheque as it were to say you will see what terms and conditions you agreed to and they decided to agree to among others a clause that says a guarantee would be issued.  Now, if you accept that, that fell within, that was left to them to decide what terms and conditions they should bind Eskom to, they bound Eskom to among others to that and once they had bound Eskom to that term they had to issue the guarantee.   If the Board did not, if the Board wanted to narrow  the scope for their mandate, to say, you can agree to whatever terms and conditions except not about A, B, C, D it was free to say so in their resolution, they did not say so, they just gave them a wide the widest possible authority in terms of what terms to agree to. It may well be that they were terms and conditions that are usually agreed to between Eskom and such suppliers in such a case and they expected the officials to agree to usual terms but they did not say so in the agreement, they did not say they must negotiate and conclude an agreement on the usual terms and conditions.  They just said you negotiate and conclude and the official decided one of the things we will agree to will be a guarantee but that was not voiced then what had been authorised if one reads the resolution to mean that the Board authorised pre-payment which could be cash, ja.      Ja, on the face of it unless the Board comes up with something else or unless somebody picks up in it something, it does appear that the resolution authorised this kind of thing, it left it to the three officials to agree the terms and conditions and one of the terms they agreed to was the issuing of a guarantee. So that of course does not deal with the question whether it was right or it was proper, it was justified to agree to a pre-payment on the part of the Board in the first place.      But it answers the question whether the three officials were authorised to issue a guarantee.     Ja, you see it is important to separate all the issues.      So far, all we were talking about and all I was raising was whether the issuing of a guarantee fell within the terms of the resolution.      That does not necessarily mean it was following the terms of the PFMA, it does not mean it was in order in terms of any other instrument.  It may well be that one might say the Board did authorise by its resolution the issuing of a guarantee, but obviously could not authorise the issuing of a guarantee that falls on its delegated authority or beyond its power.  So if the guarantee was beyond its power, and one assumes the officials would know that because we are talking here about the chief executive officer of Eskom and chief financial officer that they would know what falls within, what fell within the mandate within the power of the Board in terms of amounts.      So if the argument is from the Board, we are not saying that the officials did not - the resolution did not authorise the issuing of a guarantee at all.  We accept that the resolution did authorise in effect or by implication issuing of a guarantee, but it could not authorise the issuing of a guarantee that is your power in terms of amounts of the Board, then that is a different argument.     Ja.     Well you see it seems to me that clause 2.1.2 of the resolution and I am not looking at I am just mentioning it from memory.  Is so wide that for purposes of whether there was entitlement to issue a guarantee there might be no need to go to the clause that Ms Daniels was relying on because you say clause 2.1.2 gives the three officials complete discretion to what they must bound Eskom to in terms of that agreement.  And if they choose to bound Eskom to saying issue a guarantee, in circumstances where the resolution actually authorises the payment of cash that is within the resolution.      And once they have included that in the agreement, obviously it is going to be honoured and then maybe with or without clause 2, was it clause 2.1.4 the one that Ms Daniels relied on.     Maybe with or without it still they are authorised but certainly it seems you can say once they have included the issue of a guarantee in the agreement as a term or condition that clause 2.1.4 allows them to take whatever steps to give effect to that agreement.     Ja.     Yes, so it seems that the Board unless they come up with something more convincing cannot really complain that in issuing the guarantee the officials did something that they were not authorised by the resolution to do.  Yes, but of course you feel free to - you can always come back later on if you reflect and you or you come across something that might change one's thinking. But in the meantime, you can explore the other issues of you know, Ms Daniels has confirmed that the idea of this guarantee came from outside of Eskom.  I do not know whether she may have dealt with this before, Ms Daniels you say it came from outside from whom outside of Eskom did it come?     Well…[intervene]     Yes, continue.     Yes, now Mr Koko when he gave evidence here a few weeks ago said that, I think he said he was shocked or he would be shocked if the position was that Businessman was Salim Essa or was somebody from outside of Eskom.  I cannot remember how he put it because as far as he was concerned, he had been told and I do not know whether he said he had been told by you, I think he said, you had told him that Businessman was Dr Ngubane the Chairperson of the Board.  What do you say to that?     Ja.     Was that personal email address of Dr Ngubane known to Mr Koko at the time as far as you know?     I am sorry, I am asking whether, to your knowledge did Mr Koko also used the – Dr Ngubane’s personal email address, or is that something you do not know?     Yes, so are you saying that there are documents, Eskom documents or emails that you sent to Board members and maybe some of the senior executives at Eskom which included Dr Ngubane’s personal email address that you have just mentioned?     And Mr Koko would have been one of the recipients of such emails that you sent, which included Dr Ngubane’s personnel email address that you have mentioned?     Do we by any chance have such documents Mr Seleka?     Maybe I could ask her Ms Daniels she might know, in the bundles that we are using have you come across any documents that you send to, among others, Mr Koko which had Dr Ngubane’s personal email address that he used at Eskom that you mentioned?     Okay, ja, you can look. MS     Evidence Leader.     Yes, and you think it might be quite a few that could be found?     Yes, if – have you found something Mr Seleka?     Okay, it does not involve Mr Koko but Miss Ms Daniels says there will be quite a few.  I guess whether in the bundles or not in the bundles, if they are not in the bundles you think they can be found easily Ms Daniels?     Ja, then they should come across those.      Okay, do you know whether there would be a category of emails where you would include the personnel emails, email addresses or in other words, how would one know when you include personnel email addresses of the Board members and when you do not or does it happen when it happens and then it did not happen when did not happen? For example, if you were sending minutes of the Board meetings, do you know whether you would include the personnel email addresses of the Board members, or at least of Dr Ngubane or is it when you were dealing with a different category of documents that you would include it?     Okay, so that is fine.  So…[intervenes]     ...or the period when you did that because that was because of the challenges ...[intervenes]      A special ...[intervenes]      Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     You... the investigators or somebody must just pursue that.       Ja.     Okay.     I am sorry Mr Seleka.     I just want to go back to this issue of Mr Koko saying that he was told by Ms Daniels that the infoportal address was for Dr Ngubane.   In your discussions – or when Mr Koko would send emails to Dr Ngubane, would those emails be opened by you and handed over to Dr Ngubane by yourself or would it be opened by his PA and handed over to him or would he open it themselves? Or, sometimes he would do so, sometimes they would do so and sometimes you would do so?     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.  Did you ever have an occasion to discuss with Mr Koko any emails or documents that he sent to the email address of Businessman, the infoportal email address at any stage giving that while you were both at Eskom?     So are you saying ...[intervenes]      ...you may have discussed documents that he would have sent to Businessman but if you – you would not know that he had sent them to Businessman.  That is what you are saying?     You never discussed a document that, to your knowledge, he had sent to Businessman?     Yes, but what I am saying is.  At the time of you discussing such documents.  You are saying you would not have known that he had sent them to Businessman?     You might found out later but at that time, you say you were not aware.  You would have discussed documents which might later on turn out to be documents that he had sent to Businessman.     H’m.  Mr Seleka, you may continue.     And you can take further whatever may arise from the evidence.     Is it Mr Koko who says that?     Oh.     Oh.     Ja.     So that interview was between Mr Koko and somebody not involving Ms Daniels as well?     Oh.     Oh.     And asked for her comment?     Ja.  Well, what did you say on that occasion Ms Daniels?     Yes.  Well ...[intervenes]      Would the implication of ...[intervenes]      Would the implication of that version, Mr Seleka, be that what Mr Koko told the interviewer in that clip and what he told the Commission are contradictory in the sense that in the Commission he said he understood the infoportal email address to be belonging to Dr Ngubane but in the clip that you say that was played to Ms Daniels, he does not say that email is Dr Ngubane’s but he says it is Ms Daniels?     H’m.     H’m.     But obviously, that clip – the entire interview should be obtained.     So that it can be looked at.     Ja.     So I think that should be done.     Ja, okay.     Ja, but I think the part of the point that had been – that Mr Seleka seeks to make is, the board was prevented from discussing this issue in a proper board meeting.  And it was sent a Round-robin resolution on the basis that this was urgent because there were – you were seeking to address an urgent coal supply demand.  Is it not?  That is what the resolution said, is that not so?     Yes, but it seems that the board could have met in a week’s time, it could have met in two weeks’ time, it could have met even in a month’s time to discuss this issue.  Is that not so?     And then when the management wanted the board to authorise this matter.  Are you saying that first there was an attempt to arrange for a board meeting to take place and there seems to be problems of the availability of members of the board and that is why the idea of a Round-robin was resorted to?  Is that what you are saying?     H’m?     So the ...[intervenes]      The idea that it should be a Round-robin, from whom did it come from?     H’m.  At that stage, do you know whether before the manager sent that memo or note or email.  Do you know whether there had been attempts to communicate with the board members to ask them to avail themselves for a meeting on some date discussing the issue?     So who would ordinarily speak to board members about a need for a meeting and who would talk to them about dates?  Would it have been the company secretary?     Yes.     But ...[intervenes]      Yes, continue.     H’m?     Okay.  Is my understanding correct that you yourself did not engage with board members prior to this email or letter from Mr Singh’s office?  You did not engage with board members and with the chairperson of the board, Dr Ngubane about possible dates for a meeting?     Okay but you say, Dr Ngubane was the person that approached you first and asked you to convene a meeting of the board?     Ja.  So at that stage, he was talking about convening a meeting rather than talking about a Round-robin arrangement?     Okay.  But later on, an email from     You said – I think you said you asked somebody whether Dr Ngubane knew about this latest idea of the Round-robin as opposed to a physical meeting.  Is that right?     And who did you speak to, the author of the email that was suggesting a Round-robin.     Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     Oh, yes I see it.     Okay. ADV SELEKA     Is that the same date Mr Seleka?  Is that the 8 t h?     Okay.     H’m.  So it may be that you may not have been correct including that the idea of Round-robin     H’m.     H’m.     Yes, okay.  I think ...[intervenes]      Or even a month if you ended up ...[intervenes]      If you ended up waiting for end of March.  Even in January, you could ...[intervenes]      It was not ...[intervenes]      There are no ...[intervenes]      ...that suggests that it was urgent that the decision be taken by the 10 t h or somewhere around there by the board.     Ja, ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka.     We might have taken too long on this issue.     I have in mind my own estimation that we should be able to finished about five, half-past five, six.  You might say maybe not but just try and move.  Of course, if there is still something of substance about the issue or urgency.     Then we can.  But I think we can move.     She has made the concession.     Ja.     Yes.     I think let us take a short adjournment.  It is four o’clock.  Ten minutes’ adjournment and then when we come back, we try and see if we can ...[intervenes]      ...go or another hour, hour and a half or two.  But I think we can try and cover as much as possible.     Okay alright.     We will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     Can I interpose, Mr Seleka, just on something that goes back, I am sorry that I am taking you back, do not forget your question.  Ms Daniels, tell me, how did Eskom’s need or even purportedly urgent need for – or to secure coal, coal supply, how was that addressed in December by a resolution authorising that a pre-coal a pre-agreement of coal supply be concluded with people who did not own the coal that you are talking about at that time?  The resolution itself says the agreement should be concluded with the proposed owners which obviously means conclude an agreement with not the owners but the proposed owners.  How did that address the urgent or the need for the security of coal supply?     Yes because also this was not even a situation where the idea was let us conclude an agreement with the proposed owners to say if and when you become owners you will supply us with coal on the following terms and conditions, this is not what was authorised, is that right?     Yes because if you were in – if you – if Eskom wanted to secure coal supply, the idea was to conclude agreements with the owners of coal.  Do you agree?     But at the time of the submission that you made to the board did you not appreciate this?     But it is difficult to think that – let me ask this question first.  Did Mr Koko say to you draft an agreement, draft a submission on the basis that we are asking the board to authorise that we conclude an agreement with the proposed owners of OCM for a pre-purchase.  Is that what he said to you?     And did he advance to you his reason of Eskom seeking to secure coal supply as the reason why it was urgent that the board provides authorisation?     Yes.  One of the things that I have said to a few members of the board, maybe two, maybe three who have testified, is it is difficult for me to understand how they could not have seen that the resolution that was being asked for, from them, was a resolution that they authorise the three Eskom officials to conclude a prepayment agreement with the proposed owners with Tegeta, so to speak and not with Glencore.  I have said that it is difficult for me to understand that they all did not see that because those that have come here seem to – maybe one said she saw it or he saw it, I cannot remember, but I think Dr Ngubane said he did not see it, he was under the impression or he, as far as he was concerned, the board was authorising the conclusion of this pre-purchase agreement with Glencore and not with Tegeta.  Dr Ngubane is a medical doctor, he has been a politician, he was a minister, he was a Premier of a province, he was an ambassador, I think he was or continues to be a businessman.  Then I had Professor – was it Professor Naidoo?     Ja, Prof Naidoo.  I do not know whether he was the one who said he did see it but nevertheless he still continued to think he was authorising a prepayment agreement with Glencore and I think Ms Klein may have said she did not remember whether she saw it or not but she also still thought that she was authorising a prepayment agreement with Glencore.  Now you are saying you did not pick up that point, is that right?  You saw that it was – you say you were instructed to draft a submission that would ask the board to authorise the conclusion of an agreement for prepayment with the proposed owners but you say it did not click to you that hang on, but why must we do that?  Is that what you are saying?     Yes, so – okay, so what is your position in terms of did you notice that the – you were drafting a submission that was saying the board should give a resolution that authorises the conclusion of an agreement with the proposed owners as opposed to the [indistinct] 12.30 owners at the time?     You say you did – you knew you were doing that?     Yes.  I am sorry, you say the underlying what?     Just repeat.     Just repeat the part that relates to what is underlying something?     There is a part that I could not hear because I think there was a technical problem.  Would you like to start that sentence again please?     I think the technology does not want me to hear the whole sentence.     But I think I understand you to be saying the submission and the resolution contemplated that the agreement would be concluded with Tegeta but I may be missing something else and I do not know whether it is something to say if you look at the submission or if you look at the resolution there is something that makes it clear that it is Tegeta that was contemplated.  Is that what you are saying?     Oh, okay, ja.  No, no, that is fine.  Obviously the agreement would have to reflect who all the parties to the agreement were and it had to reflect Tegeta as one of the parties because Tegeta was the proposed owner of OCM.     Ja.  But if you were aware that you were drafting a submission that would ask the board to authorise the conclusion of a prepayment agreement with the owners of OCM and not – or the proposed owners, that is Tegeta, and not Glencore, why did you not ask the question why are we – why do we seek to conclude prepayment agreement with people who do not own OCM when there are people who own the OCM now?  Why did you not ask Mr Koko that?     No but were you not the legal adviser as well as the company secretary at the time?     Which one were you not, or both?     Yes but is it not the job of the company secretary – does the job not of a company secretary include giving legal advice to the board?  I thought so.     Ja, but they might not ask …[intervenes]     But they might not ask because they do not know but you, as a legally qualified person, would see and then you can alert them to a potential legal problem, is it not?  And if somebody does not know, if …[intervenes]     If, as a judge, a scientist gives me a certain document that talks about some science, I might not pick up any danger but another scientist who looks at the document that might have been given to me might pick up something and say hang on, do not sign this, you realise that these are the implications?  So you too, as a company secretary, legally qualified – and my understanding is that a company secretary does advise on legal compliance and so on, so it would have been your job, would it not have been, to advise the board even if they did not ask for advice to say there is a problem here or at least please appreciate that this request, this submission requires you to authorise a, b, c, d in circumstances where ordinarily this should not be the case.  It seeks you to authorise that the pre-purchase agreement be concluded with none owners of OCM when they are current owners of OCM and you would need to say this is problematic, this is strange.  Or if you thought there is no problem, advise them, having alerted them to this unusual feature and advise them to say notwithstanding this, there is no problem because of a, b, c, d.     Ja, you see …[intervenes]     You see, it is difficult for me to accept that.  You know, as I see it, this is like a situation where you want to buy a car and you know that this car belongs to me but you go and conclude an agreement with Mr Seleka, you buy the car from Mr Seleka who does not own this car and you know I am the owner.  How do you not pick that up?     They were already?     Signed?     I am sorry, but did you not draft the submission yourself?     Yes but also, if they made changes and if this was one of the changes, all the more reason why you would need to say to them what you have now put in here is problematic, what is your reasoning, why did you put this in?   Because I am not sure …[intervenes]     I am not sure that saying that it came from them already signed or they made amendments, changes, anything, because to me it seems that the moment you knew that this document was asking the board to authorise the three officials of Eskom to buy from Mr Seleka a car that belongs to me and you know it belongs to me, that should be problematic.  Can you see that?     No, it is just a …[intervenes]     No, no, I do not think, Ms Daniels, it is about second-guessing.  None of these officials were lawyers, is it not?     You are not suggesting that you did not want to give them correct advice just because they were senior, correct legal advice because they were senior?     Yes, that is why I am saying to you if it would have been correct legal advice to say to them legally you cannot buy coal – you cannot conclude an agreement for buying coal from somebody who is proposed to be the owner and therefore currently has no right to that coal.  If that was correct advice it would not be wrong for you to raise that with them, would it?     You accept, h’m.  Is there something you wanted to add earlier on and I interrupted you?     Ja, you see, you have – well, maybe the three executives will say well, we knew that we were asking the board to authorise that we conclude a pre-purchase agreement with non-owners, with people who were not owners of the coal but here are our reasons which make this thing that appears to be so unusual, justifiable, which make it justifiable, we will see, but it is strange that about 12 or so board members, some of whom I think are quite highly qualified and they say they either did not see this in the resolution or if they saw it they did not think it meant anything, as far as they were concerned they were authorising a conclusion of an agreement with Glencore and this company secretary, who is legally qualified, says she saw it but she did not think it was her place to give legal advice to the officials.  You must just tell me if I am summing up what you say incorrectly.     Yes, 509.     Yes.     Yes.     I am sorry, just tell me which clause you are reading from?     “The submission and decision required  set out herein is based on the following key assumptions. 3.2.2 The transaction between Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd and Oakbay Investments/Tegeta Resources is formally approved by the regulatory authorities.” What does that mean in the context of the issue we are dealing with?     Yes but before they were removed tell me what their presence would have meant in the context of the question we are dealing with?     The transaction that you were talking about there, namely clause 3.1.2, what transaction are you talking about?     Yes but still that did not change the fact that at the time of the – that did not change the fact that the board was being asked to authorise the conclusion of this agreement at the time when Tegeta would not be the owners of OCM.     Ja.     Yes, but again even that still doesn’t answer the question why conclude such an agreement with a non-owner at the time, when there is a non-owner that is known to you as Eskom and as officials.     Sorry?     Well, you too, because you were the legal advisor, you were the Company Secretary, as far as I am concerned you were supposed to alert them that you cannot conclude an agreement with a non-owner of the coal when there is an owner, isn’t it?   You accept that?     Yes, Mr Seleka?     I am sorry, you might even have forgotten the question that you were on when I interrupted you but if you made a note – I hope you made a note and you remember.     Ja, ja.     Yes.     What page is that again?     Yes.     I’m losing him or he’s losing me as well now.     I am at 565 and I can see Mohamed Bobat but I see only the subject, I don’t see the actual content of the email.     Well at 566 I see an email from Mariam Cassim.     To Ms Daniels.       Repeat that.     Questions?     Okay.     Ja.      And who is giving the answers?     So, the email at the bottom of 565 comes from Mr Mohamed Bobat?     And this is on the morning of the day on which Mr Nhlanhla Nene was fired, 9 December 2015?     Yes, well on this day, Mr Mohamed Bobat, who the following day, I think on the 10 t h or 11 t h met with Mr Des van Rooyen and they discussed that Mr Bobat would be – his advice, our Chief of Staff, I forget who was Chief of Staff and who was advisor, but on the morning of the 9 t h of December he is engaged in some discussions involving what is happening or about to happen in Eskom in relation to Tegeta and coal and so on.     Okay, alright but – so are you saying that Mr Eric Wood was he sending to Mr Bobat the document on page 566?    559?      Right.     Ja, this is an email starting with the one on the top or the one at the bottom?     That is the one from Mr Singh, Anoj Singh?     Ja, that is addressed to Ms Daniels. ADV SELEKA     And who was Mariam Cassim?     One of?     Okay, of Eskom?     Alright.     Oh yes, that is – they would have – all the Board members would have received the email from Ms Daniels in closing the submission.     To the Board about this transaction.     And then she sends an email to Ms Daniels/Mr Anoj Singh, where she raises certain questions about the content or the subject matter of the submission.     Ja she asks four questions.     Okay.     Yes.     Oh, it’s forwarded to Mr Eric Wood by Mr Anoj Singh.     Who has received it from Ms Mariam Cassim.     Yes, okay.     And what page do we go to, to find that?     Oh, yes, okay.  So, he sends it to Mr Mohamed Bobat.     And…[intervenes].     Ja, okay 7h13 on the 9 t h of December.     Yes, right.     That’s 565.     Then Mohamed Bobat ...[intervenes]       ...replies to Mr Eric Wood.     At 8h04.     And the subject it still the same “urgent request to approve the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Pty Limited.     Okay, so ...[intervenes]      ...on the face of it, it is Mr Bobat who is providing answers.     Yes.     He is providing answers to questions that are – were asked by a member of the Eskom Board to officials of Eskom.     And not to him.     Yes, but what happened was that the Board members questions were sent to Ms Daniels and Mr Singh.     And Mr Singh passed his questions to Mr Eric Wood, Mr Eric Wood passed them to Mr Bobat, Mr Bobat provided the answers ...[intervenes]      ...in red at page 566.     And then sent these – the document at page 566 together which contains answers in red to the questions of the Board member to Eric Wood.     Who I assume will send it to Mr Anoj Singh.     Oh, there he says on the 9 t h of December.     Eleven minutes past eight in the     Those are the responses provided by Mr Mohamed Bobat.     Okay, right so well when I heard the evidence relating to Mr Bobat and his being appointed as either an advisor or Chief of Staff to Mr Des van Rooyen on the 10 t h or 11 t h in the manner in which that appointments seems to have been made, one of the questions I asked was whether he was not employed or could he be given an offer just like that and he is said to accept it, he doesn’t even want to go and think about it, he accepted on the spot and yet Mr van Rooyen was I think saying he didn’t know him, or he may have seen him once in six years or something, or maybe that was not Mr Bobat, maybe it was the other person. Okay, alright, well I am trying to – so now I know that on the 9 t h he was busy at Regiments with matters relating to Eskom.     Okay now I understand, now I follow, yes thank you Mr Seleka.     Page 554?     This is the email in the middle is from Pauli Ntochane ...[intervenes]      On behalf of Anoj Singh.     For some reason she emphasis the “on behalf of” Anoj Singh, she sends it at nine minutes past nine, December 9 2015 to Ms Daniels and she says     But she has filed and I guess that is something that Ms Cassim had not asked.     Oh she raised, h’m ...     Oh, “has this proposal been approved or recommended by the Board IFC”.     And the answer is a special Board IFC was held this morning to consider this matter and we were comfortable to recommend the approval to the Board.   So now this is being sent to Ms Daniels as answers that come from Mr Singh?     Okay.     This part, this question 5 was it among the questions from Ms Cassim, I’m talking about four questions.     Yes.     H’m, well obviously the question that arises is why Mr Singh was not able to respond to these questions raised by the Board Member on his own being the Chief Financial Officer of Eskom, and why he needed outside assistance.     Yes.     Yes, okay alright.     It is at page 556?     Oh.      At this stage Ms Daniels did you not know the journey that this email had travelled?     I mean question 2 was “please confirm that the coal will be purchased at a 5% discount to the price in the current agreement”, why should Mr Anoj Singh not know the answer to that question, why should he go back to Mr Eric Wood and the Tegeta people and Regiments, because that is information that ought to have been known to him at the time of – before there was the decision to make a submission to the Board, isn’t it?   Isn’t it Ms Daniels, is that not some information that he should have known actually all of them should have known?     H’m.   Okay, Mr Seleka?     Sorry?     Well the – I don’t want you to abandon important issues, so if it is important to do justice you can deal with them.     Well that is fine, but it may be that on some we can get information from Ms Daniels, because she was the Company Secretary and she had a duty to raise questions if she was being instructed to do things that she did not understand, or that were questionable.     So when I say let’s try and cover as much as possible I don’t mean that we deal with important matters in a superficial way.     And it was supplying at one-fifty?     Yes.     H’m.     But that question was, is Optimum the only mine that can supply coal to Hendrina.     The answer does not answer that question.  Instead, it talks about means of getting coal at a certain price.  It says there is no other means of getting coal at a price of R 150,00 per ton.  That is not what was     Okay.  And then the next question was    When you look at that answer.  There is no other means of getting coal at a price of R150 per ton.  To the extent that OCM was supplying coal at that price, that answer was misleading.  Would you not agree?     Because you did not need to – Eskom did not need to have a pre-purchase agreement with Tegeta in order to have coal at R150 per ton from OCM.  It did not need that transaction.     Yes.  So ...[intervenes]      Well, no it does not answer the question on the face of it but it seems to serve a certain purpose because the question did not talk about the means.  It     ...from Optimum from R 150,00 per ton.     Yes.   So this was misleading. It ...[intervenes]      It sought to convince board members.  It     Without any agreement with Tegeta.     You accept that?     And now...  You saw these answers including this one.  If you apply your mind to these answers before you sent them off to the board member, Ms Cassim.  Or they were sent by Mr Anoj Singh.     Did you apply your mind to them?     Mr Seleka.     I am sorry.  You were reading from what page?     554.     Ja, you can do that.     Did you say 724?     There are two emails there.  One from Matshela, 2010 and to Ms Daniels.  And another one from Businessman to Matshela, 2010.     Yes.     Did you 73, Mr Seleka?     773?     Okay.     One second, Mr Seleka and Ms Daniels?  Okay, please continue.     Mr Seleka we might have to take an adjournment or some time, what is your assessment, I suspect that there are still quite some matters to deal with.     Ja.     But the penalties one aren’t there still quite some issues, the opinions from CDH and so on?     What is your assessment?     Well it may well be that we must either make another time available for us to continue with that, because while we want to finalise the evidence of as many witnesses as possible within a short space of time we nevertheless want to deal with issues properly still.     So maybe we could find time.  In next week I will be having quite a few evening sessions, maybe we could look at the possibility of an evening session with her during the week after next.  Which week are you – are you here during that week?     Oh is that the first week of March.    H’m?     Well isn’t the 11 t h or 12 t h somebody else’s week, Transnet’s week?     Yes, but he therefore can’t say – he can’t propose to take Transnet’s slot and give it to you isn’t it?     From what you are saying it seems that he was saying that he would be available during the Transnet week for Eskom evidence?     Yes, but they are separate.     Yes, so in regard to your week he hasn’t given anything?     Ja, well – but he has been told that we don’t have time in terms of days so has to ...[intervenes]      ...make himself available, so but during the week of the first of March, that first week of March you say you will be doing Eskom evidence.     And did we finish Ms Klein’s evidence?     We are done with her?     Why does it ...[intervenes]      It seems that you are not sure.  I am trying to look at the witnesses that we haven’t – we still need to do under Eskom other than Mr Koko, Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Brian Molefe and Ms Lynn Brown.     Mr Zwane.     Romeo Khumalo.     Ja.     Ja, so we still have quite a few witnesses on Eskom.     I think let us – Ms Daniels?     How is our situation, to what extent would you be able to be available at short notice, when I say short notice like two days notice, three days notice, generally speaking?     Yes, no, no subject to you being accommodated on the time, two days, three days notice might well work, be fine for you?     Okay, alright.   Okay I think let us adjourn and we are going to try and have Ms Daniels back to finish her evidence.    Your estimate is how much time do you need to finish all her evidence and having done justice to the issues but not too much time.     That is for everything?     Oh, okay, so there is not a lot that is left, I just assumed it was still – okay alright, no we should find time.     Okay we will – I think Ms Daniels we will stop here for today but we will make arrangements.  Mr Seleka thinks that more or less an hour, another hour of your evidence might be enough to complete your evidence, so maybe if it takes longer it might be an hour and a half, so we will see but they will be in touch with you to see on what day we could do that.  It seems to me – oh by the way because of the difference in time we wouldn’t be able to – I wouldn’t be able to hear your evidence in the mornings before we start at ten, because you would be fast asleep at the time.     Okay, okay we will make a plan and then we will continue and then complete your evidence.     Okay, thank you very much, okay let us adjourn then, and I think next week I think I am listening, I will be hearing evidence relating to PRASA, I am just saying this for the benefit of the public and the media, but I think next week it is PRASA related evidence.   Okay, we will adjourn for the day, thank you to everybody for sitting until this time and working until this time. We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Good afternoon Chair.     We are Chairperson.     I should indicate that Ms Daniels is overseas.  So it is morning on her side.     I think we have Chair.     [laughs]     Thank you Chair.  Because of the lapse of time.     Thank you Chairperson.       Yes.     Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, the last time when she was here, she testified on the transactions and there was a couple of aspects in regard to the transactions, the Tegeta transactions, which involved a prepayment decision of R 1.6 billion.   She took us through that, the submission and the decision made in respect of that aspect.  We ended up with her, just having touched on the guarantee. That prepayment decision ought to be converted into a guarantee on the 10 t h of December 2015.  She touched briefly on that and we had to adjourn. She will continue from there Chairperson and also touch on the prepayment in regard to the R 659 million that was decided in April 2016.   And she will show by virtue of correspondence emails how parties outside of Eskom, even in respect of the guarantee, even in respect of the drafting of the underlining agreement to that guarantee, got involved in that drafting process, which is what she did, also, in respect of the submission for the R 1.68 billion. We will then touch on the McKinsey/Trillian matter insofar as Ms Daniels features there.  It is not a long aspect.  Just two aspects of the meetings of Trillian where she features Chair. And for that purpose, we would use two of her affidavits.  The one affidavit is already in Eskom Bundle 18A on page 236.  That is marked Exhibit U-34.1.     Then Ms Daniels provided an affidavit in the early hours of this morning Chairperson.  It has incorporated in Eskom Bundle 8(a).       Correct Chairperson.     And that is on ...[intervenes]      She responds to certain allegations made against her by those who – some of the witnesses who have come before the Chairperson.     And then she gives a section dealing with the Trillian/ McKinsey matter.     And that is the last part we will be addressing with her.     I might add also Chair.  We will touch on the R 2.1 billion penalties but very briefly in regard to that.  The new affidavit is on page 1079 in Eskom Bundle 8(a).     Is your page reference, the numbering the same as I have been mentioning?     Eskom Bundle 8(a).  It will on page ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Go to page 1079 of that bundle.  I think the electronic bundles are not giving alphabetical numberings.  Page 1079.     Not on your electronic bundle?     Okay let us...  You have ...[intervenes]      It is not incorporated.  Okay the pagination – if we follow the pagination at the foot of the page on your – on that supplementary affidavit.     If you have it separately it will be from page 1.     Yes.  On the cover sheet ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, I would use the pagination for the purposes of the record.     And then for her convenience, I could use the page numbers at the foot of the page.     So I will use it at the same time.     Simultaneously.     Is that...?     Yes.     Thank you Chair.     Ms Daniels, there is a cover sheet which is on or page 1079, a certificate of authentication.     Correct Chair.     I just wish you to place it on record so that we ...[intervenes]      I beg leave to have it admitted.     Correct Chair.     Just for the purpose for now.     Yes.  When you turn the page Ms Daniels, it is our page 1080.  That will be the first page of the affidavit.     Yes.  The affidavit runs up to – on our side it is page 1102.  On your side it is page 203.     A signature appears there.  Do you confirm that to be your signature?     Just above signature of deponent.  And the date of the affidavit is 18 February 2021.     You confirm that.  You confirm this to be your further affidavit – further supplementary affidavit to the Commission?     Thank you.  Ja, I beg leave to have it admitted as Exhibit U-18.     Okay.  Yes, Chair.     However, it does relate to her affidavit.     It reads    Yes.     It is printed out double-sided.     So it is on the flipside.     No.     Yes.     Exhibit number.     Yes.  Ms Daniels, the – back to the cover of – covering sheet which is the certificate of authentication in the affidavit you gave us early this morning.  Are you at ...[intervenes]      On that certification of authentication.  I have read the contents thereof to the record.  Do you confirm that to be a commissioner...  Well, in this case it is a Vice Consul, South African Consulate General in Los Angeles certifying the contents of your affidavit.     It has not been send through yet.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.  It will be U18.4.       Thank you Chair.  And then the affidavit of Ms Daniels which appears – which starts on page 1080, I beg leave to have that admitted as Exhibit U18.5.     She has Chair, yes.     Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, shall we then proceed with your testimony?  And you could have in front of you the affidavit, your affidavit on the transactions which is in Eskom Bundle 18, page 236.       The black, the black numbers.     Are you there?  I will not ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Ms Daniels, the last time you testified on how the board’s decision to make a prepayment of R 1.6 billion about, you had been instructed by Mr Koko, as you said, to do – to draft the submission.  That submission was proceeded by ...[intervenes]      Go ahead.     That submission was preceded by a letter which you had also been asked by Mr Koko to draft and have it addressed to the DMR.  Do you recall?     That letter formed part of the submission that was submitted to the board in order to motivate for the board’s resolution on the R 1.6 billion by way of a Round-robin.  Remember?     Ja.  And you took us through the drafting of that submission which went to Mr Eric Wood and ultimately to Businessman.     Now, that Round-robin decision of the board was made on the 9 t h of December 2015.  On the  t h of December, we see new developments in regard to that decision of the board.  And that new development is a conversion, for a lack of a better word, of the board decision for making the cash payment into a guarantee.  Do you remember that?     Now we have provided with Mr Anoj Singh’s affidavit.  In his affidavit ...[intervenes]      Yes.  In his affidavit, Mr Anoj Singh makes an allegation that, to the effect that you came up with the idea for that guarantee.  What is your response?     Now can you tell the Chairperson, why did you hold the view that it was possible for that board decision to be converted into a guarantee?     Is that the R 1.6 billion submission?     You have the – if you have the Tegeta reference.     That is right.     Yes, that is the correct one.     The submission ...[intervenes]      You want the one to the board or to the IFC?     Go to page...  Ja, do you want the submission or the resolution Ms Daniels?     Okay the board resolution then is on page 580.       Correct.  Bundle 18, yes.     Okay so for the purpose of the record.  You are on page 580 of Eskom Bundle 18?  Are you reading from paragraph 2.1.4?     Yes.  But then, you would have seen Mr Koko’s affidavit where he says the submission he made and prepared to the board did not incorporate a guarantee.  So the ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Sorry, can you see me when I speak?     Yes.  Okay what did you want to confirm?     Yes.  So that provision 2.1.4 you have just read, would have related to necessary steps in relation to the board decision for a prepayment?     We heard from Ms Naidoo, Viroshini Naidoo...  Oh, no that is in respect of the other two payments.  Oh, yes.  That Ms Cassim took part in the IFC meeting, teleconference of the board on the 9 t h of December 2015.       Now did you and him not discuss the possibility of taking the matter back to the board if you were going to convert a board decision into something else, other than what the board had decided?     Well, in fact, there was an email much earlier than that Ms Daniels.  Remember the email that Mr Koko receives from infoportal?  And he forwards that email to you and on the basis of that email you gave instructions to CDH.     Yes, Chair.     Sorry can I just, he does not necessarily say he does not know about the guarantee but what I am saying to you is he says the submission did not incorporate a recommendation for a guarantee, that is all I was saying.     Yes, I hear what the Chairperson is saying.     Yes, I think Chair the ultimate issue turns on the purpose of either the cash payment, I mean for our purposes, either the cash payment or the guarantee.  The ultimate purpose that was meant to be achieved or objective to be achieved by issuing either the cash or the guarantee.      Yes.     Yes.      Is it not the Chairperson looking at ultimately which one is the worst of the two?  Because on the face of it, the resolution is, it contemplates a cash payment.  So steps to be taken are in relation to the cash payment.  What the Chairperson is saying is, but is that not in itself to take all the necessary steps to give effect to the above?  Does that not open the door for them to do even the less of the two worst situation?       I mean, I have mulled over that Chairperson I know that the guarantee would have in the minds of the executive be more safeguarding to the interests of Eskom exactly for what Ms Suzanne Daniel is saying that the cash constraints at the time, financial constraints at the time in regard to Eskom and maybe the Board does not have a leg to stand on.     Yes.     Well, Chairperson I wanted to add that in terms of the PFMA that you may well say well that is exactly what the Board did but in terms of the PFMA, the guarantee can only be issued by the accounting authority in the case of Eskom.  I think Ms Suzanne Daniels, you can explain that we did go through that and I know that the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, there was a debate about whether it does not require ministerial prior approval, having lifted the provisions of the PFMA, actually, in this case, the accounting authority.  But I am also mindful of what Ms Naidoo said that the Board, I think she said the Board had the authority only up to R750million to issue a guarantee. So beyond that, according to her, then you will require ministerial approval. I think Ms Suzanne Daniels can explain that to us.     Yes.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I am with you.     Chair I think what - the way I have seen it is to restrict the resolution to a cash pre-payment     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, because, well, if you take it to its logical conclusion the guarantee would simply defer the date of payment.     Ja, because that is exactly what they even say here in their agreement.      I will check in suspension…[intervene]     I am looking for her email where she seeks, invites the Board members to a round robin.     Ja, this on page 524 Ms Daniels it does not show the email address it shows the name of Dr Ben Ngubane that is where you send an email requesting the Board to make a round robin decision on the 9 t h of March.     I found it on page 571 on Eskom bundle 18, 571 but it is only an exchange between Ms Suzanne Daniels and Dr Ngubane.     ...of the anti in Eskom?     Thank you.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.  Or I can address other emails to the board members with private email addresses which is not Eskom email addresses but Mr Koko is not in that correspondence.   Ms Daniels, just – okay so we have traversed the issue of the guarantee.  It is issued in favour of Tegeta.      Which is in Clause 5 of the Agreement by the ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Ja.  I will send the broadcast Chair     Yes.     It is exactly on these lines to say ...[intervenes]      He is interviewed and he tells the interviewer ...[intervenes]      ...that the email address is – the infoportal1@zoho.com is Ms Daniels’ email address.  So he     Correct.  Ja, it did not involve her.      So there is a previous interview with – of Mr Koko.  This time Ms Daniels has – is on the station for an interview.  Then they played the clip.     The previous clip of Mr Koko.     And asked for her comment, yes.     In the clip yes Chair.  I should say that, I do not think they played the entire interview of Mr Koko.     They played a clip and then they asked Ms Suzanne Daniels to comment and they asked her further questions on that.     So ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Thank you.       Ja.  Ms Suzanne Daniels, quickly on...  Okay so the board is approached on the basis that there is an urgent need for coal in terms of the submission.  Or was it the submission on page 527 of Eskom Bundle 18? But I suppose you accept this is the gist on which or the basis on which the board was approached to make a Round-robin decision overnight on the 9 t h  of December 2015?     Ja.  And when ultimately the board decision is executed or implemented, it results in a guarantee being issued but the guarantee is subject to suspensive conditions as well as the underlining agreement in that guarantee and that is the period of three months, for about three months, until 31 March 2016.     Which – on the basis of which Mr Anoj Singh testified at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee that he was aware that coal was not going to be supplied during that period.  Hence he opted for a guarantee as opposed to a cash payment.  I do not know whether you know about that?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.  Well, that is alright.  And then – I mean at Clause 6.1 of the Pre-purchase Agreement which     The point I am trying to make is that, the execution of the board decision by deferring everything for three months, it undercuts the motivation of an urgent need for coal to the Hendrina Power Station. So it weakens the very motivation why the board had to make this decision on an urgent basis for to avert a risk which was said to be eminent at the time.  You see the point I am making?     Yes.     Can I assist you?     Yes, thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, please check on page 492 of Eskom Bundle 18, please.  There is an email there.  You can identify it to the Chairperson and say whether this could be the email that you are talking about.  Page 492 Chairperson.     So that ...[intervenes]      Yes.,     But the draft that was prepared – I mean, there is an attachment to this email.  The draft itself which comes before this email already bore the word Round-robin submission to the board if you go to page 481.   And I think all the drafts before them, even page 475.  Page 475 even better because it has the track changes which I think were made by officials of Trillian.  It is attached to the email of Mr Mohammed Bobat and Faheema Badat on page 474.  They already had Round-robin submission to the board.       That email...  Yes, Chair the email trails, they start way back.  They are on the 8 t h.  They are     [Indistinct]      Thank you Chair.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.  Indeed Chair.  I mean, the suspensive conditions in the pre-purchase agreement and the guarantee ...[intervenes]      ...the allegation of urgency.     Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I will try less than two hours Chair.  Let us see what happens.     Thank you.     Thank you Chair.   Ms ...[intervenes]      I did but she answered it during – ja her first interaction with you Chair, when she said the motivation was to help to get the purchase of this …[indistinct] ...[intervenes]     ...so because that can only be the explanation for this astounding decision, Ms Daniels.     And Chair, you see, Ms Daniels the inclusion of this proposed owner, one can trace it back, the emails, well maybe you don’t trace it back because by that time the submission was made but you could see when one of the Board members sent you questions, and I want to refer you to the page so we can run quickly, through what I want to – what I want you to point out to the Chairperson if you could please be on page 559.  So, one of the Board members sends you questions after you’ve sent the submission to them, that the Board should make a round robin decision on the 9 t h of March and that’s Ms Mariam Cassim on page 559.     The questions are there on the 8 t h of December 2015 you’ve just sent them your request which we see on – at the bottom of page 560 you sent it at 5h52pm on 8 December 2015, she responds at 9h28pm on the same date and that email goes to – she asks questions, you received the email and then you forward it to Mr Anoj Singh.  Mr Anoj Singh takes that email on the 9 December, the next day and he forwards it to Mr Eric Wood.  Mr Eric Wood takes that email on the 9 t h of March and he forwards it to Mr Mohamed Bobat, you see those emails on page 559?     And what does Mr Mohamed Bobat do with this is apparent on page 562.  So, the email now comes from him, also 9 March 2015, he’s replying to Mr Eric Wood and the subject line is, “Urgent request to approve the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum”. And now you see that there is a font in red colour which are inserted against the questions on page 562.     You there?     Was it apparent to you that, the answers to the questions were coming from outside and not from…[intervenes].     And not from Mr Anoj Singh himself?     So, to you they came from Mr Anoj Singh?     There – if you go to page 565, at the bottom of page 565 which goes over to page 566, there is, again this email from Mr Mohamed Bobat, 9 December 15 at 8h04am to Mr Eric Wood and on the next page you see further additions to the answers that are being provided.  Now you see both the additions in red and now there are those in blue, page 566.     Are you there?     And the answer, this time around, the answer to the first question it incorporates the concept, potential buyer.  So, the last – the answer to paragraph one, the last part, which is in blue, it says, “Consequently, Eskom is thus in no worse financial position than before the transaction but has mitigated the security of supply risk and has funded its working capital financing cost via the discounts being offered by the, and you see that word, potential buyer”. You see that?     And these questions answered in this way by, what potentially looks to be Mr Mohamed Bobat, were ultimately forwarded to Ms Cassim.  You remember you would have taken those answers and forwarded the email to her.     Let’s see because…[intervenes].     Ja, on page, let’s see, on page 656 where I was, on the bottom of the page is that email of Mr Mohamed Bobat at 9 December 2015 at 8h04 about that…[intervenes].     Page 565, Chair.     Yes, at the bottom of that page.  So, it is Mr Mohamed Bobat replying to Mr Eric Wood, they have kept the same email of Ms Mariam, they’re simply adding answers to her questions. Mr Eric Wood then forwards that email to Mr Anoj Singh, 9 December 2015 at 8h11, so he received it at 8h04, he forwards it 8h11 to Mr Anoj Singh so he says, “Please see responses below, as discussed, regards Eric”. The email above, is then Mr Anoj Singh, Chairperson at 8h55 on the 9 t h of December he seems to reply to his PA, Polly Ndzotyana, that was Mr Singh’s PA, Mr Daniels?     Page 565.     Yes, Chair, it starts on page – well it goes over to 566.     Yes.     Yes, but what you see there Chair, it’s an edited email of Ms Mariam Cassim because her original email only has questions.     Her original email, Ms Daniels, only has her questions.     Yes.     Question 1, 2, 3 and 4.     What you are seeing there now, the fonts which are in red and blue are the answers to those questions.     So, then you see – if you go back to 565, when Mr Eric Wood forwards the email to Mr Anoj Singh, he says, “Please see responses below as discussed”.     Yes, Chair.     I believe so Chair.     Indeed.     Yes, Chair so that Chairperson can follow, let’s start where I started, page 559.     559.     Those are the original email.     We should start with the one in the middle.     The one from Ms Mariam Cassim.     She was one of the Board members.     One of the Board members.     Yes.     So they would have received the email from Ms Daniels on page 560.     Correct Chair.     Correct.     Correct Chair.     Yes.     And you will see there, there are no red fonts or blue…[intervenes].     That email Chair, is forwarded, if you go up, is forwarded to Mr Eric Wood by Mr Anoj Sing on the 9 t h.     Yes.     Correct, who also received it.     And sent from her Iphone, then you go up, you see Mr Eric Wood then forwards it on to Mr Mohamed Bobat.     It’s above, the one above Chair.     That’s correct.     At 7h13.     On the 9 t h of December.     So, that’s outgoing, that’s outgoing, now, on the page where we were, you see the replies, the responses.     That’s 565.    Replies.     At 8h04.       Yes.     Yes and they are keeping this email of Ms Mariam Cassim now they had aired that responses to her questions.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     Correct Chair.     Not to him.     Yes.     The answers.     Correct.      Yes, ja, he requested ...[intervenes]      Which is exactly what he is saying     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     Then it seems they are not saying their sense to his PA, he says to his PA on that same page the PA ultimately Chair, the emails are not in sequence, Chairperson will have to go to page 554, she ultimately forwards it to Ms Suzanne Daniels.     554.     On behalf of.     That is right.     As is.     That is the question ...[intervenes]      It says has – let’s see.     Yes.     Correct.     In fact ...[intervenes]      Yes, that question wasn’t there, but it would have been a request made by Ms Veroshni Naidoo.     Ms Daniels will recall, she was here Chairperson and she said she asked kindly ensure that IFC approves the submission.     Yes indeed Chair.    And this is about the submission so this is before the guarantee, it is the submission, I know in his affidavit he gives an answer but the answer relates to the guarantee, why he went out again to seek advice from Eric    So that email Chair if the Chairperson is still on page 554 at the top of that page is then Ms Suzanne Daniels, after having received the email from Ms Dasinski she forwards it to Ms Merriam Cassim.     554.     554 Chair.  So then Ms Daniels is able to respond ...[intervenes]      Ja, and she also says “see below, best regards”.     Thank you Chair.   Ms Cassim ultimately responds Chairperson and says she is happy with the responses.     I say Ms Cassim then approved saying she is happy with the responses, her email is attached to her affidavit Chair which is in a separate bundle. Chair we could go to those questions, but in the interest of time let’s see when those who ...[intervenes]      Ja, I think it may be more appropriate to ask Mr Singh about the questions, his questions, his answers I beg our pardon.    Yes.     Yes.   Well Ms Daniels – I think what I could ask you in regard to these questions, perhaps is the one – number 4 which is on page 555.  The question they     Ja.  Well, this is might take us back to that question of the owner and proposed owner because at the time the owners were OCM/Glencore.   And the question is whether as a matter of fact...  Well, whether the board was told.  Now that is a matter of act.  OCM was still supplying coal to Eskom at this time.   So this question which is seeking to enquire from you for the executives whether OCM is the only mine that can supply to Hendrina.   Should it not have been answered by – and that would have defeated the submission – if it was answered     It was supplying at one-fifty per ton.     And it had said    And they will carry on with the agreement as it was.  So that question needed a correct answer.  What is your comment on that?     Okay.  No, I am not saying you should have answered that.  I am asking, again, whether – if you were aware that OCM was in fact supplying coal?  OCM had undertaken to supply coal at the price of the existing CSA.       Yes, that ...[intervenes]      Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     Indeed.     Yes.     H’m.  Alright.  Let us see, point – question 4 has – it has an element of confusion in it and it seems to require an explanation from the board in clear terms. You...  I mean, it should – a question asked in     But that confusion is not clear.  Look     554 Chair.     The answer to question 1.       Yes.     H’m.  Ja and the use of OCM and potential buyer, it is so confusing.  But Chair, I want to move on to the next point.     Yes.  Ms Daniels, let us – like the emails we have seen in regard to the – what was that – the drafting of...?  You say the emails you are getting a drafting of the submissions or we saw the emails now regarding the answers to Ms Miriam’s questions, Ms Miriam Cassim. Now let us look at what happens in regard to the underlining agreement which starts on page 724, the terms of which starts on page 724, Eskom Bundle 18.     Because that underlining agreement also has an evolution similar to what we see the pattern to be in regard to this transaction.       Are you there?     724 Chair.     That is correct Chair.     So we have looked at these emails but just in order to contextualise what I would like Ms Daniels to show the Chairperson.  Are you there Ms Daniels?     Yes.  So that is the beginning of the guarantee terms and the underlining agreement, ultimately.  So the email ...[intervenes]      The email comes for Businessman after twelve midnight on 10 December 2015 to Mr Matshela Koko, 2010.  It is a two-pager.  He forwards that to you at     Yes.  On page 7...  Let me see.  Page 743.     743, it is a repeat of your email to     Yes.  So it is a repeat of your email which Mr Moodley receives and he forwards it to – I do not know whether it is mister or miss - Badia(?) Maasdorp.     A mister.  Also an attorney at CDH.     And the attachment is, Letter     Yes.  What he is asking there is because the underlining agreement only has Eskom and Tegeta as the parties to their agreement.  Is that right?     Well, then on page 744 you sent an email or the drafts to Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Matshela Koko     Yes. “The interest payable. We will need to confirm.” Now page 749 Chairperson.  What does Mr Singh do with what you have sent to him?  So on page 7...  Let us start on 748.  I beg your pardon.     Ja, 748.     There is your email again to Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Koko to the bottom of the page which goes to Mr Anoj Singh.  What happens at the top of the page?     And the attachment follows on the next pages until page 751.  Then turn to page 752.  There are two emails ...[intervenes]      You are there.  There are two emails there.  The bottom one is from Anoj Singh.     The 10 t h of December 2015.  I think it     Gmail.com.  10 December 2015 at     Now we do not see or the investigators have not been able to find how the agreement comes back if at all it came back to Eskom but the last email we have is on page 753 which is an email from you to Mr Anoj Singh, again attaching what you are saying is the     Now the amendments are not apparent from the documents but who would have made amendments?     Did you ...[intervenes]      Oh, did you personally make this ...[intervenes]      Yes, did you personally make amendments?     Yes.     Yes.     Are you saying you inserted the date for the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions?     Yes, that was going to be my next question.  So where did you get the date of 31 March 2016 from which is Clause 5.1 of the document?     Did you know that on the same day,  December 2015, Tegeta/Oakbay was concluding an agreement with Glencore/OCH which had exactly the same expiry date, 31 March 2016 for the suspensive conditions in that agreement?     You did not know that at the time?     You say you did not know at the time?     Can you hear me?     Just repeat that again.     I see.  So what did – I mean if you look at this, the document that relates to an underlining pre-purchase agreement with Tegeta.  Why did it have to be sent to Mr Eric Wood and Mr Salim Essa?     Okay.  And we see that subsequently – subsequent to this exchange...  Well, just before that.  Did you ask him why should this agreement be subjected to suspensive conditions in the first place?  Because the submission required the board to urgently make a decision in order to avert a risk of coal supply.     Well, you know the submission is made to the board on the basis of urgency.  So the question is to what extent this pre-purchase of coal agreement, if you ask the board to urgently make the decision.  That is one.  Number two is, why suspend it for three months?  Did you ask that other one, the second question?     I see.  Now, the BTC did ultimately have a meeting on the 11 t h - on the 13 t h of April 2016.  Did you attend the BTC meeting?      And we see from the minutes that Mr Singh tendered an apology to the BTC about what he said were issues he had not disclosed to the BTC regarding the going concern of Tegeta, Tegeta’s going concern status?     Can you tell the Chairperson a little bit about what those issues were?     So Tegeta’s bank accounts had been closed?     Well it shows that they were, the minutes shows that they were closed or frozen.     But go further about the security because there were certain things you needed to do prior to the pre-payment being made.  One of them was to consider whether this was a feasible transaction for Eskom.     When you do say that in your affidavit, but by the time the payment was made, what was the position in regard to those pledges and securities?     Yes, so you say in your affidavit    Please proceed.     Yes, you also say at 85, the pledge and security agreement was not yet in place.     Did you draw that to the BTC’s attention?     So when did you become aware that payment was made?     Then let me just quickly paint the picture for you because this agreement is concluded or the pre-purchase submission, pre-payment submission made in April 2016 leads to the conclusion of an agreement, a short term agreement with Tegeta.  But this time Tegeta had been in short term agreements with Eskom in respect of our Arnot Power Station from January 2016.  So they have a short term agreement in January 16 and another short term agreement in February 2016, which was to end in April 2016.  Those agreements Dr Nteta has confirmed in respect of those agreements, that Tegeta did not ask for a pre-payment.  Were you aware of these facts?     Okay, were you aware that Tegeta was supplying Eskom with coal at Arnot Power Station?     Well, then they were supplying at Arnot and Dr Nteta has said the supply plan of April 2016 cannot be relied upon as a reason for urgency for this decision, for those two things, and there was in fact also no reason to ask for a pre-payment for the extension of the agreement that at the time existed. The only motivation, and I would like to hear your comment on this as received from the evidence was again Eskom taking a step to financially assist Tegeta in paying what on that day of the 11 t h was a shortfall by Tegeta to pay off the purchase price, in respect of OCH.  Your comment on that?    Chair we will show the evidence in due course of that money how it travelled from Eskom to Tegeta and the Bank of Baroda ultimately.  Ms Daniels we did touch on the penalties when you were here last time, did we?     Ja, but anyway, what is intriguing about these penalties that even before Eskom issued a letter of demand in July 2015.  CDH the attorneys for Eskom at the time, say that they had advised Eskom of the challenges in regard to not only the calculation of the penalties and the methodology, but also the evidence to prove the figures that Eskom had calculated in order to arrive at that R2.17billion. They talk about a memo 11 – at least at the very latest in March 2015 raising these concerns, but we know that Mr Koko and Mr Brian Molefe had said that – and they do in their affidavit, that Eskom was entitled to this R2.17billion.  Were you not aware of OCH’s concerns in regard to this amount before the letter of demand?     So when did you become involved with the claim for penalties?       And you say in your affidavit that your observation was that Mr Koko had shown a keen interest in the matter?     Was that your question to him?       Was that your question to him?     And what was the response?     But the matter ...[intervenes]      I have the last matter of McKinsey Trillian.     I could take less than 30 minutes with it.    Ja, there is ...[intervenes]      If she doesn’t – but the tricky part was – it is not a tricky part but the distinguishing aspects with Ms Daniels is that if she did not know about these opinions given already in 2015 and she comes later once can go into the details of them with her.     Yes.     That is the one I am in, the first week of March Chairperson.     Yes, I could just enlighten the Chairperson ...[intervenes]      I could inform the Chairperson in regard to recent correspondence with Mr Anoj Singh’s attorneys, I have seen correspondence from them that they would be available either on the 11 t h or the 12 t h of March.  For Eskom Chair had given him a date of the 3 r d of March, so that becomes an open slot, if the Chair accommodates him on the 11 t h or the 12 t h.     I think the date of 11/12 was proposed through him in the letter from Transnet work stream.     [laughing]     I think he was dealing with both Eskom and Transnet at the same time Chair.      They are separate issues.     No.     I will engage further.     Correct yes.     We did Chair.     We are done with her ja, we finished by videolink.     Am I not giving a convincing answer?     Yes, Mr Zwane.     Mr Romeo Khumalo.     And Mr Tsotsi has tendered to come back.     To deal with all the allegations coming out here against him.     Yes.     Yes Chairperson if we go into the details of the opinion of the CDH we could take an hour with Ms Daniels, an hour, an hour thirty minutes, ja that’s my estimation.     For the balance of what is remaining.     Yes.     Thank you. 
MS DANIELS:   Good afternoon Chair.     Good afternoon Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     Yes.  Thank you Chairperson.     Yes, I do.     Uhm ...[intervenes]      I have just got Eskom Bundle 8.     I do not think it is incorporated into this bundle Adv Seleka.     No.     No, it is not.     What page number would that be?     Oh, yes I do have it separately.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     That is correct.     I confirm that that is my signature.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I have that.       Yes, that is correct.     I have the original here Mr Chairman.     And it ...[intervenes]      So ...[intervenes]      Yes, Mr Chairman I had to attend there in person.     To have it signed and commissioned.     What numbers are you using Mr Seleka, the red or the black ones?     [No audible reply]      I am there.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, that is correct.       That is correct.  Yes, that is correct.       Yes, that is correct.       Yes.     Yes, you have.     No, that is incorrect Mr Chairperson.  I am not quite sure how the guarantee discussion came about but there was a memorandum from the Eskom Treasurer, Ms Caroline Hindley on the guarantee which Mr Singh discussed with me.   In it she sets out the advantages of not paying out the cash and limiting the risk to Eskom.  It was on that basis that he then asked me is it possible to do that and I advised that yes it is in terms of the resolution that was provided by the board.     Mr Chairman, in the resolution there is a tax all fares.  I am just struggling to get to the submission.       The R 1.68 billion so that I can read it.       I am at Eskom Bundle 18.     Is that the correct one?     Uhm ...[intervenes]      Can you just help me with...     To the board would be the one that I would reference.     The resolution would be fine Mr Seleka.     And this is Bundle 18?     Okay I am almost there.  Okay.  The resolution that I – the part of the resolution that I relied on     Yes, that is correct.     No, it did not.     I can see you now, yes.     No, it did not – it did not specifically mention a guarantee.     That is correct.     Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman.     Mr Chairman, not at that stage.  On the 9 t h, there was no talk of a guarantee.  It was purely a prepayment to the proposed purchaser of Optimum.  On the – I think it was on the morning of the 10 t h, the email from the ABSA person came through and that was the first indication of a guarantee consideration.     Are you referring to the email of Mr Koko?     [No audible reply]      That is correct, Mr Chairman.     That is correct.     That is correct, Mr Chairman, my view at the time that it was wide enough to include the guarantees based on the fact that the motivation set out by the Eskom Treasurer Ms Henry was to mitigate the risk of paying out that amount of cash.     Yes, Mr Chair, and one of those steps was to lay out the amount or pay the amount of R1.68 billion in cash to the supplier.     It was going to come after the conclusion of the coal agreement.     It was actually – if you look – if you…     If you look at the coal agreement it is actually in there upon signature that the supplier would be paid with the – paid the amount of 1.68 billion.     That is how I recall it, Mr Chair.     Yes, I am, Mr Chair.     Sorry, Mr Chair, I lost the sound there.     Yes, I can hear you now.     That is what I am talking about.     Yes, Mr Chairman.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     That is correct it was a very open – what is the word, a blanket authority to conclude the agreement.     That is correct, usually – that is correct, Mr Chairman, that was my understanding because when we do negotiate and conclude there is no need to go back to the board, you know, for permission to conclude.     Yes, I agree with that.     Yes, in general, Mr Chair, that would be the understanding.     Yes.     Yes, Mr Chair, it in effect was the payment of cash up front, upfront cash of 1.68 billion.     To the supplier.  If you strip away all the legalities.     I mean, not the legalities, I mean, you know, the wording.     What it effectively meant is that Eskom – that the board authorised upfront cash payment of 1.68 billion.     Well, Mr Chair, that is correct, and that is why, you know, the issuing of the guarantee, as strange as it may seem, was actually a better risk mitigation factor for Eskom because can you imagine had we paid the money in cash over to the supplier, there would have been greater issues.     So it was for that reason that, you know, I – when Ms Henry – she put it in a memorandum and you will see from her memorandum that she actually it is better for Eskom and I supported that within the ambit of what was provided because it was a better option for Eskom to hold on to the cash than to give it to a supplier because we would have given 12 months of cash actually.     That is correct and that was the reasoning that we adopted.     Mr Chairman, based on the communication, yes, it did come from outside but I think in our execution it was better for Eskom to issue the guarantee.  I just cannot remember the timing, Mr Seleka, if you can just show me the email.     I think it came on the morning of the 10 t h as well.     Yes, I am there.     Yes, I am following, Mr Chairman.     Yes.     Ja, I am going to look at it then answer the aspects of your question in the following manner and tell me if I am interpreting correctly.   Number one, my instructions regarding the guarantee came from Mr Koko so for Mr Koko to say that he does not know about the guarantee, I mean, it is clear from the evidence that he forwarded the email to me.  We had a discussion and that is how I instructed CDH on the matter.     Second ...[intervenes]      That is, that is – oh okay, that is correct in terms of the guarantee was not specified as an instrument, okay.   However, what the Board did authorise was the upfront payment of cash, the amount of R1.68billion and it was in that context that we looked at the risk, to Eskom, I cannot remember what, I just lost my thought.     Mr Chairman, at the at the time I did not know because you can see from the email it came from Mr Matshela Koko, and then it came from Businessman, based on the evidence and the other emails, you know, it was more than likely that this list of business plan is Mr Salim Essa.     Because…[intervene]     Well because later on in the email exchange both the investigators, and I think it was in 2018 the Mail and Guardian showed me the emails and they are included in the bundle that the paperwork that we prepared inside of Eskom actually went to Mr Salim Essa and Mr Eric Wood.     Ah, no Mr Chairman, I think Mr Koko is trying to mislead the Commission.  I at no stage told him that the info portal address or businessman address belongs to Dr Ngubane.  I did not use it; I categorically deny that.  Dr Ngubane had a personal email and it was Baldwin[?] - I am just reading from my affidavit that I - the latest one I submitted.      It is baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com. That was his personal address that you used at Eskom and there would have been no reason.      Yes, it was as far as I know yes, it was.  I think Mr Koko in his…[intervene]     I am not sure at the time was the Mr. Chairman, but he would have known about it because on the correspondence that I would have sent out, you would see on the correspondence to the Board and the executives, I would have used their Eskom and their personal addresses. So it would have been known to the executives.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.     I think if you actually look at the round robin resolution, Mr Chairman that I sent out, I am just trying to get the page it may just be on there as well.     It is on Eskom 18, oh no that is just Anoj Singh.     But I am sure we can find an email for you Mr Chairman where we, where I sent it to everybody.     Yes, there will be quite a few, Mr Koko was quite involved in some of the decisions that were made.  So he would be well aware that Dr Ngubane’s address is baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com.     Yes, Mr Chairman, I think if you, if the investigating team does a search on the emails that I sent to the Board members and executives, you will find them.     Yes, you will definitely come across those.      Mr Chairman, during this time, you know, in the early stages of let us say 2015/2016 Eskom’s IT system did not - was not sort of compatible for some of the Board members.  So they asked - so you would find that I had to send it to both the Eskom address and the personal email address.   So I did not have a defined category yet, you know, as to when I would send, so you would see on the emails that I would send it to the Gmail address and the Eskom address.     So it was ...[intervenes]      Yes.      Yes.  And I think that even when Eskom developed an app for the board members, you know, a secure portal, there was still problems with the board members and they would ask that it be send to their personal emails.  And that is why you see personal emails, work emails...  You know, there is a mixture.  It was not yet ...[intervenes]      ...in terms of a board portal yet.      Yes, I do.     It would be a combination of the three, the last scenario that you mentioned Mr Chairman.     I did not have direct access to mister...  Sorry, Dr Ngubane’s email at Eskom.  That would be the prerogative of the PA.     And she would bring to my attention if there were emails that she was not sure what to do with.     Dr Ngubane did attend at the Eskom office.  Then he would also go through his emails.     And if he received emails on his personal email that he needed, he would send them to me.     So it really depended on what the nature of the email was and what he wanted done.     Chair, Businessman or...  You see, it is a difficult one.  The subject matter of the transactions, we did discuss.  It was not – I was not aware that he had sent them to the infoportal.   You would see in my supplementary affidavit that I filed today or yesterday, that I do highlight some transactions based on Ms Matjeko’s evidence but he would discuss with Dr Ngubane if it were a board matter.       And ...[intervenes]      That is what I am saying.     Well, at the time Mr Chairman because if I – when I listened to the evidence that has been coming out, there have been documents that have been sent to Businessman that came before the board and were discussed with Mr Koko.     That is correct Mr Chairman.     Yes, that is correct.     He got me fixed up Mr Chairman.     To even be ...[intervenes]      ...that ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     I saw it – you brought it to my attention in our discussions.  I saw that.  I really cannot make sense of it.     Because the – I think the coal supply and it was effective from the 1 s t of January 2016 subject to those suspensive conditions.     So it is really a much about muchness.     Yes.     Yes, I see the point that you are making Adv Seleka.     Mr Chairman, I think the – you know if you look at the submission closely, the underlining issue was security of supply.  And I think that was a little bit broader than just the urgency of like an immediate need.  So yes it was premised on urgency but it was delayed at the end of the day.     That is how it was framed Mr Chairman.  So, yes, but I just want to point out that, you know, I think that in the beginning it was supposed to be a meeting but because the board members were not available during that time, it then became a Round-robin resolution.  And yes, the executives did push the urgency factor at that point in time.     That is so Mr Chairman.     Chair, my – what I am saying is, when Dr Ngubane approached me, he wanted me to convene a meeting.       As the discussions went along, you will see there is an email of the CFO’s office, Mr Singh’s office, asking for it to be a Round-robin.  And I do ask, as the Chairman knows about this, because my understanding was that he wanted a meeting.  It then became a Round-robin because it was urgent.       And ...[intervenes]      There is an email from the general manager from Mr Singh’s office asking that it be sent out and now a Round-robin.     Well, Mr Chairman I was still checking availability during that time.  It really happened so quickly.  It was already the first week in December and people were already going on holiday.       Yes, that would have been – at that time that was me.       I was the Company Secretary.     It was mister...     The Chief of Director also spoke to the board members directly.       So, you know, Mr Singh and executive directors were the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Executive.  So they would – you know, as part of the board they would discuss it with the board members. Sometimes I would just be told that we need a meeting, but in this instance, I had been approached by Dr Ngubane to say try and arrange a meeting and I would get the information from Mr Singh and Mr Koko. As things unfolded, there was an email from – I think it was Ms Naidoo, asking that this go out on Round-robin and he was in the office of Mr Singh.     I actually did not get a chance to do that.  I had already checked some of the people’s availability.  There were some committee meetings still happening at Eskom but there was no place for a board meeting at that point.     Yes, he did.  He called me.     That is correct.  That is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I did.  And I also subsequently spoke to Dr Ngubane and asked him and he was fine.  You will see – that is why the email says at the request of the chairman.  I sent it out in Round-robin.     Yes, that is the email that I am talking about Mr Chair.     That...  Yes, that is the request.       ...Chair.     Yes, that is the 8 t h of December Mr Chairman.     I might have got the time sequence wrong there.     But at this time, Mr Chairman the – so the availability of the board members was the issue.     So in this period, we would not have had been able to have a meeting but you are correct in saying it could have been pushed out by a week or two.    But as of this ...[intervenes]      Yes, that is correct.  I mean, it was ...[intervenes]      It was not...     Alerts(?) ...[intervenes]      Not inside of Eskom, no.     Yes, I am.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, that is correct.     Yes. MR SELEKA     Yes, that is correct.     That is mentioned in the agreement but I did not know the specifics.     The (indistinct – recording distorted) Mr Chairman, it did not in the immediate address the coal supply urgency.     That is correct, Mr Chairman, in fact I think the underlying issue is here that this was actually to assist the proposed owners to acquire Optimum.     Yes, I agree with you, sir.     Mr Chairman, you must remember that I was drafting it for Mr Singh and Mr Koko and at the time I must admit I did not really ask, you know, interrogate it to that degree, it has been on reflection and the subsequent questions that these issues have come to light.     That was instructions, yes.     Yes, that is correct, urgency was in his mind and also the big security of supply about Hendrina.     No, that is not what I am saying, I am saying that when you talk about the urgency.     Yes.     Yes, that was the intention because you will see that the underlying agreement refers to Tegeta.     Agreement.     The coal supply agreement that we prepared, it refers to Tegeta, the sources.     I said that when you look at the underlying agreement that we were asked to prepare, the coal supply (indistinct – recording distorted) resources.     In the coal supply agreement that I was asked to draft, Mr Chairman.     Yes.     Mr Chairman, at the time there was a due diligence exercise underway so it really – it really did not strike me as odd and I did not think that, you know, it was my place to second-guess the executives at that stage, I took it at face value.     No, I was not.     I was not the legal adviser, I was the company secretary.      Ja, none of the board members actually asked for advice at that time …[intervenes]     I focused …[intervenes]     That is – ja.  That is correct.     Mr Chairman, at the time I must admit I did not do that.     I took it at - you know, I took at face value because it was the Chief Financial Officer and Mr Koko involved and I did not do that at the time.     You see, when the documents came back from Mr Koko and Mr Singh they were already signed.     Signed.     By the executives, yes.  Signed off.  So …[intervenes]     Not all of it because they made some changes as well.     Mr Chairman, at the time …[intervenes]     I can see that but at the same token, I would not want to be second-guessing these senior executives.     It is for them to put the stuff before the board and the board to also interrogate the documentation.     That is correct but they are also senior executives in the company.     No, that is not what I am saying.     Chair, I agree with you there.     I am just checking the documentation just to make doubly sure.  I think we covered it.     Mr Chair, in the documents that I have if you look at the draft that I sent, I think – let me just see, it is page – Eskom 18, 509.     Yes.  There is an email to Mr Koko and the document attached is version one.     And in there – I think in – on page 512 under the key assumptions, I do – we – this is the draft that I prepared.     You will see that I put there the transaction between Optimum Coal Mine and Oakbay Investments being formally approved by the regulatory authorities.     It is number 3.2.2.     Okay, what I am saying is that this – these things were removed by the executives in the final submission.     In the context of the question, it would have given the board a fuller appreciation of what transaction was about.    Was that Oakbay/Tegeta was buying Optimum at the time.      Yes.     But you will also remember at the IFC discussion it was pointed out that the acquisition would improve the BEE status, so there was some appreciation that this was in transition and that there was going to be a new ...[intervenes]      I think that is a question that you would have to ask the Executives and the Board.     I think that is a question you would have to ask the executives and the Board.     I accept that.     Yes.     Yes, I see them.     Yes, I see that.     Yes, I’m there.     No.     No, it was not, the emails came from Mr Anoj Singh to me.     Yes.     Yes.     I’m there.     Yes.     Yes.     But my answers came from Mr Singh.     Mr Seleka, can you just give me the page reference, I seem to…[intervenes].     Yes.       Can I ...[intervenes]     554.     No Mr Chairman I did not know that the journey, the extensive journey that it had taken.   My first exposure to that was in 2018 when I received queries from the Mail & Guardian.     He should have known all of that, you now the financial construct in the submission document came from him, or I assumed at the time that it came from him.   It is clear the he had some outside help.     No...  I mean, the first part is that Optimum is the only mine because it is right next to Hendrina Power Station and it was one of the reasons why Hendrina was built there.  That is from the ministry.   Have all other supply options been investigated?  At the time, I would not have known that without having to speak to the operational people.     I am not sure I understand the question fully.  Are you saying that I should have answered that?     That was part of the meeting that I attend on the 24 t h of November.  You will recall from my earlier testimony.     It was mentioned in the submission.     So there is a line in the submission about that the owners would continue with their supply.       To my knowledge it would have been Optimum as the only mine that can supply Hendrina.     If I said yes, they would have to explain what they were and also highlighting additional costs in terms of logistics to get the coal to Hendrina.     [No audible reply]      It did not need that transaction Mr Chair.  That you are correct. So it is sort of an open-ended answer.     It answers the question on the face of it but it is more what it does not say.     No.     No, because that agreement was in place.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      I accept that.     They were sent by Mr Anoj Singh and I forwarded them to Ms Cassim.       Quite quick ...[intervenes]      Quite quickly.  I did apply my mind to them because these came from the Chief Financial Officer.  So I was not going to – like I said, I was not going to second guess what he had put down there.  I had interpreted these questions that you asked more of a funding nature.       Yes?     Mr Seleka, these questions were asked of the responsible officials.     So you know, I would not go and nose pick it.  At this point, the board member asked the questions.  The Chief Financial Officer provided the answers.  And I provide it to the board member.  She seemed to have understood them because she was comfortable with them.   I am not sure, you know, how I needed to interrogate at that stage because the questions were asked of the people who submitted – who signed off the submission.   And this was a financial construct that Mr Singh had introduced.  And this was actually the first time that I had seen about inventory days and you know the acting of.  So I left it to his expertise.       [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      I am getting there.  There is a lot of ...[intervenes]      Yes, I am.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes?     Yes, I am there.     It is a mister.     Yes.  ADV SELEKA     Yes, I do.     OCM under Glencore in the process of being purchased by Tegeta.     Yes.  At the time, yes, we changed the draft of this confrontation.     Condition precedence, yes.     740?     Oh, eight.       No, I did not.     I am there.     Yes.     Mr Eric Wood sent – he sends it to Salim Essa at Gmail ...[intervenes]      No, I did not.     Yes, I see that.     The amendments I made here was to ...[indistinct] [break in transmission – speaker unclear]      Which was the 31 s t of March 2016.     On Clause 5.1.     We – there were stuff that was not filled in.  I mean...  Sorry, information that was not completed and the date was one of them.     So I time stamped it where you can see it     That would have been the one that I inserted the dates.     Ja, as discussed with Mr Singh.     Correct.  I got that from Mr Singh.     No, I did not know that at the time.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      It came to light later in the Public Protector ’s reports and the media.     It came to light later in the Public Protector ’s report, the State Capture Report and in the media.     Mr Chairman, I cannot answer that.  You are going to have to ask Mr Singh.  I do not know.     At the time I did not ask him Mr Chairman because even with the acquisition of Optimum Mine, there would be suspensive conditions as you would see here because there would be approvals from the regulatory authorities but at the time I did not ask him why the urgency in respect of the first decision.     No, I did not.  I think you are going to have to ask Mr Singh as they were the delegated officials to negotiate and conclude this agreement.     No, I did not.     Not on the – it did not surprise me because the regulatory approvals usually took longer so 31 March was a conservative estimate.     The MPRDA, the Section 11 approval, the transfer of the mining right and approval by the Competition authorities but, as we know now, with the benefit of hindsight, those two things came fairly quickly.     No, but you asked me whether I was surprised by the date, so from that perspective I did not raise – it was not a red flag for me.      I am just reading this again.  Okay.      No, no, I am just reading the agreement just to familiarise myself, it has been a while.  Okay.  I still – well, it does mention the purchase of OCM by Tegeta so I think it was reasonable to expect that in there and it does say that clauses – that the clauses that you read would become effective immediately but they are still subjecto(?).  It was a bit – ja, it is confusing.     Yes.  But for me the date of 31 March was reasonable in terms of the regulatory approvals.     No, I agree with you there but it is in here now so that is how I understood it.     Yes, I am there.     I see that.     Yes, I do.     Nothing from my perspective, I only learnt from Ms Mathepu’s evidence before the Commission that he had actually spoken to ABSA about the terms of that – of the  guarantee.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Which ones, between the PAs?     No, I was not copied on that but the agreement was signed and I think I got a copy back signed by the parties.     Yes. MR SELEKA     Yes, I can see that.   The advance payment, yes.     No, it says what it says.    Tegeta I think was purchasing OCM.     Optimum Coal Mine, ja.    Well there is also one later for Baroda.     Oh, okay.    To my knowledge, no, I do not know.  You would have to ask Mr Koko and Mr Singh.     That was subsequent.    [indistinct] 14.47 yes.  The approvals had not been obtained to transfer the mining licence and their query was whether the guarantee would be extended but it lapsed on the 31 March.     That is why I am smiling because you say quickly.    I was instructed by Mr Khoza to convene the meeting.  He was the Chairperson of the BTC at the time.     I am not sure I understand, Mr Seleka, it came with the date.    Yes.     Well, at that stage we were still preparing it for the 13 t h, I did not – I did not have any expectation that there will be a meeting on the 11 t h.    It came from Mr Mthethwa already and at that stage we were talking about the content.  I actually did not check the dates but the assumption was that this was going to the 13 t h, the meeting of the 13 t h.     Well, I did because she spoke to me on the – I think it was late afternoon of the 8 April and asked me how could she get something on the agenda and I said please prepare the submission and submit it as quickly as possible because, you know, we have a meeting scheduled for the 13 t h and Mr Khoza would be the one that would have to approve that submissions.     No, Mr Chairman, I did not know those facts at the time, those came out later when Mr Marsden testified at the parliamentary inquiry.    That is what she spoke to me about over the weekend when we were putting the submission together, yes.     I do not think she specifically mentioned Mr Nath’s name but she did mention that she had been approached by Tegeta.    Ja, what that email means is that she had not dealt with it in the submission.     Yes.      So that is why she asked for my assistance.     The drafting, how you put it in the submission, yes.    No, she did not have anything in writing as she testified but she was able to speak to me telephonically about what she had discussed with the supplier.     I was responding to what she had put in her affidavit, Mr Chairman, but at the time of drafting she did not have anything in writing.    Yes, I did.     I do not understand, Mr Seleka.    I assisted Mr Mthethwa in drafting the motivation for the prepayment.     Yes, I saw that.    Yes, I do.     I am not sure because my formulation was based on my conversation with Ms Mthethwa or sorry, Dr Mthethwa, Mr Chairman.  So they should be similar because she was having the conversation with the supplier.     Please repeat that?     I am not sure that I can say that but based on our conversation that is what she gave or the information that she gave me and if it made its way into the letter then she would have been the conduit between the supplier and Eskom.    Yes, I did, Mr Chairman, Mr Khoza – I said to him well, we have a meeting in 48 hours, I mean – well, it was less than 48 hours because it was late Monday evening and he said that the operations team had approached him and that is was urgent.     On the collusion aspect I think Mr Khoza is wrong, we were – I was assisting my colleagues and I know that was – it looks problematic but that is how we dealt with it because they were under pressure from Mr Koko and I am not sure about Mr Khoza but I know Mr Koko.  In terms of the collusion, my meetings that I testified about with Mr Essa was about the suspensions and later with the Guptas was about Mr Molefe suspension matter and had nothing to do with coal.  In fact I was not aware that Dr Mthethwa had met with the Guptas regarding the coal issues, so I reject his version that we colluded.  He was well aware of the reason for the meeting, he was the one who called the meeting, he was the Chairman of the BTC, it was his prerogative to have the meeting, not mine.    I think that is unfair to me.  I was not the originator of the document, I had advised Dr Mthethwa that the meeting was going to take place on the 13 t h, it was a schedule board tender committee meeting, the officials would have been aware of that.     These were the responsible officials who would have motivated for the meeting, Mr Koko signed off as the responsible executive, he bypassed his own subordinate, that is Mr Mboweni and signed off on these documents.  So he should have been aware or he ought to have been aware that the meeting was going to, you know, or the urgency.  And it also is contrary to what he had said in Parliament about understanding why the meeting was urgent for the 11 t h.  He talked about, he once again talked about supply issues, and demand that are not etcetera.  So I contest, you know that he did not know that that the meeting - while he was the one who motivated for the urgency.  If it was not so then he would have to answer for it.     Yes, I did.     Yes, that is correct.     Mr Singh pointed out to the Board members, Mr Chairman, that Tegeta was having issues with the banks. He did not - I do not recall if he specifically mentioned, but from what was happening at the time, they were facing their bank accounts being closed.  I think he also worked out that the surety that that he had accepted was not acceptable and that is something else needed to be put in place, and then he also did a cash flow analysis based on what was already contracted to Eskom by them.     I think they were in the process of being closed Mr Chairman I am not sure that they were still operating.     Oh, frozen so they were in the process of being closed then.     Yes, the meeting of the 11 t h had asked, had tasked him with assessing whether this was financially viable for Eskom to enter into and what he then did was he looked at their status for the next period, I think it was next three to 12 months, and he had put in place a session of revenue.  And he had come back and said that this was not viable and that alternative security would have needed to be found for Tegeta and this is when the issue of pledge and security in the form of the shares of Tegeta was raised, and he said that that was more acceptable to Eskom.     Those pledges and securities were not in place yet Mr Chairman and I had not yet completed the necessary paperwork for that, when the payment was made it was actually made earlier in the day based on – and this was based on the evidence of Mr Snell Naga, before the Commission, and listening to that, and knowing that at the time when that payment was made, the pledge and security agreements were not yet in place.  They were signed towards the end of the day, because there were issues with the share certificates that were presented to us.     That is, sorry.     That is correct I do say that in my affidavit at paragraph 83.     That is correct.     When the payment was made I was not aware that it was made on the day.  The pledge agreements, I was excused from the BTC meeting of the 13 t h to go and draft the pledge agreements and put them in place.     Round – with timing of the payment I was, I became aware when Mr Naga testified as to how that payment was actually made, and the time at which it was made, and that made me realise that at the time that if - I think it was 12 o'clock or, you know it was very early in the day, it was not practically possible that it was made against those pledge agreements because I only completed it in late afternoon.     Not to that detail Mr Chairman.     I was not aware of the specific Arnot agreement until the submission, I was aware that they were supplying at Brakfontein.     Firstly, I was surprised by Dr Nteta’s comments at the Commission, as she and Mr Mabalane fielded quite a lot of questions on the 11 t h as to the urgency, and as to the pre-payment, and as to why it was required, you will see that in the minutes.  Subsequently, I would agree with you based on what we know now that this transaction was more to assist Tegeta in acquiring optimum than the, you know, what is the word, the facts put before the BTC in the submission, that this was an emergency.     I am not sure Mr Seleka it has been a while.     I was not involved in the matter that time Mr Chairman, but what I can tell you from my own experience with the Optimum contract is that Eskom actually did not manage that contract very well and so the calculation of penalties has always been an issue of contention with the supplier, from the BHP Billiton days.  I was in Primary Energy at the time and I did manage some arbitration issues around it and we always had a problem proving the penalties.   It was not consistent, so I would not be surprised that there was that memo at that early stage of the game.     It was late 2016 when I took over from Mr Mayo Silanco as Acting Head of Legal and Compliance.     Yes he did, at that stage he had just been appointed Acting Group Chief Executive and one of the first things that he said to me is that he would be  happy to settle at roundabout R500million on that claim, and I was surprised, I hadn’t had the time yet to study all the documentation, I did caution him that we were already in arbitration and you know how did we get from R2.1billion to R500million.     Yes.     Yes.     I don’t think he gave me a proper response, he just said that he would be happy to settle the matter, he wanted it off his desk.     Yes sir?     Generally speaking that will be fine Mr Chairman, it is just bearing in mind the time difference.     Yes, that will work.     Yes.     Thank you Mr Chairman.

SUZANNE MARGARET DANIELS:  (d.s.s.) 
EXAMINATION BY ADVOCATE SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, do you have the affidavit as well? 
MR SELEKA SC:    The underlying agreement, Chair, is on page 442.7, the signed copy of that agreement.  442.7.    Point 7, that is on bundle 18.      Yes.    Yes, Chair.    Yes.  Ja, no, that is alright, Chair.  Ms Daniels, let us see this because, you see, we need to just get the facts right.  When Tegeta was concluding a sale agreement with Oakbay OCH, the business rescue practitioner says in his affidavit, that is Mr Marsden, that the consortium of banks required Tegeta to show that it has sufficient funds to do the deal, to pay the 2.1 billion purchase price.  That is on the one hand. Now Tegeta seems to have not had – and I say seems, you can comment on that, not to have had the funds required.  What then happens is, early on the 10  December 2015 and this is immediately after midnight, Chairperson, you see that email that comes from a businessman, is sent to Mr Koko and it sets out what essentially became the terms of a guarantee to be issued by Eskom in favour of Tegeta.  So the memorandum and what happens thereafter is preceded by that communication which is forwarded to you by Mr Koko on the basis of which instructions are given to CDH.   So comment on this because based on those facts it would seem that even the idea of a guarantee did not originate from Eskom’s officials, it seems to have come from outside of Eskom in order to do what presumably Mr Marsden is saying, Tegeta needed to demonstrate that they have sufficient funds to do the purchase of OCH.  Your comment on that?    Yes.    Yes, I am going to give you that page reference, that is page 724 of Eskom bundle 18.    724, Chairperson.    Bundle 18, 18A.    The black numbers?    18A?    You are there, Chairperson?  Okay.    Oh.  Yes, it is in – my junior says it is 18B, Chair, sorry.    724, where it is the same email on 723.  Ms Daniels, are you there?    Yes, so the email, the one below from businessman, dated 2015.12.10 at 00.15, to Matshela    Salient points.    I beg your pardon, Chair, I beg your pardon.    Salient points. “Eskom will provide bank guarantee for 1.68 billion.” Chairperson, let me accelerate this because if you turn the page, Ms Daniels, when you go to the next page, which is page 725, it is Ms Daniels’ email to Mr Rishaban Moodley of CDH.  That is on the 10 t h again of December 2015 but    Yes.  Then there is the two pager, two pager between Tegeta and Eskom Salient Points and we can compare point for point, Chair, what you see in the email which goes to Mr Koko and this two pager which is sent to the attorneys.      That is correct, that was Ms Daniels, Chair.    Yes.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.      That is right, yes.    Correct, Chair, correct, Chair.  Ms Daniels, yes, just to clarify and maybe make clear the response to the Chairperson’s question, whether on the terms of the resolution of the board for the prepayment of R1.6 billion could one rely on those terms to make a conclusion that those terms also authorised the CFO, Mr Anoj Singh to issue a guarantee in favour of Tegeta.  Mr Koko says that submission did not incorporate a proposal regarding a guarantee.   The board is also surprised that there was a guarantee issued the day after they made that decision.  They say they did not authorise a guarantee.   I know you have already said that you relied on paragraph 2.1.4 of the resolution but strictly speaking, what would be your answer to the Chairperson whether that reliance can be substantiated by the provisions of the resolution.  Whether you look at it then or now you can make the distinction is up to you.    Ja, can I, sorry ...[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, are you with us?    Okay.  The same bundle, page 487, Eskom bundle 18, page 498.  Just a follow up on the email you were referring to of Ms Bana.    It is an email from you, Tuesday 8 December 2015, 16.44, that is after Ms Bana’s email of     Could that be what you were trying to explain to the Chairperson?    Just to add, Chair, to the urgency of the situation, this alleged urgency, the pre-purchase agreement is subject to suspensive conditions.  Coal is not supplied pursuant to that agreement and in its affidavit…” In its affidavit, I say it is, that is CDH’s affidavit.  Mr Moodley says that at that stage, this is December 2015, an even before that, I think from September 2015, OCM and Eskom had an interim arrangement in terms of which OCM was supplying coal to Eskom, Eskom’s Hendrina power station.  Did you know that?     Well, you see …[intervenes]    Pat Naidoo, yes, Chair.    Agreement.      She says …[intervenes]    Did you find out from him how he chose the date of 31 March 2016 and not any other date?    Did it not surprise you as one of the persons involved in the drafting of the submission that required a decision by round robin?    But they are approvals in respect of what?    Ja, but even at that stage that would not have been an issue because of the way the agreement was drafted.  The agreement specifically said, the underlying agreement, that Tegeta was going to purchase coal from OCM and Tegeta will then on sell to Eskom.  So regulatory issues did not stand in the way of the way in which the agreement was drafted.    Ja, but is that an answer if you look at    Are you looking for the agreement?    It is confusing, indeed.    Ja, but that belonged to the acquisition agreement, to the sale of shares agreement, it did not belong to the pre-purchase agreement, if it was any relevant.    Then go to page 773, Eskom bundle 18.    773.    Yes.    So your email to Mr Singh of the amended agreement is again reflected there on the bottom.  Mr Anoj Singh takes your email and forwards it to Mr Eric Wood.  Do you see that he sent that …[intervenes]    You see that?    At 4.26 p.m.  Mr Eric Wood responds in the early evening of the same date, 10 December 2015 at    Yes.  Then turn to page 778.  778 is an email now from Mr Koko’s PA.  Is that Mr Koko’s PA?  Executive Assistant to Mr Matshela Koko, ja. The signature there, end of the email.    Do you see that?    So this email – it is on Thursday 10 December 2015, at 16.56, is addressed to Mr Nath of Oakbay.  Nath@Oakbay.co.za, c.c. Pauli(?) Nzotiana(?) 08.21 that Mr Singh’s PA.  Yes, that is correct.      And the letter, agreement is attached. “Please find attached letter for your attention, should you require and further clarity please feel free to speak to Matshela.” And that agreement is in the next four pages, it is signed by Mr Nath.  You were not aware of that correspondence, were you?    Yes.    Just in conclusion here on this point.  Page 784 there is a letter from Tegeta 10 December 2015.    Ja, name of account, Tegeta Exploration, the bank is State Bank of India and the account is given.  Now I was surprised by this because when I read the underlying agreement, I saw a clause there which says the prepayment will be made to OCM.  Do you recall that clause?      Yes.  The agreement expressly said that prepayment will be made to OCM.  It says – ja, that is    Let me also read 6.1.  Clause 6.1 says     Yes.    Yes.  And now the money is going to go State of Bank of India.      That is on page 786.    Account name Bank of Baroda.  But now this one comes from Eric Wood and it is addressed to Mr Anoj Singh and banking details are different from the one given in the letter addressed to Mr Koko.  So did Eric Wood have anything to do with Tegeta, to your knowledge?      Okay.  I think that concludes the issue here.  Anything you want to say to the Chairperson before I move on.  I see there was an email from you on page 788 about the condition precedent.  One and three were still open.  That means were not fulfilled.     Ja, that is 16 March 2016.      Ms Daniels, can we quickly deal with the 659 prepayment.  I say quickly because we have the fax, the fax that is related by Dr Mthethwa before the Chairperson.    The submission was made or was drafted over the weekend.  You were sent a copy of that on Sunday night on the 10 April 2016.  We have grappled with the answer to the question why did that meeting take place of the BTC by teleconference, take place on the 11 t h, the night of the 11 April 2016 when there was a BTC meeting scheduled – a prior scheduled BTC meeting for the 13 April 16?  Your answer?       Ja and we have asked this question, you would know that, that the draft submission document already had a date of 11 April 2016 when it came to you.  How did that happen?    Ja, the draft submission – well, then let us do this because I have seen from affidavit you say Mr Zethembe Khoza called you on the 11 t h when you were already at home.      Monday 11 April.  What I am asking you is, the draft document that came to you Sunday evening that was exchanged over the weekend on Sunday, it already had a date of 11 April 2016 on it for BTC meeting.  How did that happen if Mr Khoza only got it on Monday?    Ja, but it is not answering the question, how did the date of 11 April 2015 get to be inserted on a draft document that was exchanged before Mr Khoza called you, according to your version, and said let us have a meeting on Monday the 11 t h?      Who had made that assumption?    Well, I – you see, the 11 t h, similar to the 9 and the 10 December 2015 has developments that are taking place parallel to what was happening within Eskom and that again is the acquisition of OCH by Oakbay.  So according to the evidence of Mr Marsden, on the 11 April 16 he had been approached by Mr Howa and told that Tegeta has a shortfall in respect of the purchase price and that shortfall was R600 million and he wanted some assistance, either the bank defer the payment or to give them a bridging loan.  The banks refused.  By 15.00 that day he gets a message, Mr Howa, from Mr Marsden that the banks declined their request.  Did you know that …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  So did you know that – did you know those facts?    Did you know that Dr Mthethwa had been approached by Tegeta, Mr [indistinct] 20.44, firstly with a request to supply coal which later incorporated a requirement or request for a prepayment.      Did you know that – proceed?    She says she – I mean, in the email we see exchanged with you she explicitly says to you that she has not dealt with the issue of a prepayment.      Yes in the submission but it was only in the resolution.     So her evidence is that she had not dealt with a prepayment request before and so she did not know what to do with it.      Oh, so you would have assisted with the prepayment?    Yes.  You know that she had not been given an offer in writing at that stage over the weekend as you were drafting the submission?      Yes.  Well, the reason I was putting that to you is because I saw your affidavit saying there should be no confusion about the prepayment because the supplier had put it in writing in the letter dated 8 April 16.    And, as a matter of fact, she does say in her affidavit that that letter was received only on the 12 April and it was backdated to the 8 April.  You would have seen that in her affidavit.      Who came up with the motivation for the prepayment, Ms Daniels?    Who in the submission crafted or drafted, inserted the motivation for the prepayment?     Ja, we were considering that motivation in the submission against the reason given by the supplier in their offer letter.  The motivation in the submission suggests the reopening of the export component of the mine.  Do you recall that?    And the offer from the supplier seems to talk about increasing the amount of coal and using the money for the purposes of beneficiation.  Do you recall that?      What we wanted to understand is whether the two reasonings, are they the same or different?    So are you suggesting that she would have given the reasoning for the prepayment to the supplier?    Are you suggesting that she would have given to the supplier the reasoning for the motivation so that the supplier could put it in their offer letter to Eskom?    Ja.  Did you say anything to Mr Khoza about the request for the meeting – the request made to you to schedule a meeting for the 11 April when there was a meeting coming up on the 13 April 2016?     You would have seen some of the board members who came here and the affidavit of Mr Khoza saying they were misled by you and Dr Mthethwa and you were colluding with Tegeta.  What is your comment on that?    Okay, if the – well, the assumption that the date of the 11 t h in the draft submission over the weekend could only have come from you be a fair assumption or unfair to you?      Dr Mthethwa has said that, in her affidavit, there was no reason why the BTC could not wait until the 13 t h of April.  I think Mr Koko says something to that effect, which means that there was nothing so urgent to make the BTC meet on the 11 t h of April 2016.  What is your comment on that?
