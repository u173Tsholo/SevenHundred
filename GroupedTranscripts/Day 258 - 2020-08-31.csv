CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning everybody. ADV NOTSHE    Are we ready?    A summons?    An affidavit?    Ja not a summons.    Hm.    For what it is worth I do condone the failure to file the affidavit on Friday.    Ja okay.   So basically Ms Thomas’ evidence relates to BOSASA and the evidence given by Mr Agrizzi and Mr Le Roux as well as he evidence still to be given by Ms G Peters with regard to allegations of a close relationship between BOSASA both Mr Gavin Watson with Ms Nomvula Mokonyane and Mr Agrizzi’s evidence that BOSASA did various things for Ms Mokonyane or her family because according to Mr Agrizzi Mr Gavin Watson said Ms Mokonyane was very influential and then needed to look after her in order for them to as BOSASA to have protection from prosecution or certain investigations by the SIU.  So Ms Thomas’ evidence will deal with what she knows with regard to any interactions that may have happened between BOSASA, Mr Agrizzi, Mr Gavin Watson and Ms Mokonyane as well as herself.  You may administer the oath or affirmation.    Ah sorry.  I suspect the transcribers will not hear you maybe you can remove your mask for now.    Just – or move it a little bit so that…    Ja.    Okay thank you; you may be seated Ms Thomas.  If you do not have any objection you could remove your mask so that we can hear you on the understanding that there is enough social distance but you must tell me if you have a problem.    Sorry?    Yes I cannot hear you.    Yes.    I think it is better that it..    Ja that is – ja okay.  Alright thank you.  Mr Notshe.    Let us get them to be – to place themselves on record first.  You may do so from where you are just to place yourself on record.    Thank you. ADV MANALA And we together appear for the Ms Thomas.    Thank you.  Thank you.  Ms Thomas you want to say something?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes.    No I – your apology is accepted.  I do accept that you did not intend to be disrespectful    Yes okay.  Thank you.    I do not – I do not see on the spine of this file that you have got Mr Agrizzi’s statement here as well as Mr Le Roux’s statement.  Is it in another file that is here or?    Ja well I accept or the whole statement.    Does that – does that excerpt only relate to – only relate to what Mr Agrizzi said about Ms Thomas or does it cover what he said about Ms Mokonyane as well?    It does cover both?    Oh okay.      And then it covers the supplementary and the reply because there was the first affidavit then there was a supplementary affidavit and there was Mr – Mr Agrizzi’s response to Ms Mokonyane’s affidavit?    That is not included?    Ja in the…    In the supplementary is it – I think there is something in the supplementary that relates to Ms Mokonyane.  I think Mr Agrizzi’s story about Ms Mokonyane is contained in his first affidavit, in his supplementary affidavit as well as in his response.    To Ms Mokonyane’s affidavit.  That is where you get the whole story.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja no that is fine.  Let us proceed I would have liked to have the complete version so as to see how it diverges or converges with her evidence.  But that is fine let us proceed.    I am sorry.    That is whose affidavit?    On what page?    87?    57?    Are you comfortable?    Are you comfortable?    Wobbly?    Ja move it a bit if that will make you comfortable.    It is low but it is fine?    Oh okay.    Oh.  I wonder whether anything can be done.  Okay alright let us continue.    Hm.  Okay alright.    Before that do you want me to admit this affidavit Mr Notshe?    Yes and you confirm that the contents of the affidavit are to the best of your knowledge and belief true and correct?    Okay.  What exhibit number should it be?    Well is it T27?    I think that the spine should indicate exactly what it is.  It should not just says Coetzee, Thomas because I take that to be their affidavits.  So – but you say that 27 is the summons.  I think it must make it clear what it is that one will find inside.  So – oh okay.  Ms Sandra Thomas’ affidavit is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit 27.1.    Yes.    So are you employed by the ANC now?    Okay.      Ah sorry.  You might have to …    Shift it even more.    Because I – ja  Okay, okay alright.   Thank you.    Because I am – I am missing somewhere just to speak ja.    Ja so..    And I want to hear everything you are saying.    That is much better.    Yes Mr Notshe.    From 2002?    Oh from 1999?    Yes so that is like what 21 years?    Ja that is a long time.    It means she must be very happy with you?    And it means you are very happy with her?    Ja.    Okay.    Is that – I am sorry are you talking about her driver?    Oh not necessarily.    Ja okay.  Alright.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    How long ago was that if you are able to remember?    Okay.  So that was before 2014?    Ja that is between 2009 and 2014 I think.    Because that is when I think she was the Premier.    Sorry?    Ja.    I am sorry before that.  Do you – do you say that you saw Mr Agrizzi at the Mokonyane home during the period leading to the funeral?    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Is your recollection that you saw him also only once in the 21 years or so that you – well maybe not 21 in – over 15 years – 16 years – 17 years that you were working for Ms Mokonyane?    That you can remember.    Yes.    It will come back okay, no that is fine.     You are the same star?     [laughs]     I am sorry.  Just repeat that.     Yes, yes.     Let us say that by... Mr Agrizzi left BOSASA I think in 2016 or 2017.  That would mean that he would have had, by that time been PA to Ms Mokonyane for about 17 year or about.     Ja.     Out of 17 years, what would be your estimate of how many of those years Mr Gavin Watson might have sent presents to you and miss...[intervenes]      Ja, say to yourself.     Ja.     Yes.  And so ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Ja.  About five times, ten times?  What would you say?     Maybe even less?     Yes, okay.  And as far as presents for Ms Mokonyane, out of the 17 years what would you say?       Those that you saw.     Yes.     Yes.     Oh, is the position that you would get calls from Mr Gavin Watson ...[intervenes]      ...about your birthday as well as about Mr Mokonyane’s birthday present?  But the discussion, for example, about Mr Mokonyane’s birthday present what you would suggest he should buy for her, would not necessarily mean you would see if it was sent.     It might just be a discussion ...[intervenes]  MS     ...but what he ultimately bought, you might not see?     Okay.     Okay.     [No audible reply]      You forgot Mr Notshe... did you forget and read the address?     I am sorry.  That is an email dated 29 June 2015.     Sent by Ms Gina Pieters at eight minutes past eleven to Dudu Dube, Innocence, Jamaria and Alpha Hand.  Is that right?     And the subject is    Why you are not using...?     I think you ...[intervenes]      Ja, because there will be confusion.     Ja, on the top left-hand corner.  The black numbers.     That is under tab number 29.     Okay.     Are you ...[intervenes]      If you do not know whether she received it, you say you do not know.     If you do know you say    She says ...[intervenes]      ...she is not sure whether ...[intervenes]      ...she received this particular one.     And I think she says she may have received a hamper at some stage or another ...[intervenes]      ...and as to when that will be, maybe that will come back to her.     Yes.  H’m.     You are not saying that it did not happen.  You are simply saying you do not remember whether it happened?     Yes, okay.     H’m.     Maintenance issues …[intervenes]     I think you said maintenance issues.     Yes.     When you refer to maintenance issue, what kind of issues are you having in mind?     Ja.     Ja.     Now did you say Mr or Ms Mokonyane?     That is when you would call him?     Yes, now how would you have become aware of the maintenance issue.     That is the helper or what?     Would call you directly.     Yes, no, no, I accept that.     We talk about others, I just wanted to know what you are talking about when your maintenance issues because in your affidavit you do refer to what you call maintenance issues, so I just want to [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Ja, no, no.     We will get to the others.     So on maintenance on what you call maintenance issues you are talking about if the lights go off.     If the water goes off.     Yes.  There are problems with the security.     Features in the house.     With the electric fence.     That kind of thing, ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes, okay.     Would they call you even if he was not present in the house?     Oh, he would call in that case.     So whenever the helper called for such – called you on such issues it would mean that Mr Mokanyane is not home.     Okay, alright.  And then once you have been told exactly what the problem is …(intervenes)     Maybe the police at the gate have looked around, you would then phone Mr Mokanyane to tell him what has been brought to your attention.     Oh, you would call a plumber?     Oh, okay, alright.     Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And I saw in your affidavit – I got the impression that you would call Mr le Roux sometimes for certain things.     Ja.     Mr le Roux?     Yes.     Oh.     Richard?     Oh, okay, alright.  Did that happen a number of times that when there was some or other problem at home …[intervenes]     He said call Mr le Roux, Richard?     Ja, it happened a number of times?     Okay and then in that case you would then call Mr le Roux?     And then, as far as you know, he would then go to the house and try and attend to the problem.     Yes, yes, yes.     Ja and he – would he report back to you?     Yes.     Yes, yes.  And would he tell you?     Yes.     Now you have said that that happened a number of times.  Would you say it is stretched over many years, I mean, you were with Mrs Mokonyane for about …[intervenes]     Yes, maybe from 2010 maybe or for…?     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     So you are able to say there were a number of times when you were asked to conduct Mr le Roux – that is Mr Richard le Roux…     …to go and attend to some problem, some or other problem in the house but you cannot say over what period.     It was not over a long period.     Okay, alright, thank you.     Ja, based on what the witness has said, Mr le Roux apparently had gone to the house a number of times, is it not?     So he would know the house.     Ja.     Yes, elaborate.     Some things will come through you, others will not.     Ja.     Ja. I am sorry, Mr Notshe, let us take the tea adjournment.  We will adjourn now for tea and resume at twenty five to twelve.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I take it, Mr Notshe, that you should be able to finish in the next 25 minutes?  Ja.  H’m?  Switch on your mic.     Well, as I see, it should not be a problem, finishing within 25 minutes.     They talked to you making a risk assessment?     Ja.     But you – that was for a risk assessment as you understood the position?     Okay, alright.  Continue?     I am sorry, are you saying that they spoke to you when they wanted to install CCTV cameras?     Yes.     But what I am asking is, whether you are saying at some point they contacted you.     And asked you to make arrangements.     Oh, they did not talk about installation of the CCTV, they just said they want to do some work.     So you say that is what they told you?     Yes.     Yes.     But you do not know whether they actually did that, you just know they talk to you about planning to do it.     Yes.     Yes, so – okay, what you are dealing with is quite important.  Now you say you know for sure?     That they did what?     They put up the electric fence.       Security lights.     And CCTV cameras.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  So that you know.     And you know it because they told you so or because you were there when they did it.     Yes, okay.      Okay, alright.     But did she not say it was Housing department?     It was when Ms Mokanyane was MEC.     Ja, was she MEC for Housing at the time?     So it was people from the Housing department that you spoke to.     Okay.     Oh, okay.     Yes, yes.     Yes, okay.     Do you remember his name by any chance?     Yes.     Is there anybody else …[intervenes]     Is there anybody else either in the Premier ’s office or in the Housing department or SAPS whose name you remember?     Not SAPS, ja.  Premier ’s office?  Somebody that…?     Yes, but are you able to remember the names of some of the people from the Premier ’s office who were involved who would know about this if the Commission wants to check?     Ja, okay.     You said security is it not?     It was somebody who was from the security.       Department of Housing.     Do you know if that person was the head of the security unit at the housing department?     You do not know, okay.     Ja, okay.     Well, Mr Notshe, before you proceed, for quite some time I was under the impression that Mr Agrizzi’s evidence and Mr le Roux’s evidence was to the effect that BOSASA installed the CCTV cameras.     But when I was looking at this affidavit Mr Agrizzi last night, I did not seem to pick that up and I do not know whether it is in Mr le Roux’s affidavit because I did not have that affidavit at hand and when I did not seem to pick that part up in Mr Agrizzi’s three affidavits, I thought that maybe what he said was that BOSASA attended to repairs and maintenance of the security features at Ms Nomvula Mokanyane’s private house as opposed to having bought and installed the CCTV cameras.  So I do not know whether it is something you are sure about or whether you might be mistaken like I was.     Ja, you see, that is why it would have helped if those affidavits were here.     Ja.       Ja, it is just that if Mr Agrizzi and Mr le Roux, if the position is that they do not say that the CCTV cameras were installed by BOSASA then that issue falls away.     And if all they are saying it was – BOSASA was repairing and maintaining security features that had been installed by somebody else.     Ja.  And Ms Thomas has made it clear that there were a number of times when she had to contact Mr Richard le Roux with regard to things to be fixed at home, at the private home of Ms Mokanyane.     So, in other words, if you need to check whether Mr Agrizzi’s evidence and Mr le Roux’s evidence includes saying that BOSASA installed the CCTV cameras.     Because if it does not include that, maybe there is no reason to go further about the installation.     But with regard to maintenance, I think that her evidence seems to support a least part of what Mr Agrizzi said insofar as Mr Agrizzi said at a certain stage BOSASA put together a team led by Mr Richard le Roux that was meant to take care of whatever issues arose in the house, so what she has said seems to be consistent with that.     Insofar as maintenance and issues are concerned.     Ja.     Did you say 53?     Five six.     Okay.     The right hand …[intervenes]     Hang on, hang on, we cannot all speak at the same time.  Why is the writing on those pages so small?     Ja, Mr Notshe, why?     Because the other pages are fine.     Well, somebody should have checked this bundle and seen that these pages with such fine print should be replaced with others that have got the correct size of print.  It is difficult to read here.  Yes?     But it does not save – it does not have to save paper if we cannot read it.  The whole point is that we must read it first, we must be able to read.      Ja, refer the witness if you can, if she can see – maybe you …[intervenes]     You will read for us if you able to read it.     Ja, read for all of us but will you arrange afterwards that the pages here are replaced by pages with pages that have got the correct size of the print?     Did you deal with Mr le Roux during the time when Ms Mokanyane was Minister of Sanitation and …[intervenes]     Yes.     Did you also deal with Mr le Roux at other times other than when Ms Mokanyane was Minister?     It was only when she was Minister as far as you remember?     Okay.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.  What is the arrangement about when she is testifying?     On Wednesday?     We have another witness who should take the whole day on Wednesday. How long do you think she is going to be?     That is like what?     Okay, so I think we may have to make that arrangement.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  Or maybe we say half past nine?     Ja.     Ja, let us say half past nine.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  Ms Thomas...     In your affidavit you have also dealt with Mr Agrizzi’s evidence relating to the  - or his evidence that BOSASA provided Ms Mokanyane with groceries.  Do you remember that?     Yes and he listed in his affidavit some of the items of the groceries that he said were bought for Ms Mokanyane and they included meat and they included liquor and they included a number of things.  I think they are set out in his affidavit.     And you have responded in paragraph 91     You want to find it in your affidavit?     Okay, paragraph 91.1.  Okay and then in 91.2 you say. “However, I distinctly remember that there were instances when I corresponded with people including Mr Agrizzi.    “...Relating to such large scale type of groceries that is mentioned for the  community projects for the elderly in Kagiso.”     Is that right?     Ja.  Now the – your involvement in all of this, these groceries, I take it you were involved because your principal, Ms Mokanyane, had something to do with them, there was a role she was to play?     Sorry?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Did you say the ladies who would know?       I thought you said something that ladies would know.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, would Ms Mokonyane be involved in the distribution of those groceries or parcels?     Yes.     Yes.     I am sorry, I did not here that.     Whose late sister?     Yes.     You would liaise with her?     Okay.  In order to identify …[intervenes]     Ja?     Oh, did she leave in Kagiso?     Okay.     Oh, okay.  So was she a common feature, you said the ladies would change, it would not be same people all the time, would she always be …[intervenes]     Ja?     Is that at Ms Mokanyane’s house?     Oh, her sister lived in that house?     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So these parcels or groceries would be delivered to Ms Mokanyane’s house but for – as far as you know for onward delivery to Kagiso, not to stay in the house?     H’m?     Yes, but what I am asking is whether you are saying the first point …[intervenes]     …would be that they would be brought to Ms Mokanyane’s house?     To the garage.     And then afterwards they would then be taken to Kagiso.     To be distributed to the community.     And would this happen around Christmas time December?     Festive season?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay and would it be a yearly thing, did it happen every year?     Oh.     Yes, so Ms Mokanyane would be there for these deliveries?     Ja but she would know about the arrangement?     Yes.    Yes.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Do you know how these parcels of groceries were taken from Ms Mokanyane’s house to Kagiso?     Who took them and so on?     You do not know that?     Ja and in terms of how they were brought to Ms Mokanyane’s house do you know if that was BOSASA?     Yes, yes.     And they would be put into the garage, in the garage?     Ja, there was a lot …[intervenes]     There is no space. MS   Ja, maybe after a few days or something.     Maybe a day.     Ja, okay.  Now did you say – you said it would happen around the festive season, Christmas period.     Sometimes a little earlier.     Ja, like early December.     Yes.  Now would it happen like every year?  I do not know, I may have asked you this question, I just want to …[intervenes]    So sometimes they will skip a year?      Ja.     Make her own arrangements?     Okay, to give people food.     I am sorry did you say he or she?     Mr Mokanyane, Ms Mokanyane?     Ja.     Yes, yes.  Now from the time that you started working for Ms Mokanyane which you said was 1999.   To 19 when she stopped being Minister, for example, are you able to say that maybe most of those years this happened even though it might not have been every year or are you not able to say that?     Most of the years.     Or sometimes even …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And when it happened in the middle of the year maybe for her birthday would BOSASA have been involved in providing parcels or…?     Not to your knowledge, that would be a separate arrangement for herself.     Okay, okay.     Okay but the Christmas period ones that involved BOSASA?     It would not always but most of the years.     Not always BOSASA?     Ja.  No, no, I accept that.     I am just talking about those that were done by BOSASA.      H’m?     Yes.     But you said most of the years?     Okay, no, that helps clarify things for me.  Do you have anything arising?     Okay. ADV NOTSHE     Do you wish to re-examine or are you fine?      Not at this stage, okay.  Ms Thomas…     Thank you very much for coming to assist the Commission, thank you.      We are done, you are now excused.  Thank you very much.     Okay, alright.  Okay.  That is all you had, Mr Notshe for today?     Okay, we are going to adjourn and just for the public, there will not be a sitting tomorrow.     But we will sit on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.   As things presently stand, on Wednesday we will hear Ms Gina Peters’ evidence as well as after her I will hear the evidence of Ms Seipati Dlamini who is a former Chief Financial Officer of the Department of – I think Agriculture in the Free State and then on Thursday we will hear the evidence – we will have Mokanyane back to deal with certain matters that have arisen since she gave evidence.     And then on Friday I will hear the evidence of Mr Vincent Smith from parliament.     We adjourn. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  We are ready.  Chairperson remember last week Ms Thomas, Sandy Thomas appeared under a subpoena and she asked time.    It was under a summons.  She asked time to prepare an affidavit and so that she can testify today and the – you allowed her to – you allowed the adjournment to today and you allowed her to give an opportunity to prepare the summons.  And she has prepared the summons and it was filed over the weekend.    I am sorry.  She prepared an affidavit.    Not a summons.   And it was filed – it was filed over the weekend.     Chairperson where this all starts it starts from the evidence of Mr Agrizzi.  Mr Agrizzi his testimony was to the fact that…    Yes.    And – So Mr Agrizzi had referred to – his evidence was to the fact that in the interactions with Ms Mokonyane – Ms Mokonyane she had been – he had been dealing with Ms Thomas and then there was also the affidavit of Ms Gina Peters.   And the affidavit of Ms Gina Peters I will refer you to when we deal with the evidence.  We will refer to it in the bundle wherein she also states that in her affidavit she dealt with Ms Thomas and then there is also the evidence of Richard Le Roux to the effect that he received instructions from Ms Thomas to do some repairs at the house of Ms Mokonyane.   Chair Ms Thomas is here to give evidence can she be sworn in?    Chair I understand from the legal representatives of Ms Thomas that she wants to say something before she starts with her evidence.    Now Ms Thomas you will find in front of you there is a black file.  Chairperson I refer to the file which is marked BOSASA Bundle 1.  Do you have that in front of you Ms Thomas?    Well do we call you Ms or Mrs Thomas?    Ms Thomas.    Alright.      The – the excerpt of Mr Agrizzi and Mr    No there is an excerpt which is attached to the – to the summons – the relevant part attached to the summons.    No it does cover both.    You will see – yes you will see on page 33 Chair where it deals with Ms Mokonyane.    And then…    No those are not – those are not included.    Yes.  And…    But what is…    Yes.    Yes.    The only – the only reason Chair that those are not here in this – in the summons it is because they do not refer to the witness.  You will find Chair where on issue – if you were to turn to page 41 – page 41 of Exhibit 27 and then there it starts and page 41 starts the – the evidence of Mr Agrizzi before you.  And then…    The relevant part of that evidence is on page 44.    Now Ms Thomas you are on page – there is – if you see the tag – there are tags in this bundle you have been given – there is a tag which is 27.1 – it is called Exhibit 27.1    And if you there you turn to page 57 – 57.3 that is your affidavit.  The numbering we are using we are using the black numbers.    Thank you.  That is the – the affidavit.  Now if you – you turn to whilst you are there.    Turn to…    That is Ms Thomas’ affidavit.    Page 57.3.    57.    Yes.    Little bit – what will make it – what will make it comfortable although you are talking, I am asking you questions.   You are talking to the Chair.    So it is his.    Ja if you – if you sit that way.    It might even – is it alright now?    It is a funny chair Ms Thomas. It is stuck.  It is stuck.    In order to – in order to move it a bit kick – sit on it and then like kick or push it.    Now turn to page 57.25.  There in that page 57.25?    Ja.  57.25.  Point 25 ja.  Bearing in mind we using the black numbering.    In your affidavit yes.  At the top.    Left hand top – left hand top.     Yes the last page.  There is above the word deponent there is a signature there, is that your signature?    No this document starting from 57.3 to 27.25.    Is that your affidavit, you confirm?    Now if we then go back to 57.3.    Point 3 of the affidavit.  In the beginning of your affidavit.    Now your affidavit you begin by giving a background of…    Yes Chair can this be admitted?    It is T27.1.    Yes.  T27.1.  Not T27 is the summons.    Yes.    Now just before we deal in details with your affidavit.  Ms Thomas where do you work now?    Is that the ANC headquarters?    I see.  And are you still the personal secretary – assistant of Ms Mokonyane?    And I see that you have got the same lawyers as Ms Mokonyane?    Is she paying for you for the services as well?    Well I do not think it can be rushed – could be rushed because according to your statement you were with these attorneys since 2019?    So since 2019 you have not made any payment arrangements with them?    Who is paying for you – who is paying for them?    Come again.    Who is going to pay them do you know?    Yes.  Now in your affidavit you give a background of when you started with Ms Mokonyane can you confirm that when did you start working for her?    And then for Ms Mokonyane did you start working for her?    Yes.    Of Ms Mokonyane?    I see.  And then did you continue with her when she became Premier?    How did that happen?    Were you not employed by the Department of…    So you – you – were you not employed by the Department of Safety and Security?     Yes.    And then the – how do you then move to Department of Housing when Ms Mokonyane moved?    I see.  And then you – you then moved with her when she became the Premier?    And then when she became the Minister of Water Affairs you moved with her again?    So basically, you have been with her for a number of years – for a long time?    A long time.    I understand.  And I understand from your affidavit you have become almost part of the family?    So from her – from the – from what you are saying and from the affidavit you dealt with some other things which are outside your official duties?    And I suppose in those situations you even visit the private home of the Minister?     But you do?    And you…    And you confirm that you did visit Ms Mokonyane’s home now and again?    I mean from your side…    And you – in your summons.    And I am sure – I am sure you were following the proceedings where the name of Ms Mokonyane was mentioned and her relationship with Mr – the late Mr Gavin Watson was mentioned?    Do you know – do you know Mr Gavin Watson?    You know the relationship between her and Ms Mokonyane?    And – but you never saw the – saw him the face besides Google face?    Did you also – of course you also attended the funeral?    I see.      And Mr Agrizzi, do you know him?    What did you speak to Mr Agrizzi about?    And you have just told the commission that you spoke to Mr Agrizzi on the phone.  You did speak to him on the phone? MS    I see.  What did you speak with Mr Agrizzi about?    Is that – is that the only time you spoke to him?    I understand.  I understand.  Tell me the birthdays – did you give him your birthday at some stage?     Sorry, perhaps I did not come out clearly.       Perhaps I did not come out clearly in my question.     Mr Agrizzi - how did he come to know about your birthday?     So you do confirm in that over years, you and the minister were receiving birthday present and ...[intervenes]      ...from Mr Watson?     Including Mr Agrizzi?     I see.     And you would wish the minister a birthday, a good birthday on her birthday?     Yes, you.     And I am sure after the birthday day celebrations, you would also tell her that Mr Gavin Watson did... want to send you something.  Did you receive it?     No, I man after the surprise, after the...     I understand.  And then the... do you know Mr Gavin... sorry, Mr Agrizzi’s PA, Gina Pieters?     Is that the only time that you spoke to her?     You saw her affidavit?     And you saw that she refers to more than one present.     Okay let us start with the get-well.  Turn to page 85.  Page 85, Chair of the bundle.       This is an email from Gina Pieters to Dube and other people.  And here she says, you must arrange a ladies hamper to be delivered to Ms Sandy Thomas and then she gives the address.  Is this the get-well you refer to?     It was in 2014?     I see.  Now if you turn to page 83.  Now in June 2015, she is asking people to assist with two hampers and then she gives the address of Mr Nomvula at 5 Blouberg Street, Noordheuwel.  And I think this is the address of Ms Mokonyane.  Do you confirm?      Page 83.     Sorry, Ms Thomas.     Yes?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     And if you... it says    And then to Sandy Thomas.  1 Customer Street.     Oh, I beg your pardon.  I beg your pardon, Chair.  And then there is the address Sandy Thomas and then there is an address there.     And it says    Is your cell number?     Now over the page ...[intervenes]      Yes.     And then over the page on page 82, we see there an email.  This is from Kombelo to Gina Pieters.      Now, we then go over the page to page 81.  And then, if you start at the bottom.  I always find emails funny to read.  Will you start at the bottom when you read them?  Look at page 81.     Are you there?     Oh.     It is an email... in the beginning it is an email from Kombelo ...[intervenes]      Ja, page 81.     Yes.     Look, you will have all the time.  If you want you will check something in your file.  You have the time.     Page 81.     Look at the bottom.  We start at the bottom.  It is from Kombelo, the one... the name we saw on     And then Gina responds and say    Did you not receive these hamper deliveries?     So are you saying to the Commission that as you are sitting there today, you are saying you never received the hamper?     I understand.     And you confirm this is around your birthday?     Yes.  So it is not far from your birthday.     I see.  And when you saw this affidavit of Gina Pieters...[intervenes]      ...and she says there were these hampers delivered and you say you cannot recall of whether you received... it was received by your family or not.  You must have seen that there is also reference to Ms Mokonyane, delivered to Ms Mokonyane’s home.     Yes.  Did you ask her now    Now I was looking ...[intervenes]      ...in your affidavit...[intervenes]      I see.  I understand.     ...you are only required to tell us what you know.     And I was... as I was reading your affidavit, I was reading with a bated breath that you would say you received yours or did not receive it.  You confirm that in your affidavit, you do not deny receiving.     Yes.     No, this... the hamper.     And all I am saying now is you... in your affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...you must have forgotten to deny that you have received the hamper.     Oh, I see.     Ja, I understand.     And can you confirm that in your affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...you do not say you do not you do not remember receiving the hamper?     I see.  And you are telling the Commission that you dealt with Mr Agrizzi one?     And if you turn to page 85.     Ja, of the page 85 of the bundle.     On page 85?     Page 85.       Sorry, 85.  Ja.      Yes.  You confirm you receiving the get-well flowers?     The get-well hamper.     I see.  And the card reads    And everything of the best.     God Bless.     Angelo Agrizzi.     And not from Mr Gavin Watson?     Yes.     And then, the person... you had spoken to him twice, then sent you this message?     I said the person who had spoken to you twice ...[intervenes]      I understand.  So you spoke to him once or twice or more?       What did you speak about?     What would that be?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     What are those issues, please?     I see.  And you cannot even remember one issue.     When?  Today?     I see.  Right, now... so you... finally, your evidence is that you spoke to Mr Agrizzi more than twice.     Okay.     I understand.  Sorry, sorry.  I did not want to embarrass you.  It is Notshe.  My surname is ...[intervenes]      No, no.  Do not worry.  It is fine.  I am used to it.     I know.  Ja, I know.  At times, you know, I get to places and the people think I am Nortje.     No, it is Notshe.     Nortje, I think.  [laughs]  Now just tell the Commission about this.  You said at times because Ms Mokonyane was away at meetings and what, you would have to deal with her domestic things?     Domestic affairs?     And you say in those instances, perhaps you would be called by Mr Mokonyane?     To deal with these stuff?     Yes.     And then also when there were problems at the house.  If he says there are problems, you would go and try and assist him there?     Yes.       Yes.     And then you would go to the home if there was a problem?     when you say not necessarily, you say you could?     Was it necessary when you visited... Mr Agrizzi says in his evidence... and I will take you to the page.  Turn to page 44.  Actually, it starts at page 43.       Look at page... if you look at the lines.     This the... or let me just orientate on this.  This is evidence, transcript of the evidence of Mr Agrizzi ...[intervenes]      ...when he testified before this Commission.     As part of the summons?     But you... without me going into it, if you     Let...[intervenes]      Ja.     You do not recall an incident where you were at the house with Mr Agrizzi and ...[intervenes]     Yes.     I see.  Now Ms Thomas, can you just tell the Commission, you... the... is it correct that the only things you did regarding the house, was to arrange for the repairs of things that had broken down in the house?    What are the other things?    Sorry, can I …[intervenes]    Now why would you – when there is the issue of the alarm, why did you not call the alarm people as you say you usually do?    Yes.     But now in instances where you would call the electrician, would you then arrange for the payment of the electricians?    Now did Mr le Roux leave and invoice for the alarm?    And you confirm when you were asked by the Chair that you did not call Mr le Roux, you called him a number of times.    I see.  And you – on page 37 there is an email – an SMS, I think, on the 1 June 2017.    And the SMSes from you to Mr le Roux.    Is this from you to him?     And when you say   Why?    So Richard knew – Mr le Roux knew what house you are talking about?    He told you not to tell him which house it is?    Yes.    Was not your first contract with Mr le Roux.      Hence you do not have the house numbers here.    I see.  And you said you dealt with the issues of maintenance and other issues.    Please elaborate.    And you were not involved in the ordering of new equipment we fitted at the house.     And Mr Mokanyane did not instruct you to...    I see.  Now this Mr – this Richard...    Yes.  Where did he work?    And how do you get hold of him?    And there was  - he never arranged for the installation of CCTVs at the house of Mr and Mrs Mokanyane?    But you were never instructed that there were people going to install CCTVs.    You were the link between the outside world and the department – between the department and the minister.  Anything going to Minister, official, will come through you?    And no department, no government department liaise with you to install CCTVs at Ms Mokanyane’s house.    At home.    So Department of Housing contacted you?    Okay.    Let us get this clear.  Who contacted you about the installation of CCTVs at Ms Mokanyane’s house?    And the Office of the Premier said there will be installations at Ms Mokanyane’s house?    And do you inform the ladies?    And then did you get a feedback about the assessment that had been done?    And the …[intervenes]    Thank you, Chair.    Well, it also depends on Mrs Thomas or Ms Thomas.    Ms Thomas, I just want you to confirm this.  You say that the Office of the Premier went and did assessments, security risk assessments at the private home of Ms Mokanyane and then they installed CCTVs at the home of Ms Mokanyane?    And did they write back to you or send you an invoice or...?    You facilitated their visit to install these?    Yes.    Ja.     And then – sorry.    And then they then later on asked you to arrange for them to install the CCTVs?     Yes, they did the lights and a few other things, I am not sure what else.    Now the investigators, and you know the investigators for the Commission, you have met them on occasion.     The contacted the Office of the Premier.    And it said it did not do any – did not install any security features at the house.    No, she says it was done by the Premier ’s office.      Your evidence now before break, you said this was done by the Office of the Premier.     The Office of the Premier said they did no upgrades and they did not install security features at the house.     Which office?    But which office said to you, you want to go to Ms Mokanyane’s home to install security features, please …(intervenes)     Okay.    And then the – so just to get it clear so that there is no I misunderstanding.  The person who asked for you to arrange for security features to be installed was a person from Department of Housing, is that correct?    And do you know who the person is?     If the Commission were to ask Department of Housing what section of the department should they ask …[intervenes]    I see.  Now you had promised the Chair and the Commission that things would come back to you.    Has anything come back to you?      Because Mr Agrizzi does recall in his evidence what he discussed with you.     Yes.     If you go to page 56 of the record.    56.    Yes.    Chair, my recollection is Richard le Roux seems to confirm that they installed the CCTVs.  I will also have to check.    Yes.    But, Chair, as the matter stand now, the witness says these were installed by the Department of Housing and I will go back to the evidence and check with the witness, with the – and check with the investigating officers and then – and look at that with the evidence of Agrizzi and Le Roux and then we can deal with that if something comes out of it.  But in any event, the investigators will follow up the evidence of Ms Thomas insofar as the installation of this by the…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Now just before I take you to page 56.  Are you there, page 56?    No, five six.    Yes.    No, no, 56 is part of – yes, the summons, it is annexure to the summons.  Look at 56 at the top.    I suppose, Chair …[intervenes]    I suppose we were trying to save paper but I would not know why, I do not know why they print it like this.      Chair, just to – on the part of the people who keep the records there has been concern that – if you look at the pages, they would have had about more than 10 pages, 20 pages of this.  I think at times it is merely to save paper and costs.    Can I continue to refer the witness or should I get …[intervenes]    I can.     And it says on page 9 of 142 pages and it is the left hand side of the document and it starts by 21 January 2019, day 37 and then there is Advocate Paul     Seems as Mr Agrizzi says he dealt with you arranging funerals and even hiring of cars.      Why do you say no because when you say you cannot remember what you discussed with Mr Agrizzi?     And yet up to now you cannot remember what you discussed with him?    I see.  Now, lastly, do you say these security upgrades, TVs and – were installed by the Department of Housing?    No, do not worry, it is fine.     Now do you know when these had faults, why would you call Mr le Roux instead of calling the department that had installed them?    Chair, just lastly – or just for reference, I had referred to emails on pages 83, 85.  Those emails, Chair, are on EXHIBIT T29 which will be the affidavit of Ms Gina Peters, I am merely mentioning them for purposes of reading and record.    This affidavit, we will have it admitted later when Ms Gina Peters testifies.    I have no further questions for the witness.    Testifying on Wednesday, the 2 n d.    Yes.    She should not be long, she should not be long, Chair, this is …[intervenes]    If unless you were to make an arrangement for her to start at nine, we should finish by ten.    I will arrange now, it is early enough.    It is early enough for us to arrange to start at nine.     And then by ten we will be done.     Half past nine still, it is...     Even if we start at half past nine, Chair, we will just – the latest will be just on the other side of ten.     That is fine.    No, Chair, I do not.    That is the only evidence we have.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed…    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    Thank you. 
MS THOMAS:  Sandra Thomas.    Oh.    I will just do this.    My full name is Sandra Thomas.    No I do not.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    If I find that it is a bit difficult then I will remove it Your Honour.    I am saying if I find that it is a bit difficult then I will remove it.    You cannot hear me?    Okay.    I will just keep it this way.    Yes good morning Your Honour.    And everybody else here.  Sir I just wish to apologise for the in – the mistake that happened last week.    It was in all Honour a communication mistake and a breakdown there and I do apologise.    It was not an intent for me not to be here.    And I – really it was a bit embarrassing though but really, I do apologise humbly so.    And I am here now.    We can go ahead.    No I did not Your Honour.    Yes I do.    I am Ms.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I am.  I am with you.    Yes.  Chair [00   Okay no problem.    I think ja.    Okay.    No problem it is just…    The chair is a bit uncomfortable but I will…    I will make it – not wobbly it is – I would like to move it a bit but…    It is just heavy.    Ja kind of.    Okay I think this is better.  It is lower but it is fine.    Yes, yes it is.    I will just lift up the file to see.    We can proceed it is not a problem.    57.5?    This is my affidavit.    I am there.    Point 25 is the last page?    That is my signature yes.    Yes.    This is my affidavit yes.    57.?    Yes.  I am there now.    You confirm that this is your affidavit?    This is my affidavit Your Honour.    Yes I do Sir.    I am now based at Luthuli House in – yes.    ANC head office.  Ja.    Yes I am.    Yes I am Sir – Your Honour.    Yes.    No we have not come to discuss myself and my attorneys on what my fees would be because all of this was just a bit of a rush.  So we will get to that when we are done here today hopefully.    Yes. Yes.    We have – we need to finalise the total amount after today.    Well I have not paid them as yet.    I have not paid them anything as yet.    I am going to pay them.    I started in the Department of Safety around 1999.  I was employed as an administrative secretary who ultimately is responsible for like running the office kind of – like some – not an office manager but ja.    Directly?    At the time that was in the office – in the private office.    Yes.    Yes.    During the period in – at the Department of Safety the PA she did not pitch up for work and unfortunately or should I say fortunately either way – fortunately I was there and I occupied her seat not knowing you know the formalities about being a PA and the protocols of safety and the police.  So I was there and I filled the seat and I had to learn very quickly because she just did not come back.  I had to learn on my feet so it is hitting the road running.  I learnt and I think I executed my duties rather well because I then moved with her to the Department of Housing.    I might have to.    Why do I not just take it off.    Let me just.    It kind of…    No Your Honour it is fine now.    Okay no my apologies.    Yes Mr Notshe.    I was employed by the Department of Safety and it had many names – Community Liaison.    And it was on a temporary basis in the beginning.    Look that is the choice of the member of the executive as to who would accompany them to the following departments.  That choices are theirs.  But they could even leave you or they could take whoever is at the department.  It is entirely up to them.    Yes I did.    Yes I did.    Twenty years to be exact.    2000 – 1999 to…    Yes Sir to date.    Yes.    Yes it is.    I – I would hope so.    Yes we do hard.    And if you have the energy.    You must always pre-empt your Ministers or your principals.    Yes – yes it is different when you – when you working with I would not to be gender based but working with a female Minister they – they have – they are Ministers in their capacities but they are also women and they are also mothers and some of the tasks they cannot fulfil.  So you know when they are in for example I would just say if they are in the lagotlas for example their phones are off.  If they are in the cabinet meetings their phones are off.  Any meeting their phones are off.  So if there is anything happening if they cannot reach the spouse, they would contact me and I would obviously find a way to either speak to the spouse or either speak to her.  But if I know where she is I know that it is – I would know if she is in a cabinet meeting clearly, I would not be able to relay the message.  If she does get the message it will only be during the lunch period you know.  But by then it would be possibly too late.  It depends on the kind of emergency.  So I would obviously contact the spouse the late Mr Mokonyane that would be my first point of contact.    Yes and this is what I am saying that I am coming back to the issue of you know when you work with female Ministers they are also mothers and they are also wives.  So you – you kind of fill the gap and you do things.  So it – it is – everybody – well let me put it like this.  Every PA he or she may have a different role because we do not just come in women form – there are men PA’s as well.  So you fill in the gap where you have to and you try to do the best you can.  Because obviously it is just the dynamics of the office. You are not bound to your role and responsibilities but it is then again how you work with your Principle.    Not, not – no.  Look not often.    Not really because I am not the kind of person that would just go.  I do have a line.  I would go as and when requested to.    Not just on my own.    Yes.  Yes on – when I have to accompany somebody like the driver I would take something home or when there is files that needs to go.  I would accompany the driver.  Just to brief on what we have and so on.    It comes – the department driver.  We do – in the private office whether it is the MEC or the Ministry there is a private office driver.    Driver/messenger.    Ja.     Yes.    Well not much but here and there.    I knew Mr Watson telephonically for a very long time.    I – I do not know exactly the – I know that he is a family friend but I knew him by talking to him on the phone. In fact yet the funny part is that you know when you talk to somebody for quite some time you try and then put a face to the name so you Google and then you see okay this is the person.  So that was my first point that I decided to let me Google this man and see who am I talking to.    No.  I think once.  Once at the son’s funeral he came to sympathise.    Yes.    It was during the run-up you know during the period before the funeral he just came to sympathise and that is when I – I actually met him    She was still – she was in – she was a Premier at the time Your Honour.    Ja.    Ja.    I am sorry you know this – this whole Covid has just messed up one’s date and sense of time.    I am saying this whole Covid thing just messed up your date and sense of time so ja.    I have spoken to him not often but I have seen him too during that very same period.  In fact I am – if I am not sure they may have come to – I do not know together to sympathise but something like that ja.    It could be yes Sir.    I am not too sure but – look it has been quite some time so…    I am not sure but that is the one that I can definitely confirm.    But I will come back.    You know Your Honour because I will – it will come back to me.    Well he would call.  At one stage he called we did not go into details as to what it was.  You know he called and I said to him that – I think he heard – must have heard that I am a bit drowsy and he called.  I said to him look I am not work I am going to send you the number of my colleague and you can speak to her.  And he wanted to know like why, what is happening?  And I was – just said to him that I am off sick.  And – and that was it.  So he – I referred him to my colleague – my late colleague to speak to because I was no position to talk to him at all.    He may have called once before then but as I am saying you know it will come back.  It will come back.    This is the funny thing.  Mr Watson like any other – well not any other person but you know what happens Your Honour is people would call and it is not just necessarily people but it is people that we liaise with and amongst the Ministers we have dates of whose birthdays they are especially those that she is quite close to.  So you send – my duty would be I would obviously call the PA and say listen you know what is your Principal’s preferred flowers, chocolates what do you think?  Or what perfume does your Principle like.  Those kinds of things.   So outside of the work relations there is also other people that would call and say you know I want to get your boss something but what do you think I should get?  Do you think I should get flowers?  If I say flowers.  Yes, these are the colours she prefers.  So the person has already decided, you know.  Some of them have already decided that they are going to buy flowers.   They just want to know from me, what does she prefer because it is no secret that she suffers from very bad asthma and sinus.   So some of the flowers... and so do I... some of the flowers like your lilies, for example, they give off that terrible pollens.  Man, you in a room and you just smell lilies.  So it messes me up.       Yes, we are.  [laughs]     Sorry?     Yes?     Oh, I would... it was probably Mr Watson because Mr Watson knew when my birthday was and he would call.  He would call either on my birthday or the day after my birthday but somewhere in that period because... and he would call and he would say,  “What do you think?  I want to do flowers but what do you think?  Can you recommend somebody?” So at time I would recommend somebody that normally does the flowers in her home.  And say,  “Go speak to this lady because she knows what she wants.”   And that would be it.  And I think maybe through their discussions and obviously talks and so, he then discovered that it was my birthday.   We share a birthday in, you know, the same week.  And it is with that then they that... he would often call me or surprise me with something.   More often call me or send me a message and a happy birthday and things like that.  In the latter years, it was just surprises, you know.  Not necessarily a conversation but a surprise.       Not all.     Mr Watson, yes.       Well, probably.  I do not know how they work in that office.  So.     I say probably.  I do not know how they work in their office.     I have no idea.     But it is like I am saying it is not all the time.     Yes.       Ja.     To myself?     Let me say to myself.     Because of... I mean, at times, I would not even know if he sent her or it would be that odd times that he would call me.       But to myself, not very often.  It was not a yearly thing.  It would come as a surprise.       Not... it is not all the time.     Maybe even less, Your Honour.     Yes.     I would not... it would be that ...[intervenes]      ...one odd call that he would ask me    What do you think?  Because we have no exhausted... maybe I bought flowers.  Let me surprise her with something different.  What do you think?  Sometimes I would not know.     I would say to him    I did, yes.     Exactly Your Honour.     I would not know.  I would not even know if it got there because I am not there.     And from twenty... the latter part, we were in Cape Town most of the times.  So whether things actually arrived or not, we do not know.     Me?     Obviously.  I would arrange flowers from... we would put together in our office and we buy cake and flowers and cool drinks and balloons and we were... the private office staff, we would have something depending... it does not matter where we are.      No, no, no.  Look, I am... those are surprises.  I do not... cannot ruin a surprise.     No, I should... I would... after... you know... I am sorry, Your Honour but sometimes you are so busy, you actually forget.   So after some time, I would maybe ask her or maybe not.  It does not... if she says, you know, this is what I have received from X, Y, Z or this is what I have.  It is not necessarily from who, I would know but whether he has actually bought it or sent it, I would not know.     Okay, I discovered her name actually the other day when I received the notice that she was going to testify.  I spoke to her once.  And that was the time when Mr Agrizzi called and I said to him that I am at... I am actually in...   He needs to speak to my colleague.  And when I... then I got a call from her, wanting to know my home address.  And     Yes, to my recollection.  Yes.  Because I did not... I honestly did not even know her name until I received the note.     Yes, I did.     I saw that and I can count for the get-well gift for sure.     Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.     Ja.     [No audible reply]      I am just going to the next... just a second.     There is an email here.     I see that the email goes to a Dudu Dube.     Is that the one?     Okay.     Yes, that is her home address.     That is my address.     Yes.     Yes, I see that.     Yes, I can confirm that this is my cell number.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes, I see that.     [No audible reply]      Just give me the top part where it says... because I am actually using my own file here.     H’m-uh.     This one and mine because I put it... I put my own file together here.      Let me go to the page.  What did you say?     81?     Let me go there.       Ja, I will do that.  Just a second.  I am just going there.     Ja.  Okay I see the email.       Yes, I see that.  Yes.     Okay I see that too, yes.     Well, be it on Wednesday, I was obviously at work.  So.  You know, I am going to say in all honesty.  When I receive Ms Gina’s affidavit.   I have an 83-year-old mother.  An 83-year-old mother     No, I was at work on that particular day.  So even if I... our... I at this point, I cannot say to you whether I was in Cape Town or whether I was in Pretoria.     Right.  But I did not sign for it.  So I cannot recall receiving a particular hamper on a Wednesday, the 1s t of July.  It is a weekday.       My birthday is on the 26t h of June.     No, it is not far from my birthday.     Yes?     I saw that reference because it was sent to both ladies.     No, I did not.  I did not ask.     Because ...[intervenes]      Normally, Wednesdays it is either a Cabinet meeting or a sub-committee meeting and that would be Wednesdays.  So I can say, I do not know, were we in Cape Town, were we in Pretoria during this period because I... when I look at it we were at the Department of Water.   So I cannot confirm whether she has received it.  I have not even asked her even when I received this.  Look, I consider this affidavit of Ms Pieters to be more related to me because that is what the emails said that I can question her and so forth and so forth.   So if Ms Mokonyane had received something, I cannot confirm on behalf on behalf of anybody.  I do not think it is fair that I should confirm that she has received.  She may not even have received it.     But again, and I want to ...[intervenes]      Your Honour?     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Your Honour.     No problem.  Thank you.       No.     I do not deny receiving the flowers.     Look, there may have been.  Like I said and I indicated earlier.  There may have been once or twice but as I indicated that it will come back.  It will come back.  I can confirm the flowers, the get-well flowers.  And I know that maybe at some point but I cannot confirm whether it was that particular day or whether it was any other time.     Yes?     No, I did not deny.  I am not denying.       I am saying I may have received.     I received ...[intervenes]      It was on that ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, Your Honour.     I am not denying.  I just... it may not be that time.  It maybe another time.     Yes?     Yes, I do know.  I can say I know.  I can just not say to you that is it on that particular day because it may have been any other time but not that particular day because like I am saying that date is Wednesdays, it is at work.  So it could have been any other time.     Once or twice.  Ja, once or twice.  Not necessarily that I would call him to pick up whatever or whatever.  No.  My communication was mostly with Mr Watson.  And how they did their communication in their office, I would not know.       Of my affidavit?     Yes?     Page 25?     85?     I am looking at 85.     Yes, I did.     It was flowers or something like that.  Whether it was flowers, whether it was a hamper, I do not know but I do know that when I got home there was a little card.     Yes, it was... yes, it was ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, it was.     Yes, it was.     I do not... as I indicated earlier, Mr Agrizzi     Then that is the reason why obviously the card would have his name.     Excuse me?     We have spoken... when I say we have spoken once or twice, I am saying once or twice.  We could have spoken more.  It depends on what the necessity was but I have spoken to him and I confirmed that yes, I did get these flowers.     More.     Well, it would depend on what he needed.     I would not know.  At one stage, I think he called.  Like I said, the day when he called, I was in hospital.  So I do not know what that one was all about.     He called once.  I was at work.     So obviously... I know I was at work and I was another call.     I cancelled the call and I said I will call back, okay?  So I called and he was in a meeting.     And by then... so that call, he did not follow up.  He could call me... he would call me about various things.  Mr Watson ask me to call him.     There were a number of issues that Mr Watson would ask him to call him for.     Well, it would be that Mr Watson had spoken to Ms Mokonyane and I need to... I cannot quite recollect what some of the issues were but it was quite a number of issues Mr Watson would have made with the late Mr Mokonyane.     It will come back to Mr Nokkie(sic).  I will... I am sure I would be able to answer that.       Not today.     Yes.  Mr Nortjie(sic), the nature of my job is such and Your Honour is that, you know, when you call people or people call you and depending on their tone, you can befriend a person.  This is how I did things.   You can become comfortable and have a relationship with that person without knowing that person.  If somebody     It is just on how you work with people.  You network telephonically and as a PA it helps.  So I may call     Notshe?  Okay sorry.     I thought I was putting it in an Afrikaans way. [laughs]     Ja.     It is Notshe.  And did I say Nortjie in Afrikaans?     Yes.     Yes.     I would call Mr Mokonyane.     Ja.  Because the train that followed was for them to call me because Mr Mokonyane himself will maybe in a meeting and even if I could not reach him, I would ask his     So I would be the one making contact with     The ladies at home would call me, yes.     Often... more often the ladies at home.  And I would also call them because we had to establish a relationship with the ladies working at home.     Well, I had to.       Not necessarily, no.     Look, if they call and then there is a problem and I can handle it at the time and sort it out, I would do so.  But I would only go to the house if and when it is necessary.     Yes?     Okay?     Yes, I ...[intervenes]      Yes, I have seen this Mr Notshe as part of my summons.     Yes, I have seen it.     No.     I read it a couple of times.  I read this one a couple of times and I tried to recall this.  Ja, I see there, where it says her PA was there as well.  Sandy.  Sandy Thomas.  I think her name was.     This one I cannot honestly... Mr Notshe, I cannot recall.  Ja.     And Mr Watson?     No, no.  Not in this instance, no.     I cannot remember anything like this.     It has been quite some time.  I... this one, I do not remember anything of this.  I went through it quite some time over and over and...     No, that is not the only things.      Do I have to elaborate?     Can I give an example?     Maintenance issues, it would depend on what it is and whether the ladies would actually call me.     Sometimes they would …[intervenes]     Okay, for example, sometimes the lights would go off.     So at times the ladies are not sure whether it is power failure or whether there is a problem, a switch or something in the house.   What I would first do, Your Honour, is ask her to ask the police at the gate just to come and check what exactly it is and also find out in the area if it is in the area.     Before we do anything and they would come back to me.  If they come back to me and they say no, no, it is in the area or it is just this house, that is when I would call Mr Mokonyane and say look, there is something wrong at home, we are not sure whether it is …[intervenes]     Mr.     Yes, I would call him because he was responsible for most of things around maintenance at home.     Well, what happened was, Mr Mokanyane had indicated to me that look, from time to time the ladies would call you directly.     At home yes, their personal home.     It is not necessarily maintenance issues, that is why I am asking do I elaborate, it is not just maintenance issues.     Yes.     Ja, I am referring to that as maintenance issues but overall, at home it would not just be maintenance issues.     It would be whatever.     Yes.     If the light go off, if the water goes off.     If there is a toilet leak.     Ja, whatever.     Yes.     Yes, whatever.       Anything – well, the ladies just had this thing that they would call me.     And if I know that Ms Mokanyane is not there, available, I would call Mr Mokanyane.     But, you know, it ended up more so that I would rather just end up calling Mr Mokanyane.     He is, after all, the principal of the house so I would call him.     No.     He would call if he needed to call.     Yes.     I would then …[intervenes]     There is often – look, it depended, Your Honour, on what it was.  If it was a plumbing issue, would call the plumbers.     Directly, yes.     If there was a leak, I would call the plumbers.       If there is electrical fault, I would call the electrician.     Directly.     But if it is something that I do not have any clue on how to address it I would call Mr Mokanyane.     Well, it depended.     For example, I know that there was a day the alarm went crazy and they – I said to them switch it off at the mains or switch off the mains or switch off the power or whatever.  And for some reason it still did not help.  So I then called Mr Mokanyane and said Chief, there is this problem at home, what do I do because it was rather noisy, according to the ladies, and he then said look, call this guy and speak to him about it.     Yes.     But knowing – no, I did not know his surname was Le Roux.     I just know him as Richard.     Yes.     Yes, I would …[intervenes]     Call, Richard.  Ja, we would get Richard to come out.     Ja or I am in – wherever he is, can you please call Richard.  Otherwise …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     He would try and attend to it and often I would ask him to please let me know whether it is attended to or sorted or whatever.     And then…     Yes, he would, he would tell me no, it is sorted.     He would – I would ask him, what was the problem so that if it happens in future what do I do, you know?     He would tell me that no, it is the switch or that switch, but…     And that is where it ends.     No, not – it would not stretch over that many years.     No, we have had – there is people that was there to do the electricity.     There is people that was there to do the plumbing.     So where I could sort it out, I would sort it out.     And not necessarily have to call Mr Mokanyane.     I would call him after.     And say – or even tell her after.     You know, sometimes I would forget.     That there was this problem and it has been sorted.     Ja, Richard.     No, not – it was not over a long period.       No, no.     I do not have anybody that – I do not know who deals with the alarms.     I do not know anybody that – if there was somebody that was dealing with alarms or with the alarm or if I had known who installed the alarm or I would have called that person.       They would leave the invoice at the house and it would be paid by Mrs Mokanyane.  They would always leave the invoice with the ladies at home.     I do not know.     Ja, a few times.     Yes.     Yes, like I said, I did not know his surname     Yes.     No, I did not.     I was told by Mr Mokanyane to contact Richard and say to him that there is this problem with the alarm, please he must tell me what to do and that was it.     Well, he obviously would have known because I was told just to tell him that.     No, no, I did not – no, no, I am saying he would have known.  I am not saying that he did not know or that I did not tell him, I am saying he would know because I was told by Mr Mokanyane to contact him.     Yes.     Look, he may have even been at the house without my knowledge, Your Honour.     But I was told by Mr Mokanyane contact him and ask him to assist.  Hence, I am saying that please let know what to do because I had no clue what is going on with the alarm so this email – sorry, this SMS.     SMS.     No, no it was not my first contact with Mr le Roux.     No, I do not have the house numbers because I – once I called him, I think more or less for the same problem, I just called and said the alarm is still doing the same thing, the alarm is ringing.  It was a time the alarm was just giving problems, so I would call and say the alarm if going off.  If he is in the area, he would say I am in the area, I will sort it out and I will tell Mr Mokanyane that Mr Mokanyane, I called Richard, he will go and sort it out from there on.     Yes, that is why I asked if I should elaborate.     Other issues like, for example, you know, sometimes we had a lady that – like I said earlier, we had a problem with one of the toilets and it was leaking water.  So the ladies had called me and said Sisi, there is this problem with one of the toilets and it was – I know it was leaking water, so the ladies have called me and said Sisi, there is this problem with the toilet, so I would call the plumber.  It is okay, let me call the plumber and they will come out.  So they would – look, I do not know what will go on there and we then call the ladies and then they will tell me no, it is sorted and that is it.   Other issues, there is a lady I know that used to or still does, I am not sure, delivers flowers, so she would also leave the invoice at home and the lady at the house would say to me so and so was here and she delivered the invoice, please remind mama to pay it and then I would say to her you know what, put it at a place where mama can see it and then you give it to her when she gets there because I am not in a position to say that there is this thing, I may not even see her because more often you do not even get to see – so when she comes home, you just give it to her.     No, I …[intervenes]     No, Mr Mokanyane would – no, Mr Mokanyane would do those things himself because I would not know what exactly is needed there.     Richard, yes?     I did not know where he worked, I did not even know what company he was working for.     Mr Mokanyane gave me his number.     No.  No, my only arrangement, I would just say look, as directed, I would just say that Cynthia – oops, sorry, x, y, z is – or not even Cynthia, Busisiwe, somebody is coming to the house, Ntata will tell you what they are going to do.  If he has not told you, this is what is going to happen, people are coming and this is but not what time or whatever, I do not know what time they would come.     No, not CCTVs, no, not to my knowledge.  I would just be told please tell Busi or please tell this one or please tell Grace that people are coming, they must open for them so that they could tell the police.     Not quite as – I am the PA, I am maybe the link.     Yes, some things would come, some would not.       We also had a Chief of Staff, we also had a media liaison and they had direct access to her so it would or would not come through me.     At home?     Okay, when we were at housing, it was a whole arrangement, I know that they did upgrades and it was a whole arrangement because I had to facilitate them going to the house.  So I had to inform the ladies at home that people are coming from the department and that happened during the time when we were at the Department of Housing.     It is not the Department of Housing, per se, we were at the Department of Housing at the time.      And it is not the Department of Housing per se but obviously there is security and risk analysis people, they would be there, the security guys, all of that was arranged through the office of the Premier.     The gentlemen at the Office of the Premier.     Well, the first point of contact was when they told me that they needed to go and do an assessment and they had to visit the house to see what needs to be done, what needs to be installed and what needs to be repaired and for security reasons I needed to just inform the ladies that they would come.     Yes, I would inform the ladies.     Not a full feedback because it was not within my scope.  We had a head of office even then, so the head of office would also, as the head of office, they have broader scope but I would not get feedback.  They would either talk to head of office or – but not even directly to Ms Mokanyane.     At the private residence and this was during her time as the MEC for Housing.     No, I just – all I had to do was facilitate their visit there.  Other than that – no.     To do the risk assessment, to go and have a look at the house and they obviously had their reports which they would not share with me.  I am not privy to that kind of information.     No, Your Honour, they just may ask me to please make sure that they have access to the property.     And they were also accompanied by one of our security people in the department.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, they would have spoken to Mr Mokanyane but they would have done that too and my knowledge, I also in that made that arrangement to facilitate that they had been given access and that was it.  I do not …[intervenes]     I would - Your Honour, I would just be the one that would ask, they would say make arrangements for the people at home, we are coming on this particular day.     Yes.     Yes.     So that they could go back to the house and they will be working at home, that is all.  The word was, they will be working at home.     I would ask, I would say what are you going to do?  No, we are going to do the fences, we are going to check the gates and we are going to – ja.     Ja, they just said we are going to do the fence, the gates, cameras.     The lights need…     Ja.  But that is it.     They were there.  They were there because at one point Mr Mokanyane met with them to discuss the issue of the gate.     Ja.     Yes, I do, Your Honour.       That they went and they put on the electric fence, they did the lights.     Ja, there was quite a number of things that they did.     Yes.     They put up a room for the police.     You know, to be sheltered, especially in rainy weather and so on.     So they had to put in monitors and things like that, ja.     That I know, yes.     No, I know that because I was told this is what – because I asked.     I cannot just say that you need access to the house, I need to know what you are going to do.     Yes.     Okay.     Well, I find that strange.     It was a time when I know that there was things that was done at MEC’s homes.     An MEC, not a Premier.     She was MEC for housing.     We had a person from the Housing department and we had people from the Office of the Premier who coordinated and SAPS.     They coordinated because there was a need for – I do not know, some sort of an upgrade to MEC’s homes.     So it was not just Ms Mokanyane as the MEC at that time.     It was something to do with MEC’s homes, but not during her term as Premier.     Yes, I am saying that Office of the Premier with a person from the Department of Housing and SAPS, it was all coordinated.     Well, that I did not know but what I can say and I can confirm that whatever was done it was done through SAPS at the Office of the Premier.     It may even be the Department of Housing, I do not know those technicalities.     The gentleman that we were working with at the Department of Housing that is responsible for safety, so it was a matter of assessments and things like that and I do know …[intervenes]     I remember his face.  I am not sure if it is Thabo, something like that but I cannot remember his name.     But he was responsible for security.     At the office of – at the Department of Housing.     Not SAPS, I would not know, Your Honour.     Office of the Premier they have their own security, I do not know if there was still – if there is people there, the same people, if they are still there.     We – there was a Colin, I do not know if he is still there or if he was even involved during that period.  I just know his name as Colin, I do not know if he was part of the involvement but he was at the office of the Premier.  Ja.     Yes, it was done through the department – gentleman that was responsible for security at the Department of Housing.     As I indicated now, it is either Thabo or something, I do not even know.  I can see his face though but in terms of his name, I cannot recall.  It could be Thabo something, I am not sure.     It would be the …[intervenes]     Ja, security, yes.     Somebody that was working with security, yes.     Yes, in the Department of Housing.     I do not know, Your Honour, if he was the head or …[intervenes]     Or if he was just assigned to take care of the matter, I do not know.     H’m.     When I went to the bathroom, I tried to recall a few things.  No, no.     What he discussed with me?     Can I go to that?     Page 50...?     And is 56 part of the summons?     It is very tiny.  Little tiny [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I cannot see anything here.     It is fine.     I think so.     Yes, Mr...?     No.     I can confirm that I have not arranged vehicles through Mr Agrizzi nor funerals and I know that there was even made mention of ANC rallies and catering and cakes.  No.      Those particular items, I have never spoken to Mr Agrizzi about, it is not – did not fall under my ambit, unfortunately.     I – Mr Notshe, maybe just a point, I am sorry that I have to interrupt and I am sorry, Your Honour, but …[intervenes]     I made it clear that I said it was a coordinated matter between the security people at housing, SAPS as well as the security people at the Office of the Premier. So who installed it, who paid for it, I unfortunately cannot answer on that one.     Well, if you look at the timeframes, we were at the office of the Department of Housing.  Where and why I was called, Mr le Roux was much later in the time and that is what it is.  At the Department of Housing and at the Office of the Premier I was not relating to Mr le Roux at all.  So this installation was way before the time of Mr le Roux and Mr le Roux only came in the latter part of the year so …[intervenes]     That particular SMS, Your Honour, was during that time.     Ja and that was her private home.     No.     Yes.     Yes, Your Honour?     Yes, I do.     Yes, Your Honour.     Let me just go to that, sorry, Your Honour?     Yes, I was there now.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     That is correct, Your Honour.     Parcels would be made.     Parcels would be made.     And it would go to families in Kagiso.     We would – ladies would know who to invite, which families are in most need and it would then go to those families.  The numbers would normally vary.     So even if you are proving for 70 or 30 people, you know, word of mouth, you will always find more people so one would try and accommodate for just the bit extra.     Ja.     We had …[intervenes]     Yes, I did say.  We had a network of people in the area, Kagiso community work.  They did not just work, they did not work for Ms Mokanyane or anybody.     They did mostly community work in Kagiso.     So they would know, you know, where there is a need.     And they would identify.     But it is not the same ladies, it would always be different people because people come and go.  But they would know who the needy are, the most needy, actually.  And it was a yearly thing.  There was one time when we did it even for her birthday but it was arranged completely differently so that …[intervenes]     Well, I was not there.     So I do not know if she was there.     But I was not there, I would just be part of the here and there and make sure that this is there and liaise with her sister, who is late, and she would also know that this is coming and this is what it is needed for.     I would liaise with her late sister.     Ms Mokanyane’s late sister.     Ja.     Yes.     No, no, just to indicate that there would be this coming.     And this is where you put it because we would be making parcels.     Ja, she is from Kagiso.     But she was living at the home.      She was at the house.        And besides – she was living at the house, so besides the ladies, the helpers, she was there living at the house so …[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes.     So obviously for me that would be the safest person in the safest place to have things dropped off so that we could coordinate it from there.     Because if it was taken directly to Kagiso it would have been a bit of a problem as to where and – ja.     And it would be done, taken and distributed.     People would be invited to come and…     Not standing there, no.     Not standing at the house, it would go to Kagiso.     Yes, Your Honour.     To the garage.     Yes.     Yes, Your Honour.     Yes, Your Honour.     Yes.     It would happen around Christmas time, December.     Sometimes it would try to be a bit early.     Because we normally would finish off at the 15 t h.     So sometimes it would be after – even after the 15 t h.     Yes, Ms Mokanyane would have this yearly event every year save for the last two years.     Due to ill health and the morning of her husband.     Not for the deliveries, no.     At times she would not even know.     I would be told by Mr Watson let us do this and let us do that.     I would indicate to him that okay, I am not sure how many people we are looking for and try and contact the ladies and establish how many people we are looking for – looking at to accommodate.     And we would take it from there  I would just indicate these are the number of people and whatever is brought, it is not my call.     Whatever is brought is brought and packages would be made.     No.     No.     No.     I would be the one that would be called.  Mr Agrizzi would indicate that, you know, you would get this call, just for a day and make sure that somebody is home to take responsibility of these things.     And that is it.   I know that it went into the garage because there is…       There was no space.     Not even a few days …[intervenes]     Ja, maybe the next day, I am not sure.     Yes, Christmas period.     A little earlier.     Depending on when Mr Watson would call.     Sometimes it would happen year after year and …[intervenes]     Sometimes they would skip a year.     But Ms Mokanyane would also then arrange her own …[intervenes]     Yes.     To give.  At one time we went and we did a blanket distribution …[intervenes]     She.     She.  At one time we did a blanket distribution to the old people.     As well as groceries and those kind of things.     Yes.     It would happen most of the years.     Sometimes it would be in the middle of the year.     For her birthday.     She would take the initiative of instead of spending her birthday, she would spend it with the grannies and the granddads in Kagiso.     And that would also be in the middle of the year.     For her birthday.     Not to my knowledge, no.     She would do it by herself.     And – ja.     Not always.     Not always BOSASA.     No.  She would do some of these things.     Yes, ja.     Not every year, no.     Not all the time.     It would  - we would wait for Mr Watson, if he calls.  If he does not call …[intervenes]     Most of it, ja.     Your Honour?     Pleasure.     My pleasure.  Thank you, Sir.
