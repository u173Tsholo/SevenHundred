Yes okay alright so yes. AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry I think the one that you referred to as the second is the one I thought was the first.  I am now looking for the whether the first is.    Oh I think the one that I picked up which I thought you said was the first is the one that says Mr Clayson Monyelato.  That is now the first one.    Oh that is the one?    Yes.    Yes so the TO should not be there    And there should be a an after so – in Clayson.    Yes.  That is the first one.     Oh first and second okay yes.

Okay.    Okay, okay.    That you picked up.    Yes.   She will make arrangements afterwards.    For a supplementary affidavit which will deal with this to say in this affidavit I have picked up the following corrects. This is how it should have been.  Basically what you have told us to be put in an affidavit form.  Okay no that is fine.    No that is fine.  Thank you.   Yes.  Could you just summarise – you have started it – it starts from 20 – in fact it starts from 2006 maybe you should start from page 7 because that is where you start from 2001, 2006 and then take us through your career and where you have served the country as an ambassador in various states throughout the world.      YEs.    Hm.   Yes.    Hm.    In 1994?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.    In your second life.  In your second life.    And then you became DG of the Department ofForeign Affairs.    Yes.    Hm.    And you started being DG from which year?   2011?    Okay, okay.  Thank yo.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.   So I think Advocates are quite lucky.    That is my representative. AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS    Yes.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And that is why I guess you are – you are referred to as His Excellency is that – does that come in?    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.  So – but you have made a very important point to which I think you were – Ms Norman was still going to come.  You say the head of state is saying to the receiving head of state this is my trusted representative.   And therefore I am – I take it that a person occupying the position of Ambassador must have a high degree of integrity, is that correct?    Yes.    The trust of the head of state.    Ja face to face.    Yes.    Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.  Thank you.    I think just raise your – the one in your hand and show it to him.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Okay, thank you.   I am sorry.  Just repeat (intervenes).    Yes.    We go to what page?    Oh.  We …    We had not done that.    Yes ma’am.  The file containing a letter from Dr Cassius Lubisi Director-General and Secretary to the Cabinet addressed to Mr Peter Pedlar will be marked EXHIBIT FF12.    I am sorry.  Before that …    I saw that Ambassador you took an affirmation and not an oath – not an oath but I see that this is in oath form.  Is that fine with you - your statement/affidavit?    It is fine.  Is it fine?    Affirmation.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay.  You have no problem?    Okay.   No that is fine.  That is fine.    Ja.  No, no that is fine.  I just want …    I – I was just wondering whether there was a mistake.  So – okay no that is – that is in order then.    Hm.    I guess the purpose of the visit?   And – and the time …    The time when the visit is proposed to happen?    Yes.    At OR Tambo Airport?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.   Yes, yes.    Oh.  Are you – are you asking the actual landing or the proposed visit prior to the landing?    Ja.   The request …    Ja.    After the arrival of …    Of the aircraft?   Oh.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes. Before that you did not know anything?    Yes; and normally you would not get involved?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes and that is the DDGs of your department?    Yes.    Meetings.    Hm.    Yes.  Maybe before you get to the preparations - you spoke earlier or you said earlier on there could be two note verbale.  One just making the request and another one later on – later on coming with details.    Normally at what or who at DIRCO would receive the first note verbale?   Yes.    That is the protocol officer?    Yes, of DIRCO yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    But you – you would – if it is a visit involving a Head of State you would become aware of the first note verbale …    Quite soon after it has arrived at DIRCO or not?    It will be quite soon?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, okay.  Okay and as the preparations moveforward you would be aware of what is going on and you will …    Be kept informed?    People?    Ja, okay thank you.    Yes.    Some special treatment?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    And then I must just ask this question you spoke about two note verbale.  Now is the position that there must always betwo?  Is the position that there must at least be one but sometimes there maybe two?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes, yes.    Hm.    But – but Jerry may be His Excellency?    Ja.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    So – but to go back to my question there are times when one note verbale is sufficient.  There are times when two note verbale are required or is the second one always optional?    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.   Hm.    Okay and I guess that whether it is one note verbale it might – can contain all the details that you would have expected from a second note verbale in a different case?    Yes.    The request?    Ja, okay.    Okay, thank you.   Investigation team?   Yes, and the C you are talking about Ms Norman is, have you gone, have you changed lever files to another one?    I am still at page 20.   Oh.     Okay.     Alright. Okay are you, in what page are you?    Page 4?    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja, would have kicked in much earlier.    So you knew?    MEC?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    National Minister?    Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry. I am sorry but still in note verbal was to have been required even if it was State Ministers or is there something you are coming to deal with?    Yes, because that, ja.    Ja, okay.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Error or mistake.    Hm.    But at that stage, I am sorry. At that stage I go back to the question that I asked earlier. Now at that stage when you were speaking to him in the meeting, you knew that there were no national Ministers.    Now if there were no national Ministers and there were and I am assuming and I know that you said you were not sure; assuming that there was no need for, was there a need for a noteverbal if it was just State Ministers? Because there might be no oversight or mistake to send a note verbal if no note verbal was required. Have you determined that at that stage?    Which it was? Is not it?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    But do they go to Waterkloof?    They do not?    Yes, yes.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, I think we will take the short tea adjournment.    You want to make the last one before we take adjournment?    Yes.   Ja.    Hm.    To OR Tambo?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    After landing at Waterkloof?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, yes. No, that is fine. Before we take the adjournment, I just want to ask this question. This was as I understand the position an aircraft that was coming to South Africa to bring guests who were going to a private wedding and some of the people who were said to be included in the aircraft to be in the aircraft were State Ministers of India. Did and as I understand it, even day were not goingto have any meetings with any government officials as I understand the position. So their trip had nothing to do with any; there are coming to South Africa had nothing to do with any government official. If my understanding in regard to those issues is correct then it just seems to me that this was a completely private visit for everybody. You could have a situation where maybe I do not know, State Ministers from India are coming to South Africa. They are going to meet some MECs maybe, I make an example. There is going to be some government business to do and maybe as while they are in South Africa, there will also attend a private wedding. Something suggests to me that under those circumstances it may be that it might be viewed in a certain way, I am not sure but it seems that this was just completely private. They were not going to meet anybody from government and have official government business and that for that reason for all intents and purposes, this was private. Is my understanding correct?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. So in terms of official documents to which DIRCO had access or with which DIRCO had been furnished, there was no intimation that any of those State Ministers were going to meet any official from government. Anybody that might have known anythingmight have known it on the basis of unofficial sources.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    And I take it that around the time when you were dealing with this issue immediately after the landing, you would have been furnished with all relevant documentation that anybody at DIRCO had access to.    And therefore, you would know. You would have known if there was some document that had been given to DIRCO that indicated that there was a plan for them to meet some MECs.    Yes, thank you. We will take the short adjournment and we will resume. It is 25 past. We will resume at 20 to 12.    We adjourn.INQUIRY ADJOURNS FOR TEA    Urgent meetings that sometimes take place during the tea break about Commission work. Thank you. Let us proceed, yes     Okay Ms Norman?    On which Exhibit are we now?    I do not seem to get Exhibit FF3 here.    I have got Exhibits 2A and B.    4, 5, 7,8.   6, 9 and 10.    Just continue.    I may be able to.    Do without.    I think what should be done is every morning somebody must check from the legal team that everything that I should have is here.    Look at the spine of the lever arch file and see whether it is written FF3. Okay she will help you.     Okay.    Okay.    What is the page number that you want?    Page 3 of Exhibit FF3?    2 n d of May?    The right way.    Yes.   Hm.    But you say at that meeting the Minister took this position that Ambassador Koloane should be suspended.    Yes, okay.    And legislation?    Hm.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Your role there is important. It was to just implement the, irrespective of what you may have thought about the sanction?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm. You might not have anything to say about this because your role as you say was to implement.    Yes.   The question that I was thinking of asking you, I am not going to ask you because I think I should reserve it for somebody else other than you. But you do accept, do you not and as a general principle that there are certain things that if you have done it does not matter how good you are, you may have to go? I am not talking about this specific matter. I am just in general; you accept that? In general, not about.    Sorry?    In some areas, yes.    Ja, no that is fine. Thank you. Ms Norman?    Are you done?    Thank you very much Ambassador for coming to give evidence and help the Commission. Thank you very much.   If I refuse your request, what will happen to South Africa in the family of the nations?    You are excused. You can go back to New York.    Thank you, thank you.    Do you want a short adjournment?    Yes.    Okay. We would take a short adjournment before thenext witness.    Thank you. INQURY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Are you ready?    Ja, okay.    Yes, yes.    Ja, no that is fine.    Thank you, thank you.   Administer the oath or affirmation to him.    Thank you very much.  Ambassador as Ms Norman has indicated we do not have a statement from you, but because of what she says was a misunderstanding but we do have material whereyour name is mentioned in regard to the incident that we want you to share your knowledge about.  I just want to indicate to you that you will be asked questions by Ms Norman, I may also ask questions, just feel free, answer to the best of your ability, and if you do not understand a question feel free to ask for it to be repeated, and it will be repeated, and give your answers to the best of your ability and as honestly as required when anybody is under oath.  The whole purpose is to understand what happened, what role everyone who is mentioned played, had played and since you are mentioned we also want to understand what role you played and it isimportant that I should understand as much as possible because in the end I will make findings.  I must understand your own perspective as well as to what your role was, what may have been in your mind in dealing with matters in a particular manner, so this is an opportunity where you can just share with the Commission exactly what you know and your perspective so that when you are done we have – I have a full picture of what your role may have been, you understand?    Yes thank you, you may proceed Ms Norman.    The request ...(intervention)    The request for the landing.    Maybe before we proceed there, maybe let us just hear what your usual role is in regard to requests for visits for Heads of State, Ministers, or private visits in terms of what your function was, your job was at that time.    By the High Commissioner.    Okay before we proceed, the information you got from the High Commissioner was that it was a Ministerial visit or there were going to be Ministers on the aircraft?    Yes, on your understanding would your office or DIRCO be involved in anything relating to flight clearances in circumstances where an aircraft might have ministers from another country who are not coming into the country on official business, would DIRCO or your office be involved normally in such a case?    Yes    Yes, yes, but if there is no suggestion of any threats and it is just they are not going to meet any government official or ministers or anybody, it is really a private visit would your office being DIRCO be involved, would DIRCO be involved at all?   Yes, so to some extent whether the embassy office of the relevant country makes such a request is a factor to be taken into account but if it does make such a request even with a private visityours is just to pass on the request to the Department of Defence?    And is that the case whether it is a State visit, official visit or private visit, namely the people who must decide in the end whether they allow the landing of an aircraft falling under those categories is the Defence Force?    Would the difference be that if it is a State visit or official visit DIRCO and your office would have had certain roles to playin order to make sure that South Africa played its role if that visit happens?    And the State visit is only one which involves Heads of States?    Yes okay.    Okay.  Yes.    I am sorry, maybe let us start with the question whether when you phoned him he was aware of the application as atthat time as far as you recall?  Or was he hearing about it for the first time from you?    Okay.    Yes, okay, alright.    So, yes.    Or maybe before that.    Maybe you can just tell me the full conversation that was – that the two of you had accepting that it is quite some time backthat this happened but also accepting that you have had access to documents and reports I think of what different people may be saying happened and I assume even with regard to Mr Ntishsi’s own version if you can just tell me this is my recollection of what transpired during that conversation?    Hm.    I am sorry should we not go to that letter from thePA?    Or do you want to deal with that later?    Did you say page 199?    You can read the letter.    The email.    That is Mr William Matjila?    Hm.    I am sorry.      In relation to the call you received from the high commissioner.    And the meeting that you have just talked about.  Which happened first?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  That happened before you got a call from the high commissioner of India?    Yes.    Oh okay, alright.  Now at OR – at the OR Tambo meeting.    We have been told about a number of people who attended then Minister Ben Martins was there.    You were there?    I think …    The CEO of ACSA.    Was it Mr Tony Gupta who was there or was it another brother of theirs?    Tony Gupta.    Yes, yes.  I take it that at that meeting Mr Gupta gave full information of what this was all – this trip or this visit, this landing that they wanted at OR Tambo was about?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  Okay.  So that is the information that was revealed.   1.  It is a wedding – wedding. 2. There would be some Ministers or maybe some Ministers.    Oh he said there will be some Ministers.    There might be a Vice President.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  And as you understood the conversation at that meeting was this cultural reception or welcome ceremony was it supposed to happen on the tarmac of the airport near where the aircraft would have landed or is that a detail that you cannot remember?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  I see we are two minutes or so past one.    We are going to take the lunch adjournment. We would normally take an hours – an hour long lunch adjournment but there is some urgent commission business that I have to attend to.    So I am going to adjourn until three o’clock to attend to that urgent commission business.    And then we will resume at three.    Yes.  We adjourn.    Okay let us proceed.  Thank you.    Ms Norman have you got your – do you not want to say between the time of that meeting in February and…    And the landing.    Well would …    Well why do you say remote possibility because that is what you had been told at least that there would be Ministers.    No, no I accept that.  I accept that.    Ja no I accept that you say you do not remember whether you mentioned that or not but I was thinking that it must be just as possible as anything because that is the knowledge you had namely in terms of what you were told  - you had been told unless your knowledge had changed.  You had been told by the …    High Commissioner.    Both – well you had been told by the High Commissioner in the telephone conversation with you.    But you had also heard from one of the Gupta brothers in the meeting that you had at OR Tambo that there would be Ministers?    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, no I think mentioning one is good enough.  You know the one what the High Commissioner said to you.    The other one was just an extra and we can put that aside. So what I am saying is I am reacting to you saying there is a remote possibility that you may have said – mentioned Ministers but I am wondering why you say it was – it would be a remote possibility.  I would have thought you would say it is possible because that is what I was told.  You know it is not like necessarily remote but it could have – it is very – it is possible.    Yes thank you.  Because they – from – in your mind at that stage that is what you were talking about an aircraft that you had been told would have Ministers.    Well – well so far I have had somebody who speaks English very eloquently.    Okay alright.    Continue.    I think – I think you may be speaking at cross purposes.    I think what he is saying – the point he is making is.    To the extent that it may have been Colonel Sanderson – Anderson.    Who called.    She wold have been the one who wanted something from him and therefore he cannot remember.  But he says he cannot remember whether he is the one who called.  So I think that is the distinction he wants.  Because your questions says, what did he want from her/    And I think what he is saying is I cannot remember whether …    I am the one who called in which case you are right toask me what I wanted her to do.    Or whether she called me.  In which case she would be the one who would have wanted something from me.    Mr – Ambassador is that – is my understanding correct…    Of the point you wanted to make?    Well at least from what you say maybe it does clarify at least in part…    You say at some stage when you were speaking to her you sought to establish what was holding back the processing of the application but what you cannot remember is whether it was before youspoke to Mr Ntshisi or after.    Is what you cannot remember.    Okay alright.    Let us go back before – let us go back to your conversation with Warrant Officer Ntshisi.  You have already testified about that.    And you said what the gist of the conversation was.  As far as you are concerned did you capture everything important in regard to that conversation?    Yes, yes. yes.  And you would have read what I think is recorded in the – in the report.  I think Warrant Officer Ntshisi if I am not mistaken says that one of things you said was that Number 1 or the President was aware of the – this request for a visit and as I understand what is recorded and I for now I leave out what Major Ntshisi said when he was in the witness stand because it may be necessary to recall him to clarify certain things.  Is there – is your understanding that that is – that reference to Number 1 or the President does relate to that conversation or is it a later conversation?    Yes.    No, no let us take it step by step.  For now let me not deal with what your version is.  I am saying did you see in the documents that have been made available including the report of the Directors General that there is a suggestion that the version that was told to them was that in a conversation with Warrant Officer Ntshisi you said Number – you referred to Number 1 either Number 1 or the President that he was aware of the visit and you said something to the effect that the – the application should be approved either approved or processed but you mentioned Number 1 or the President, are you aware that that is what is in the documentation and is attributed to you beforewe can talk about whether it correctly reflects what you said.    Yes come.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No but you should listen to my question.  I asked him what his understanding is of what the documentation says.  So in other words I said is his understanding that that was a conversation with Mr Ntshisi then or later in which case if his understanding is that the documentation does refer to any such conversation with Ntshisi where he mentioned that he can say no, no, no I am not aware that the documents have such a reference.  I am aware that the documents refer to which mention that are documents relating to a conversation I had with somebody else.    Do you understand?   Okay alright.  Thank you.    You are not aware?    Yes.  Ms Norman do you…    Yes, yes.    Yes.  No, no, no definitely    We will give you the chance to do that.    Ms Norman do you want to take that question forward?    I am under the impression I may be wrong…    I am under the impression that Ntshisi is reflected as having said that but I may be wrong.    Ja okay alright.    Well to the extent that if you are going to go to thereport it may be that this might be the time that we allow the witness to mention …    His concerns about the report.    Before we can go into it.    Do you want to deal with that Ambassador?    Yes.   Ms Sindane.    Oh.  We are not being recorded we are not being heard or something like that?    Okay let us – let us take a short adjournment to allow the technicians to attend to what they need to attend to and then we will continue.  Hopefully five minutes will be enough.    Okay we adjourn.    Figure out what it is that is a problem but we are going to proceed because I understand whatever the problem is has not affected our recording for the purposes of the transcript.    So …    We will – we will continue.  Let us continue. ADV THANDI NORMAN    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Thank you.    Yes proceed.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja, okay.    Thank you.    Okay.  Let us – let us put it this way according to this report Warrant Officer Ntshisi at the time according to the report told you in that conversation that the base could only receive flightstransporting Heads of State and their Deputies.  Do you remember him having said that to you or are you saying you do not remember he may have said so but you do not remember or you say he definitely did not say so?    Huh-uh.    Hm.   Well I can imagine that he might have said Heads of State and their Deputies if he did not intend giving the whole list …    But if he was then asked are those the only people then if he said Heads of State and their Deputies only.  Then he would have appreciated that he was now being asked to give the full list or what do you say?    Hm.    Yes.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Is your recollection that at this stage he knew or he had seen the application or the papers that indicated details …    About the request?   Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Thank you.    I am sorry.    Going to the point that you made in regard to the statement to say you would have been surprised if he gave an incomplete list.  If indeed he did say landing at Waterkloof was for Heads of State and their Deputies then it would be understandable would it not if you then said you know the people who are coming include Ministers because you were aware that according to Commissioner – the High Commissioner it was Ministers who were going to be involved in the plane in terms of Government Officials andnot other people.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    I am sorry.  Just repeat that last bit.    Unless of course your understanding was that Ministers can also land there under certain circumstances despite what he was saying.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.  No what – what I mean is if he said to you Heads of State and their Deputies land here and you know that Ministers also land there under certain circumstances it appears to me to be natural for you to say - to refer to Ministers because that might just remind him that do – Ministers do also actually land there or you do not think so?    Yes.    Yes.    You do not recall ja but it is possible but you do not – you are not sure?    Ja, okay.  Thank you.    Hm.    Well some of these are important pieces.  So I just want to draw attention that if you do not recall - if you say you do notrecall what it means is that it could be that you said it.  It could be that you did not say it.  So it is important that you make up your mind as to whether the position is that you do not recall.  It could be that you said it. It could be that you did not say it or you are quite clear that you did not say it.  In which case if you are quite clear that you did not say it then you say I definitely did not say it.  So I just want to explain that so that you – you understand what – what meaning I attach to a statement when you say I do not recall.    So that you can make sure I – I get exactly what you want to convey.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Well where it says   I take that to be a reference to you.  Is that correct?    That – that you added.  Same sentence that you are dealing with just now.  At the beginning of it. “He added that the Minister of Transport Minister Ben Martins had been given instructions …” My understanding that the “he” is a reference to you.  Is that your understanding as well?    But I do not think that takes care of the point you have made.  It maybe – maybe I might have misunderstood.  My understanding is that because the previous sentence relates to you. “The Ambassador responded to that there will be four to five Ministers on board.” Then the next sentence. “He added that the Minister of Transport Mr Ben Martins had been given instructions …” That “he” I understand to be a reference to the Ambassador.  That would be your understanding of – of this as well or not really?   Yes.  If it is read like that then you understand it but you do not recall?    Okay, alright.    And then of course it says   Yes, yes but you say whatever the – whoever the “he” is referred to you – you have no recollection that …    This – this was said?    And – and even if the suggestion that it was said by you – you say …    You do not recall?    And – and you appreciate the distinction that I have just said about …    Being – about saying I do not recall or never – I never said it?    Okay, thank you.    I am sorry.    I have lost you where you are.  I was looking for something else.    Of the report?    Okay.  Okay, alright.    Hm.    I am sorry.  I – I missed you.    I was looking for something else.    The …    No, I am on that page.   I want to talk about something that you may have asked already.    In – in that paragraph after the part that we were dealing with which you could not recall relating to somebody being told to assist and this was - and that this was a unique case.  It is reflected that Mr Ntshisi requested a note or letter from the Ambassador and that the Ambassador responded that the challenge was that this could not be put in writing.  She probably has asked you this.  What is youranswer to …    Whether there was that exchange or not?    Yes.    Hm.    So you say you never said that or you cannot remember whether you say – you said it the statement that on this page is attributed to you and it is said that it came from Warrant Officer Ntshisi.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So you …    Yes.    Please finish.    Yes.  No, I understand that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. I know that your legal team did ask that you be given a chance to give evidence this week to which I agreed and I said Monday at the time we spoke. I think it would have been Tuesday or Wednesday.    On Tuesday. I know that at that time your legal team and you were still waiting to be furnished with certain documents and Iknow that, I think Ms Norman indicated or somebody indicated from the legal team that you would be given documents as soon as possible. I do not think at that stage there was any contemplation of a delay in terms of documents that the Commission did have already but you have indicated that you only got some on Friday. Is that correct?    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay let me tell you something in relation to the Commission that may assist. The Commission was going to sit tomorrow in order to hear other evidence but have been told that the witness was going to give evidence tomorrow is not able to do so due to family situation. Now I wonder whether to the extent that you may have a complaint or concern that you have not had enough time to look at the documentation, you think it would help if we adjourned and allowed time and then come back tomorrow. I understand you only needto leave later for I assume the Netherlands?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. No, it is fine and I will ask what your Counsel’s attitude is. I am saying this because we do want to make sure thateveryone feels that they have a fair opportunity. Let me hear if your Counsel has anything to say in regard to this. Where we can we would not like a situation where later when everything is done there is still a feeling that had I been given a little bit more time, you know I may have dealt with issues differently. Yes, Counsel?    Yes.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    Okay, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja    Yes.    Yes. Okay alright thank you. I think what your counsel has said seems to be in accordance with what you have said.    Well, I do not know exactly what documents you have in mind but there is no document that I am aware of as we speak that the Commission has which may not be made available to you. Whether or not it may have been available sometime last week I do not know but as I speak now I am not aware of a document that may not be made available to you. But I do know that on Thursday, as Thursday there was a transcript or recording that the Commission had wanted which is not be made available to the Commission and despite certain promises have been made. And I drew that to the attention of the Chief of the Air Force who was giving evidence and asked him to facilitate the release of the document or the recording which he undertook to look into and over the weekend or on Friday I was told that either that had been made available at some stage or was going to be made available overthe weekend. So to the extent that you might refer to that, I can assure you that I have not seen it but I have been told that it is there. I have not even seen it myself. I was told that there was I think a memory stick or something like that and it was left at the gate with the police at my official residence. I was told but it has never reached me. So as we speak I do not know about that. But anything that you want to have sight of nobody can or should deny that without me having a final say. If anybody says you are not entitled to have it, you can raise that your lawyers with me and then I can hear what the problem is and can make a ruling. So I just want to mention that part but I do not know if thereare other parts but I see your counsel is back in front of me. So I think maybe probably would prefer that he speaks.    Yes, yes.    Yes, no with special reference to that one, I mean to the recording to which I have made reference, my understanding is that the evidence leader intended to lead evidence on that and to ask me for leave to play it. But if you have not had a chance to listen to it and he has not had a chance, I would be inclined to think that might be a reason for us to adjourn and then continue tomorrow so that you getthat opportunity to do that. What is your attitude to that?     Ja, but what it does also even though you and your client might have taken a different view is that it also does give him and yourselves an opportunity to look at any other documents that have been given to you on which he might not have had time to reflect properly. And then when we continue tomorrow hopefully, the documents that he might not have had enough time to look at. He might have had some more time.    Yes.   Ja, it mitigates, ja.    Ja, okay thank you. Ms Norman?    What you have to say about these things?    Yes.   Yes.    Which documents? Alright let me put it this way. As at Wednesday last week.    When he has counsel requested that he givesevidence this week and not last week.    What documents have they been given already and what documents had they not be given? You see there are a number of documents that are relevant to his evidence.    And if for example one goes by when they had how much of the documents and whatever was left one knows exactly what was outstanding and when the part that was outstanding was given to him.   Then I am in a position to assess whether the days that he had, the time that he has had is adequate. But if I do not know when he got what then is difficult.    That would have been when? Wednesday or Thursday?    Yes.    On Thursday?    So on your understanding, if there were documents that you think Mister De Beer sent on Thursday were sent.    How much was outstanding by the end of the day or by Friday morning?    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    No, no that is fine. Of course we are not in a situation where Ambassador Koloane for his legal team came this morning and said we are not ready.    We need more time. That is not the situation but we want to make sure, I want to make sure as far as possible that there is fairness to everybody.    It may be that there are certain matters that we can still cover this afternoon and maybe others tomorrow; that is one option but it may well be that maybe if certain issues are quite central to everything that maybe we should adjourn until tomorrow in the hopethat this would add to the time.    And if Mister Koloane’s counsel come tomorrow and make an application for and they say they cannot continue; Mr Koloane cannot continue then we take it from there. They would have to make an application for a postponement if that is the case. My understanding is that they would like to avoid that. They would like that this time be used as much as possible. But I think you make the point that they might have to be put to any election so that we do not have a situation where we spend this time and go on and then later on they say therewas fairness because they were not given time. Whereas if they say look is not going to be fair, we need more time. We might decide to, say okay if they have make out a good case we will adjourn.    Because I think what you have in mind is, if we proceed not knowing where they stand it might defeat the whole purpose.    Yes, yes.    Ja, okay.    Hm.    Well, I am reluctant to allow the playing of the recording before they can hear it.    But let me hear what counsel for Mister Koloane hasto say and then we try and finalize this.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Ja.    Well, I would like us to make use of the time that has been set aside unless there is.    Unless there is going to be unfairness to him and if there is going to be unfairness it would not be on the basis that thenext time he comes would necessarily depend on agreed dates. We want to try and we talk to people who are concerned as far as possible but we want to retain the right to fix the dates because otherwise if you are going to wait until everybody has agreed you will not get anywhere. So subject to that I would like only to consider an adjournment that goes beyond to do tomorrow or this week only if I am made to understand that otherwise there would be unfairness and the unfairness I think would; it will be a question of whether bearing in mind what he would be asked questions about. Whether he has been given adequate time of looking at the documents and so on. So in other words therewould have to be, I would have to be convinced. At this stage, I remain open to be persuaded. I am inclined to think that it ought to be possible for us to continue and finalize without any unfairness to anybody particularly if we are going to adjourn to allow more time until tomorrow. But if your side takes the view that definitely is going to be unfairness and it would rather apply for an adjournment, a long adjournment then I would consider that at that time and look at the grounds. That is why I have asked now, how much of the documentation was given when and so on because although there is a lot of documentation here, my understanding is that that a lot of it might not really relate to his role.    You know. Although, his role it seems to be quite important, it seems to be narrow.    To me.    And therefore it ought to be possible to have certain documents that relate to his role that are important and to apply one’s mind to them and finalize.    Yes, no, no I accept that, I accept that, ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Excuse me. Thank you.     Now with regard to what you received over the weekend in regard to the recording of the conversation between as I understand the position, Ambassador Koloane and Major Ntshisi.    And Ambassador Koloane and Colonel Anderson, that is available to him. There is no problem with that. Is not it?    Yes.    Yes, but is not classified or anything?    Declassified?   Okay.    That can be given to him then.    And then what is the other confidential document or something? There is nothing else?    I thought there was something else that arrived today or something this morning.   Oh okay.    Oh okay.    The disciplinary hearing report or what?    But it is available to him?    Ja.    So there is nothing that as far as you know should not be made available?    That you, that we have.    Ja. Okay those can be given to him or his lawyers immediately. So it, but it seems to me that we should adjourn until tomorrow morning so that they can then have, they can listen to the recording and number one. Number two, use the time to for particular the witness but his lawyers may need to as well. If there are anydocuments that they have not had a chance to apply their mind to.    But my understanding of his role suggests that even with documents it should not be many documents that need to be referred to that are in the bundle.    Everything, yes.    Yes.   But.    Is it your understanding too that those that really relate to him is very limited number?    Very limited number.    Yes, yes.    Ja. Okay, alright.    Thank you. I am happy to adjourn. We can adjourn to tomorrow at 10 and everybody understands why we are adjourning. Andthen when we resume tomorrow at 10, we can then hear if the witness’s counsel has, can indicate to us what the position is but as I speak my inclination is that as far as possible, it ought to be possible for us to continue without there being any unfairness to the Ambassador. But I will be told if there is any feeling that there will be unfairness.    Okay.    Alright. Ambassador, you have been listening to everything, you understand where everything is going.   You do? Ja, I am going to adjourn the proceedings now and we will resume tomorrow at 10 o’clock. The adjournment will serve the purpose of allowing you and your legal team to listen to the recording but also to have more time to apply your mind to whatever other documents, whatever documents you might not have had a chance to apply your mind to. And tomorrow we will be looking at proceeding but you and your legal team are free to make any application that you might consider making about a possible adjournment and then I would make a ruling on it. You understand?    Okay, thank you. We are going to adjourn then until tomorrow at 10 o’clock. We adjourn.

Ja.  We have had very kind Ambassadors in New York I hope you are that kind?  But…    Yes.

Now that you mentioned to the Chairperson the letters that a person wouldreceive which the person must take to the head of state in the country where one is deployed.  This FF12 Mr Chairman these are documents that have been received from the Director General Doctor Lubisie from the Office of the President.    Yes.  Could you – could I just ask you to turn to page 3 of that document.    Yes.  This for instance is a President’s minute that would relate to Ambassador Koloane.    Because this is the one that you had requested.    Yes.  Could you turn to page...(intervenes)    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  May I also at this stage this exhibit – this be admitted as EXHIBIT FF12 which is the documentation from the Presidency.  Thank you.    As EXHIBIT FF12 Mr Chairman.    Yes, thank you.

Thank you Ambassador, can you go back now to EXHIBIT FF11 which has your affidavit.    We have covered paragraphs 1 up to five with the process that you have already testified to.  Could you then tell the Chairperson - you were asked by the Commission is that correct toanswer certain questions.  One of the questions that you were asked was …?    Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.    Thank you.  Then you were asked just to give a summary of what is the process that DIRCO would engage inwhen there is a request from a foreign country for landing in South Africa and then you deal with that process in paragraph 5.  Could you just briefly tell the Chairperson what that process is?    Yes.    Yes.   Thank you and – and then coming to the issue that we are dealing with which is the Waterkloof landing of Jet Airways.  When did you become aware of that landing for the very first time?    Yes, yes.  No.    In fact I think he …    The request.    When did you for the first time become aware of the request that Jet Airways wanted to land at Waterkloof?    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So that relates to the arrival of a Head of State.  What happens when thereare Ministers visiting the country?  Do you get as informed as you are when it is the Head of State visiting?    Yes.    Thank you.        Okay.  Thank you Mr Chairman; and then – then you commented then on the report that Ms Sindane and Dr Swemmer and – and others had prepared and you deal with your comments on the report from page 4 onwards and then you comment specifically on what is termed under the post arrival stage or phase and you deal with when you first got to know about the landing and the steps that you took.  Could you take us through that process please?    Are you looking at FF1?  That is Ms Sindane’s bundle.    Yes.    Yes.  What page are you looking at?    Yes.    Page – page 19.  On top it would be page 19.  Is that right?  Not.    Oh sorry.  Yes.  It will be page 19 2.3.3.   The bottom page is marked 15.    19 on top.  Page 19.    Thank you.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    From 4 o’ clock until 21   Yes.    Yes.   Yes thank you Mr Chairperson is Ambassador Koloane but before I lead Ambassador Koloane his legal representatives would like to place certain matters before you, thank you.   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman Ambassador Koloane does not have a formal statement that has been placed before you.  There has been some misunderstanding as to what is it – the break, the period that was requested on Tuesday but be that as it may he is willing to testify and I would beg leave to lead him.  Thank you.  May he be sworn in.     Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Ambassador is it correct that you are currently serving as an Ambassador in the Netherlands?     Yes, and as you have indicated you have been invited then to tell your version of what – the persons that youlistened to last week, the evidence of Ms Sindane, the former Director General of Justice and Constitutional Development and the evidence of Major Ntshisi, you were present when those persons testified, is that correct?     Yes, now shall we then just deal briefly with how you got to know about the landing of the Jet Airways at the Waterkloof, the very first time that you were told about it, who told you and ...(intervention)     ...and the request ...(intervention)      The request for the landing yes.     Yes, now ...(intervention)     Yes.     Yes, no I do not recall anyone saying thatDIRCO does draw it, our understanding is exactly the way you put it, DIRCO does not draw it but it receives it.     Alright, now let us just take this one step at a time.  You have just given an answer that the DG would know that there is a request coming from a foreign country and then the DG then will bring that particular DG will bring that to your attention?     The DDG.     Alright, okay let us talk about this incident then.  We know that there was no Head of State coming, is that correct?    Now you know.     Okay now at the time what was your understanding of in respect of whom was the request being made? AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE     Yes, no, no but then there is no mention of a Head of State there is it?     Yes, so at that time when then the request, when this was brought to your attention by the Head of State you knew that there was no Head of State ...(intervention)      By the Commissioner, I beg your pardon, thank you Mr Chair.  Okay, may I just repeat that, when the High Commissioner of India called you he did not mention that there would be a Head of State in respect of the request that he was following up on.    Yes.  So at what point, if any point at all, did you then get to understand that there would have been a Head of State?     Yes, so then the High Commissioner called you and says look there has been some delays and we know that usually these things are done quickly, so what was the first thing that you did?     Yes, so then you said look into this, you say to your PA look into this, that is Ms Morris, is that correct?    Is that Ms Morris?     So you say to her look into this thing, there is a complaint from the High Commissioner, India, they say there is a bottleneck.     Find out where the bottleneck is?     Yes.     Yes, so at that point then when High Commissioner called you, you also had no idea of what he was talking about?     Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  So then let us talk about then your secretary would have made enquiries, what did you discover, did she report back to you as to what she discovered?    Yes and then who did you then call?    Yes.    Yes, so at that point when you werecalling Mr Ntshisi you had not had sight of any documentation?    Yes, so then what did you convey to Warrant Officer Nshisi, at the time he was a warrant officer.    At that point you had not had any documentation with you, you had not had sight of any application?    Yes, you have already told the Chairperson that you have no powers over defence, I am just trying to understand the basis upon which then without any documentation at your disposal at the time would you then have to ask Warrant Office Ntshisi to process the application, I just want to understand the basis upon which you did that?   Yes, what did Warrant Office Ntshisi say to you when you said to him please process this application?     Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman, so then what did he say to you then, if he was aware or the impression you got was that he was aware of the application, and you said to him please process it, what was his response?    Yes and then what was the discussion among the two of you?    Yes.  In the end what was the understanding between you now and Major Ntshisi?    In the understanding you had made the call to him to process it, did he report back to you that now we have processed it?    Yes.    Yes.  Sorry…    Then in your interactions with Warrant Officer Ntishisi did he ask you for anything in writing or something in writing?    Yes.    No I wanted – I can go to it Chair it is at page 199 of Exhibit FF – at page 199 Exhibit FF4.  Ambassador you will find it is that big lever arch file next to you.    Yes.  Could you just look at the spine of that – is that FF4?    Thank you.  Okay.    Page 199 yes.  Thank you.  It will start from – we have on line 8 – okay.   Yes this is from – you have already identified Ms Morris is your secretary at page 199 and that is dated the 9 April 2013.    Yes and you mentioned somebody who had been copied there?    Yes.    Yes.  And then what does Ms Morris convey to these people?    Yes.    He is writing to   Yes.    Yes.  What does he say in the email?    No, no, no there is something else there.  Could you just read the entire email please?    Yes.    Now if he – if she says Ambassador Koloane has telephonically approved the request, what request would that be?    Yes.  Now let us take a situation where let us say it is a head of state from another country who has applied or requested to land alright.    And that request is sent to DIRCO.    There is nothing wrong about it and you as DIRCO all the processes that you said you follow you would have followed and you quite comfortable.  You have checked with thePresidency as you would say, you checked with the Minister and you comfortable that that aircraft should be allowed by defence if it is defence to land, would you in those circumstances say, DIRCO is comfortable and DIRCO approves the – or – approves the landing?    Yes.  When did you discover for the first time that your secretary had sent this letter – or this email to Mr Matjila?    Yes.  And then when you then discovered that there was this investigation and yoh now you secretary had issued something like this what steps did you take?    Yes.  Now let us deal with that – before we deal with the rights insofar as your suspension is concerned I just want to understand – because from – what you have told the Chairperson the very first time you got to hear about it is – it is when this high commissioner called you about it and you would not have been involved in anything else that was intended to either facilitate this landing or in any way that would be seen to be you having tried to assist other than the call that you made to Warrant Officer Ntshisi?    Yes.    Nothing else?  Okay.  What else would I be talking about?    Yes.    Yes.   Lanseria?    Yes.  So then when…   Okay yes Sir.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.  Thank you Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Ambassador I would like to refer you to the Exhibit FF1 which is the Exhibit that contains the statement of Ms Sindane.  It is a small presentation file.  Yes thank you.  And I would like to draw your attention to page 10.  It would be under the second divider marked number 2.  Are you there?    Yes thank you.  The sequence of events are recorded there but what I would like to ask from you because that is also recorded in that paragraph is whether it is correct that at themeeting that you held at OR Tambo together with the Minister of Trans – former Minister of Transport and Mr Maseko from ACSA whether in – I beg your pardon Mr Tony Gupta whether it was mentioned that the request that they were making at that meeting would – they would – the aircraft or whoever would have Ministers on board and four or five Ministers on board.    Yes. And then having received then the call from the High Commissioner did you link the two incidents that there was a talk by Mr Atul Gupta of five Ministers and now you have a call somebody is saying look our request is taking long for it to be processed?    Yes.  So between the time of the landing which should have been on the 30 April and this meeting of February 13 you yourself…    Oh yes and the …this is what happens.    Thank you Mr Chairman this is what happens when I eat a lot during the lunch break.  Sorry.  Thank you. During – you got the call from the High Commissioner would you say when you got that call from the High Commissioner was it at the beginning of April or just a few days before the landing in April?    Prior to the landing?    So…    Yes, yes.  Alright.  So then when you then contacted Major Ntshisi at that time when you contacted Major Ntshisi did you at any stage give him certain details about who is it that was going to be landing in the request that you were asking them toprocess?    Yes.    Yes.  When you contacted Mr Matjila what did you talk to him about?    No but we talking about Mr Matjila now from your department.    Is it possible that in your conversation with Mr Ntshisi you might have mentioned that there would be Ministers on board?    Yes.      Okay.  Now.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman.    Thank you Mr Chairman.    And in fact it would make sense to mention that to Major Ntshisi because you want the relations between South Africa and India as you have indicated not to be really spoilt by these delays.  So it would make sense to say, look I am told that there is going to be Ministers coming please look into this process.    Yes.  And other than Mr Matjila from DIRCO and Major Ntshisi from defence did you mention – did you speak to any other person from defence?    And who is that person?   Yes.  At what point did you speak to her?    Yes but about this incident.  About the complaints that you had received from the High Commissioner did you speak to Colonel Anderson about it?   Yes.  Was this before you spoke to Major Ntshisi or was it after you had spoken to Major Ntshisi?    And you would have also mentioned to her that look I am frustrated, Ambassador says there will be many stars but I do not know where the process is, would you have mentioned the Ministers to her?    You would have?    And what is it that you wanted her to do about – about that?    Yes.  But what I would like to know Ambassador is what is it that you wanted her to do?  We know what you wanted Major Ntshisi to do?   You said you wanted them to – to work on.    Yes.    Yes.   Anderson.    Yes.    Yes. Yes.    Whether I wanted something from her.    Yes.    Alright.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Slightly.    Thank you.  How long did it take for this issue to be resolved?  Did it take weeks, how long did it take?    Yes.      Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Maybe I should just direct…   Yes.    He does confirm certain paragraphs in the report and I will take the witness through those.    Thank you Chair.  Could we – just a minute please.    The areas of concern.    Yes thank you.    Thank you Chair.    I am sorry Chair I am just – the technicians are – they are saying that their system is a bit down.  Whether you – yes if you could allow them just five minutes so that they can deal with that issue.    Yes that is what …    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    We will proceed.    Thank you.    Thank you.  So what you attacking about the report is the process but you have not identified factual inaccuracies in the report?    Could you please identify them?    Yes.  What – what other inaccuracies are there?    Yes.    Thank you.  I - I will just refer you to what I believe which is – which is something that Major Ntshisi has confirmed because as you – I think you would appreciate the fact that the conversations that you had with Colonel Anderson and with Major Ntshisi are critical conversations.  So I would like you to comment on those. So if you do not mind could you please look – have a look atEXHIBIT FF1 which is the report – where the report is contained and then you can just tell the Chairperson where you believe that …    FF1 if you could please turn to page 11.    And it will under or next to paragraph 2.1.12. “On 2 April 2013 the Chief of State Protocol contacted the Political Advisor to the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans to inquire as to the progress with the request.  The Ambassador stated that he was under pressure from number one on the matter.  The Political Advisor stated that he was not in a position to respond at that point in time.” Is that statement correct?   Okay.  All of it or certain parts?    Yes.  So which part of that paragraph that I have read out is not accurate?    Yes.  Only that part?    Thank you.    Oh, sorry.    Yes, thank you and then paragraph 2.1.15. “On 9 April 2013 the Chief of State Protocol telephoned Sergeant Major Ntshisi at the Air Force Command Post to inquire as to the progress with the clearance request from the Indian High Commission.  Ntshisi informed the Ambassador that the base could only receive flights transportingHeads of State and their Deputies.” Is that paragraph so far correct or the contexts of that paragraph so far correct?    Yes.    Yes; but would you have – would – Major Ntshisi would have told you what – what would they normallyallow?    Yes.  So what do you say about that paragraph?  You are not sure.    Yes, thank you.  Let us move.        Yes.    Thank you Chair.  May we then proceed Ambassador?    Yes.  He added that …   I am sorry.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  He added that   Yes.  So everything that I have read is – is inaccurate?    Yes, thank you and then   Sorry.    Thank you.    (Intervenes).    Yes.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair; and then   Yes. “…and the Ambassador responded that challenge was that this could not be put in writing.”    Yes.  So   Yes but – but this showing around did it relate to the landing of – of Jet Airways?    Okay.  You do not remember it or it never occurred?    Yes.  So this would have been for thearrival of the Jet Airways Aircraft?    For the Gupta wedding?    Yes.  So this then according to you and your recollection Ambassador this would have happened prior …    Before the landing?    Yes and it would have also happened prior to 9 April because that is the date when you spoke to Major Ntshisi?    You do not …    Yes.  So what else – what else were – did you – did you become part of in preparation for the landing other than for the events management company for the Gupta wedding that went to – to have a look at Waterkloof?  What other activities did you – did you participate in prior to the landing?    Yes.  So can we agree then that at this point when you went together with Colonel Anderson to look at Waterkloof this aircraft had not received clearance at that point?    Yes but then let us just retract.  Rather letus – let us retrace our steps.  If on 9 April that is the day when you were speaking to Major Ntshisi.    That is the day when the clearance had not happened but already you were telling him that Colonel Anderson is aware of this because she had been to Waterkloof.  Well you have just told us now with the events company – management company.  Now at that point there were – there was no clearance when Colonel Anderson went.    Okay.    Alright.  We are going to come back to the dates and I am going to show you Ambassador that at the time when you were telling Major Ntshisi that Colonel Anderson had been there Major Ntshisi had not issued a clearance certificate because if it – if it did not happen – if it happened before the 9 t h then clearly whenColonel Anderson went to do – with the events company to go there - there was no clearance that had been issued for this aircraft but we will get back to that.  I do not want us to …    I want us to deal with what we are dealing with now …    But I will show you that.  Thank you.  Now    You do not recall?    Yes.  What is it that you do not recall?  That you would have told him that it was a Gupta wedding or the fact that he must contact Colonel Anderson because she had been there.    Yes, thank you.“He instructed Ntshisi to call him back.” Do you recall asking Ntshisi to call you back?    Yes; and then on 13 May 2013   Thank you.  Regarding specific …   I am sorry.    I beg your pardon Chair.  It is the last paragraph.    No.  At page 11.  I beg your pardon.    You see on page 11.   We dealt with   So …    Chair …    Is Chair at page 11?    Yes.    Yes Chair.

AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  My name is Jerry Matthews Matjila.   No objection.    I truly affirm.    Yes.    Yes Ma’am.    Yes Ma’am.    It is true Ma’am but I wanted to make some if possible some corrections if you….    Chair I would like to refer to FF4 – is it 4?    No JMM4.    Exhibit     1.    Page 4.    Thanks Chair.    On 4.    Is the name of – of the spokesperson of DIRCO.   It is Mr Clayson Monyela now there it is Mr Clayso Monyelato.    So now I want to that to Mr Clayson Monyela that is the first correction.    I want to make Chair.    And after Monyela Iwanted to strike on that 2 – so it is Monyela and we strike the first 2.    Clayson Monyela [indistinct] so that is the second correction.  Chair the third correction…    If it is the first then when you say Clayson Monyela then if you strike that 2.    No that is the one.  First it is Clayson.   It is n after so – Clayson.    And then Monyela.    That is right.    Right Chair.    No it is the first and the second in that way.    Ja.  I wanted to be precise.    The name of the Minister.    Is not is not properly spelt.  Her name is Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane.  So there it is Minister Nkoana-Mashabane Maite.   So it is to correct that Chair if the Chair allows me?    It is a typo error.    Is…    Maybe Chair it was the commission.   I do not want to be direct but maybe it is the commission typist.    But Chair please it is not his problem I should have edited that myself.    So that is not to do with him    So please save him.    And the third correction is the – the name of DDG Mahoai then DDGHR.  Chair I want to record that he was not present in the said meeting with the Minister.     So if we can strike it off.    It was Ambassador Koloane [indistinct] of Protocol and Mr Clayson Monyela.  So DDG Mahoai was not there and I apologise Chiar.  So we can strike it off.    And then Chair on 2.   Page 2.    B3 roman 3 [iii] .    It says   It is supposed to be “the nature of the state visits” then semi colon.    Then it says state visit.    Official visit and thenon 4     Can be a summit or private.  So this 4 can [indistinct] visits.    We will improve with that Chair as time goes on.  So that is the…    Official visit during the summit when the President come or a private visit.  So it is.   So it is four type of visit.    Because they got the various what you call.  So that is the correction.    And I wanted the Chair to understand it that way.    And then the second one Chair is they know the buzz there.    You know from roman iv to roman vi.   On that B.      B yes roman figures.    iv, v vi, vii.    And then roman figure I, ii, iii, iv.  So Chair you may have two note verbales’    The first one just asking for the visit.    Then when the number 1 or the [indistinct] yes when the details come because of security.    If a note verbale which now ask about the lending.    That ask about – because you want to protect the security of the guests.    And normally at that point security services take over.    Because it is less – because of the current environment in which we are.    You know there are so many threats to heads of states.    And they have different classification.    So sometime at thatdetailed level the security services take him over.    So there may be interaction between security services.    Among themselves and one person in DIRCO.    So because it is the details now.    Or the movement.    Of the chief guests.  I just wanted to    Maybe talking about two note verbale.  The first …    To triggers.    And then the secondone the details now.    When you ask for a flight path…    Then the…    And all those.    Chair thanks those were the few changes that…    I wanted to indulge you with Chair.    Thanks.    Thanks Chair.    Right.    Chair I had two lives.  There was a life before 1994 where I served the current ruling party as their envoy.    In foreign countries.    In Sweden where we run the office to mobilise international support, solidarity and the resources to support the struggles in South Africa.  And then the then President of the ANC Oliver Thambo then moved me from Sweden to Japan, Tokyo to open up the first ANC office in North Pacific dealing with Japan, South Korea, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei all those countries in the North Pacific again for the same reasons.    To mobilise support for the ANC.  Mobilise material support to conduct the struggles, to ask thecountries to implement sanctions.  Internally speaking to make people conscious about the brutalities of apartheid.  And then Chair in that context I received President Mandela twice in Japan. In 1990 when he was released and 1991.  And then after the ruling party was unbanned I used to come home temporarily.  We were given a week to come home and back into exile or three weeks to go back into exile.  That torturous period of your life where you taste home, then you go back into exile.  But finally Chair I came back.    After voting in Tokyo.  I voted in Tokyo.    1994.    Then I came home withmy family and then work came into DIRCO 1 August 1994.  We were 17 of us who were former ANC envoys abroad called Chief Representative who were then moved to the then Department of Foreign Affairs as Deputy Directors.  So that is how I was inducted and that was my second life now.  This time around serving a democratic South Africa.  And then Chair I was then posted to India as the first South African High Commissioner to India to open up the embassy there.    In India until 1999.  Came home, get promoted to a Chief Director and served in the officeof the Director General at that time.  And in 2001 I was then posted to Belgium to European Union as and Envoy there but also covering the Grand Duke of Luxemburg.  So it was both bilateral Belgium/South Africa, Luxemburg/South Africa and multilateral with the European Union and part of that was because at that time the European Union was the biggest trading partner of South Africa, close 60% of our trade was European Union.  And there were a number of agreement to be negotiated with the European Union for market access of our products.  Like wines and spirits we were a mid-size marketing of wines and spirits to the European Union and wanted to take up the – more quotas and part of that was because of job creations in the wine industry.  But also because of the foreign exchange so we managed to get additional quotas from 21 to 52 – 51 million litres of wine.  And then the auto selling of the cars.  Because Chair you recall the new democracy the local content of our cars there was about 5/6% but we are revving uplocal content.  We are producing more parts in South Africa.  And once they reached 66%, 67% local content the – that threshold the – in terms of the – the ruse of origin you can say it is my car.  So that at the time we reached that threshold of 66% of content of the cars we could then send them duty free to the European Union.  So we had to have that agreement.  And the third one was on the Science and Technology Agreement because we are a new democracy obsolete technologies you have to again mobilise new technologies for the input into manufacturing in particular.  Telecommunication and other systems.  Health education.  So we then had an agreement with the EuropeanUnion on Science and Research.  So for every scientist they sent here we sent scientist to European Union in that case we create the capacity and you know for manufacturing.  But the sum total of all this Chair was that you see a growth in terms of the quant ant of trade from mineral resources, from raw material you see the quant ant increases.  So that was part of responsibility.  But also because we used to get a grant, an envelope, European Development Fund in the region of about 130 million Euros free grants to help South Africa and that fund was very necessary for us because you recall Chair we are still developing the capacity of local government, provincial government, even national government departments in terms of policy system procedures.  It was a period where we – this new democracy was building systems to make sure that we can function efficiently.  At the same time establishing institutions like Human Rights and others for accountability purposes to make sure that there is a – there is a system of accountability.  So theexecutive can be held accountable.  So this was very nice and very fragile, very new systems so we needed grants that does not burden the fiscus in that area of work but also to expose bureaucrats, officials to those countries to go and lend, to go and study how other countries have dealt with these issues.  The issue here Chair was to make sure that as this new democracy take roots in the Parliament, in the executive, in bureaucracy at all level of governments there is a capacity being created because it does take time.  More so it was in the context of transformation.Racial issues, perceptions issues, movement of people from rural to urban, new departments, newofficials, new acquaintances, governance.  So it was a period where there was so much influx so we needed that type of envelope from European Union which could be used to capacitate.    For example we – then we got funds in 2003 for Limpopo to train local government officials to know what it is to be a local government.  To be MEC, to be a Mayor, to be MLA, how to respond to the people’s things, how you study legislations etcetera, etcetera.  So that was that period.  So part of our responsibility Chair was to make sure that that money continues to flow.  Chair I was giving the extension by President Mbeki.  President Mandela was – when he was India now President Mbeki is in charge so he sent me to Brussels.  So he gave me one year extension because at that time I was assisting with the Congolese issue.  You recall there was a Sun City Process.   Where South Africa was helping the Congolese.    To find peace and now most of them were based in Brussels in Belgium so I have to make sure that they are assisted to go to Sun City so that the – as exclusive as possible, transparent so that at the end of the day Congolese at home – abroad can own up to the process and that is what [indistinct] is.  So for this reason President Mbeki gave me an extension.  So I came backin 2006.      When I came back 2006 Chair I was then given various responsibilities in government.      You know I was a DDG Asia / Middle East.    And part of that was because perhaps President Mbeki thought I know Asia since I went there in 1988.    And I dealt with those countries in the area.  But part of this was because – part of my career was to develop the strategy for government, the policy for government. So then we had to develop the strategy for India, strategy for China, strategy for the Gulf, strategy for Japan.  How do we access those markets?  And we have a role to play because we saw a huge potential in Asia / Middle East.  At that time Chair the trade between South Africa and Asia / Middle East was not that pronounced but we thought we can do better.  And so over a period of time like now you see the biggest market of South Africa is no longer Europe anymore it is Asia / Middle East.  Almost  R880 billion close to a trillion with the EU is almost half of that so you could see that change.    Or the [indistinct] South African Foreign Policy from Europe, Asia / Middle East, Latin American and Africa have borne fruits for the economy.  So that was part of our responsibility to do but at the same time we had to deal with BRICS formation.  I developed the BRICS strategy.  What the government should do in the BRICS.  What is IMPSA focal point India, Brazil and then we have the multilateral engagement.  So you have South Africa, Africa and China it is called FOCAC I was the focal point of that.  How do we as South Africa and Africa deal with China?  Then you have Japan, Africa, it is called TICAD I was the focal point for TICAD.  India, Africa I was focal point for India, Africa.  So we have these polo lateral arrangements where Africa was trying to access this huge merging market going forward.    At the same side Chair Imust also make the focal point for BRICS because there were huge emerging economies that we were accounting for accessible percentage of the global market.  So those were part of my peace jobs after [indistinct].    In my second life Chair.    No before that Chair.    Then I was sent by President Zuma now.  Now government have changed to Switzerland as the second Ambassador of the United Nations in Geneva.  UN have two major centres it is the UN in Geneva and the UN in New York.  Now Geneva have a lot of UN agencies like World Health Organisation, World Intellectual Property Organisation, WTO, Human Rights Council, IPO, it is a whole huge of what I call heavy lifters of the UN are in Geneva.  So I was sent there Chair to be South African Permanent Representative at United Nations in Geneva.  Human Rights, ILO and all those entities.  And in that capacity I was then elected to chair the ministerial board of ILO to make the ILO to help the ILO to deal withthe issues especially of domestic workers farm workers.   So that was part of my responsibility.  Then Chair two years into – eighteen months into the process I applied for a job offer to the DG of DIRCO.  When that it come then it means I have to leave Geneva and come back here to be the DG.    So I served five years as a DG>    2011.    To 31 May 2016.    Five year contract.    At the end then I was sent to where I am today.    The New York United Nations.      That is my short life in the new life.    Taken to?    I am not sure Chair.    Chair Ambassadors called Plenipotentiary and Extraordinaire.  In other words they are the representatives of the heads of state.  Where a head of state through a letter of credentials, letter of credence says to a counterpart in the receiving state let me say in Belgium.  I am sending Jerry Matjila as my trusted person so please accredit him to do the job there.  If you have any sensitive issue you want to communicate to me that is my person.    So you are the ears, the eyes and the spokesperson all the heads of state.  And you represent all government departments.    That is why – that is why you fly the flag in your car.  The car has your flag of the country.  And that is why in your house you call it the residence there is a flag of the republic there.    In the office.   That is why in your house you have the heads of state photo there.    The Ministers photo there.    In your office you have them there.    Because you are regarded as the representative of the heads of state.    Precisely.   Excellency Bruce Koloane ja.    That is why you are His Excellency.  Very few people have this title His Excellency.    Precisely.    Integrity, knowledge, expertise.    And a trust of the head of state.    Because that is why when you come there Chair that letter from your President you take it to the head of state.  You meet the head of state.    And you hand it over tothe head of state.    Who opens it, read it and then you sit down with the head of state whether it is a King, the Majesty, the President, you sit down and then you discuss a relationship.    Will ask you thank you very much please convey my regards to President Ramaphosa.     I am glad that they sent you here.  What is your task? Then you start to explain your task.    And they say well we are very happy for this [indistinct] relationship we wish you well.  And then from time to time you meet that head of state of course.    If there are sensitive issues.    Because you already presented you going to meet that head of state.    FF12?    Ah this one.    Yes.    Yes.    Right.    She receives it, looks through it when it comes into The Netherlands and then have a chat over a cup of coffee arranged by Protocol.  It is just a small ceremony because some – some people make very elaborate ceremonies.  Going there by house card, queen’s card.  I do not know how I must go there but something.    It is a very elaborate thing.  You know you going to the queen’s …   Houses.    You know.  Those who go the majesty’s but some of us we are not going there.  It is just a small thing but the majesty’s one.  Sometimes they make it very elaborate, very pomp and then you have that discussion with the majesty in which the majesty welcomes you and ask you to – to thank Heads of State but the same time it might be a letter recalling the one who was there before you.  So that it is not you and somebody else.  So …    So this is the letter Chair …  That the Head of Mission designate …    Will call.  At that point he is no longer designate …    After the Majesty says yes the designate goes then he becomes the Ambassador extraordinary (indistinct).    Yes ma’am.    Yes.  Yes it is oath form.    Well Chair I was asked is it oath or …    Affirmation.    I took oath.    Then she says if I am not a practicing Christian or religious then affirmation.    I thought it is the same thing.    But Chair if it is not the same thing I will stay with the oath.   I do not have a problem with the oath.    I just thought maybe I have a leeway to move either way but (intervenes).    I have to be very consistent.  Chairperson once DIRCO through the bilateral desk receives a note verbale from the resident mission foreign in the country.  The bilateral desk notifies the protocol of the receipt of that note and then in the note we expect them to indicate the purpose of the request, the timing of the request and the places …    Of the visit yes.    And …    That is right.    And the nature - is it a State Official, is it working or it is private.  So once that part has been agreed upon we have to find if the Head of State – our Head of State is okay with the request especially the timing because there are (indistinct) issues and once we are certain that indeed the President is okay with this type of visit and is affirmed then the preparations start and part of that preparations may entail convening interdepartmental meetings to say here is the request from country A for this kind of visit and our President has consented to this visit.So we then develop content.  What should be achieved?  Were there any agreements to be signed?  What should be the outcome of the visit and then the protocol looks into the facilitation of the visit.  The place of the visit?  Where is going to be the arrival of the visit?  What movements will it entail?  The venues, the hotel, the transportation. This is the protocol to arrange transportation.  How many people will be coming there?  So we – we then – we then prepare a submission to the Minister and to the President to say we think the best way of making sure that this is a success we need to address thefollowing issues.  Economic diplomacy, let us talk about market access.  We talk about this - technology, security, issues of Africa. So we – we go through all these issues to make sure that the visit is – because it is – it is costly.  It is costly.  So you make sure that it is money well spent but also because you are building a relationship.  You want to make sure that the ceremonial issues by protocol is up to mark.  To leave a lasting impression to our guest.  That you are ready to strengthen relations – to expand the relationship. So protocol we go into those ceremonial issues like – is it going to be a dinner, lunch, it is going to be a breakfast.  Will be a visit maybe to a museum or to the Cradle of Mankind or a project.  Something that is long lasting for the Heads of State and then the second part protocol we then also deal with the maybe in a separate note verbale when we know the arrival, the number of guests in the plane and the date of arrival.Then the protocols and the defence and (indistinct) services then is arrival.  Are you going to have a guard of honour at the airport or not.  For instance if it is a – a private visit you do not have to have that but then and where are you going to mount the – the ceremonial welcome by our military personnel.  Where will be the 21 guns to be fired, taking salute or not. So that is the protocol.  It is very – very (indistinct) and delegate issue because if something slips there the whole content is gone.  So – so ceremonial part is what markets the country.  That is first impression, lasting impression.  Of course content is also veryimportant but you cannot underestimate the impact of properly arranged ceremonials.  So that is where the protocol is to make sure that that part – so both protocol, content (indistinct). Now if for instance it is going to be at a military base or at the airport – some Heads of State arrive at ORT because of the size of the aircraft the 747.  Mostly they arrive there.  Some at Waterkloof Air Base etcetera.  There is as different process now which needs now the security and the protocol to work on and once all of us have gone through our internal processes. Example the – the defence will assess the availability of the facility.  The condition of the facility and work everything internally and then they say to DIRCO no we do not think our facility is available or it is available and then our role is to notify the requesting mission that yes let us go ahead or please not at this one but that is the – that is the defence to decide because they going to (indistinct) have airport.The defence will then agree.  So once the defence agrees they apply their mind going through the internal processes.  Then we trigger the preparation – the arrival ceremony all – all those kinds of things happen.  So that is what normally happens …    But if Chair choice of aircraft is like those big 747s.  We then say no land at ORT because our runway does not handle that.    OR Tambo yes. Then we trigger arrangements there.  It is a civilian airport.  So we make arrangements there.  If it is Cape Town, Cape Town Airport.  It is easier for us when it is Waterkloof because it is exclusive …    But not many land there …    With big aircraft.    So it is a decision that we normally take together.  If it is at OR Tambo then ACSA kicks in.  So we go with ACSA, Home Affairs and relevant …    Department.  What is going to happen there?  It differs.  If it is Cape Town it is going to be international part or domestic part.  It would be like for incident President Obama did go to Cape Town.  So we then make arrangements there.  If it is a summit it is the number of Heads of State.  The protocol say okay so many of them land at OR Tambo, so many Waterkloof, maybe so many at Lanseria. They will distribute them and create a mechanism to make sure that the – wherever they land they are all welcome to South Africa.    So that is the in short without compromising security.  There is a lot of security issues that Chair you may save me from not saying them.  Understanding that we still have to protect the Republic.    Chair I became aware of that through the news.    It was after the arrival.    After …    Ja.  When …    When the news and social media …    Were busy then …    We looked through this …    No, I was not in the picture Chair.    Normally I would get involved after an interdepartmental meeting.   I normally get involved if it is Heads of State …  And I have been advised that the note verbale clearly indicates it is a Head of State coming …    And then in that case I will then confirm with the Chief of State Protocol and the DDG of thatarea.    If it is from America it is the DDG of America.  Europe …    Because that DDG we then convene an interdepartmental meeting.    Prepare preparations …    And they will come to report to me.  Then I will make the Ministers aware …    But also we have the forum called the DG Forum …   Where I convene the DDGs and we collectively discuss (intervenes).    Of my department.    To say it is like this and then of course we have interdepartmental …    Processes … Where they send department – an official at the appropriate level where the issues can be discussed and sometimes the President might say no look I want a ministerial committee on this issue.  So a few Ministers will be put together to – to do (indistinct) but in normal circumstances the note verbale comes then I request the DDG responsible for that region to start the preparations, the content, to call the other colleagues, DTI, Home Affairs. Defence always – Intelligence Services are always part of the process because you need to – to make sure that the defence family is – is aware of what is happening and then they then make a submission.  We discuss them.  Then I advise the Minister to say Minister I think we are ready.  This is what we have to – to realise.  So that is in terms of the content.   Then in terms of the preparation ceremonial …    Hm.    The first note verbale ordinarily goes to the bilateral desk.  Let me say it is Japan.  The Japan desk will receive that note verbale …    And then make protocol aware.    Protocol Officer of – of DIRCO.    Being aware that there is this request.  Then we go for consultation first.  We go – it goes into a facilitation process.   To make sure that the Minister and the President are okay.  Before you go to any preparations …    You want to make sure that the principals …  Are on – are on agreement.   When the principals have agreed and then you trigger ceremonial issues and then you trigger the content development.  Now the second note verbal maybe about the landing rights.  It maybe containing the – the where to land the type of aircraft and requesting the flight route all those issues. Normally I saw that thing been dealt by the defence attaché of the mission.  Let me say again it is Japan.  The military attaché will then trigger that because now that is where security comes in.  That is the protection of the principal or of the guests.  The mode of the route come in.  You do not expose the route from Tokyo to Johannesburg. So very few people are then aware of the route of the flight, the time of the landing and the preparations and then they will deal with the – the defence – appropriate defence person and then maybe a person from protocol to be aware but this is – it is not a huge numberof people made aware.  It is a very risky thing because of security sensitivities. Also because there maybe the – you know – application of the number of arms brought by the protecting party of the – of the guest.  The type of arms, serial numbers.  So all those things are done very quietly and sensitively.  So that might trigger a different one from the global note verbale asking for a – for a visit.    Ja.   Yes.    I will – I will get almost from the DDG to say DG we are in receipt of this …    Because my rule is to (indistinct) the Minister …    And then (indistinct) the President …    And – so (indistinct) to start.  So I will be aware of it.    I will be kept …    I will be kept informed by the relevant ….    Yes Chair.    Normally at Ministers level there are Ministers – Ministers also differ.  Instead of defence of intelligence of DIRCO normally as a different category because of the nature of their work.    They get sort of …    I am not saying that.  I never said that.  I said that it is some consideration and some consideration given because of the nature of their work …    And that consideration means that certain things are done but maybe if the Minister of HomeAffairs comes Minister of Tourism comes it is a different consideration but still if a Minister comes we still get a note verbale.  That note verbale may we request – let me say the Minister arrives at ORT. Then protocol will then receive the Minister concerned from the flight through the protocol lounge of DIRCO.  So – so you still need a note verbale.    For – for that particular Minister.    As low as an Executive you need a note verbale.    Whatever position or station in …    In the Executive you still …    You still need a note verbale.    Chair it differs.    Let me say you receive Hilary Clinton.  She travels with a special aircraft.    She is not coming commercial.    So – and again because of profiling because all guests are profiled by the state security.  They are graded.    High risk, low risk, medium risk …    Or it is Jerry okay let him come in.  It differs.    Well but Excellency really with not much risk because South Africans like that person …    There is no risk.    But certain people have risk.  You have seen if American Heads of State arrive you could see the level of preparation.  It is among the top security.  You can see even the amount of American Intelligence amount of America Special Forces arriving.  The – the type of cars, helicopters, armour.  You could see because it is high risk because they are targets.    They are targets but of course if the President of a neighbouring country comes you do not see that huge – there is a level.  So we are guided by the grading byIntelligence Services on the Head of State and accordingly we calibrate …  The security arrangements.    The rules …    The – what do we do?  The hotel …    It – it triggers so many other …    Things that happens.   If it is a Minister – Minister from Iran for example or Minister of these countries that have global attention you also trigger arrangements but maybe a Minister from Lesotho we may not trigger such a huge arrangement but there will be security …    Details …    Done but …   They all differ …    Depending where they come from …    And the protocol also …  Recalibrates its arrangements accordingly.    So but for us we are led by Intelligence Services.    What is the grading?   I think for Heads of State normally I think if I recall well there will be two.    Agreeing then.    And then the details …    Because whether it is private whether it is official, ceremonial, state the security of the Head of State of any country …    Is important.    You do not want to answer back something you are not ready for …    Because once they land they are your guest.  So their lives are in your hands.    So – and hence the protection …    Around them.    Well in some cases but as I said you will (coughing) Chair that - that different functions are triggered for preparations.   For instance in the first note verbale they may not ask for landing rights when they do not know whether we accept …    The request or not.    For instance if the President flies to the UN like he does every September the note verbale are triggered by defence – defence attaché with the American State Department and then we are notified that there is going to be - because of security.  So I suggest that maybe the second one is triggered by yes we agree.  Then work on the finer details which are not for public consumption.    Yes.  On – as I said I only heard this on post arrival and in Mr – Ms Sindane’s document you are referring to …   FF1?    FF1?    I think I am looking at 2.3.3.    That should be I think 2.2.3.    Let me come there.    Yes.    Page – page 19.    Page 19.    This is the first time now.    Because as a DG ofDIRCO I am also the Member of NICOC - National Intelligence Coordinating Committee - principal.    So that is where we meet to take aboard the State security and other issues.  So there was a meeting convened.  For the NICOC principals on 1 May.    To come and – this is a day after the incident.    To come and discuss this issue because it attracted so much attention …   And I am sure the principals were worried about it.  So in preparation for this visit and having learnt that the GCS Cluster – GCIS called communicators because there was so much media hype.  I then invited the then spokesperson or he is still the spokesperson of DIRCO – Clayson Monyela – around 1 o’ clock to come and brief me because I wanted to make sure what is happening and what has happened and then also I called His Excellency Ambassador Koloane to come and join us at NICOC because so much was said about him in the media space.So I, Ambassador Koloane and Didi (indistinct) went to the NICOC principal – it was extended.  Extended means other people who do not normally attend – are attending.  Normally I do not take anybody there but on this case it was extended especially from those department that had people like implicated like defence, police all those people were brought to NICOC. So we met them at the NICOC Headquarters until time    Nonstop.    And then part of the recommendation was to immediately brief our principals.  If you see on (I).  “Every General (indistinct) with their Ministers and advised against attending the wedding”. You recall we all – like myself I received an invitation.  We all received invitations.  Most of the DGs and it was going to be I think that.  So I had to call the Minister Nkoana-Mashabane to say Minister I want to see you to brief you about the outcome of the NICOC Meeting and 
MATJILA:Chair the first correction I wanted to make is on paragraph A.    Chair the third correction in on B.  To make that understanding that …  That is my representative. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  To investigate the whole thing.    Now Chair, we are coming to the details now and part of… (intervention).    No, I am following you.    Yes, where are we?    Chair, part of our role all department was to verify.    There was an issue of note verbal.Now as a NICOC now I took over. Then I called, I telephoned the High Commissioner, excellency the High Commissioner of India to establish his we are not sure who were the guests, who were the people in the aircraft.    We heard there were Ministers.    There were officials, they were the family.    Because as I said earlier on, if it was Ministers and issue of protocol preparation kicks in.    Yes. Then I called the High Commissioner, Mr Gupta who is very different from the Gupta. He isanother Gupta. Like you heard Matjila here who is another Matjila. So Chair, do not say that Matjila’s. It is a different Matjila. So it is a different Gupta. So indeed, His Excellency Gupta took my call. I think you may had been to Sun City already at that time. So I asked precisely, High Commissioner were there Ministers in the flight? He says no they were not Ministers. They were State Ministers. Now Chair, I was Ambassador… (indistinct) to India.    State Ministers is the equivalent of our.   MECs here.    Right now MECs have a different category.    In terms of visits.    So I then established and informed the NICOC that there was no union Minister, they call them union Minister.    National Ministers.    It was provincial or State Ministers.   So that was very, very important because then it goes to the content of the note verbal that was supposed to have been sent. So that is the first call I did to the but also.    I am not sure whether State Ministers needs a note verbal.   Ja, it is not a national.    Of course they might be very, very important but they still, we mind our security to.    To know their visit.    The second thing that I asked him was, were you asked by the Gupta family to facilitate. He says no I was never asked to facilitate. So two issues I wanted to get from him. Were these union Ministers, national Ministers or not. Secondly, you as the High Commissioner responsible, the eyes of the Prime Minister of India were you approached by the Gupta family to help, he says no I was not approached. So I conveyed that, Chair, to the NICOC principals tosatisfy are so that they were not. He was not approached and then he did not set the note verbal. No, there were no union Ministers. The second time, if I continue.    Then I said to him, can you come to my office. I think it was on the 3 r d of May. Can you please wherever you are, can you come to my office.    For in-depth discussion because this was telephonically. So he came to my office.    And at that time could appreciate the gravity of what has happened and I thought as a responsible person and as a fellow diplomat but also to maintain relations because you do not want this thing to sour everything. You want to continue to make sure that the warm relations between… (indistinct) and India continues so that this incident is not a cause of the rupture of something that has been built over a period of time especially the special relations between South Africa and India. Chair, it does not need to do with because I was High Commissioner to India. It is a historic relations that Mahadi Magandi was here. He is a founder of India. You know that historic issues. So he came to my office High Commissioner Gupta and again I made him aware of what have they followed, the procedures in the Indian High Commission they have followed especially around the note verbal. That we, it is unacceptable for us something like this hashappened under his watch. I did not ask whether he was aware or not but I am sure you may be aware. So the idea of the second meeting was for him to know the issue of note verbal of no note verbal has caused a major problem and is something South African diplomacy or government that we take very, very serious. Of course, he apologized. He knew there is a very, very serious oversight from his. Now oversight is a diplomatic term. They cannot say we failed. So Chair should de-quote what I say from time to time.    I have to stick to my, this is my…(indistinct). This is where I earn my living. So, no can he say I did a mistake. He said it was an oversight but I can de-quote to say it was a very, very serious; very serious.    Error from their part.    But also… (intervention).    He clarified that.    Chair, if this was a real wording party it ought to… (intervention).    It would have landed in a civilian airport.    In that case, is just a wording party.   No need for note verbal. They are coming here to have a nice time.    They are guest.    They go to where they go, enjoy and go back.    But once you go to a military base.    The civilian part goes away because now you are coming to a very exclusive area, a sensitive security area. So you need to provide documentation why you come to a highly secured area in this way. But we do have a lot of high-profile wordingswhich are not were South Africans because they… (indistinct). We have a lot of people who come and marry here, who come and below the radar. It is a lot of high-profile people coming here but they do not attract attention because is low-profile. So it could have… (intervention).    No, no, no.    They do not go to Waterkloof.    Waterkloof they can go if it is a requirement.    By special arrangements.    But it will be such and is very few and far apart.    Chair, maybe can I finish last one?    Yes, because in the same meeting with the High Commissioner because there were.    It was those; the second issue was the.    The whereabouts of the party. We agreed.    That the aircraft on the 2 n d must go to OTIA.   OR Tambo.   Everybody must leave from there.    But then we got the reconciliation from Home Affairs.    That some people are missing.    The State Ministers    So I said, how Commissioner, where are these people?    He said, oh Ambassador Matjila they charted a private aircraft to Cape Town.   After enjoying in Sun City    They charted an aircraft.    To Cape Town.    And I got even more worried.    Even if they are State Ministers ifsomething happens in Cape Town, we may be blamed as South Africa.    We are not notified that they would fly differently.    We thought they will come to charted aircraft and leave the charted aircraft.    At Jet Airways. So they went to India. Then I said but also somebody is missing in reconciliation.    Where is the somebody?    So we managed to identify the State Ministers in Cape Town.   And were informed and what happened which is true, they left through Emirates via Dubai back to India. So I just want to finish that part before break.    Chair, as we deep deeper and deeper.    It came to transpire that some of them privately also went to I think Free State to meet MECs there.    But we are not sure because this was a cloak in secrecy.    We are not privy to their progress.   We just understood that it seems some of them in Cape Town did meet some people in private capacities.    Some were to Free State to meet MECs there.    But we did not have any official documentation.    Is what we had to say, where is so-and-so, what happened to so-and-so; that actually some of them did meet.    Their counterparts.   In some provinces.    But as DIRCO.    As DG, I was not privy to that.    Chair, we are normally guided by the noted verbal.    On the purpose.    Of the visit, what the guest want to achieve and the facilitation that we do and then the program is developed.    I said it triggered two things… (indistinct] program and protocol ceremonial.    So we could have been aware even if it was private but then is a request that during the privacy.   There will be a dinner with so-and-so MEC to discuss this.    So and actually in some private visit this do happen Head of State meets some you, know companies, meets some but you are aware although it is private. But in this case as a DG I had no hint.    Of their actual purpose.   Who to meet and not to meet.    Precisely.    Yes, Chair.    Chair, the deviation was as I saidafter we have gone through, we trigger the issue of interdepartmental meetings. It is that forum that looks into the whole visit and make recommendation in terms of content to be achieved and State protocol services. So that is the one thing. But also the bilateral test needs to assess and says we agree that this visit takes place. So those were some of the deviation that some of us see in this process. That the bilateral test concerned was not engaged fully in the whole process and so you could not advise the executive or the top management of the department to go or not nor was any interdepartmental meeting convened. So those were some of the deviation that.    Identified.    Well, Chair following the procedures and the outcome of the investigation on this Waterkloof airbase then there was an issue of department concern establishing teams to go further. Chair you will recall that DIRCO belongs to the public service. So Public Service Act guides us and defence they belong to a different dispensation. So once they were going through this process and then we were requested that each department carries out. So in DIRCO part we have to see the provision of the public service SMS handbook,disciplinary procedures in the department. I am sure the Secret Service is did their own work, given their own prescript, their own guideline, their own… (indistinct) provision but we were, had to deal with our own colleagues within the Public Service Act.    In the DIRCO, the DDG of human resources as in his portfolio the disciplinary hearing is part of his responsibility. And so I wanted to sort of distance myself because I was engaged through. So I did not want to prejudice the college implicated. So I said to the DDG HR who is now happened to be the DG of DIRCO, please trigger in the disciplinary procedures. Make sure that you follow the prescripts, you follow everything and to make sure that the colleague implicated is given the chance to come and appear before the panel. In that context therefore, Chair, the DDG HR even this thing ashis own portfolio triggered in disciplinary hearing. Now in the DIRCO disciplinary hearing is about, is a corrective process identify, we correct and rehabilitate. It is meant to be humane orientated process especially if the person cannot have a final say. For instance, we do not own any military base. So we look at that that we are not the one who have a final say as DIRCO. So it is the defence. So we then trigger that process. Then the DDG HR followed his procedures, prescripts, came with a submission to me identify the relevant people to form the hearing in DIRCO. I think in this case it was Advocate NB Motlajwane from the Pretoria bar to lead this because we needed somebody fromthe legal fraternity.    In this case Ambassador Koloane was identified from the hearing as person to which I should make some disciplinary procedures. And therefore, I then invited the DDG HR to trigger to say, look this application from the hearing. Ambassador Koloane has been implicated. Can you carry this thing over within the prescripts of the Public Service Act and relevant prescripts, procedures of a disciplinary hearing?    3 you said.    Page?    Is it this file?    FF3.   Okay, I saw it ja.    Yes, in the morning of the 2 n d we did.    Of May. Recall in the evening when we briefed the Minister, she said Ambassador Koloane should be suspended. But you see bureaucrats are there to assist the executive to do things.    That is your say. Is to help to guide.    We can understand the sentiment of the Minister.    But our role is to make sure that things are done appropriately without victimizing anyone. That is why after we had a short sleep, we came back and drafted this.    That was early hours of the 2 n d.    But as an accounting officer I am directed by the certain procedures.    Legislation.    And then also I am advised by the DDG HR.    Who actually happened, came from public service commission.    On the legality of doing things.    So that the colleague is not unduly compromised or his human rights are undermined because he has aright; recall is an allegation. So with the advice of the DDG HR I drafted this letter… (indistinct) and then called in Ambassador Koloane. To say, by the way he was also in the meeting with the Minister but you know we said we will follow the procedures. So after I drafted it, I called Ambassador Koloane to my office and said, Ambassador, we are going to have these procedures followed. I think it triggered the same with other departments. Then he looked at the letter and I said, Ambassador you can take it home, consult your lawyers because he has a right that after certain date he can say, Ambassador I am going to question. I am going to question this or but after he read it, he applied his mind. Ambassador Koloane countersigned. But Chair, I understand at that time I think the media was just too much on him and I cannot understand is feeling and his family and everybody. I think there was an overexposure which I thought was not appropriate at that time because we had no facts. So Ambassador read it. I gave him a chance to dobecause I am by the law to give him to him, study it, have any legal advice, then sign. So indeed Ambassador Koloane after the discussions, he read it by himself in the premises. Then he signed. Then I said, Ambassador you will be contacted by the HR. So we are going to trigger this process.    Yes, Chair. Then the DDG HR took over and I stood back.    And allowed him to do his job per his profile and scope. So DDG HR, DDG Marhwayi then went to consult, identify the appropriate people to deal with the inquiry. As I say in this case, Advocate MB Matlejwane from Pretoria bar was identified and Chair. And then we identified Doctor HN Manzini from Independent Development Trust to represent the department and Ambassador Koloane chose to represent himself. No legal… (indistinct). So the charges I want to presume were read to Ambassador Koloane. He went to see them and on the 27 t h of May, Ambassador Koloane was served with notice of disciplinary hearing and he actually received thereof. And then there was three charges that were laid. And after the processes by both, I think they met on the 11 t h, hearing on the 11 t h and 22 July. Thenthe employee in this case Ambassador Koloane had pleaded guilty to the charges. And again, the parties were given an ample opportunity to present mitigating factors before the Chair could issue the sanctions. I think thereafter then on the 29 t h of July the sanctions were issued and pronounced. Suspension without pay for a period of two months as an alternative to dismissal in terms of Clause 2.74 of the, Chapter 7 of SMS handbook; that is the Chairperson and a final written warning which shall be placed in the employee’s personal file and shall remain valid for six months. So this is the submission that I finally at the end again through the DDG HR. To say I have finished my work DG and thisis the outcome. So my role was to implement the sanctions as such.    And they were duly implemented, Chair.    Yes, Chair because I presumed that they had all the facts at their disposal.    Both the Chair.    And the like their mind thoroughly.    And the HR who, DDG HR who advised me also knowing the system and SMS handbook anddisciplinary code. They all satisfy themselves that is appropriate sanction given what has transpired.    And Chair, mine was to implement that.    Chair, let me tell you why I implemented.    When we started in 1994, and we came few of us in government he went to DIRCO. I think Ambassador Koloane went to DTI. Very few skilful knowledgeable people who were not in government came in to try to drive the new government, new policies. Remember this was 99.9% white establishment in everything. So we needed a highly intelligent, highly knowledgeable, highly skilful and confident and qualified people to go into government to issue transformation. Ambassador Koloane was one of them. Ambassador Koloane was sent by the DTI I think in Tokyo. Then I met him there. Recall I spent six years in my previous years in Japan. It is a very difficult environment because they do not know South Africans. It is very far. They do not even understand English, let alone their culture. So for a diplomat to penetrate the market in Japan to attract investment between South Africa you need an extraordinary capable person to do that. Ambassador Koloane came from that stock. We were youngpeople. And I am saying this thing because I have been around in this for a long time and I understand the need, the knowledge of a person. And I am sure I was the only few South African at that time when I was with the Japanese. Actually Asia, I do not think there was any other South African who understands Asia like I did. So when I went to Japan because part of my work, Chair, was to try to transform DIRCO into new concept of strategic planning because we found that they were just working. So we were adopting some concepts from private sector to make sure that government functions efficiently. So we borrow from private sector that these functions like strategic planning, annualperformance basis. So that was my role, so I used to go all over to train diplomats on the spot about these new concepts. That is when I met some of my old friends in Japan in business bureaucracy. And I found that Ambassador Koloane then he was official in DTI not in DIRCO was equal to that task. So when we expanding our footprint in Asia especially in China and we were opening up a diplomatic post in Shanghai; is a heart of Chinese economy. I said to the then President, that we need somebody to understand business. Shanghai is business. So Ambassador Koloane was identified from DTI as the head… (indistinct) General in Shanghai, the one who can effect this because he had the knowledge of Asia. So and I must confess, he did an excellent job, excellent job. New mission but you could see the investments. You could see the procurement from South Africa. As a result, then Ambassador Koloane was asked to go to Beijing as a number two in Beijing for Greater China. But because of hisperformance, the President promoted him to be an Ambassador and sent him to Spain. Spain is part of the EU and as a barrier area, we are trying to reinforce our relationship. So then Ambassador Koloane was not promoted from (indistinct) General deputy to an Ambassador in Spain. Now some of us who see these young people growing over a period of time, of course you do stumble in life. You know all of us we make mistakes. So that is why when I got this report from the Commission and I understand the totality of the Ambassador Koloane is and I saw this, you know has a mishap. He could not you raise the total picture of his contribution to South African diplomacy and economy.That is what, Chair I implemented as a corrective way.     In some specific things, yes.    In some areas, yes.    Yes.    This one?    Yes,    Yes.    No, it is in the file that is.    FF11 Exhibit.    I need technical help from the Commission.    Is there some assistance from the Commission?    This one does not have FF11.    Page 9. I have seen it.    Indeed, Chair.    So, Chair, can I go back to New York? Is that I am released?    Thank you very much.    Thank you so much. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  So after then all these meetings which are interdepartmental, inter-Ministerial then you deal in paragraph C with your call to the High Commission of India.     I beg your pardon Chair.    Oh, I am sorry. I have gone back to the statement of Mr Matjila.    I beg your pardon.     Yes.    Page 4.    Yes, thank you. Sorry, that is FF111. Or is there something that you wanted to refer to in Ms Sindane’s report, Ambassador?    Oh, you are following me? Oh, thank you. Could you go back your statement then, page 4 of your statement?   Yes.    Yes. Then you mentioned and after having these meetings with your principals then you made a call to the High Commission of India. Could you tell Chairperson about that call?    Yes.    Thank you Mr Chair.    Yes, yes.    Thank you, Chair.    Thank you Mr Chairman. Thank you, Ambassador we were still at page 5. You had finished the part about these guests and the questions that you had put to the High Commission of India. And then you deal in that same paragraph where the meeting HC, you deal with deviations from normal DIRCO processes. Could you just highlight those?    Yes.    Thank you. And then having now regard that the information and having interviewed the High Commissioner of India, what was the recommendation at the end of it all as to what were thesteps that had to be taken and could you just highlight what those recommendations were going to be?    Yes. And then which officials did you then decide to implement those disciplinary charges against?    Yes, who was going to be disciplined? The person that was going to be disciplined.    Yes. And maybe just to refer you. There would be a bundle Exhibit FF3 which contains. It is in a very, in a smallish lever arch file FF3. It contains Ambassador Koloane’s disciplinary proceedings. There is a letter which bears your name in the FF3 at page 3. That will be under the divider marked one.    Yes, Mr Chairman?    We are on Exhibit FF3 Mr Chairman. I just want to… (intervention).    Maybe to put it behind you, Chair. It is just a letter of suspension. If the witness may just be allowed to identify.    Yes.   Yes.    Chair, I do not know what happened to it but the Chairperson had it last week and I had asked that all of your bundles be returned this morning. I just wanted the witness to just simply identify if you.    Thank you.    To find it.    Yes, I apologize for that. Could you please that letter… (intervention).   Yes, Mr Chairman. Thank you. Page 3, are you there, Ambassador?    3 on top it will be VBK003.    Look at the spine it will be FF3.    Chair, may I in the meantime just hand up a spare copy for your?    Just so that you can be able to follow.    Thank you.    Page 3 Mr Chairman.    That is correct.    Thank you. Did you suspend Ambassador Koloane?   Yes, thank you. Thank you. You may then put aside FF3 aside Ambassador. Then a disciplinary process then as you have already indicated was embarked upon which led to Ambassador Koloane pleading guilty to three of the charges without facts and evidence as we read the record of the proceedings.   And it was indeed implemented?    Yes, thank you. Thank you Mr Chairman. ThenAmbassador there is a report which appears at page 10 of the same, if you go back sorry to Exhibit FF11. There is a, no that is the one that has your affidavit. FF11.    That one.    Yes. This is a report which you forwarded to NICOC but you have already summarized everything that is your interactions with the High Commission of India and the meetings of the DG’s and the Ministers, all of that you have summarized that report.   Yes. I just want you to identify it and a letter which you wrote forwarding it, appears at page 9. Is that correct?    FF11.    Exhibit FF11 at page 9.    Thank you.    Thank you.     Page 9.   Have you seen it? Yes, that is the letter where you forwarded the report to NICOC.    Thank you. Thank you very much, Chair. That is the evidence.    Of the Ambassador. Thank you.    Thank you    Thank you, Chair. Chair.    Yes, please.    Thank you, Chair.    Thank you.    It was on Tuesday, Chair.    Thank you Chair. Chair.    Chair, there were only no documents that were withheld on the basis that they were not to be made available to the witness.    The only document that had not been declassified as of this morning was the FF12 which I referred the chairperson to which is the documents that were from the Presidency and also the DIRCO report which is attached to Ambassador Matjila’s evidence.    We got then the declassification from the DG of DIRCO insofar as that report is concerned. That is the one thing. The second thing, the recording was made available to me yesterday afternoon on Sunday and I did mention to the representatives of the, of Ambassador Koloane. That that recording is not made available to me but it is made available to the chairperson and I cannot simply just play it without the chairperson giving me authority to do that. And this is something that we discussed during the lunch, the long break. I have no difficulty with an adjournment but I am just concerned MisterChairman that we may come back tomorrow and then the witness testifies tomorrow and he goes back and says but still there is something that I did not get. I would prefer a situation where the witness because he has been brought here by the Commission the Commission’s expense. If the witness is of the view that he has not been afforded adequate opportunity for him to prepare thoroughly, I would prefer a situation where he is given the time that he wants. So that he does not come back later on and say look I was not afforded adequate opportunity. I am concerned, chair, that if you listen to the recordings tonight and then he comes back tomorrow morning andcertain questions are asked about the process as a whole again tomorrow morning, he may again say look if the cluster had asked me this I would have told them this. I am not comfortable with the approach that they are adopting because the Commission does not have time. We cannot keep on going back to matters simply because people are not comfortable. I think I would suggest, chair, that the best way they must indicate to the chair, how much time do they require to prepare fully and then once they have given that indication, chair, affords them that opportunity. So that when they come back he is ready to answer all the questions and probably he might even want to prepare a statement and deal with the JCPS cluster report in whole, yes.    Yes, chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair, I can easily establish that because Mister Derek De Beer who is the one who sent the first batch of documents that was requested were given because on Wednesday I think they had a problem with the link. They were given the link and I think they got some documents and they did not get some, if my memory serves me well. On Thursday then there was another request made with a long list of documents that they requested. Some of those were not in our possession. For instance, they wanted the certain Annexures to the report and they wanted the audios that we are talking about which we do not have and I was advised by the secretary of the Commission that on Friday a link was also given in respect of thosedocuments. But then at the time when that was established, there was already a letter that had been received from Ambassador’s lawyers saying that you still have not given us documents and we took and we went to Mr, to Derek, Mister De Beer and was said to him, please check whether the documents that you sent have been downloaded. And he confirmed that yes they had been received and there was one download and the letter had to be caused to be written to say, we confirm that that has been sent and there has been a download already. But without giving evidence from the bar I could establish all of that information and I would give it to the Chair exactly what was given.   That was on Thursday. I beg your pardon, chair. I am confusing it because we did not sit on Friday.    That was on Thursday.    Yes, yes but I could establish, yes.    Yes.    My understanding is that he would have sent everything that he had in his possession because he extracted most ofthe documents. I was, I remember that I was upset with him that he did not send them early on Thursday.    But because he had to extract those matters that are relevant and to Ambassador.    Then that took a while.    Yes, but my understanding I have not received anything like as of today to say you have not given us this particularfile.    Or something like that, yes.    Yes.    Yes, Chair.    Yes.    Yes, chair.    Thank you, chair. Chair might I also mention, chair that because we anticipated that we would play the audio at this hearing, we had invited Major Ntshisi to be present.    So that we do not have to replay it when he is recalled by the Commission.    Maybe with your leave, chair, would it bepossible to allow the play of that. The one recording is five minutes. That is the recording between Ambassador Koloane and Major Ntshisi.    And then the other one is 22 minutes which is various recordings of the conversations between Major Ntshisi and other officials.    As Chair pleases.    Thank you, chair.    Thank you, chair.   Yes, chair    No, no chair. It is available. I was waiting for Chair to give directions. I had indicated to my learned friends.    That the chair had not seen and had not heardany of these.    It has been declassified.    Declassified now, yes chair.    Yes.    Yes.    I am not made aware of any other document that.    Oh yes, the FF12. That is his letter of appointment as an Ambassador.    There is nothing contentious.    And the, I beg your pardon, chair. There is also the DIRCO report which is in Ambassador Matjila’s statement.    No, no chair. That is in FA12. That is just the one-page report that Ambassador Matjila identified as a report which heforwarded to Nico. That was the other document was declassified.    Yes, it has been declassified, yes chair.    We can make it available to him.    No.    No, chair. Not at all.    Yes, Chair.    Yes, yes chair. But we decided to give them all the bundles.    As far as understand.    Yes, yes.    But.    Very limited, yes.    That would be FF4, FF3, those matters that really.    Yes and FF1, yes.    Yes, thank you, Chair.    Thank you, chair.    Thank you. 
ADV MAHAN:  Thank you Chair, just for purposes of formality to place ourselves on record, I represent Ambassador Koloane, it is Advocate Mahan assisted by Advocate Chavalalah.  Ambassador Koloane was not formally subpoenaed but was requested to appear by the Commission’s Legal Team on the 27 t h of June, he has made arrangements to be here at their request.  We – the impression that we got from the letter was obviously that the Commission’s Legal Team intended to lead the evidence of Mr Koloane and I understand that that is what they intend to do.    We will if so advised we may re-examine.    As it please you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    Vusi Bruce Koloane.      Definitely not.      Yes I do.      Yes.      So help me God.      (duly sworn, states)      Yes I do Mr Chairperson.     Yes it is.     Yes I was.     Well I got the request for the landing for the – to know about the request for the landing was when I got a telephone call from the former High Commissioner of Indian, Ambassador Gupta, who called me and informed me that they had applied for a flight clearance for landing at Waterkloof and it has been over six days but they have not had a response whilst not a few months earlier they had heard the President of India visiting South Africa on a State visit and it took less than three days to get the flight clearance, so he wanted to say to me Ambassador can you check for me and follow up to find out what is keeping it for this long, that is the first time that I heard about it.     Okay.  Thank you Chair.  As the Chief of State Protocol and I am talking about the portfolio, not the individual, one of the things that is principally your responsibility is the maintenance of cordial relations with all the diplomatic missions which are resident in South Africa.  You become the first point of call to South Africa because any person coming to South Africa first interacts withProtocol before they can even meet with the political principals, and therefore in servicing all the diplomatic missions I get requests of – that are wide-ranging, ranging from saying Ambassador assist us, there are people who park right in front of our Embassies and therefore I have to engage the Diplomatic Police and say can you please go and assist the Embassy of Singapore is complaining, and they will go and check and they will see that maybe they may need to demarcate the area so that it is clearly mark that it is only diplomatic parking or it may also go to the extent of a request for flight clearances coming into the Republic of South Africa, and I think as was also indicated between Wednesday and Thursday when we heard the testimonies of the people that you have mentioned earlier there are three ways, I think it was stated under oath there as well that such requests may come, they may go directly to the Department of Defence or they may come through DIRCO, I have forgotten the third one that they mentioned.  In this ifthey come through DIRCO what normally happens is that I will say, I will anyway normally as the DG said earlier I would have known about it because if it is a State visit during the meeting that is convened by the DIRCO General called the DGF where all the DDG’s sit we share the programs of work in terms of what is going to be happening.  If it is somebody, a Head of State from Europe who is coming, for example they will say to me in the meeting the DDG in charge of Europe will then report to the DGF and say by the way we have a State visit coming from Spain and the Presidency has confirmed availability and so has the Minister, so we have just received the correspondence from themthrough the note verbale and we are now going to be sending it to the Chief of Protocol so that we can start triggering the actions.     So the initial note verbale does not come to me, it goes directly to the DDG dealing with the program area and then that is actually what happens and then all we do on our side without then interacting with that mission because once they receive the response from the responsible Deputy Director General dealing with the branch then they will start writing directly to me because the response will say to them the Minister has confirmed the availability of the President for the dates that have been requested, please start liaising with the Chief of Protocol on Logistical matters and they will put my contact details and accordingly the mission then will start liaising with us in sending the note verbale request and the flight clearance, and I would like to also clarify something, maybe todemystify one minor issue about the note verbale, the note verbale they will send to us will contain all the details as was earlier indicated by both the official from DTI, Matjila, not the one who was testifying today but the one on Thursday, as well as General Ntshisi from Defence.  The details of what size of a flight is that, how many people on board, who is head of the delegation etcetera, so we do not ourselves in Protocol draw up the note verbale, we forward that note verbale that we will have received and say please find attached a note verbale that has been sent etcetera, etcetera.     Ja, I was just clarifying because when I was sitting on Wednesday in the responses I heard a response saying there will be a note verbale coming from DIRCO so I was trying to clarify it that yes there will be a note verbale forwarded by DIRCO but not emanating from DIRCO as the writer of the note verbale.     No I said the DDG.     Who deals with theparticular branch, say in this instance it will be Asia and the Middle East so the DDG will then report in the meeting of the DGF that there is going to be this State visit.  Even if the DDG for whatever reason either is not able to attend the DGF but his office will at least convey to the office of the the Chief of State Protocol that please note that the DDG asked us to inform you that the President has agreed to the following days etcetera, etcetera.       I would – now yes I do.     Ja.     No in our discussion he didnot mention anything about the Head of State.     Correct.     I think during the meeting I had with NICOC they indicated that it was first the Head of State and then it was downgraded to a Minister and then further to an MEC equivalent, but that is information I had not been privy to because the request for such a flight clearance was sent directly to Defence and not to DIRCO, hence I would not have been privy to that information.     The first thing I did was tocall my personal assistant and I said to her my dear I have a challenge, I just got a call from the Head Commissioner of India complaining, because that is what he was doing, can you please follow up with our official who deals with these issues to find out what is the bottleneck.  At that time I was under the assumption that the Indian High Commission had submitted all the documents through DIRCO, hence my recommendation to my PA to contact the gentleman by the name of Mr Matjila, who works for DIRCO.     That is correct, it is Ms Morris.     Ja.     I did not say bottleneck I just said ...(intervention)      Maybe can I rephrase and state it as I am trying to express it?     I said to her I received a call from the Indian High Commissioner complaining that they have filedan application for flight clearance, which on average takes two to three days because a few months earlier they had had a visit, a State visit, but this  has taken over six days and hence he is edgy and wants to find out what is the cause of the delay with the processing of the application.     Correct, I did not have any idea, that was the first time that I heard about the visit.    Correct Mr Chairperson, he just said to me there are Ministers who are coming, I think he said six or eight and that they submitted an application, it is more than six days but they have not had a response.     I think that will depend on the what they call the threat assessment that would be conducted bythe security, because sometimes the ministers come for purely private visits.     But because of the threat levels it may be deemed to be too high then DIRCO may get involved in facilitating that they get protectors and things like that.      At the request stage Mr Chair yes because if they send the request, if for example the Indian High Commission sends a request and says – and they are applying for in the note verbale format complying with the procedure but stipulating in the note verbale that this is a private visit, people coming for a private visit but it is ministers can you request defence that you can land at Waterkloof.  We do not have the legal mandate as DIRCO to say sorry you cannot land, yes you can, that is the principal domain of Defence, so we as DIRCO would be like a post office that will take and pass it on to Defence and then if Defence says yes they say yes if they say no they no, and that is how – that is the nature and the limit of our involvement.     Correct Chair, I can actually provide an example to that effect which maybe the Chair may also want to verify, the mother of the King of the e-Swatini has landed on a few occasions at Waterkloof on a private medial visit, coming for private medical reasons, so all we do is just process as to what criteria they  use to allow her to land or not to land is fundamentally the responsibility of Defence, so ours is just to process and we are like a post office, a conduit, if one may use the word of interaction between diplomatic missions and Defence when it comes to requests of landingat Waterkloof and I mean as you – I am sure the Chair will agree that the mother of the King of the e-Swatini is neither a public office bearer, a politician or Head of State but I am saying she has landed, not once,  at Waterkloof, but again if you were to ask me Chair sitting here what criteria was utilised to decide that she can land I would not be able to answer it because like I said earlier that is the principal domain of the Department of Defence.     Correct, if the request is to land at Waterkloof Chairperson, because it may be that they are doing renovation of a runway, so I will not have that knowledge sitting in DIRCO so they are only people who can know whether all their systemsup to date, everything is good for them to accept the size of the aircraft etcetera, so whilst DIRCO and the Presidency may agree to receive a particular Head of State on a particular date but the decision to land in Waterkloof will not reside with the President or the Minister of DIRCO either it will depend on the availability of Waterkloof and the only people who will know about the availability, the size of the aircraft etcetera will be the people who are given that mandate constitutionally, which is the Department of Defence.     Yes Mr Chairperson as was earlier also indicated, if it is a State visit I will then also coordinate an inter-departmental meeting where it just ...(intervention)      It can be the head of State or the Deputy Head of State as well.     In  some – whether it is the President or the Prime Minister or the King depending on the form of governance in a particular country.  In that instance I personally will call a meeting, an inter-departmental meeting, which will include amongst others SAPS, particularly the presidential protection servicesteam, I will call people from maybe DTI if the (indistinct) was coming we will call them, but normally we will call people from Home Affairs, we will get people who are dealing from the Intelligence Sector as well who deals with the issues of accreditation to make sure that they will address issues related to accreditation, that they will also make sure that they put together a security strategy and plan identifying the routes because as you work on the program and we know which meetings are going to be taking place and where we need to decide on the best logical route to take given the traffic, we then get also people from the Metro Police to come in because we will also request someescorts so yes we get extremely involved because it is the – it is a Head of State meeting that is going to be happening but only in as far as dealing with and organising the logistics and not the substantive component of the visit by the Head of State.     Yes she called me and said the gentleman from DTI does not seem to know anything because they have not sent anything to him, he has not received anything, and I called the Ambassador, the Head Commissioner of India I said there does not seem to be anything and he said oh but we we sent it directly to Defence, and again I assumed like I said earlier that a few months earlier they had had a State visit that they had submitted alldocumentation as per the previous exercise, and I then asked, because I did not have the number, I did not even know the name of the person, I then asked to be given the number and the name so that I could call, like I do also call other government departments when there are issues to make enquiries.   I called is it Ntshisi?     Yes.     I had not, I was just acting purely under the assumption that there has been total compliance with the administrative requirements in terms of documentation that must be submitted etcetera, because a few months earlier they had had a visit of their Head of State and they had complied fully to the extent that they had been granted the flight clearance to land at Waterkloof.     I the said to him please sir can you held because this High Commissioner is on my case, can you please process this application.     I was out of my office,although I cannot, as you will imagine it was more than six years ago, I cannot recall exactly where I was but I was not in the office so I was only dealing with this by phone, I had not seen any documentation whatsoever.       Okay, as I indicated earlier if an Embassy of Singapore complains that there are people who are parking right in front of their embassy where they are supposed to be parking because according to the Vienna Convention provisions we need to give them at least two bays where they can park their officials cars.  If they complain that there are people parking all the time because they are not demarcated I call the Diplomatic Police, although I do not have power for decision making but I call them and I say please can you attend to this problem because it is going to create unnecessary diplomatic tensions since my responsibility is to ensure that we have cordial relations and I am the conduit, and in fact when they arrive and I receive them before they get their credentials I explain that if you have any problem whatsoever, irrespective of which department protocol dictates that you come through me and I will facilitate that you have somebody attending to the matter.  Equally withcalling Defence I understand fully that I do not have authority over officials working for Defence but to request that the process should not be an issue because all I am saying is process, I am not saying issue or not, processing is can you address or attend to this business because it is creating unnecessary problems.     I think when ...(intervention)      No I think he already was aware of the application.     That is the impression that I get.     Although I cannot accuratelyrecount the words verbatim but I think he said something to the effect that I think there was note verbale attached or something like that for him to be able to enquire into all the necessary processing that is necessary.     Although I do not recall like I said every single thing we discussed but all I remember saying, because it was standard approach I used with everybody, irrespective of government department, I would say to them if there is an issue withthe application revert back to the embassy, the High Commission, so they know what the issue is because keep quiet for six days is just not you know healthy for our standing in terms of these countries must look at us.     I am not sure I understand what you mean.    Correct.  According to my recollection Chair as I indicated earlier mine was to say to him please can you make sure you process – expedite processing the Flight Clearance Application you have received from the Indian High Commission.  And again I want to stress the word processing theapplication.  And he indicated that there were documents missing and I asked which ones. He said I think one of them is a note verbale.  And I said please just check everything that is not in order and revert back to the embassy rather than sitting for 6 days and not going back to them so that you can – you can address the matter.  I think in essence that was actually what transpired and I had also – I think he called my PA or my PA called him thereafter I am not sure but my PA – and also I had asked my PA to convey the same thing that I actually want to see that this matter is processed.  And I take note of the email that my PA sent which I think was either a misunderstanding on her side or maybe a failure on my side to present it the way that she put it understand it properly because the email she sent subsequently said, Ambassador Koloane approves the issuing of the flight clearance.  Obviously I have got no authority Chairperson because I think if you think about this there are certain things that must be met to be able to issue a flightclearance.  One of them is that you must be able to have access to civil aviation information otherwise if anybody can just issue that bodies would be falling from the skies because planes will be crashing.  So I do not have access to that.  So I cannot issue it because when you issue you have to issue coordinates, etcetera that people must utilise when they take off or when they arrive for landing or even en route coming to South Africa.  I do not have access to that information.  I do not know if the Department of Defence would be having a ceremony or an event on that particular day.  I cannot know that so that is why I say it is either a misunderstanding on her side or maybe my failure toexplain it properly to her because [indistincty] discussion with her that all I want is to see this matter being processed which is my responsibility to make sure that it is processed.  As to whether the answer is yes we issue or no I will convey whatever answer comes because I cannot and also particularly given that one of the most notorious government departments for following protocols stringently is the Department of Defence.  So I would not.  I mean I had been doing this – this work of facilitating flight clearance through my team of course not directly myself for over two and half years and therefore I was alive to the realities in terms of procedures and processes that I had no legal mandate whatsoever to dictate to any government department.  Even when we had an inter-departmental meeting I could not dictate to the police although I was the Chair of the meeting I will say to them, you know you have a role to play to provide security, what is your plan?  Have you identified people?  Who are the names so wecan put them on the list?  But I did not ever give myself power that I never have because I knew my limitations in terms of the statutes and there is no way I will have actually given instruction that I order an official from another department to issue when also there are – there are processes horizontal processes in that department that must be followed.  So – and furthermore I would just like to state for the record as well Chair that I even further said to my PA, please make sure that the following people are also copies so that because I am in a meeting they can also follow up.  And the Director of State visits that was referred to earlier on Wednesday Ms – or Thursday Ms Grace Masonyou will note is copied on that email and somebody as well I think Ms Sally. There are two people copies who was senior managers.  So if I was of an agenda to do something dubious why will I say let us copy some senior managers within protocol who know exactly processes must be followed.  I think for me there was purely an issue of either I fail to get across to her properly or it was either an issue of pure misunderstanding.     No.  He did not and then I got a call from …    FF4?    ja.   Ja.    Yes cc Ms Mason.    Ms Mason was the Director of State Visit who would be the person in the event of a Minister coming who will then appoint protocol officers that will take care of that business.  Ms Sally Ramokgopa was my Deputy Chief of State Protocolat the time.    As I stated earlier she says   It says   He is writing to William.    William Matjila.    I repeat she says   Oh. “As per your discussion with Ambassador Koloane with regard to the request for flight clearance and landing at Waterkloof AFB for the Indian delegation. Kindly note that Ambassador Koloane telephonically approves the request.”    Again like I stated I only said that I want – I authorise that they follow up to make sure that this whole application is processed but that is why I am saying it eithermust have been a misunderstanding on her side because I am not the one who drafted the email but the orders or the instructions I could only give – give them a mandate is to say to them can you please follow up and check is happening or can you push that they process this thing so we can give the response irrespective of what the outcome of the person will be.    Hm.    Hm.    The answer is no Ma’am.  Like I said earlier DIRCO does not have any legal mandate whatsoever to determine whether any flight can land in Waterkloof or not.  All we do we are like a conduit, a facilitator for passing applications to defence and then defence will decide like I said.  Because they could be renovating the runway or anything like that so DIRCO cannot includingthe Minister of DIRCO cannot authorise that the let – the plane land in Waterkloof.  All we do we really facilitate that information be moved from the diplomatic mission to defence.    I do not remember but it must have been quite some time later.  I do not recall.  I think in fact I might have only learnt of it when the NICOC investigation had started if I remember well.    I did not Ma’am because it was post the landing phase and also as I was earlier indicated byAmbassador Matjila on that same following day the Minister had taken a decision that I be suspended from the department so that I will not interfere or tamper with potential witnesses.  So any direct engagement with her would have constituted if you like tampering with evidence. Albeit I was not happy with the manner in which I was suspended because in terms of the Public Service Prescripts I should have been given seven days to write back to tell her why I do not think I should be suspended and that was not done.  As you can see from the letter that Ambassador Matjila showed earlier of the 2 May it was exactly a day after and the letter was given just like that.  And I did indicate when Iaccepted the letter that only because I want to cooperate I will accept it but I believe that my rights have been violated again.    I assume we are talking about the request for the Ministerial plane for the alleged plane carrying Ministers that was requested to land at Waterkloof?    No nothing else.   I think it is from the reports it is common knowledge that I was invited to a meeting at OR Tambo International Airport wherein there was then former Minister Ben Dikobe Martins.    And there was the CEO of ACSA and myself and there was a Mr Gupta there and they wanted to request landing at OR Tambo International Airport.  So the Ministerwanted to get an advisory opinion from both the CEO of ACSA and myself because they had also requested the use of the diplomatic lounge at OR Tambo and the OR Tambo falls under the management under the Chief of Protocol in – I mean the – the protocol lounge also falls under the management of the Chief of State Protocol so I had to come on [indistinct] advisory.  And I did advise in that meeting that I do not think it is going to be viable, I do not think it will work because it is also used by our own protocol leadership, our executives as well as diplomatic missions so therefore I advised against that and so did the CEO of ACSA who also equally advised against arguing if I remember well although again it is some time back but I think his argument gravitated towards saying we have got regular clients that keep our business going we cannot chase them away only to accommodate you for a one or two day event.    And the Minister of Transport said I take your advice and he advised them accordingly that sorry on the basis of this advice you cannot land at Waterkloof and we then further went beyond that during that meeting then recommended that they may want to contemplate approaching private airports like Pilanesberg and what is the other one called?      Lanseria airport.  And with that the matter was dead.    Yes Sir.     The first meeting was the meeting that was called by the Minister Ben Dikobe Martins who was then Minister of Transport.      And then it was like the matter died for some time.    And I thought okay nobodyfollowed up so the matter then must have been sorted out either at Pilansberg or Lanseria as per the recommendation that we had made in the meeting.    Correct.  The call from the high commissioner of India Chair was made to me after they had already submitted the application to the Department of Defence.    And definitely long after themeeting that we had had at OR International Airport.    Yes Sir.    Correct.    Correct.    The CEO of ACSA.    And Mr Gupta was also there.   I think it was Tony Gupta.    Although – although I might be mistaken.    Chair I am not sure whetherfull information will be appropriate but he gave some information    Which I think was critical.    For the Minister to consume in order to be able to make a decision.    And one of the things he did say categorically is that there was going to be a wedding and that there were guests that he is expecting to come and some of those guests will be Ministers and there might even be one of the Vice Presidents coming and that is why he was requesting the use of the Protocol Lounge.    And that is how that partcame in.    He actually said there will be some Ministers Chair.    And there may be a Vice President.   Correct.    And also that they would have liked to get an area where they could have a cultural performance to welcome and receive these special – the special guests.    As they were presented.    I would not remember that level of detail because my principal focus was on the matters dealing with protocol but I do recall that the CEO of ACSA did say somethingand again I am not quoting him verbatim.    I want to stress that but he did say something along the lines of – look that is a very busy time, we dealing with a lot of processing of immigration etcetera so we cannot just take our regular clients that come to us and use this airport every day and put them aside for you who are coming for a one day event so it is going to be disruptive and that is why you cannot support it.    Ja.    Yes it was Ma’am.    It happened a few months apart and initially I did not put any link to the two but when the actual landing happened I was actually in a position to say probably this mustbe linked.    I do not fully recall but I know that in the records it is there but I think if I remember well it was probably a week or two prior to the landing.    Ja.    But I mean the dates of course are somewhere in one of these documents.    When I initially contacted my office to contact Mr Matjila then Mr Matjila spoke to Mr Ntshisi and then subsequently I spoke to Mr Ntshisi myself but I do not recall whether there was too much detail in terms of who was going to be in that because I would not have known the information, the details of who would be in the – in the plane because the request for the flight clearance went directly to defence.    Whereas if it came throughDIRCO then we will actually have – would be privy to the list of the people who will be on board.    As I indicated earlier I was worried about the fact that I had received a phone call from the High Commissioner of India who was complaining that they had applied for a flight clearance and normally whilst it takes two or three days it has taken longer can I assist.  Then I called to say can they please process that that was what I really wanted them to do to process that and whether they were going to say we are granting or not granting was not in my hands.    I also asked Mr Matjila tofrom my department to actually follow up and find out what is the bottle neck that is delaying the issuing or not issuing of the flight clearance.    I do not recall.    I do not recall at all.    But…   Of course the High Commissioner himself had indicated that they have sent an application for a Minister – Ministers will be coming on board that plane so although I do not recall there is a remote possibility that I might have mentioned it because the High Commissioner did mention it to me as I said earlier on in the morning session.    Yes Chair I do agree that I had been told by the High Commissioner that there will be Ministers but in the discussions that I had with for example everybody else I am not – I do not recall that I mentioned the name Ministers but I might have mentioned…   That is why I am saying remotely – that is why I am saying there is a possibility that I might have said that Chair.    High Commissioner.   Correct.    Yes Chair.    But Chair I am trying to delink this because in my view there are two delinked processes.  The one of the Gupta’s mentioning the Ministers.    Was a request made in February to land at OR Tambo airport to a meeting that I was invited to by the Minister as well as the CEO of ACSA.   And we decisively advised the Minister not to approve that they use that.    And for me that was the chapter closed because we had done that and the Minister in our presence also informed the Gupta’s that unfortunately we cannot help you.    So that is why the issue ofthe Ministers that they are talking about there was different to the notion.  The only mention of the Ministers who were requested to land at the Waterkloof Air Force Base was mentioned to me by the High Commissioner Gupta.    Yes Sir.    Well maybe if it pleases theChair for me to clarify like that.  Yes there is a possibility that I might have said so.    Correct Chair.    Please Chair bear with me because English is not my first language.  Sometimes I fail to express myself appropriately.   Thank you.  I will take that as a compliment Sir.    Yes Ma’am but also I think remember I think also in the morning session it was explained that the person who is the real custodian of strategic relations between SouthAfrica and their own countries is – will have been in this case the Indian High Commissioner.  So he is the one that we really service the most but like I said now with the advice from the Chair there is a possibility that I might have mentioned the word – the further – that there were Ministers who were going to be coming on board.    Yes I did.    The lady that Colonel Anderson who used to work at the Air Force Base.    I spoke to her when – I mean on a few occasions. First of all like I said I had been in the Portfolio for more than two and a half years so as the Chief of Protocol and we have had regular interactions and we were regularly in contact with each other because of work related issues.  Every time whenever we are going to receive is there anybody there she was on a point of call so there was regular interaction so I would not really – it is not like there will be quietness for months.  So there were regularly engagement for all other related matters that applied to both our portfolios.    I did mention it to her I think I cannot remember in what context but I did mention that I am frustrated because this Ambassador is busy nagging me and I am not sure where the process is.    I think it was around that time whether after or before I cannot have the appropriate recollection but it was around that period when I was – I had received the call and I was trying to ensure what is it that is the challenge so that they willprocess the issue.    Ja definitely I would have ja.    Hm.    Like I said I cannot remember the context in which the discussion happened whether I called her or she called me but like I said we were regularly in contact with each other so I would not really recall what was the – like who initiated the contact whether it was me who called when I mentionedthat or it was when I had called that I had mentioned that.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair but also I thinkthe point I am really trying to clarify is that I am aware that we spoke a lot with her around the period when I was also following up to establish what is the bottle neck regarding the issuing of the flight clearance.  So I would not know whether it was before I spoke to Colonel Ntshisi or it was after but it was around that period because it has been quite a long tim.    That has elapsed.    With her Chair I was expressing my frustration at the fact that I have been nagged by the High Commissioner of India regarding the non-issuance of the flight clearance and I was trying to establish if she knew at all what – you know where the process was in as far as the [indistinct] concerned.  Whether I asked her before or after I had spoken to Ntshisi I do not really recall.    Yes Sir.   I do not really remember Ma’am.  But I think we can establish that by checking the date on the flight clearance because it will guide us in terms of when it was issued.    Yes Sir.    Yes Sir I think I did Chair.   Chair as of course inattempting to respond to the question.    Since of course there has been a big leg of time between the incidents that happened in my recollection I doubt that I would have actually used that word at all.    I am not aware Chair.    I am only aware as indicated of the – the reference to the discussion between Colonel Anderson and Mr Ntshisi.    And Chair must also indicate that maybe when the Chair deems it appropriate I would also like toraise some serious issues I have about the report itself because the bulk of the questions will be based on the report of the JPCS.    And I think if it pleases the Chair I would just like to make some comments around that.    That is of course when they…    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair thank you very much for according me the opportunity.  Chair as we listened to the testimony of one of the witnesses by the name of Ms Sindane on Wednesday she under oath indicated that a cluster of ministers appointed for people to be – to form the JPCS that will then be tasked amongst other things with the – engagement the implicated people, getting reports from what has been done in the past etcetera.  And shefurther indicated that under when – under cross – under examination she indicated that she tried to arrange and meet with Ms Anderson unsuccessfully so.  I just want to go on record Chair that I as one of the people who was implicated was never ever invited by the committee of the four people so that they could sit with me and say to me there is some contradictory information we have received which conflicts with the statement that you had given.  Never.  So I was never subjected to that.  Secondly I would just like to indicate Chair that one of the people in that committee it came out because all of this for me is new.    Is that Mr Tom Moyane was part of that committee but he never sat in the meetings where I was interrogated by a committee of about fourteen people which meant Ms Sindane will be the only people who will actually be influenced in that together with Ms Ndlomo but I want to go on record that I was never given an opportunity to interact with the information not necessarily people, individuals but even to be told that you have said this but there is somebody who can collaborate you information they say the opposite what do you have to say?  That exercise was never done.  Lastly Chair I would like to state that I was called by the committee – the only committees I met with I think I must make the statement to the Chair allows.  The first meeting is the one that was referred to earlier this morning a meeting of the NICOC extended NICOC meeting wherein the Deputy General in the Presidents recommended that a committee comprising of DG’s of all the affected departments be formed.  I wasinvited by that committee through the DG to a meeting in one of the security houses in Eastern Pretoria.  When I got there they asked me a lot of questions and I asked – I said to them, in the letter that I received I was told I am only going to meet Mr Ndlomo.  Mr Ndlomo not the one put in the newspapers as Thulani Ndlomo but the other Ndlomo who actually his name is Dennis Ndlomo who was Ambassador in Algeria.  He was the Chair of that meeting.  But there must have been about thirteen or fourteen people I do not recollect.  They asked me a lot of questions and I said to them, what is the legal status of this gathering?  And they said to me, it is a formal and legally constitutedstructure to conduct an investigation about the landing of the Gupta plane in Waterkloof.  I then asked them I said, Do you not think it would have been appropriate for you to inform me accordingly so that I will have exercised my rights to legal representation if I so choose?  They then said no it is fine can I be excused for a few minutes.  I was.  After that they called me back after quite a long period and they said okay we are going to give you questions in writing so that you can have a chance to consult with your legal counsel.  I did that.  I responded to those questions within a very short period of time in less than three days and I sent it back to them.  Number of weeks elapsed and then one day again through the DG they called me to the same guest house and they say I must come and clarify some of the answers I had given to them in writing.  But that to me was just an exercise in futility because the same day that they called me they had already given the report to the Minister Jeff Radebe who was already reading it.  So thequestion is what was the purpose of calling me by all these committee members?  It presupposes that some of these members did not know that there was a final report out there already because they will not have wasted their valuable time sitting and trying to establish that. So I actually have a number of concerns about the inaccuracies in my view what I see as inaccuracies expressed in the report.  And again if it pleases the Chair I would request that the commission establishes from the lady who was here testifying if they ever made…    Ms SIndane thank you.   That is right.  I just wanted to indicate Chair that on the very last meeting when I was called into clarify the answers that I had provided when I got onto my radio Minister Jeff Radebe was also reading on television the outcome of the work of the JCPS Cluster …    Which to me was extremely worrisome that I would be called to come and account and to provide my own account of issues but already there is a pre-delivered report which has been presented.  It – it raises questions to me over and above what I said earlier. None the less having said that I am willing to cooperate with the Commission if they want to raise issues on I wanted to go on record that the manner in which the final report was compiled by the JCPSsmells fishy and normally if it smells fishy it is fish and I am raising that because I have explained Chair that the people that interviewed me I would have expected that they are the people who are also associating with this document but now there are people who never said (indistinct) wrong but they are part of – they are the ones compiling the final report. I just wanted to go on record on that and that I will be willing to cooperate fully …    With the Commission but Ijust wanted that serious concern noted because …    It raises a lot of questions in my head.    Particularly given that the Chair of that Committee in our first interaction at NICOC she was the first one to pronounce that I must not be allowed to use State funds to – to defend myself legally and I was not sure where that came from either because I thought I was being if you like interviewed for what happened during the execution of my job as Chief of Protocol so I was not sure. So I thought there was already a bias and then when the report comes in the way that it did.  It definitely raises serious concerns on my side.  I just want to go on record on that and then andwhatever questions …    I can Chair, thank you.    There are.   One of them that for example Ms Sindane also made reference to is that I told her – I told somebody that the Minister of Transport has approved landing in Waterkloof.  Surely – surely you will also appreciate that I will not be that naive to expect a Minister from Transport to supersede the Minister of Defence when the - Waterkloof is the base falling under the authority of Minister of Defence. So surely the only thing I wanted to – to go on record again on is that yes the Minister of Transport spoke to me about the landing in OR Tambo but never did I make reference to it landing in Waterkloof.    I cannot recall all of them now because if maybe you ask a question I will be able to indicatebecause …  There was a lot of information.  Maybe I may also indicate that a lot of information was given to us extremely late Chair and maybe to correct also the impression created that we - we requested a postponement to Monday because we wanted to make an affidavit is inaccurate.  It was because we got some of the documents actually on Friday.  So …    I could not prepare.  I couldnot prepare …    Properly without access to that.  So that was the only reason …    Primary reason …  Why we requested an extension.  So clearly …    With all the documents in your – in the possession of the Commission.    It has been a very difficult period for us.   FF1 page?    11.    No it is not ma’am.    I did ask – I did call the Advisor after the – the Ambassador of India said he is aware that the request has been elevated to the Minister.  So I wanted to find out from him if – if the Minister had made or applied her mind to the – to the said request.    The reference that I wasunder pressure from number one.    Yes.    In fact – sorry.    Ja, ja.  It is – that is basically it yes.    I do not have a proper recollection of the – the content of the discussion.    I accept that it was about following up on whether the flight clearance has been processed or not.    I – I suppose so but as I indicated earlier ma’am I would have also asked him why they had allowed the – the mother of the King of Swaziland to land at Waterkloof if those are the only categories but I am just saying if – if that was my objective but that was not.  My objective was just to establish if they have issued and/or processed the flight clearance.    I do not – I do not remember that at all.    Chairperson I doubt that he would have said so and I will give you reasons why.  Because when he was testifying sitting here …    He indicated that people who have utilised Waterkloof is the Head of State, the Deputy Head of State and Ministers if they are doing business – Government business.  So he would not have restricted himself to only Heads of State and Deputies because he knows the work.  He is being working in that area for quite some time. That is why I am saying I find difficulty in associating with a statement which is incomplete because I will have expected him to actually say even including special envoys for example which also land at Waterkloof.  So that is why for me that statement makes me feel uncomfortable again.    Chair …   I think Chair it would have been an anomaly for him to do – to say that …    Because the application for the landing was indicating that it is Ministers not Heads of State.    So he will have to responded to it   And said sorry these Ministers …    Because of this we are denying them the right to land.    So I would have understood that.    Hm.    I would not be able to tell Chair …  Because as I said unfortunately the request had been sent directly to …    To the – to the Minister of Defence.    Ja.   Yes. ADV THANDI NORMAN    As I indicated earlier I could have said that because the Minister – the High Commission of India had told me that there will be four - four.  In fact I think I said six or eight Ministers will be on board.    Chair the way I read it …    Again subject to correction.    Is that if he says to me it is only the Heads of State and their Deputies who land there and that is an understanding we have both established.  I think it will make more sense than for me to say oh yes by the way there is a Deputy President in the plane.    So for me it does not suddenly follow that …    The mentioning that therewill be Ministers is linked to the statement …    That he might have made earlier.    I am saying to – to Chair I am trying to indicate Chair that there is no direct link between the two.  They may be or they may not be linked because if he said sorry we only allow people like when you go to some places they say sorry we only allow people who are 18 years and older.  They say of course I am 18. You then show that. You do not say I am 14.  So even in this case when they say it is only Heads of State and their Deputies for me to make an – to continue engaging based on that.  I will have had to say indeed also in this plane coming there is a Deputy President or a President.    I agree Chair …    And I am sure also that even in his understanding …    He knows that Ministers land there and …   Earlier this morning …    Ambassador Matjila made reference for example to Hilary Clinton who has landed there manier times.    So – do - Ministers do land there …    And I am 100 percent sure that he knows that.    I do not recall Chairperson …    But of course I could have said that …    Ministers but I do not recall or …   I do not recall that one.    I deny categorically that statement.  It sounds very much like the media statement I read after they discovered at meeting that Minister – of Ben Martins had had in OR Tambo.    I – I do not recall that at all.    Okay.   Chair, may I ask …    For clarity on the question?    If you read the line that was    If that is what is meant then I hear but …   If you clarify it like that Chair but again like I said I do not recall Chair.    Yes sir.    I think the – the distinctionthat the Chair is identifying of the two meanings is exactly what I was also saying.  I was identifying as confusing in that statement.    No I do not recall Chair.    Yes sir.    I do not recall that.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.    He did say that you send something in writing and that is when I asked my PA to send an emailsaying that can they please process that – the application which unfortunately I think we went through it in the morning was sent in way which said I have authorised it when I do not have such powers.    No.  I - I could not say that and then immediately instruct my PA to send an email to confirm that I want them to process and also ask my PA to copy two of the Senior Managers in the Protocol Section that is my Deputy Ms Sally Ramokgopa and Ms Grace Mason.    The only time that I met with Colonel Anderson at Waterkloof was when we went there to do a dry run before the arrival.  Like for whenever you have got delegations coming landing there some would request that they would like a pre inspection to see how they are going to plan it and it was something standard that we used to do in the two and a half years that I worked there which also I am sure will appear in the – in the report of themeeting with the Public Protector which was held to verify that very same point.    No, no I know that there was an inspection because I did I asked her to – if she could arrange to meet with the people and I know that there was a – what do you – there were people who went there to – from events management company who went there to actually see how they could actually do the décor for the arrival.  For the – for the (intervenes).    Correct.    Before the landing.    Correct.   I am not sure of the – I do recollect the dates ma’am.    It has been a long time.    I am not sure I understand what you mean by activities ma’am but as far as I know that is basically – my – my job was only in protocol and I had no other business in all other – you know - portfolios because those fell – fell under differentpeople.    No ma’am.  The only time that you can allow people to come and do a pre inspection is only when they have received the flight clearance and then after receiving clearance then they arrange to go and do a pre arrival inspection about how they are going to deal with the things there.    Hm.    I think ma’am I think you meant to say the company went because Colonel Anderson worked at Waterkloof.  So she was always perpetually there.  That is one.  Number two, I am saying again ma’am although I do not recall the exact sequence and the date because of the time lag all I am certain of is that there is no way that I would have said to him that we have alreadyhad a pre inspection if the – the flight clearance had not been issued.  I do not remember the exact dates like …    You know – as they are like that.    It is okay.    It is okay.    No I do not.    Yes.    I do not recall telling him it was a Gupta wedding.    When I tried to call initially and I did not get him and I left a message and then secondly I said once they have established whether they were granting or not granting then they must call me back to let me know so I could converse that information to the High Commissioner of India.    That is correct.    No I responded Chair.    I said that is not an accurate reflection of what – of what I did.    It was on the contrary I instructed my PA to send an email that yes I do want them to continue processing the application and then let us know so that we can inform the Indian High Commission about the outcome thereof and I had asked my PA to also copy two of Senior Managers in the process …    Because I had no issues to hide.  So why would I have – I would not have said therefore that I cannot put it in writing.   No Chair unfortunately like I said I do not recall at all some of these things becue of the time lag and unfortunately had the JCPS Team called me at that time when all was fresh in my mind I would have been in a better position to respond …    But now I am sitting with this six and a half - more than six years later …    And obviously it is something I have been trying to put behind my back in the first place.    So I do not have a very vivid or accurate recollection of some of the sequencing and some of the issues that had transpired there …    But of course …    Like I said …    And of course like I said I amtrying to cooperate with the Commission to the best of my ability despite the challenges that I have indicated getting the …  Some information – documents on Friday …    And having to try and squeeze with my legal counsel …    Based on their availability.   Try to recollect and recall some of the things.  It is rather difficult …    But nonetheless I am not using this as an excuse for anything. I am just trying to say that I may not have a fair recollection when it comes to date or the timing for example.    Chair, first correction is that the request was made on Wednesday when we came here not on Tuesday.    It was not Wednesday and wewere promised that we will get them on Wednesday.    But unfortunately we only got the first batch on Thursday.    So I am just trying to indicate the sequencing and if you look at the bulkiness of the information.    We are to deal with, it is, I think it is you know. It is… (indistinct) I mean.    Otherwise I could have used an argument that I have not been given enough time, I need a month.    I requested a months’extension but I just wanted to subject myself to this process so that I can continue with my work.    Correct.    No, we can continue, chair. I was just indicating because I do not really believe that if we extend up until tomorrow given that my legal counsel also has got other.    Legal obligations with other clients… (indistinct) have time to consult with them.     So I might just as well, it will just be a waste of the Chair’s time as well as that of the Commission to do so.    Yes, Chair. And again maybe I may just also add one thing toward what my legal counsel has said. That our reservations do not only emanate from the timing but also from the fact that when we requested some of the testimony that was utilized by the former people who appeared before this Commission we were told that that is classified, we cannot have access to it and yet it was admissible to be used here particularly implicating me. So in terms ofbeing able to prepare myself properly I feel that my rights were prejudiced because I am engaging with people who have probably seen, listened and heard what they are talking about and given that a six-year period had lapsed. I have been denied that right to also have the same access but yet the information is admissible to be utilized by this who are leading the interrogation. So I am just feeling, Chair, and again please bear with me for my naïveté. I may not necessarily understand that you know certain processes may be allowed for those who are leading evidence to have, to be the only ones with access to certain information and those affected be denied because of it being exclusive.You know, but to a layperson it says there is something just not right. You know, that is all I was just trying to say, Chair.     Yes, I do chair.    Yes, I do, Chair. 
KOLOANE:When the High Commissioner, as I indicated earlier that my first time to hear about it was when the High Commissioner of India called me and I was not in the office when he called.  He said to me we have submitted a flight clearance request for a Ministerial delegation coming from India but we have not had a response, so that was for me, that is why I took it that it is a Ministerial response. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Chair I am sorry Chair I am – may I approach?    I beg your pardon Chair but I think in fairness.    In fairness to the witness.    We should identify     The particular paragraphs of the report whichyou have in mind because to my recollection what the report suggests is not that that exchange took place in a conversation between Ambassador Koloane and Mr Ntshisi but rather between Mr Ntshisi and Colonel Anderson.    Right Chair.    I understand. 
AMBASSADOR VSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I – I just do not remember that at all ma’am. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Chair, in the greater scheme of things the difference between a journey now and continuing is really negligible.    We, the instructions that we have had thus far is given the peculiar nature of this witness does having been postedoverseas.    It is difficult to coordinate. So we thought it best in an effort to be corporative to try and use the time as fruitfully as possible.    And that remains our instructions.    But we of course.    I am constrained to reserve my client’s rights obviously.    Given the amount of time but really I think in essence what we are saying is.   If we really want to utilize the time fully as a normal witness would and leaving aside our efforts to try and be as corporative as possible.    Well then, it would not be possible to give evidence this week. We would have to adjourn and he would have to come back at a later date.    We do not want to go there as presently advised.We want to use the time.    And so our attitude at this stage is we would like to continue.    But with a reservation of rights.    Thank you, Chair. Yes, Chair, your characterization of the events is what was relayed to us and we certainly have no reason to doubt that. But where we have some concern is not that necessarily the documents are being or recordings are being deliberately withheld but that once they are becoming available, they become available during the course of the testimony and the witness does not have an opportunity to consider them before he is questioned in relation to the contents of those conversations.    So what springs to mind in particular is specific recordings that I believe are on record as having been held between the Ambassador and Colonel Anderson and in my learned friend’s questioning this morning she did touch on some of the conversations.And I withheld an objection to that point but we place on record now that we have some concern if there is going to be questioning in regard to those conversations before we have had an opportunity to listen to those recordings. Thank you, Chair.    Yes, Chair. That is certainly something we would want to take you up on that offer and of course that goes for any recordings or any documents that are intended to be used I think that is a matter of principle.    Yes, Chair, I am not sure it necessarily solves the problem completely.    It mitigates the problem.    Certainly.    Thank you, chair.    Again in regard to the production of documents, we do not point fingers at anyone to the extent that they were not given. We do not suggest that was not purpose.    And you know the Commission does what it can.    We understood that we would receive documents late in the day on Wednesday. That we understood it was undertaken which was given. We understand and we accept at face value what my learned friend says that that attempt was made and that a link was senton the Wednesday but it was not received.    On the Thursday, a link was sent and that is attached approximately, will not approximately 519 pages’ worth of documents.    And then on Friday afternoon, a further link was sent, sorry then I think. Yes, on the Friday for the link was sent and that although there was some duplication between the first bundle and the second bundle now contains 776 pages of documents.   What the Ambassador had been given prior to appearing to give evidence on Wednesday was nothing more than only the Rule 3.3 notice which attached to it an Annexure A and an Annexure B which is comprised of Ms Sidane’s statement as Annexure A and JCPS cluster report without any Annexures as Annexure B. That is all that he had before.    So you will appreciate Chair, that it is a voluminous extent of documentation.    We do voice our concerns about the prospect of having the recordings played before we have had an opportunity to listen to them which adds to that.    What you, as I understand it Chair now have is a suggestion by my learned friend that rather than putting us to pressure and trying to do it all this week that perhaps we arrange a mutually convenient dates in the fullness of time. And the Ambassador will then go back to the Netherlands and by way of an arrangement we will then come back in a few weeks or months or whatever it is. I have not had an opportunity to take instructions on that. It seems somewhat sensible to me as I am standing on my feet but honestly all of this is subject to what you may roll of course, Mr Chair. So in regard to if there is a suggestion that he must either be put to any election and be held by it.   And if there is a suggestion that as an alternative to that we, my learned friend and I talked about mutually convenient dates in the fullness of time, I will need an opportunity to take instructions on either of those.    But perhaps I could inquire as a matter of principle, chair, whether you would be receptive to either of those approaches perhaps arranging dates in due course or whether you would insist on the matter preceding this week.    Prejudice.    Yes.    Yes.   Of course.    Yes, of course we would have to consider all the documents to determine whether they are relevant or not.    The other complication, chair, and again I raise it just thinking out loud is of course in order for us to form a view onwhether the Ambassador would be prejudiced in continuing or not, this question of the recordings is a spanner in the works. We would obviously want to listen to them first before we make that election.    So perhaps, my suggestion would be if we could obtain a ruling from you that we are entitled to those recordings.    And if we could have them immediately.    We could consider them overnight and then tomorrow we could come back and inform you, chair, what our position is whether we are inclined to continue or whether we would seek a postponement.
