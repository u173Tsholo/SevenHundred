CHAIRPERSON:Good morning Ms Gcabashe, good morning everybody.    We are starting late because of partly me, partly matters of the commission.  Okay let us – are you ready?  Let us start if you are ready.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Okay.  No that is fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay No that is fine.    Okay.      Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Hm.    Yes.   Yes, yes.    To clarify.  Okay no that is fine.     I am sorry we are going to his affidavit?     Okay.    Yes okay.    Or maybe…    Yes.   Okay.    Maybe let me put – let me say she is saying she understands your evidence  to be to the effect that you did not at any stage intend to establish public / private partnership.     Hm.    Yes.  My memory is not very clear now by the way did you say there was some agreement that the department had with Paras – separate agreement or was there just a letter?     Yes.  But there was no – nothing – there is no agreement.    Directly between Paras and the department?     Ja.  There was some mention I think of some letter maybe it was a letter from Paras saying Estina would be their partner or something.    It was just a letter?   That was addressed to the department.     Yes.  Because I know that you – you said I think that from your point of view your partnership was with Paras and Estina wasParas’ partner or agent or something ja.    Is that right?    Ja.  But it would seem and this is maybe a point that we did deal with before but I just want to ma ke sure.  So it would seem that for all intents and purposes in terms of records the only entity that you had as a department you had a partner – an agreement with or a partnership with was Estina?     Not Paras.    That is correct ja.    Okay.      Hm.    Yes.  Yes no, no, that is fine but your understanding is that there are provisions that deal with that?     Yes.    Yes okay.    That is fine.    Hm.    Are you moving away from the agreement?    Oh you are?    Oh okay.  Maybe before that Mr  Thabethe some of the questions that I might ask you about the questions that linked toquestions that we dealt with before but it has been quite some time.     You see we talked a few minutes ago about the fact that the records of the department would only show Estina as being the department’s partner in this project.  Is that right?     Yes, because the agreement was with Estina.  Excuse me - and - and it did not say that Estina was entering into the agreement as an agent of - of Paras.  You would know that it did not say that even though that might have some legal issues that maybeonly lawyers can - would look at. I do not want to be unfair to you but it was Estina in ter ms of the agreement.    Yes.  Now I see that - in terms of the agreement    Yes, but you see the sole provider in terms of that clause of the services as I understand it.  You might have a differe nt understanding.  The sole provider is said to be Estina.     Yes.  So what I am - what I am putting to you is itseems to me therefore that if anything went wrong with the services that Estina was supposed to provide to the department in terms of this project the only people that you could legitimately really complain to would be Estina because it was Estina who was the sole provider.  They were not the sole provider - they were not the provider or co provider of the services with Paras.  They were the sole provider of the services.    Yes.  You - you accept that?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Yes, but there is nothing wrong with internationalissues.    I know you are not a lawyer but …     But if you need to involve international issues to protect yourself and to protect taxpayers money why not bring in those international issues because remember we discussed this earlier within the context of the fact that you did not ensure that there was proper checking of what Estina business was.  Maybe I am inaccurate in - in putting this - putting it that waybut even its financial situation was not checked.    And I think last time.  It was revealed that I think on the day on which they signed the agreement or around the day when they signed the agreement they had only about R16,00 in the bank account.    So it is in that context because as I said previously part of what one is looking at is to what extent was this project handled in a manner that protected taxpayers’ money in light  of what we knowhappened.  So - so this question that the sole provider of the services was Estina and that is put in the agreement means that for example to the extent that you might have difficulties with their services.  You are stuck with them and if y ou speak to Paras they speak to you as a favour if they want to but there is no agreement signed thatcompels them to come in if Estina fails to provide services.     You - you understand?    And you accept that?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Did - and - and the - and the State Law Advisors did - were involved in the drafting of this agreement?    The first one?   Hm.  Of course - of course what the lawyer drafts depends also on what he or she is told by the client …     Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  What - what should have - the question that should have arisen - maybe I should not put it like this but there may be an argument that says the question that should have arisen in your mind and/or the mind of the lawyers or the State Law Advisors is if the intention was to have Paras as a partner and there is - there is not going to be an agreement with Paras …     How do we make sure that the entity with whom we enter into an agreement meets the same standards that made us comfortable to select Paras as a partner?  Let us look into those things and only when we are satisfied about those things do we then go ahead and sign an agreement.Part of this might be linked to what we discussed already but you might wish to say something.    Yes.  You - you are in agreement?    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Oh I think there is just one more that I - one more question that I want to raise.  I saw something quit e strange here in   But - but maybe to fair to you I must point out that nine - Clause 9.4 has a clause about monitoring where it places the    Hm.    When you say compliance is that as opposed to performance?   Yes and do you want to deal with the distinction?     Ja.    Hm.    Which Act are you talking about?     Act.   Yes.    Well compliance would relate to what?  To statute - tothe performance of statutory obligations?     Yes.    A certificate for (intervenes).    Yes.    Have you got a licence?    Yes.   Oh.  So - so when you say the department was going to monitor compliance those are the types of things you are talking about?    And in terms of the monitoring of Estina’s performance of its obligations other than compliance with statutory requirements.    It was going to monitor its own performance?     Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.   Well my - my concern with the idea or notion that a party to the agreement is given the obligation to monitor itself as opposed to or is - is given the right to monitor itself and that right not being given to the other party is that I do not understand why that would be so. I mean if I employ  you as a - as somebody to do some work in my company.  I monitor you.  You know because I must satisfy myself that you are doing the job properly and when I am satisfied it is fine.  IfI am not satisfied I raise issues with you and - and I do not rely on - I do not give you the right to monitor yourself.     You see and - and here it seems that the department was giving Estina the right to monitor its own performance and - andthat seems to me to suggest that if you try to monitor their performance they would be entitled to say hang on.  You are in breach of the agreement.  We are supposed to monitor ourselves …     And that sounds strange to me.    That - that is what you - you wanted to do?    Hm.    Hm.  Well I would imagine that anybody would do their - what you call internal monitoring with or without any clausebecause you want your own performance to be in accordance with your commitments and the agreement.  You want to perform well.  You do not want the other party to accuse you of failing to perform a s required but it may be that from your side if you say we want to see mechanisms that you put in place that will help you to detect as early as possibletheir problems in performance.    That might be fine.  The only question would be that must not take away your right to - to monitor.  My concern is that from what you have said it seems to me that Clause 8 -4 which seems to talk about the department’s right to monitor.     From what you say maybe it could be relating to compliance but I see that it does say performance.  It does not say compliance.   Did you see that?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    But internally Estina should also monitor its own performance so that maybe they can pick up things even before the department picks them up.  It does not mean that the department wasnot going to monitor Estina’s performance?     Okay, alright.    I think - I think those were the two questions I wanted to - two areas on which I wanted to ask questions, ja.    Thank you.    Yes, okay.    Okay.      Do you think it would be necessary to look at it or not necessarily?        That’s fine ja.       Yes if you wish to look at it, it’s fine, just for mypurposes ja.         But why would you need to send a lawyer of the department Mr Thabethe?      Well there is something you say – you said you had a problem with and you must tell me if my understanding is wrong, itseems that you had a problem with investigators interviewing Estina without you or without anybody representing you there.       No Mr Thabethe, Estina has an agreement with your department.     And it is going to benefit from tax payer’s money.      Treasury is there to look after the tax payer ’s money.      They want to investigate, one would have expected that you would have said to them, oh you want to speak to Estina, please by all means go there and actually if y ou want I can pick up thephone and say they must please make sure they meet with you.     Whether I’m there or not, whether somebody from the department is there or not is neither here nor there, go and m eet with them, why didn’t you say that, what was the problem with saying that?         Yes but you – well they may or may not have wantedpermission from you but I don’t see even why they thought it’s necessary to get permission from you if they thought they needed permission but that might be for – that might be because of what I don’t know in terms of how National Treasury operates and Public Service operates but the fact of the matter is, Estina had an agreement with the department in order for them to properly in vestigate the project, the had to speak to Estina and actually if Estina refused to speak to them it seems to me it would have fallen upon you to say, you can’t have an agreement with us being part of government and you refuse to talk to government because Treasury is government.  When they areinvestigation, if that’s your attitude then maybe we are not going to continue this agreement with you.  If you enter into an agreement with part of government you will be investigated, so what’s your problem?  So that’s what I would have expected you to say to Estina if they resisted.  So I don’t know why you seem to have a problem, I don’t seewhy you had a problem and why you would even have wanted to have a lawyer of the department to go there and be there when th e investigators talk to Estina, why?       You see the point?        Yes.     Well from what Miss Gcabashe has read there, it seems to me that Estina was saying they were quite happy to be interviewed by the investigators if you gave permission.  Did you ever get to know that, that was their attitude?      Yes did - as far as you know, as far as you remember did the investigators ever say to you, Estina is p repared to talk to us but they want to know that you are permitting them to talk tous or permitting us to talk to them, did the investigators ever say that to you?     And what did you understand the waiving of the agreement to refer to or is that the permission you are talking about?     Yes and you did not do that?         That is Estina?      Yes.     I’m sorry where in the agreement does it say they would need your permission?     Oh I’m sorry I think I missed this part but then this appears to clearly say you must give permission.      So why did you say to the investigators – or at least you said to me earlier on, you didn’t see why the investigators neededyour permission.       Yes, so in the light of this clause, are you saying they did not need your permission?     Ja you see what you referred to as an e xclusive, you mean an exclusive interview with Estina between the investigators and Estina without the department?          Yes and why was that a problem?   MR MBANA PETER THABETHE     Yes okay.     Yes, no that I appreciate but I want t o understand your understanding at that time, what did you see as a problem at that time, in the light of this clause?      Yes but you knew that their request for permission arose from this clause isn’t it?       And in terms of this clause Estina was prohibited from disclosing certain information to other people?      And obviously the investigators, if they interviewed Estina they would have wanted Estina to disclose certain information about the project to them?       Yes so they would need your permission then.       Ja but why do you want an understanding, they are investigating and they want to interview Estina people?     Why don’t you give them permission, the clause says Estina must get permission from you in order to disclose certain information?       So why don’t you give them?       Yes you would give the permission now.        Yes.       Yes but remember I said I understand that, I appreciate that in terms of now, I’m trying to understand what it is that you would have seen as a problem at that time because it seems to me quite clear.  It seems to me that any head of department who was reallyinterested in National Treasury being satisfied that everything was in order would have said, oh yes Estina you have got my permission to disclose whatever they may ask you, these are not people who are coming from outside government, they are part of government?      Yes.         Yes but I do want you to – well if that is all you areable to say in terms of what the basis was for our not being prepared to give permission that’s fine, bu t I’m looking at it because I don’t know if, when all evidence is heard there might be a suggestion that it was more than that, you know and I just want to make sure you get an opportunity to deal with it, but Miss Gcabashe might be having questions around  the issue.     Well I see you look at me Mr Thabethe and you’re not sure whether to start answering and that’s simply because I’m thinking that, from your answer you – well maybe not really what I’m thinking about.  You don’t seem  to have been concerned about the department you seem to have been concerned about Estina.          So but having said that, answer the question that Miss Gcabashe has put to you I’m just articul ating this because you did realise that I seem to be wanting to say something but now you know what I was thinking but you can answer her question.     Yes.         Yes I see Miss Gcabashe certainly has more question for you on the issue, I’m not sur prised.  Let’s have he tea break and we’ll resume – it’s twenty past we’ll resume and twenty five to twelve,we adjourn.    You may continue Ms Gcabashe.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC    Just repeat Ms Gcabashe who that email was from and who it was addressed to?     I am sorry please give me the Reports bundle.   Yes but …    Yes.    Yes thank you.      Okay.    Yes but you can just reiterate who it was from and who it was addressed to and then he can respond.    Yes.    Yes.  But maybe before – before it – I just want to go back to the answer that Mr Thabethe gave to your question before the break.  Remember at least part of what I was hoping would emer ges whether I was right in thinking that you seemed to be more concerned about protecting Estina than really the department.  Now you gave an answer and you talked about intellectual property and so on and so on.  Am I right to say your concern was more wi th Estina than with thedepartment in terms of confidentiality if there was any concern on your part on confidentiality?     Hm.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Yes.    Okay but let us clear this one at a t ime.  As far as your refusal to give permission to the – to the National Treasury investigators to interview Estina people without anybody from the department your concern was with regard to the confidentiality ofEstina’s intellectual property, is that right?    And then was there any other concern that formed the basis of your unpreparedness to give the permission?     You mean in the investigators?     What do you mean – what did you want them to say about their interest as to how far their interest went.  Exactly what is it that you wanted them to say?     Is it about the scope of investigation? MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   About the project?    Yes no I will talk about the intellectual – your concern about the confidentiality.    Of the intellectual property and Estina.  But as far  as the department is concerned what if anything was there that formed the basis of your unpreparedness to give permission?  In other words what interest of the department were your trying to protect against people from – investigators from National Treasu ry in relation to in not wanting to give permission?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Was in the weekend newspapers?     Yes.       Hm.    Hm.    Well you see that is part of the problem. From what you have said it seems to me that there really was no – there really was nothing that formed – there was nothing relating to the departmentthat formed the basis for your not wanting to give them permission.  The only thing that seems to have formed the basis of your unpreparedness to give permission was your c oncern about confidentiality relating to the intellectual property of Estina.  Now I just want you to confirm whether my understanding of your evidence iscorrect?    It is correct?    Okay.  Now why would you be so concerned about any intellectual property of Estina when you were being requested to give permission such as is contemplated in Clause 10.1 of the agreement about confidentiality?  Because if you gave permission and Estina thought you gave permission for the investigators to interview Estina people 1. That might have nothing to do with any intellectual property.  Therefore the investigation would go on but  2. Even if there was something they wanted to talk about in relation to intellectual property or to see Estina could protect interest by refusing so why could you not say look as far as I am concerned I am giving you permission.  If Estina has any problem you will deal with them.    What the intellectual property?     But that is where I have a problem.  Why you being head of the department were more concerned actually from what I think Ms Gcabashe read earlier on it looks like you were more concernedabout Estina’s intellectual property than Est ina itself.  Because it seems that Estina was saying they were prepared – saying to the investigators they were prepared to – to meet with them if you would agree.  They did not seem to have the same concern that you had about confidentiality and their intellectual property.      What condition?    Yes but – but if Estina had a problem they would raise the issue and also you could pick up the phone with – and phone Estina and say the investigators wan t me to give permission for them to interview you and therefore I propose to give them the permission. You do have any problem?  You did not do that, did you?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  But from your side you see the permission that must come from you as far as outsiders are concerned I would imagine is really more to protect information relating to the department.  Because you as – in terms of the agreement you could have – you could have seen whatever you needed to see from Estina.      But as I understand it I think that your permission was put in more to protec t the department’s information and of course I do not see why there will be a problem with National Treasury peopleseeing information of a government department as such and of course you have not said that was your concern.  It is – you said it was with intellectual property.  But I think – I think that is fine we have reached a stage where we agree that your concern was with intellectual property – that you say that your concern was with intellectual property ofEstina.    And did you know what intellectual property Estina had there in relation to anything in the project?     Yes but you cannot fight so much to protect something that you do not know.  Did you know what intellectual property they had?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Ms Gcabashe.    Yes, yes, ja.    Yes explain it is fine.es explain it is fine.    Ja, no, no I think ever ybody understands that.  He says Ms Gcabashe will continue with dealing with that.     Hm.    Yes.   Hm    Yes.    Yes. Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC    Yes.    Yes.  I think – I think maybe what you – you – what you should nevertheless do is to put to him if that is the case that a reading of those emails and you can specify them without going through each of them.  A reading of those emails is not consistent with his version now on this point if that is the position.  So that he gets a chance to respond to that.  If he wishes to look at those emails beforehe responds then that can be done and we can if ne cessary he can look at that over the lunch break and then after lunch he can answer that question if he needs to.    Yes.    And that email is from who to whom?     Estina was unwilling to meet with them.     Okay.  So – but you are saying that you never told anybody that Estina was unwilling to meet with the investigators?     Hm   Hm.    But as far as you know why would they be interested in intellectual property?     Why would that really be of interest to National Treasury Investigators about this project?    You are wondering whether he should stand up andobject.  He will not assist you to answer the question.  He will leave it to you to answer the question.  You k now some questions just need you.      Yes.    Yes.    You do not know?    Yes, no do not speculate but I am trying to understand the thinking.    Would be speculation?    Yes.    Yes so I guess that is – the correct answer then is – would be that you also do not know why intellectual property would beof interest to National Treasury investigators?     Hm.    Yes.    But you see you do not have to be afraid of anything as long as you are telling the truth.  If you make a mistake you say I made a mistake I have thought about it you know.  So in other words as long as you are honestly giving the answer that you believe to be true if it turns out later to be mistaken or to be wrong as long as it is what you believe honestly to be the truth there is no pr oblem.   Ja.    Yes okay alright.  But…    Ja but – but you accept that it seems that the onlyanswer is the one I hav e suggested?    Ja okay.  Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe.     Mr Buthelezi.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm    Hm    Hm    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI   Hm.  Well maybe we can leave it on the basis that maybe during the lunch break the two of you can talk.     Talk to each other about it and then when I come back after lunch if we need to revisit the issue we can look at that.     Having said that I just want to say that the question was – I ask the question because it did not seem to me that one wouldnecessarily think about National Treasury investigators being concerned about intellectual property and if I am correct in that thinking then - there may be a question as to why the approach taken was not that you people you go there.  Do as much as you can and Estina will - if Estina raises problems about anything let us deal with it at that stage and try and solve it at that stage but maybe the two of you can confer over lunch and then depending on the need we - we can then revisit it after lunch.     Ja.   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  Well accept that National Treasury can put conditions to the appointment of a third party to say because you will be doing this for us these are the limitations.  You know.  So that - thatthird party is not exactly in the same position as would be somebody from National Treasury doing the same thing.     Ja.    Yes.    Okay.  No that is fine.    Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe.    Yes.    I am sorry.  The last one it - it is an email from whom to whom?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Do you accept Mr Thabethe that at least as at 24 December 2013 Estina - Mr Vasram were prepared to speak to the investigators.  I am tempted to say about anything relating to the project as long as at least they knew that you had no problem.  Do youaccept that …     That was factually the position?     Yes.    But he - he seems not to be concerned about that.  All he seems to be wanting is if there is no - no official from the department at the interview …     At least you should be - you should be able to say you are okay with there being no official from the department and they can continue and interview and go into the interview.  He - he does not say - as I understand it.  He does not say we - we are happy to - we - we are happy to discuss with you everything except intellectualproperty.    I hope - I hope I am right Ms  Gcabashe in terms of what they say - Estina - that they do not seem to say we are happy to discuss anything with investigators other than intellectual property.  They do not seem to say that.    About.    Ja, at all.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So they do not raise that issue at ally.  You were concerned about it but they based on this it is not their concern - theirconcern and they - they are not saying - they are not - there is nothing here that shows that they want you to refuse permission.  There seems to be nothing suggesting that they want you to refuse permission.  They just want you to make up your mind.     Yes, yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay.    Yes.  Okay.    Hm.    Do you have any recollection? MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   You might not recall?    Okay.  You …    Might be able to help him.    Where the email was.    The one you were having.    The one in front of you that has the email that we were looking at just now.  Ja.  Page 48.   I cannot remember?    Hm.    Yes.   So it is possible that …    With them.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.    That is fine.    That is fine.    Ja.    Yes.    Please remind me where to find it.     Yes.  What page?    2-8-8 does not look the first page but no I think  my 2-8-8 …   Hm.    Report’s - Report’s Bundle B?    And page 2-8-8?    2-8-4, okay oh.    Okay.    I think it is the same thing.  It is just that I thought you said the first page would be 2-8-8.  Maybe you meant the first page    Ja.    Ja, okay.    Yes.    Hm.    At - at?    Yes.    Yes.  In different years.    1 067.    Hm.    Sorry.  Did you say the same number?     Yes.    Oh, I thought you said 1  006.    Ja.  Okay.    Yes.    You must - you say declining means it was doing well?    In - initially?    Ja, in 2006 it was - in 2006 they were - there was agreat number of milk producers in the Free State.     Ja.    Yes.    By 20 - before you do that - by 20 - by January 2012 …    The number of milk producers in the Free State interms of that information there had gone down - had decreased by something in the region of two/thirds.     Hm?    By - by half, ja.    By almost half, ja.  You are right, ja.    Earlier question ja.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Well do you accept his figures that between January 06 and January 2012, in six years, if I’m corre ct, the situation in the Free State, which I take to refer to the whole of the Free State.     The situation was that the number of milk producers went down by half over six years, do you accept  that statement?    Yes.    Ja okay.    Ja.    Ja    Yes.    Mmm.    Well I would imagine that you wouldn’t go into a business sector which had – which had effectively driven away 50% of businesses unless you had a solution for the pro blem that drove thosebusinesses away.   What was your solution, what was driving them away and what was your solution?     Yes, well let’s talk about that Mr Thabethe.  If you are into milk producing as a business person and on your own I know that you are going to fail, because I know about five hundred other milk producers have failed over the past six years in the same province, and it seems that the reason you failed is because you did not produce enough or you – the business required you to spend too much on it than you were getting in and now I say well I don’t like this idea that you arefailing, I want to assist you, I will put in money.    Okay, one of the questions that must cross my mind is if I look at what I may have to put in, the money that I may have to put in to assist you I must also look at wh at you will get out of the business and see whether it will be worth it because it cannot – it would not make sense if on your own if you rent the business on your own you are going to go under, I come in, I put in a lot of money, and you still go under.  It might also not make sense even if you are not going to go under once I have put in my money if nevertheless whatever you willget maybe just be enough for you to float, you know. Now the question is was there a study that looked at that to say what will these farmers get out of this realistically speaking and when we look at what government, the department will put in for X number of farmers and what they will get out will it be worthwhile.  Now we know that over what three years you were going to put in about over R300million, that is a lot of money.     Did you know what was realistically expected they would get out of their business over the three years?     But well you see if the real problem was transport and if that transport costs could be solved by having a truck, a government truck going around that is much more less than the R300million that you had used for the first three years and obviously you were going to still use a lot of – many more millions after.  So why don’t you just do exactly that, to say this is where we will assist you because this is where the problem is.    Ja what would be the other one?    Yes, but let us go back to what the situation was before you came with the produce.    You see there’s a problem.    The number of milk producers going down drastically.    And you say one of the problems is their prices cannot be affected by the transport costs.     And if government can take over the transport coststhat could go a certain, a long way.     What were the others?    You mean the farmer?   Yes but what I am talking about is why don’t you say okay here identify farmers who are milk producers, and say we understand that this is where the problem lies, that’s where we will come in.  You will continue as normal but our – we will give you a helping hand in relation to costs but otherwise you continue and then you should be able to sell more of your milk because now you don’t have to worry about transport costs, government will take care of those.     Yes, what were the other challenges, if that wassolved in that way?    But that was the only other one or were there other issues, costs and being shareholder.     Transport costs and being shareholder.     Yes.    Mmm, okay.    Well when you say you had permission from WaterAffairs to access water that gives me the impression that you are talking about a river or rivers or dams as opposed to depending on the climate as such.    Were the rivers ...[intervenes]     Well I don’t know enough about boreholes, so I don’tknow whether the position is that as long as you dig deep enough you will find water or whether it is only certain areas where you will be able to do boreholes and find water.    So you’re saying that the area where the farm was, farm is, is such that in terms of the requirements for finding waterusing boreholes that you would easily have been able to  have boreholes and find water.    That’s what you are saying.    Oh, okay.    Mmm, okay.    Yes.    Yes thank you, let us take the lunch adjournment, we will resume at two.  We adjourn.    Let us continue.    Okay.    Ja.    Well that is the one we were using just now.     Yes.    Okay.    Hm.    32 – page 321 you say is the preliminary?     And then page 332 – 331.   Is the big – is the final?    Feasibility study ja.    Okay.  So they are just together.    But they are different…    Ja Okay.    But I should close it.  You will come back to it.     Ja.    Okay.    And the…    16?    Well – my one does not reflect A oh you say it is 16A and the…   Ja   16 A and the A has been…     Ja okay I think we need to     Yes.    Hm.    What did you say these are at 16A, 16B and 16C?     To Estina.    Oh okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay ja.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC    Hm.    Let – the first line of paragraph 18 says the table shows the – reflects the manner in which payment was done.  Does the manner in which payment was done refer to the times when payments were made and the amounts that were made.     That were paid.    Okay.   Ten days apart hey?    Hm.    Hm.    So you confirm that these were – these amounts were paid?    Was available to you.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   ja.    Okay.      Ja.    What page first?    Yes.    Ah.    I wonder whether it might not be better that even later on somebody crosses out the corner…     Ja.  Okay.    I am sorry I am at…     1967 middle number.    Oh okay.    Okay.   Oh okay so when you said paragraph 2 I was looking for a number 2.    Ja.    Okay it is the second paragraph under 5.4.     Well …ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Well …    Ms Gcabashe please do not forget your line of thinking.    I just want to see whether we are on the - our concern is the same or not.    You see Mr Thabethe you said that in effect it was in order that they wrote Vrede Dairy in the column wh ere they were supposed to write the name of the transferee.  You remember that?     Yes.  I have difficulty with accepting that because if you look at the third column in that table.  It says p urpose for which the funds were used.    So each column you are supposed to enter only the information that is required.  Now under name of transferee obviouslywhat is required is you must say who was paid and then - and then the next column says type of organisation …     And one assumes that there is a reason why they would even want type of organisation that might not be apparent to me. Maybe to Ms Gcabashe as well as lawyers but they - we - we have to assume they have a reason to want that information.  Then the next - the third column is purpose for which the funds were used and then you see what is written there is project implementation.  If you ask me that is where the reference to Vrede Dairy Project would come in.    So - so that if I am correct about that then writing Vrede Dairy under name of transferee could not be correct because that is not the person who was paid.   Hm, hm.    But I am inviting you to concede that it was wrong for them to write Vrede Dairy when they were supposed to disclose the name of the person to whom the money was  transferred because thereis a column …     Where they needed to disclose what the payment was for …    You - do you accept that?    Okay, alright.  I do not know whether we (intervenes).     Oh …    Okay.   Yes.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.   Yes.    To - to …    Hm.  Of course you can preface your comments on by saying well if it was not final this is what I  have to say.  If it was final …    This is what I have to say.   Oh.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, but it - it depends whether you want to look at something in that - in the report or whether you just wanted to know whether it was final or not.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Okay.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.   Well …    You - you must remind me now Mr  Thabethe …     Because at some stage I had a clear understanding of these things about qualified and unqualified audits …     But I know that some peopled used to get them mixedup …    And I think right now I am - I am not sure that I am - because I think if you follow with just the general understanding.  Sometimes you understand it in a certain way.  Just go back qualifiedand unqualified.    You see unqualified to the general lay person’s mind …    Might - might give the idea that it is good …     There is no qualification.  There is - there is no condition you know.    So there is no dark spots.    You know, but if you say also qualified.  You know qualified is supposed to - if somebody is qualified it is good but also if it is qualified it can be - it means it is condition - it could mean it is conditional.    So it is a very basic thing but I just realised that I have just forgotten and …     Exactly which one is good which one is bad?     The unqualified?    The first prize?    Clean audit?    Okay.    Unqualified?    But why do you say unqualified because it is like they are qualifying?    It is - it is like yes, but.    You see.    Maybe that is why it is - it is confusing.  You know.  It is like you say to a student you have passed but you must focus on thison this otherwise you will fail next time.     You see.  That is the - that is the unqualified.  The one that says that.  That is the unqualified?     Ja.    But, but can you understand what I am saying?     From a lay person’s person it is like I am approving but my approval is qualified.    But it is called unqualified.  It is like - it is - it is okaybut if you do not fix A, B, C next time there will be a problem.     Ja and then the qualified?    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Which are very bad?    Ja.  Just remind me what are those again. MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Disclaimer, ja.    Then that is …    That is a disaster?    It is chaos.    Yes.  It is just - it is a mess.   It is a mess.  The documents of records are not there.     Yes.  Ja, ja.    That is the worst.    That is - that is …    Disclaimer.    The one above that?    Oh, okay.    Hm.    Oh, but do not worry if - if you cannot remember it.   Okay.  So - so you say what - which one did you get this - this time around that you are telling me about?     The unqualified?    Which is like second best?    Oh, okay.  Ms Gcabashe I was - was I alone in this confusion?   Well at least at some stage I understood it very clearly.  I do not know what h appened recently.    Ja.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Ja.    And the page?    280 million.    Well I thought …    These - these amounts are …    Quite familiar to Counsel.    Ms Gcabashe I am sorry.    I just do not want to forget this am I correct to say throughout the period until the cancellation of the agreement Estina had not made any payment in terms of the amounts that it wassupposed to pay in terms of the agreement?     It had not?  I - I know - well what I have not double checked now is whether the last agreement like the first or the second - I cannot remember - still had a provision that said Estina was to put in a certain amount.  You remember that?     Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.  Ms Gcabashe just explain that again.    Your remember initially there was a clause which said Estina would put in a certain amount and the department would put in a certain amount and we were looking at the question of where Estina would get the money from.    Yes.  So I was saying I have not looked at the last agreement whether that provision was carried throughout or whether it was dropped and if it was not dropped whether Estina ever made th at contribution.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    So …    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   But just to put me at ease.  Is the position that they did pay - do their part in terms of payment or …    Is that unclear?    Hm.    Hm.   Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.  I - I think I just want to mention this so that even if I were to forget at least one of you will not forget.  It is important for - I - I do want to know whether one that obligationcontinued through on the part of Estina to make a contribution.  Whether it made the - the contribution that was envisaged and - that is two, but three I am interested in the timing of the payment by them.  In other words did - did they not pay with the money that you paid them.    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Oh.  There is a term for it.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja, ja.   Ja.    Yes, okay.  No that is fine.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.  No that is fine.    Okay.  Alright.  Do I push aside this file now?     Hm.    To my - to my right …     Ms Gcabashe are you one of those people who need to do this …    To say whether it is left or not?     Alright.   Okay.  We - we go back to the annexures.    I - I just cannot resist this remark.  That if Estina had R16,00 when the contract was entered into.  It is highly un likely they paid with any money other than the money they got from thedepartment.    Okay, but Mr Thabethe might be able to explain and say …    If - if it is convenient.  If it is convenient otherwise I am happy to go at your pace.  It is just that it was something worrying me.  I - I am easy about it.    Yes.    Ja, okay.    Ja.  Okay.  Let us adjourn for five minutes, ja.    Okay. We adjourn.    Okay.    I’m sorry are you reading from 1378?     Yes.    I’m sorry.    Again Ms Gcabashe you will tell me if there’s something I am missing here, could it be Mr Thabethe that by ensuringthat there was a provision to this effect in the agreement that is Estina, namely all its obligations would only commence from the date of the official handover of – or this is of the land, I thought there was a provision that was a little similar but relating to the handover of the shareholder company or the handover of the project to the farmers, atsome stage, but at least this relates to the handover of the lan d?    Ja, okay, no, no.    Yes.    I think I probably had something else in mind, ja,okay.    Ja, what I was concerned about whether Estina ensured that the agreement had a clause which wou ld make sure that they did not have to put in any money until a certain stage but that stage could only be reached after the department had made payment to them therefore allowing them to be able to perform their obligations in terms of putting in their co ntribution with the money from thedepartment that’s what my thinking was, but ...[intervenes]     We might not need to bother about it until later maybe.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh yes at the back of my mind.       Ja okay.    Yes, yes.    Yes, ja.    For each year, okay, okay, and phase one was within the first year?    Okay, okay.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Been met, okay.    Yes okay.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Okay.    Yes, okay, okay.    Okay.    Just remember to raise your voice a bit Mr Thabethe,I know it is late in the afternoon, it has been a long day so that your answers are recorded, just remember to raise your voice a bit.     Okay.  Well there wouldn’t be a company without shareholders isn’t it?    Yes, so if there was a company there would be shareholders to the company.   Ms Gcabashe is that right, or is that not right?    Yes, I am saying isn’t the position that there won’t bea company without shareholders, if there is a company there must be shareholders, or at least a shareholder.     Oh there was even a company called that?     Yes.    Okay.    [laughing]    So the concept of ...[intervenes]     Ja.    Okay.    Ja.   Yes.    Ja, ja.    Mmm, mmm.   Yes, no, no, it is very helpful, it is very helpful.   Yes.      Yes, okay.    Mmm.   Well I think that re ference at page 1400 to the paragraph that has got “vide it’s letter” I think that its somebody who is used to – I do not want to say old English – I think that vide means see, see letter.    Yes, ja, so in other words whatever he is saying in that paragraph he says go to that letter if you want to see what he is talking about.    Ja.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Yes.   At 1-4-0-3?   Yes.    Yes.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Hm.    Hm.    Is - is there any reason to - is there any reason to take that to mean anything other than that there was no money?     There was no money that was transferred.     Hm.    Ja.   Yes.    Hm.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Oh, yes.  I can remember that yes.     Yes, okay.  Alright.    Yes.    An explanation.   Yes.    Ja, ja.    But the R16,00 we saw was in - in a different account.    In Estina’s account that …     They are not mixing with the project money according to that explanation.    Ja.  Yes.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Ja, okay.  Alright.  Okay.    You want to say Mr Thabethe?    Yes, yes    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Of - of course if they had - if Estina had borrowed money in order to be able to carry out its oblig ations of making acontribution into the project that might not help it if it got that money on the basis of the fact that it was going to get this money that would come from the project. It - it would help it in terms of its financial position when we look at whether it was the type of entity with which the departmentshould have entered into an agreement involving such big amounts.     You accept that?    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Huh-uh.   Huh-uh.    I had raised earlier and much - even much earlier in terms of Estina if in terms of fina nces it really had R16,00 in its bank account at the time when it concluded an agreement in terms of which it was supposed to inject millions of Rands into the project.  That suggests that they were not the type of company - entity that should have been in - been involved - with which the department should have been involved in such a project and I am saying it seemsto me that even if they were - even if the position was to be that they had borrowed money in order to carry out those obligations provided the position is that they had borrowed that money on the strength of the money that they were going to get out of the project from the department that should not change their position.  The - the same concern would remain unlike if maybe they had loss of properties and so on and so they - they got money.  They got a loan from the bank on the basis of their property portfolio for example.  You know.    But if they went to the bank and said please lend us RX million and the bank said how are you going to pay it back.  They said look - look at this agreement.  We have signed with the Department of Agriculture.  We are going to be getting a lot of money.  So we will be able to pay you back.  That would not help them.  That is what I am suggesting.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  You …     You said you - you are comfortable …     In that context?    And you accept that that does not address the earlier concern that we talked about?     That is just a separate concern/issue?     Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    So in other words they were using money given tothem for one purpose …     For another purpose?    But maybe using might not be …    The right term.    I am not sure but maybe, yes.   But you see Mr Thabethe you are dealing with a different question that she did not ask.     I think the question she is asking is what you may do or what may be done …    With money before there is a proper feasibility study.  So she is saying why allow that to happen.  Why allow Estina to takethe money and put it into another account?  Such a lot of money.  When actually you do not even know what the feasibilit y study will say.  That is what she is asking you.    Yes.    Because you are putting it at risk now.     And what was the rush Mr  Thabethe?  Why not do thestudy - a further study finish properly and then start involving mo re money?  What was the rush about?     Yes, but then …     Why do you not wait until the - a final feasibility study is done?  You see what outcome it gives you …     And then you proceed properly.    Why was it not done?  That is my question.     But you were the HOD.    You - you were in charge.  I mean you could - you were -you were the HOD.  You were in charge.  You were the Accounting Officer.    You knew that if anything went wrong with the taxpayers’ money …     You would have to answer …    Ja, but what - what will - if - even if you are convinced is it not the right thing to get the paperwork first right - get the paperwork right and then start?    So why - why start before - before that - that stage is done?    Yes, okay.    But your contract I take it did not require you or entitle you not to do things the right way.     Yes and doing the feasibility study first.  Finishing it, seeing what the outcome is before engaging in certain expensive aspects of the project would be the right way.  Is it not?     Yes.  Ms Gcabashe I - I leave it at that.  You - you had your own angle.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Hm.    Well I - I do not know if - if that addresses the - the real issue that Ms  Gcabashe is - is drawing your attention to.    She is saying the explanation you give for havingdone things the wrong way - the wrong way in terms of my discussion with you.  The correct way would have been to do the feasibility study.  Have a final feasibility study.  See the outcome and then start things.  You said well there were certain constraints placed upon you by your    With the MEC or premier whoever it was.  So she is saying but that could not have been the reason.     Do you accept that?    You accept that.  Ja.    So then the - the next question is that if you accept that there could not have been any constraints on your contract tha tjustified you doing things not in the correct way.  What then was the reason for the rush if it was not the contract because you were suggesting it was your contract?  Now you accept that it was not your contract.  So what then was the reason for the rush ?    Hm, but when you - when - did you not want to be seen delivering in the correct way by doing things the right way?    Well if you still felt - if you - if you accepted that    Then I want to suggest to you that you should only have started doing something before the - the final feasibility study w as completed if there was some special reason.  Otherwise you just wait for the outcome of the feasibility study.  Then you - you continue.  So but if you say there was really nothing then it seems to me that you may have done things the wrong way for no r eason really.    Okay.  No.  Let us go back.  There is - there is the correct way of doing things and there is a wrong way of doing things.     Okay.    And I thought you and I agree that if in order to embark on a project it is necessary to do a feasibility study …     The right way of doing things is to do the feasibility study first - first.  A final one if you want to call that.    See that it is outcome is before you start the project …    Or you incur a lot of expenses.  We agree so far? MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Yes, so far.    Yes.    Yes.    But you - you accept that normally the best thing would be to get everything in order in terms of the study.  Understand everything and see exactly what yo u need to be careful about before you - you move ahead but you are saying that well the preliminary study gave you what you needed in terms of the - the approval to say you can go ahead with this …    But you - the final study was going to give you some details …    That you needed?MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Ms Gcabashe.    I see we are past 4 o’ clock.    But may - maybe - I thought we would stop at four because more or less our plan is that Mr Thabethe would come back but we could - we could go up to half past if it is - if - if that is necessary to complete whatever you want.  I am - I do not have a problem.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Okay.    No that is fine.  We - we are going to adjourn Mr Thabethe.  We have not finished and we are adjourning in circumstances where I am not an nouncing now when you must come back but I think Counsel will see me after this and there will be a discussion about when you must come back but it will - it will not takelong before you come back. So your - your Counsel will - will let you know what date  we have talked about and then if necessary the Commission can send written notification of what the date is afterwards.     Is that fine?  Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm, hm.   And were - were in September …     In terms of what we were talking about? ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Oh, okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.   So - so in other words the point being there could not have been the comfort that he says the preliminary report study - feasibility study would have given him - could not have given him because it was not there at the time.  That is the point.     Yes.    Yes.   Yes, okay.    Yes.  That is what I was talking about.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Okay.  Okay, alright.  Alright we will adjourn then and then we will talk about dates just now.  We adjourn.
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning DCJ.    We are ready DCJ.    DCJ I thought I should just place onrecord that…    After your enquiry yesterday regarding local dairy companies and the contact that was made with them our investigators have tried to work on that overnight.     And have been able to find two documents.  One appears to be a report – a feasibility study.  As soon as that comes to hand – a hard copy comes to hand I will make sure that my colleague Mr Buthelezi gets a copy.    Of that document.    So that Mr Thabethe can look at it.     As I understand matters Mr Thabethe has  in any event requested that he prepares a supplementary affidavit.     He may wish to deal with those matters.    And whatever else in that affidavit.     Thank you DCJ.    In relation to the questions Mr Thabethe good morning again.    We were yesterday going through your annexures.  The annexures to your 2017 affidavit.  Those are to befound in Exhibit HH10 Volume B.  And that is the volume that starts with your 2017 affidavit and then has tabs where all the annexures ought to be.    Are you good with that?  Thank you.  TheDCJ will have to hear whether you are comfortable with what I have said or not.    Thank you Mr Thabethe.  We were dealing with Annexure 6 if you go to Tab 6.  And it is a report that we have actually dealt with largely in your  previous evidence.  I would just likeyou to deal with one small aspect that I do not believe we have touched on and that you will find on page 316 under Processing Plant.  The reason of that I have a great interest as a – the evidence leader in the processing plant of course you know is because that is money that    Yes.  Now this state of the art ISO9001/2000 and HACCP certified facility that they were going to put up you mention it in that report in the very last paragraph.     Can you maybe we are not as technically inclined as you are can you just explain what exactly they were supposed to put up because this is what you were expecting from them. This certified facility.    So it is a certificate that says that they have the capacity and capability to do processing at the level at which you had specked was specified the processing pl ant?   Thank you.  It helps.  Because we will later on deal with what exactly they did then put up and we will come back to this.    And your knowledge on this.  MPT7 which is the next annexure we have dealt with.  Because of the presentation that we have just spoken about the MPT the annexure 6 you then were able to secure resolution from the Provincial cabinet.  MPT8 the next tab, annexure 8 we have not received.  This is the invitation letter that you would have received – I beg your pardon – you would have sent to the CEO of Paras.  If you go to paragraph 12 of your affidavit MPT8 isdealt with there.  So if you go to paragraph 12 just same document – same document.      Same file – his affidavit, same file.   The same file just the beginning Chairman.  And we go to page 247 of the same file.  You mention here that you invited the CEO of Paras by way of a letter.     All I am saying is we do not have that.  Ido not know if you want to add anything at all but I am saying I do not know if you still have a copy of that letter.  It is not in the file.      Then 9 if you go to Tab 9 that is the original project proposal by Estina dated the 15 May 2012. We have dealt with that.    In our previous hearings.    At the end of that you have annexed the deviation – what we have been callin g the deviation memorandum.  Again it is something we have dealt with.  And that deviation memorandum would have been MPT9.  Okay?  It is just at the end after 8 comes 9.    And you will find it there.  We have dealt with that – that issue.    We then move onto 10 which is theacceptance of the proposal.  You have again dealt with that.     In your evidence.    And the only point I want to confirm withyou is that though you mention a partnership agreement in paragraph 2 of this letter you have explained that you had not intended to establish a PPP.  That is my understanding of your evidence.     What I will actually …    Do is read.    Read the sentence.    Chairman.    And the only reason I ask for confirmationis because this paragraph 2 mentions a partnership agreement.  Just to make sure that we are on the same page.  Thank you.     Thank you Chairman.  We then go to 11 – Annexure 11. We did not receive that.  It  refers to the verification ofaccount details and this verification was supposed to be done by the Provincial Treasury.  Again I do not think much turns on that.  We will deal with matters relating to the Provincial Treasury when the Treasury witness or witnesses come in.  MPT12 is the agreement of the 7 July it is also called the Agreement of the 5 July.  We have traversed much of the content of this agreement previously.  There are just a couple of things that we had not looked at in that agreement which  I would like you to just give a short explanation on.  The first is – so if you go to 12 which is the agreement.    And you look at Note 11.2 or Clause 11.2.  The heading there is Intellectual – Ownership of Intellectual Property.  And what I understand you to have agreed with Estina here is they must and I underline the word must return without delay to the department all materials in their possession which belonged to the department.  Most importantly is the next bit.   “Regardless of whether or not such materials were originally supplied by the department to Estina.” You are comfortable with that?     And there is no further explanation that your understanding is the same.  Estina had to give everything back to you.    Hm.  CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chairman.    We have dealt with 11.  Can you please    You see I ask the question because we have had discussions around transfer payments.     1. We have had discussions around the how the PMFA gives effect to Section 217 of The Constitution.  2. We have had discussions around the Treasury regulations and how those too of course give effect ultimately to Section 217.     My understanding of your evidence has been that the transfer payment – well first monies that were paid to Estina were transfer payments?     How were you going to account for those transfer payments within the framework of the Public Finance Management Act that is all I am asking you to explain?  You may have done so before but…    If you could just go over it.   Can you just take us through the particular portions that you think are d irectly relevant to this?     Can – can…    Can you then explain your essential understanding of how you would be holding Estina to account with the PFMA in your hand?  And the reason I ask this is because I do not knowif I should just bring it forward rather than leave it where it is.  There is an Auditor General report.    That speaks to monitoring etcetera.  Can I deal with it where I have put it?  It somewhere towards the end?     So I have understood from the Auditor General report which we will look at.     That there is a monitoring mechanism.  Ijust thought you might be able to talk us through that monitoring mechanism?     Thank you.  I know I can explore that further with different examples but I am – I am – I understand what yousaying.  Can we then look at Clause 15.3?  15.3 is part of the termination set of clauses and it is – it is a bit of a tricky one when you look at the proviso which is the last two lines of that paragraph.  Maybe again it is useful Chairman just to read the whole provision in because it is going to come up again.    In relation to the FDC.    Mr Thabethe would you like to read that into the record please?    No Sir.  15.3 on page 349.    Correct.    So my question is, can you just clarify what the services delivered would be in the same sentence?   “So Estina shall be entitled to payment in full for the services delivered.”  What are those services?     The reason I have been struggling with this since you started giving evidence is because we know that Estina was appointed as both an implementing agent and a management    Now nobody goes into an arrangement without there be some commercial value for them.  And I have been grappling with how they were paid either as implementing agent – was there a fixed fee?  Or as the management agent.  Can I maybe give you the example of FDC which seems a little easier for certainly for me?    Because with the FDC there appears to be a fixed contract price and I – you will talk about it later.  I have assumed that that price was the – the payment for being animplementing agent.  Then they sub-contracted to E’tsho Civils who were being paid a separate amount and I have assumed – I will – all subject to what you will be telling us later that that payment would then be for the managing agent part of things.  So the FDC arrangement is a little easier for me to understand.  I cannot quite grasp the same differentiation between implementing agents and how they are paid here?  Can you help me with that?     For work done?    Or for items procured?    You see Mr Thabethe I really just want to debate this for a bit and I suppose I also have the shareholding structure in mind where originally you had 49% going to Estin a and 51%of the original Zaina[?] if you remember which was then going to become Mohoma Mobung.    Going to the beneficiaries.    So there Estina would be a shareholder and I can see the commercial benefit for them as equity holders they would be getting payment of some kind.  That shareholding did not come into this agreement did it?     So I beg your pardon were you going tocontinue?    You finished?    So what was in it for Estina here?  You know in Johannesburg it is – when I got here it is an expression I learnt what is in it for me.  What was in – what value was Estina going to get out of its association with this project?   Were they happy just to assist and not get anything at all?    I do not know explain to me.    But I thought you said that arrangement was not carried forward in to the new July agreement.     Now when you started this was supposed to be a two year project, am I correct when this started it was supposed to be completed in about two years?     What – three year project.  Okay.    So you are saying Estina was happy towait until year three before it reaped any real benefits from the project because that is when you would bring them into the shareholding?     Is that – was that the arrangement?     Was that arrangement written anywhere?     Did you share the opinion of the State Attorney with them and tell them why they would have to wait the three years before they became shareholders?     And the fact that they started putting money into the project is confirmation of the fact that they - I am just trying to understand what you saying - is confirmed - was confirmation to you that they understood the terms?     I am going to explore with you a little later when we look at the monthly and the quarterly reports …     And a line item that says Directors fees.    So we will talk about those.  You can think about it and I will show you the line item and in the context of this discussion …    I will then ask you to explain what those Directors fees might be.    I have now understood 15.3 for services delivered but strictly and it is the next one that I wanted us to look at isinvoices.  I think somewhere here we talk - you talk about invoices must be presented at - on a regular basis.  In fact it was 13.5.  We dealt with invoices.  If you just go a page back.     Yes.  So those services deliver ed youcould easily assess because you would have an invoice …     That backed up the services that they were claiming for?    I am good.  If we then look at Clause 1 -9 -    It is part of your monitoring as I  understand it.    Were you able to give effect to this clause?  Were you able to put it into operation?     We are going to be talking about the feasibility study.  Remember in Phase 1 …     We dealt with October  2012 the feasibility study was conducted and completed …     And they were able to show you the - and we have a - a feasibility study here in the bundle of documents.     There are people who conducted that feasibility study.    So I would want to know and it is a group of people who are - from my recollection not South African.  So I would want to know from you whether 19.2 would have been applicable to those particular people conducting the feasibility study.  So aga in youmay want to reflect on that and when we get to the specific example say to me oh I know these people. I signed off on them coming in.  There gateway invoices I am going to be presenting to you and you say oh I know these people.  I signed off on them giving us particular or giving the - the - Estinacertain items even though they were subcontracted.  Okay.     So that is my interest in 19.2.  I just want you to bear it in mind when we get to looking at those invoices.    Good.    But the principle of the matter is in terms of 19.2 subcontractors had to be vetted by the depa rtment?    That is the principle …    That is recorded here.  Implementation Mr Thabethe is what we always come back to at the end  of the day.  So it will be implementation.  How did we implement 19.2?     Ja.  We then look at just one aspect; no let us look at MPT13 which is the presentation you made to D -A-F-F to DAFF the National Department.  So it is 13 - flag 13.    I am Chairman.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chairman.     Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chairman.    It has given me the opportunity to just go back to two issues in the sam e agreement.   With your leave.        If we just very briefly go back to page 338 it’s still the agreement but what I’m looking at is clause 1.2 page338, 1.2 gives us the address of Estina, Block A, first progress in which 144 Catherine Street, Sandton, the question is were you aware at the time that 144 Catherine Street, Sandton, that address is the address of a number of entities that are associated with the Gupta ente rprises?        And the relation between Estina and in  Particular Kamal Vasram and the Gupta enterprises, I’ll put it as generally as that, was not clear at that time?        Mr Thabethe then the last question on the agreement is clause 10, confidentiality it’s on page 346.  When the National Treasury investigators from ENS tried to have a discussion with Mr Kamal Vasram who was the sole director at the time of Estina, when the ENS investigators and the National Treasury investigators tried to talk to Mr Vasram about this agreement, about the relationship between Estina and the department, your department, Mr Vasram refused to speak with them because he relied on this confidentiality clause as I understand matters.  He said at the time that h e had to getpermission from you.  Do you recall him ever coming back to you to say to you, there are these particular people from National Treasury who want to speak to me, can you release me from clause 10 of our agreement?        Yes my junior has just pointed me to correspondence from Mr Vasram on this issue and maybe for your information it might be useful just to read what his response was.         He is writing this letter to a Miss Jacobs and he copies Mr Thele who you know came to give evidence here on some of these matters and he says, “We strongly object to the content of your mail which seems  toimply that we are deliberately not cooperating with you.  At  the outset please note that we have already  communicated to you that we do not consider it prudent to  respond to your request in the absence of an approval from  the department to do so.  This is in line with theconfidentially clause in the agreement, signed with thedepartment which can be verified with the department.  Yourcontinued insistence on breaking protocol appears t o bemotivated by an agenda that we do not understand and underthe circumstances, anything we say will probably bemisconstrued.  All the relevant documentation and information in relation to this project is available with the department andif there are any gaps in the information we are more thanwilling to assist you, provided that this is done with the activeparticipation of department officials.  This is an inter - departmental matter which in which our participation in any form, if warranted can only be initiated in the presence ofdepartment officials or at the very least with their approval,best regards, Kamal Vasram”.So hence the question, my understanding of the report of Mr Tele and Co. was that you did not release Vasram from this confidentiality clause.      Well the report – just to tidy this issue up, the report that was prepared by those investigators is in the reports bundle Chairman at page 34 you may wish to look at it later and this isbundle B – reports bundle B, it’s under the – it’s under witness interviews…(intervenes).        Chairman if – with your leave I’ll simply read this into the record.        Thank you and it reads – if you’d like to I don’t mind waiting for you to find it….[intervenes].       Reports bundle and it should be B, little b and it’s in b and the page is 34 and the paragraph is paragraph 2.3 it deals with witness interviews.         2.3.1 as you can see Mr Thabethe says, “After our first interview with Mr Thabethe we approachedEstina’s director, Mr Kamal Vasram to discuss the project withhim.  Mr Vasram is Estina’s only director.  Mr Vasram wouldnot agree to an interview with ENS and stated that Estina was bound to confidentiality in terms of the agreement signed withthe department.  We requested that Mr Vasram produce theagreement giving rise to his duty of confidentiality.  MrVasram ignored our request and we were no t provided with acopy of the agreement.  2.3.2, at our second interview with Mr Thabethe we requested him to waive confidentiality andfacilitate a meeting between ENS and Mr Vasram. This is heimportant part please Mr Thabethe, Mr Thabethe refused to assist ENS and stated that we should conduct our owninvestigation without his assistance.  Mr Thabethe stated thathe was in contact with Mr Vasram and that he was aware thatMr Vasram refused to meet with us.  He was neverthelessunwilling to facilitate a meeting between ENS and Estina. Thereafter ENS again requested an interview with Mr Vasrambut he refused to attend an interview.  As a result, we were not able to interview Mr Vasram/Estina in this investigation toobtain their perspective an d explanations regarding theproject.  The correspondence between ENS and Mr Vasram isattached as exhibit 18”,That’s the correspondence I read to you.  What’s your final comment maybe on this, I know we’ve dealt with it previously but just having given it, at least context in terms of the agreement?       To the investigators number one.          Number two, these are investigators that are doing work for National Treasury you are part of the same      Why did you have reserv ations about allowing National Treasury to speak to Estina who, at the end of the day, was an implementing agent or was about to be an implementing agent handling funds that, essentially come from the same National Treasury?          Page 346 Chairman and it’s the confidentiality clause which says, “Estina will not, during the term of this agreement andthereafter without the prior written consent of the department, disclose any confidential information relating to the department and the project to anyone other that those persons who are connected to the department and/or Estina and who are required to have access to such…[intervenes].       Chair, maybe just two questions and really Mr Thabethe it’s – they were not investigating Estina as a private company they were asking to investigate the project that you and Estina were partnering in, I’ll use that wo rd very loosely, partnering in.You were satisfied that, that was all they were really asking to investigate?         The second thing is I can’t quite understand the nature of the con fidential information that you sought toprotect under this clause, maybe that will help us understand your attitude?  What is the nature of the confidential information you thought needed to be protected and this is why you were refusing access to Estina without your being there?     It will be small b.  Yes and page 249please.    They are filed back to front in a sense Chairman so I will just help you navigate through – through those.    As to what they were trying to investigate.     Thank you Chairman.  You recall MrThabethe that we showed you documents that indicated that Estina was a commercial company IT company.  It operated in that space.     And they reflect Mr Thabethe’s attitude.     Explaining his position.    Okay.  So that is what that email dated the 1 December communicates.    No.  I think I will let him deal with the issue he would like to raise Chairman.     Thank you Chairman.  I just want to put the second proposition.    So the first one related to the email of1 December 2013 Mr Thabethe and what is recorded here is that you said that Mr Vasram was not willing to speak to the investigators.  You have denied this?    The second proposition is there is the email dated 5 December from Mr Vasram to the investigator Ms  Jacobs    It is an email Chairman from Mr  Vasram.    It is on page 2-4-9.    It is dated 5 December.    It is to Ms Jacobs …    And it is copied again to Mr  (indistinct)and Mr Barnard …    And Mr Vasram writes that and I am just reading the last sentence which is - sentence which is the most relevant.    That   And it is the very last …     Three words.    He was prepared to talk to them …     As long as Mr Thabethe approved …    The interview.    They - they do not speak …     To the issue of intellectual property …     At all.    They simply speak to the approval which is what …    Clause 10 deals with.    If you give us permission.    I suppose my closing comment is you  - you actually went with the ENS investigators to the farm in October 2013.  That is correct.  Is it not?     The date is not important.    The important fact is you accompanied them to the Vrede Dairy Farm on a site visit.     Page …    Page 48 of the Reports Bundle.  Hopeful ly it is the same one you have.  It should be the same …     But just go to page 48 - paginated page48.    B.  Reports Bundle B.  That is where  the emails were.    Yes.    (Intervenes).    No, no.  That is - you are trying to find Reports Bundle.  Reports Bundle.    Thank you.    No.  4-8 - 48.    And it is just that very first line at clause or paragraph 6.1.1. “In October 2013 ENS visited the Vrede Dairy Project site accompanied by Mr  Thabethe.”You cannot recall that visit?  Very first sentence at 6.1.1.     Well I do not think that the investigators would put a fact into a report …     They have prepared for National Treasury if that would be fact especially something like going to on a site visit.     Would not be verifiable or - or correct.  If you go to page 51 of the same report.  They actually conclude - 5-1 -    I do not know if you want to comment on that.    Mr Thabethe if I - my recollection - mymemory serves me well.  At - when we postponed this matter we gave you a file that had the ENS Report …     Because you had indicated that you did not really have access to it.  You may want to read it again and look at some of the issues that they raise and - and deal with those because I think you are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum in relation to what was provided, what permissions were granted or not granted and what progress this investigation could make in the given circumstances.     Pursue this particular point …    Any - any further.    I would like to move onto the next …     Aspect.  Mr Thabethe we are back at your annexures to the 2017 affidavit and so that is HHB.  Yes.  You have gotthe right document there.    If you look at flag number 13 - 1-3.  That is a report - a presentation actually that you made to the Nati onal Office - the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries - Forestry and Fisheries.  Is that correct?     And when would you have made this presentation?    Can you recall?    Just the period because my assumption is    Conditional funding.    So just give us ballpark …     Dates.    I - I would suggest that it is probably the latter because if you go and look at page 3 -7-3 and 3-7-4.  It would appear especially at 3-7-4 that you are setting out the additionalfunding …    Required in the current financial year.     What I found interesting was that the feasibility study substantially reflects the same information that is in this presentation.  Now the feasibility study was completed at the end of October 2012.    My question is which document informed the content of the other?  Did the feasibility study inform the conte nt of this document or did this document possibly inform the content of the feasibility study?   Now just to - to get absolute clarity on this the big feasibility study is the one that you signed off on when you signed off on the Phase 1 milestones that had been completed.  Is that correct?    I am sorry. I just want to understand your answer.  Are you saying the first 30 million that was paid was for purposes of doing the prefeasibility study or the larger piece of work?     Huh-uh.   And that is why the larger was part of Phase 1?    Because that would be consistent with what you have said before that your understanding …     Of the 30 million …    Because it was supposed to cover Phase1?    Okay.  Can I very briefly take you through Mr Dawie Marais’ report which we have also f urnished you with.    The bundle Chairman is Report’s Bundle B.    And the first page will be page 2-8-8.    It is paragraph 1.4 Chairman.    Page one - the cover page is …    Report Bundle B Chairman.    The cover page is page 2-8-4 - the cover page …    Would be 2-8-4.   2-8-5 is the next one.    It is in fact - it is paragraph 1.4.  That is where I want to start Chair.    And here he - he comments on location essentially and the - the essential point made about location was that this was a rather arid part of the country.  It has never been dairy milk cow farming territory.  He speaks to the coast - the midlands really being perfect for - for dairy farming and then he goes into the numberof producers who have shutdown. I do not know - I know you read the - the document.  You may just want to give us a comment on - on what Mr Marais’ issues are with - with regard to location.    Yes.    No.  1 067 was correct.    Of course Mr Thabethe Mr Marais does    I just wanted you to factor that into your answer or to take into considera tion.    Today, ja.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   Hm.        Yes, continue, I am trying to give you the opportunity Mr Thabethe to deal with the issues including the second question, because ...[intervenes]         His figures are correct?         But you admit that by 2013 there had been a substantial decline?         In the Free State.        Yes I really, I am just trying to move on.     Mr Thabethe of course the issue of water I am still dealing with the location.      And then you talked about rainfall patterns etcetera, that is not arid.  Water is critical to running a dairy farm you will agree with that?     Thank you Chairman. Mr Thabethe my next question is one where I have tried to collect a few things from theMaree Report.  So Mr Maree also questions the irrigation and mechanisation cost, the rain fed mechanisation cost, the cost of cattle and the cost of the bulk cooling tanks, the dairy products manufacturing plant and pasteuriser, the annual feed plant and grain old seed mill.  You will find this at Table 5 on page 295 of the same documen t that isReports B.  So my question to you is you have now read those observations made by Maree.  Did you interrogate the costing in the same manner that he did when you were given this – the feasibility study, the business plan?     So are you – are you saying that when the feasibility study was done, when the business plan was done, the ones that were submitted to you.    You know that is a bit strange because wehad the evidence of the Mr Basson who said he has a number of tractors belonging to the department that are parked in his yard – on his premises.  Now if you have got departmental stock a nd that is in Vrede.    That is what I was trying to explore at the time.    Is this the preliminary?     Yes the A has been chopped.    So that is 16A.  The next one Chairman is 16B.    Those are the ones I want to deal with right now.  You mention them at paragraph 18 of your affidavit.  So ifwe go to the front again give us context?     Chairman it is a record of payments that were made to Estina.    Okay.  Of course we have agreed that the first R30 million that was paid in July 2012 is not recorded here?    Yes.  So you knew that the money had been paid but because nobody could give you the receipts.     You were reluctant to deal with the amount?   Okay.  But we …    Yes.  So…CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chairman.    If – so in a financial year 2013/2014 if you look at that schedule at 18 – at paragraph 18 the amounts were R34 950 000.00.  You have got it there.    So you report against the project not against the implementing agent?     I understand.  My - my …    Yes.    Yes and that is where I - I just want to spend a little bit of time because one of the things the Chairman is enjoying to do is make recommendations on how to improve syste ms that are in place.  Systems that are not as clear as they might be if a different modality was adopted …    And this is why I debate this with you because at least you have some knowledge of - of these matters.    Yes Mr Thabethe but as the HOD - you are the Accounting Officer for everything - finances - for absolutely everything.  So your team - you have got people who report into you who explain things to you.  It does not matter which division they may sit in.  Yours is to at least have a - a strategic overview of what is going on in the department.   So you - money is important.  You will have a very close relationship with the CFO.  Am I right?     But this is a simple proposition because this table that very first table accords with what you have put inparagraphs 18 and 19 of your affidavit.  We - we agreed on that earlier?    That the total amount spent between April 2013 and March 2014 was R113 905 000,00.    Ja.  So I mean there is no - there is no rocket science thinking that goes into this.  You know that that is definitely correct.  Yes.  That number is correct.  I am just starting at the easy thing.   Yes.    Yes.    No and the reason I say they do not need somebody who is a specialist in finance is because as a lawyer I wasable to read this and understand exactly what is required and I have no financial background at all …     And I have never been a Head of Department.  So I am challenging you to help me work this through this. From my position of never having been a Head of Department.  Let us go Mr …    Thabethe.    Yes.    That is exactly …     Absolutely Chairman …     Because I think it just makes it much clearer.    Irrespective of where that record sits.     Whether it is in your annual financial statements, in your strategic plans.     The same explanation.  As I un derstand what that paragraph that I read into the record requires.  You really - it is - it is asking for transparency.    Quite frankly.  It - so that we know exactlywho is handling the funds a nd - and I was actually going to suggest that it could even be Estina/Vrede Dairy.  So that your needs are catered for as the department.  You know that that is the project …     But we must know the implementing agent that is handling that money …     Because when the issue of monitoring the spending on such transfers arises and that is line one, two, three, four in the middle of the same paragraph.  One then interrogates how themonitoring of the spending of these monies was conducted.  So we are talking - it is implementation. We are really talking about how the department implemented the obligations that arose in relation to the dairy farm and accounting to the public for the monies that had been dispersed.  You have understood …     That - that line of thinking anyway?     It - it is.  Chairman I must say that where we got this from it came to us in this format …     But I asked one of our investigators …     To print the entire document …     For me …   Because I wanted to be sure …     when I say the AG.     And I must say that it is sitting on my desk.  I looked at it …     But in the rush to get here this morning …     And I really knew that this issue might arise …   Which is why I know …     I have the - I can actually …    If it is important Mr Thabethe …    When we adjourn we can go across the road and I will give you - it is actually quite a thick document.     I could give that to you.    Can I suggest to you that it did go through your hands and that - that is the precise question …     I was going to ask you.  In relation to these empty columns …    Because not only type of organisation is empty.  You have not - there is no entry - there is no entry here …    And my assumption is the department did not supply that information but there may have been an explanat ion for that …    And then the column that says amount spent by the entity …   Again does not have an - an entry and I am sure you would have had that am ount …    Readily available.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   So that you could account for it …     In all the records that you need to prepare prior to the AG being given information.     In - indeed so.  I am coming to that.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE   I was surprised but pleasantly surprised.  I have got - I have actually - I have got it.  Do not worry.  I am - I am very fair Mr Thabethe.    I made a note of that.    Yes.  Of that opinion.  You are quite correct about that but we are going to get to it in a minute.  In fact …     It is the very next document we are looking at …     Chairman.    Unfortunately yes Chairman.    No.    But - yes in fact can I just go a step back because I have now found the - the other document that I was looking for and it is really just to corroborate in a sense …     What you had put in your paragraph 18.  Now these - if I can ask you to look at Reference Bundle D for Donald and the page there is 1 -4-5-2.  D - Reference Bundle D and it istowards the back.  Reference Bundle D …     The page is 1-4-5-2 Chairman.  Towards the back Mr Thabethe.  Page 1-4-5-2.  I am at the same time still looking at paragraph 18 of your affidavit which is on page 2 -4-9 of HH10B and all I am saying Mr  Thabethe is that when I look at the figures you put out …    In paragraph 8 you will find the very samefigures in Reference Bundle B page 1-4-5-2.    Save that that first 30 millio n that we have agreed …    On 18 April 2013 it receive another R34 950 000,00.  On 26 April 2013 it received R30 million.  On 3 May 2013 it received 19 050 000.  On 20 December 2013 it received the amount of 29 950 000.  Then on 25 July 2014 just before you cancelled that contract.    They received 30 million.   After cancellation on 8 May 2015 they were paid 60 million and the last payment they received was on 5 May 2016 and that was R46 252 652,00.  The total that was disbursed is there.    280 200-and - I beg your pardon.    It is - it is big money to some of us.    DCJ.    And …    No and I was doing so well with all theothers.  You know DCJ.  It is because I have been looking at them for so long but now I go back to my old style of knowing.  I - I handle thousands.  I do not have to live - but let us go back to - thanks DCJ.  R280 202 652,00.    So essentially R280 million is what they were paid.  That is the number I want you to lock in your head.     Because we will be coming back to talk about it …   And - and the reason I produce this particular document is just to compare it to what you had produced and say you are spot on save for that little error at the beginning.  Otherwise you are quite correct …    About what you had disclosed at the time.     I think if we just finish off with these annexures - I am trying to get them out of the way.   Chairman.    Can I - it is a very simple answer.  No, no Mr Thabethe. You have read the quarterly and the monthly reports …     And you have seen the numbers that were submitted by Estina.    So the answer to the Chairman is Chairman you are wrong …    Because the quarterly and the monthly reports reflect a differen t version.    So Chairman …     Correct Chairman.   When we get to the monthly and quarterly reports which I am hoping we can still get to today Chairman.     We will see the reports from Estina where they say we have put in 250  000.  We have put in 3.6 million.    This is what they say …    But it is all in the …     Documentation …CHAIRPERSON   That was presented …    As per the agreement to the Head of Department or to the department maybe not to the head …     And we will go - go there.    At the end …     Of the day you really want to know compared to the - so they were supposed to put in 228 million.     For the processing plant.    We are talking you there Chair.    We are talking you to a valuation of the …     Processing plant …    That was done in 2017 …     And then we are comparing …     I - I think …    Once we show Mr - it is unclear - Mr …    Thabethe the evidence that is in those quarterly reports …     We would like an explanation …     On why the last two payments were made after the contract was …     Was cancelled …    Because those were claims in terms of that Clause 15.3 I referred to earlier …     But whether they were justifiable claims only Mr Thabethe possibly can help us.    Exactly Chairman.  Oh, sorry.    But that is where we are going.    It is called round tripping.   I have learned a lot Chairman.    There is a term for it.    It is called round tripping.    You pay and then they round trip it.  It comes back.    Your money.    Then they say we are money into the    But Mr Thabethe is going to assist us …     Because we can only speculate.    Really on the basis of documents that …     That are available …    But I think it will be fair to ask him to helpus …    Analyse what we can.    Thank you Chairman.  Mr  Thabethe let us just get rid of these annexures very quickly.  We are almost done with it.  We are now looking at - with …    Just for a minute Chairman.  I - to your left possibly because I can see on your right you have got other files orthe other way.    From where I am sitting.    To your …CHAIRPERSON   To your - please put it on your right.    Yes.    I am.  I will admit very quickly.  Do not ask me left or right hand.  I have got to think or turn right.  I - I have to think Chairman.    But they say creative people Chairman.  I like that.  That is a (intervenes).     So we are back to the annexures Chairman simply because I think I would like to get this file out of the way as - as soon as we can.  So we have been dealing with 18 and - and …    We are going there Chairman.    Exactly.CHAIRPERSON   Yes sir.  If - if - Chairman if you really want to go there immediately if you give me a five minute adjournment I will find the spot in my questions and we can actually deal with that immediately because I have got the …     Chairman I - I literally just need two minutes to collect - to …   Just to find - let us look at those monthly …    Monthly reports.  If you just give me two minutes to pull out the right documentatio n.    And let us do that.  Thank you.  Thank you sir.       Chairman so we are dealing with reference Bundle D for Donald, reference Bundle D, and I think that is probably going to take us at least an hour Chairman, I doubt we are going to use any of the others, but it is Reference Bundle D that has the monthly and the quarterly reports.         And the page number Chairman is 1398, Mr Thabethe page 1398 is where it starts, and I am hoping that these are semi-familiar Mr Thabethe because this report or thesereports, because there are a number of them were submitted in terms of that 7 t h of July agreement, it’s part of how you implemented that agreement, it is one of the ways in which you monitored th e spend that you had transferred to Estina, okay.         So the first one we’re looking at is September 30 2012, and in the background paragraph just to touch on what is set out there they r eally say that the project was initiated on the 5 t h of July 2012.  Okay Mr Thabethe?         We know of course that that’s the date on which you signed the agreement, and that’s what they are calling th e initiation.  The first phase obligations that are set out on that same page I – we have dealt with, these are the ones that the Chairman interrogated, I interrogated and you will them, I just want us to get aclearer copy, if we go to page 1378 of the sa me document, the same file, 1378.   And again you will find this looks familiar Mr Thabethe, those were the phase one obligations that we interrogated a while back with you.        The same obligations which appear in the agreement if you keep your finger on 1378 are the ones which are in this red print and that are not particularly clear.  If you turn the page there’s an explanation on the project, I am going to the third paragraph there, which says that Estina is awaiting the signing of a leaseagreement for the said property and an official handover of said property to enable them to commence work on the project.  Do you see that?        I am reading from 1399 Chairman, my apologies, it is 1399 now Chairman, and it is the third paragraph.         And I will read the fourth paragraph,  “Estina would like to make the Department aware th at all its obligations can only commence from the date of officialhandover of the land to Estina.”  You were aware of this Mr Thabethe at the time, that they were waiting for the – this is the September report remember.         The lease was only signed on the 14 t hof December 2012.        So you were very much aware that between September and the signing of the lease in  December their view was they couldn’t do much?         Yes that is a different topic which I will also address with you at a later stage.   But I know that you wereinvolved in ensuring that that lease was signed.         In December of 2012.        Then the very last paragraph on page 1399 reads ...[intervenes]         Yes Mr Chairman?        Of the land Chairman.        And it is evidence that Mr Morreme gave at the hearing because he was at that point the Municipal Manager of Phumelela Municipality.         And this land is located, this farm is located, in fact it is all of Vrede plus at that municipality.         My colleague thinks yo u may be thinking of the handover of assets because you have been reading your documents, there’s also the FDC taking over at some point Chairman.         Chairman you are correct.        In fact it is the evidence of MrThabethe.        That there was a phase one and a phase two, am I correct Mr Thabethe?         And your evidence was phase one the milestones for phase one are the ones on page 1378.      It was rounded off at 114million for each year.     And I know that by the end of the discussion on this he had conceded that there were a few of them that had not been met.     And this is why what’s written in the pinkish/reddish colour is the environmental impact assessment, you will find it on that phase one schedule at 1378, the feasibility study, waterreticulation and then electricity connections and applications, that’s what is written just above the last paragraph.     Chairman then you have in that ...[intervenes]      So you are telling the Chairman that you set up a company, Zana Investments, you asked for a change of name to Mohama Mobung Diary Project Pty Limited.      Company the address of the registeredoffice again Mr Vasram’s Sunninghill address Chairman.      You then have directors.     The last document Chairman is just a CIPRO registration certificate which reads concerning Mohama Mobung Dairy Project Pty Limited and the r egistration number.  The above company has been registered in terms of Section 14 of the Companies Act 2008.  In accordance with the notice of incorporation the registration of the company takes effect on the 11 t h of October 2013.  In conjunction with this  certificate the Commission has not issued anothernotice contemplated in Section 12(3). So there is a legitimate company that was established called Mohama Mobung Pty Limited.     We now also have Mohama Mobung certainly by 2013.     Mr Frans Oupa Mokwena then hadnothing to do with any of this?     In fact you are correct, it is letter, you are correct.    The issue with her is that she is not a South African National, she is from Korea , so that complication means that you don’t have a BEE company holding the Estina – being the director of Estina, because she is from Korea, and if she was alsoholding the Mohama Mobung shares again your whole idea behind creating that BEE culture and doi ng things in terms of the BEE thinking falls apart, but I do not know what you recall of the facts as they related to these issues at the time.     Yes.    Hence my question.  Mohuma Mobung who remained the sole Directors of Mohuma Mobung to your knowledge?     You - you say it would.  Do you not recall what in fact happened during your term as HOD?     That is fine.  We - we will just check - do a check on CIPC to see what the status of Mohuma Mobung (Pty) Ltd is …    So next time we speak to you we can tell you.  Okay.    Do not worry Mr Thabethe.    No.  Do not worry.  I will only be speakingto things that happened up to April  2018 …    Because that is when you left the department.    The - the next few paragraphs really just speak to the project plan.  They say it is appended to this report.  The following paragraph confirms that the capital injection by Estina will be coming in Phase 2.    Conclusion - they just say again that lease agreement please could you have it signed.  So that is the September report.  The very first one that you received.  Do you recall receiving it?    That sounds ominous Mr  Thabethe only because there are - the very next report deals with monies  and how monies were - were spent and I would have thought that you would bekeeping a close eye on this mega project and the monies that would be spent.  It is a lot of money 500  000 put together the Estina and the departments. 500 million putting together the Estina and the department contributions but let us look at the next report.  October, the 31 s t 2012 on page 1-4-0-1.  Again paragraph 1 just again is an executive summary.  There they acknowledge that 30 million was received on 9 July 2012.  Paragraph 2 is interesting Chairman because this answers one of the questions you have asked.     They say that   At 1-4-0-3 Chair.    So it is cash flow position of Estina (Pty) Ltd from July 2012.    So Estina did not reflect any money it might have had.    Am I correct in what I am saying?    Then I am just look …    Chair to be …     To be fair to Mr Thabethe …    An explanation he has given …     To the Commission.    Is that his understanding was that Estina …    With project money.  Am I correct in what I recollect you saying?    So that is …    Possible explanation Chairman.    I am simply repeating what Mr …     Mr Thabethe had told you.    In - in Estina’s account Chairman.    Hm.   Or they are too embarrassed to put here Chairman as the balance on that account whichever Chairman …     Yes.    Mr Thabethe the - the difficulty with what you are saying is found in the very next line.  Grant received from DARD 30 million.  Total source of funding up to July  2012 R30 million.  Then we have under application of funds.  So far nothing to creditors. Then you have got a line that says reserved for parlour equipment R29  million …    And that is where I thought you differed    Because I understood your evidence to be that that 30 million was supposed to pay for Phase 1.     That was your explanation?     They took that 30 million.    Kept one million in this bank account.     Took 29 million out of circulation.  Did not use it.    Took it out and said they were  reserving it for parlour equipment.  Not buying parlour equipment.  Reserving it for parlour equipment and this is why I was hoping you would be able to explain to us how they justified that and yet at the same time they say to you we are having to put mo ney into Estina because - I beg your pardon - into the Vrede Dairy Project because you are not giving us money.Did you inter - my question really is did you interrogate this and say why are you putting money in?  We gave you 30 million …     On 9 July 2012?    You see Chairman and Mr  Thabethe my difficulty with what you are saying is this was your project.  It was notEstina’s Project.    It is a department project.    These are public funds.    You had not even received let alone approved the feasibility study …     At this point when they took the 29 millionand put it in a different account.  Why could you not say  to them bring it back?  We have not - we do not even know in terms of our feasibility issues what we will or will not be able to do.  So how do you start thinking of placing an order to manufacture anything when we - we have - we are not even out of the s tarting brackets yet.    You …    And can I add to that.  So my question was why did you not say it is our money.  Bring it b ack.    Chairman in fact I was simply going to draw a parallel with questions you asked at an earlier hearing.     When the CFO went to ask for the 30 million …    And wanted it on a Friday afternoon     At 3 o’ clock.    You asked similar questions.    Why the urgency.CHAIRPERSON   I do not know if you have seen the transcript or the evidence given by Ms  Anna Fourie.  She dealt with that aspect …    And the Chairman asked the same questions but the issue I want to raise is the following.  Your contract could not have been the reason that you were rushing this because the Executive Council was well aware that they only app roved the implementation of this project …    On 13 June 2012.  Now that was quite a way - three months into the new financial year.  Is that not correct?     Not only that Mr Thabethe.  The same Exco knew that you had hoped to allocate a budget of 114 million per annum to this project.  Am I correct?     The same Exco was well aware that you had to find 84 million for the remainder of this financial year.  Am Icorrect?    So they were aware of the constraints that you were operating under.    Thank you Chairman.  I just want clarity on one aspect.  Earlier on when we looked at the business plan and then we looked at the feasibility study did I understand you to say that that short business plan was in effect the feasibility study - the preliminary feasibility study that we are talking about?     Yes Chairman and I was …    Chairman I would prefer to stop now.  I just want to …     Place on record that the business plan that Mr Thabethe had identified as the preliminary …    Plan is the one in the Reports Bundle which we spoke of earlier today.    That runs from page 321 up to page 320 -330 …    And that it is Mr Thabethe from what you are saying is on the basis of this …     Very thin document I am holding up …     That you were prepared to rush this project?   Chair if we might adjourn.    That is …    Chairman …     Very briefly.  I am sorry to interrupt you …     But it is an important point my colleague has just pointed out to me.    That the date of that business plan …    The so called preliminary feasibility plan …    Is October 2012.    So I leave you with that so you can prepare for next time.    That we will interrogate that with you.     Thank you Chairman.    Hm.    This was actually July …     All the way through.  It is July, August, September …     But the money was - the first amount was paid in July …     But it is …     Yes and I misunderstood your question.  Sorry Chairman.    In September …    They started putting money in.    If that was - the first 250 000 and then …     Yes and the next 3.7 million.    They put in, in September and October.     I misunderstood your question. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Good morning.    Thank you.    Ja Chair I wanted just to interject.      If the Chair would allow me to make a statement regarding the discussion we had yesterday.     Ja Chair thank you very much.  Maybe Chair I need to come back and maybe the statement that I made might not have been appropriate regarding the issue of the media.    I am aware we made a debate yesterday.    Regarding the media.    Stopping the project.    Ja what I am saying maybe it might not have been appropriate to say it is the media that stopped theproject.    I think what is correct is that af ter the media article.    And during that period maybe two things that happened.  The one which I have referred yesterd ay which led to treasury doing an investigation. And the second one which was the media enquiry that was also made to Paras which also made them to – to be very reluctant to proceed because of the – of the status of the project because Paras was – is a multinational company.    So they get worried about the – the media.  So that is the issue not necessarily meaning that it is the media that stopped the project.    I think that is what I want to [indistinct].    That is correct Chair.    Ja Chair why we had included thatthose are the certification already they were having in their possessions.  Those are the assessment that a re being made and then if a company meets those requirements then they are given those certificates which determine a certain level of compliance.  So hence then we refer to them.  So it is a very technical kind of a certificate that is given that qualifies you to be able to issue – to be able to do processing at that level.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Okay that is fine.    That is correct Chair.     Okay.  Yes Chair the – it was when this affidavit was deposed a copy of that letter was attached.  It is one    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.   Okay thank Chair yes it is that.    That is correct.  Thanks.    That is correct Chair.    If you can repeat again Chair I am not [indictinct].    No that is correct, that is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes I am there Chair.   That is correct yes.   Back to – yes.    That is correct Chair.    Ja Chair the agreement was between the Memorandum of Understanding was between Estina an d Paras.     Yes.    And the department – no Chair.    That is correct Chair.    It was just a letter.    Department yes Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.   That is correct Chair.      Yes.    Ja Chair – Chair this means that we will – we will do all transactions in line with the PFMA.  That is what itis saying.    That is correct Chair.    That is [indistinct].   That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair transfer payment are in the PFMA.    Yes I may not be able to do it rightnow.    Transfer payment yes Chair.    That is correct.    That is fine.    Yes.    Yes Chair the – what we had set up in the department for monitoring is that on a monthly basis we going to get monthly reports – monthly financial reports.  And on a quarterlybasis we will also get quarterly reports.  Now the payment was paid in tranches so that in any event you have a problem you will then be able to say wait let us talk to this report before you proceed.  So those mechanisms were in place.  Now on an annual basis then the Auditor General also comes in and they also go inside they do their monitoring and they do their assessment and they issue a report in that regard.  So monitoring mechanisms are in place in the department and also oversight outside the department.    Chair are you referring to 15.11.    Exhaustion of Funds.    “It is also agreed that should funds no longer be available to pay for the execution of the project the department may terminate this agreement in its own discretion or temporarily suspend all or part of the project by notice to Estina who shall immediately make arrangement to stop the performance of the project and minimise further expenditure.  Provided that Estina shall hereupon be entitled to payment in full for the services delivered up to the date of termination or suspension.”   Chair there could be a range of services.  There could be work done, paid for but maybe the department did not pay for them. It could have been ord ers that would have been placed for delivery.  It could have been work done hence the choice of services so that you cover all areas that money was spent forbut not paid for by the department.     Okay.    Ja Chair the FDC one was very clear because they were required to do management but in this instance when you have a responsibility to set up a project then when you set upa project it means you are setting up the project you cannot then claim management fee until you hand over the project.  It means it is your responsibility to look after the assets until it comes to a stage when you say now I am done with the project I am handing it over.  It is completed.  Then beyond that then you can charge management fee.  Ifthen you hand it over and you are not able to get the  owner to receive it.  But my understanding is that we should not – they should not be claiming management fee other than direct cost.     Direct cost.    Yes direct cost then should be paid.     That is correct.    That is correct.    No Chair.  The – you will rememberthat it – after I had been advised by the state law advisors we ended up with this agreement versus the first agreement.  Now this agreement was saying first finish the project before the shareholding kicks in, do and finish it and then you revert back to the shareholding structures.     No I am…    Yes.    As an investor?   They would have a shareholding.  Remember the shares that we had agreed on will then be held by Estina.  It means they  were working as an investor.    Immediately.  The advice that is why the agreement was revised so that it does not say outright that this is the shareholding.  Finish the project, the construction and once it is finished Chair then – then you transfer the whole asset into theshareholding structure.  Then that shareholding structure is the one where everybody then will be holding shares.  Because I am sure you – we have looked at it on the letter that was sent by the state law advisors to advise us to say at any given point if the beneficiaries whoever was there would then decide we are the owners they wouldsell their shares even before you finish it.  That is why the decision was saying finish the project and then transfer the entire project into that structure which is a shareholding structure.     It is a three year project.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That was my understanding Chair.    Chair I understood it that they signed this agreement that did not carry the wording of the first agreement which means they understood this agreement when they entered and signed it.   We - we did Chair when we submitted the second agreement.  They - they were able to - to see that it will notbe in - in it.    That - that is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Of this discussion, okay.    Alright.  That is correct Chair.    Okay.    Invoice.  Yes.  That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja.  That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair, I am - I am thinking whetherthere was any discussion we held on subcontracting because subcontracting means you are getting somebody to - to implement a portion on your behalf.  It is different from appointing a contractor to do that.  So I - I may not remember exactly whether we had anybody to be    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    Ja.    (Intervenes).    That …    That is correct Chair.    (Intervenes).   That is - that is …    Point two.    Yes sir.    Ja.  That is correct Chair.    The agreement.  That is correct Chair.     Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  The - the understanding that I had on that statement was that we expected a certain level of - of deliverables in the project that should be certified by Paras to say.  We - we will be able to deliver  what we had agreedon, on this project in terms of the standard.  It - it would then be a problem if we bring somebody else and say construct one, two, three and then they come back and say but that that does meet our standard.  Then it becomes our problem .  Hence - hence we say Estina being a counterpart will always be directed by Paras to say to meet our standard this is how it should be done.  So they cannot come back and say we have constructed this role because we did not understand how it should have b een done.  Hence - hence we say then they should be the sole provider so that we - we should not have a misunderstanding.    That is correct Chair.    That - that is correct Chair.    Yes.  We - we accept Chair.   Chair also in - in the earlier discussion we had …     Was that this - this was done so for - for litigation purposes …    Because if we - if we would have brought in Paras …    Into the agreement …    Then international issues then kicks in.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    I - I understand Chair.    Ja.  I - I accept Chair …     Because I had very limited knowledge …    In - in drafting of agreements …     But I took it that it was fine.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  You will - you will remember that after the …     The first agreement the State Lawyers requested that they assist in drafting of this one.     Hm.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.  I - I agree with you Chair.    In - in - what was brought to my attention …     Was that in the first agreement where we had brought in Paras.   Was illegal …     Because at my level I did not have a    To sign an agreement with an international partner.    So that - that is why then it would be illegal …    To bring in Paras …    Into the agreement.   Hence then it was reduced to an agreement between the department and Estina.     Huh-uh.   No Chair.  I - I would want to add anything.    Yes.  I agree with you Chair.  Yes.     Ja.  Thank - thanks Chair.    We - what we intended here was to say to Estina you must have your own internal monitoring processes.  The - there are instances in - in agriculture where the department is - is responsible for - for monitoring compliance.  Our responsibility is monitor compliance.  Now in instances where …     As opposed to performance.    Ja.  We want to deal with that.    So that we - we do not go there andmonitor implementation and then we come and monitor compliance at the same time.    So we - we - hence we have said let them monitor - do the monitoring of the implementation of the project.  We will come and monitor compliance because in terms of the Act there are issues the department must monitor compliance on.    The - the Agricultural Act.    And - and you do the job and you come back the following day and say now I am coming to monitor compliance.  So we said do your monitoring internally.  We will also do our monitoring in terms of your compliance.     That is correct Chair.    Like - like you - you will have to have a - an environment impact assessment who will come and say for you tobe able to do this do you have a PFMA.  Excuse me Chair …     A certificate that you have been given permission …    For you to be drawing water from this dam.  Do you have …?     Do you have a licence?    Those things.  We then come and do the monitoring.    We - we are talking about, yes.    Yes.   Yes and remember they will then still give us a monthly report.    Then over and above that we willmonitor the implementation …     And also monitor the compliance at the same time.    So we do both but they must give us a report of their own monitoring to say this is what - because we - we do not want them at a particular stag e to come and claim ignorance that we did not know.    Hence if - if there is any failure that they pick.  Then they must be able to - to address it immediately.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.  Chair our understanding - maybe let me use the Government scenario.  Each department will have its own monitoring unit to monitor itself over and above the external monitoring that comes in.  So this - this you do so that you are able to pick challenge earlier yourselves.  Now that is what we were intendingthem to do.  So that …    Yes.  They must then do monitoring internally if there are problems they are able to pick them e arly.  So that whoever comes and do the monitoring they are aware …     Already and they are able to say this is how we are going to resolve it.     In performance.    To monitor.    It …    Yes, yes.  Chair we do both …    Because - because by the Act we have to do certain compliance …     And - and there is work that we do …     That we also have to do complianceon.  Some of them might not have been mandated by the Act …     But we still have to do those …     That monitoring.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    That - that is correct Chair.       I may not have been aware at that time Chair, although I’ve been to these offices, the relation during that time was not clear but now I am aware Chair.         At that time Chair.        Chair I have not received therequest from Estina although I remember discussing this with the investigators.        Okay.         Chair the investigation team did discuss the matter with me, requesting that I give them permission to investigate, the investigation that they were doing was the investigation of the department.  We said – because they needed an exclusiveinvestigation without the participation of the department because there you are going to investigate a third party.  Now if you investigate a third party with the exclusion of the department, now that I can’t give that permission I would only give permission to do the investigation in the inclusion of the department, that’s where we differed.  I said we’ve agreed to do the investigation because this investigation is being done to the department if you proceed to do that investigation of Estina, inclusive of the department I have no problem, that we’d agreed but they wanted an exclusive investigation to which – of which I did not have the power to say, go and investigate a third party.  It had to belimited to the application of the project, that is the situation that we had.        That’s correct.        Chair this is exactly what I was explaining that they needed an exclusive interview outside the department which I could not do.  We’ve agreed that we could do theinterview of Estina with the department, so we’d bring them in and we’d all sit and then they will do the interview.  So we could facilitate but they wanted an exclusive, them and Estina, without the department.  That was the difficulty that I had, that I could not gi ve permission to        Because I did not know what they would – that’s why we said we wanted – we’d send a lawyer of the department to go with them and sit with Estina.        Chair we had signed a disclosure agreement, they had said to us as a private company they have issues to protect which they would not want to be exposed when we negotiated these things with Paras as international role player.  So we did notknow what would be those issues at stake.  Hence we said we would want that to happen but then we wanted to make it in line with what National Treasury has requested us to do.  National Treasury has requested that we want to do an investigation of the department in the implementation of Vrede Dairy of which Estina is a party in [indistinct] we don’t have a problem with that.  ADV LEAH GCABASHE       That’s correct.       Yes.      No I did not have a problem Chair in…[intervenes].        In the department, that’s correct Chair because I would not want to be seen giving an investigator permission to investigate a private company.      That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.        Yes Chair.     I hear you Chair, maybe that time then there was a misunderstanding because my problem – I’d never had a problem to have the investigators speakin g to him.  My thinking was that they want permission from me.        Chair I hear you but the thinking that I had that time was a different thinking.  Now that we are speaking and the investigation is done, I hear your understanding.         I see the point.      My problem was that, also not beingvery clued with legal issues, I thought – because I had said to them, I don’t see any problem in them doing an investigation directly with Estina without asking permission from me.  The problem was that why should the permission be asked fro me.  If the permission is asked from me, therefore I would then need to have somebody to sit with them, if I had given such a permission.         No Chair the letter she’s referring to had never been made available to us, his letter to the investigators.         Chair in the meeting that we had they requested me to waive the agreement so that they are able to go to speak to Estina that is what they had asked?      Yes to give them permission to do the investigation.        Yes because there were like – there are two issues Chair, I did not see why they needed permission to do investigation because the agreement says they were not allowed to give information without the consent of the department.       That is Estina.       Now if Estina would have then written to the department to say, we request permission from you, we would then have granted that permission.        That’s correct Chair.     To do the investigation.         Yes the clause is saying, Chair, if they wanted permission from us to go and do the investigation, we said we don’t have any problem for them to do the investigation but then we would organise the meeting for them to come and do the investigation but that’s not what they wanted.  They wanted an exclusive without the department.       Yes.       As now I had responded before.           Yes what I saw as a problem is me giving permission to investigate a private company.        Yes, yes Chair.     That’s correct Chair.        Yes.        Yes, Chair maybe I’m not – all I asked was that we bring Estina, the department and National Treasury and we sit and we discuss and we agree, we would have come up with a solution in that meeting to say, okay proceed with the investigationthis is now all our understanding.         Yes Chair.        That’s correct Chair.     I hear you Chair, like I say theunderstanding I have now…[intervenes].        I would give the permission now.      But at that time my thinking and understanding of legal issues was different.          I agree with you Chair CHAIRPERSON    At that time my thinking was different from what – if you had to come to me I would have said go and investigate.        At that time my understanding was that I’m afraid of giving permission for an investigation of a private company.  That was my understandin g, then what I would say Chair, I made a mistake that time for not allowing them         That’s correct Chair.        Chair…[intervenes].       Yes, Chair the question was that – what I had in mind was that Estina – Paras, through Estina would be doing products on the project and they’re the sole owners of those products, they brand their name, like any other company that has got [indistinct] property on certain products.  Now the problem comes when you give permission, to  what extent are they going to requestpermission to expose some of those issues.  Like when you get into the project, they do the construction in such a way, hence they said to us, when we do construction of the processing plant we normally don’t allow people to come and take pictures because we are exposing our intellectual   property so people know how we achieve the production ofthis brand.  Now that information becomes very confidential because they were going to bring that information of that project  in the construction phase so that at the end it comes up with that particular brand of a product which they’ve got a sole intellectual property, nobody else will produce it that same way because it has the brand name of that product.  Now the understandin g when we had discussed that was in line with saying, the department becomes – we are giving you information that is exclusive in your construction, we wouldn’t want that information to be exposed to everybody because any vendor then would manufacture our product, they know how we do it.  Now that’s thedifficulty, hence it’s very difficult to say it seems I was protecting Estina more than the department…[intervenes].      But this is what they had said to us, we are willing to come and assist you on those basis that you don’t allow people to come and see how we deal with this product because it’s our intellectual.    Ja thanks Chair.  Chair if that would have been the understanding at that time there  should not have been aproblem.      Not exactly Chair the way you putting it.    Because – that – but it is not – it does not mean that I had more concern about Estina than the department.    That is correct Chair.    Chair during the meeting that I had with them they were not – they were not able to say to me our interest goes up to this far.  Because if that should have been the case I should not have had the problem.    The investigators Chair.   Yes.    About the project which would have also included the issue of intellectual property.    Yes.    Ja Chair let me go back again.  We –we had written a letter to the Director General of National Treasury.     It was actually a letter o f complaint.    We had given information CHAIRPERSON   To the investigators.    And that information we had handed over to the investigators was in the weekend meeting.    It was with the newspapers.    We wrote a letter through the Director General of the Province complaining to say Na tional Treasury has doneinvestigation.  Here is information we have given them and that information was in the media on the weekend.  Now we complained to the DG at National in writing.  We received a response to our communication to the DG and the response that we are receiving comes from the investigator.  The letter we wrote to the DG was responded by the investigator.  Now we – and then we have – we had a problem because our understanding was that the DG would then say how did this happen?  You release information you gave to the investigator and the information straight goes to the media.  We had the problem with that hence we wrote the letter and say we have a problem please assistus in dealing with this thing until the investigation has been complet ed.  We cannot have a situation where investigator comes collect information and release it to the media.  But we – we – we were not able to be assisted because we received a response from the    Why I am giving this example Chair.     To say what then came to my mind if – if then we would speak to them and they will say no we do not want you to limit us.    Including the issues of the intellectualproperty.  It means they would have wanted to inve stigate any other thing in that relation.  Now that is where the problem came in because if they would have agreed to say no we will – we are investigating implementation and all those things your transfers, your payment and whatever we are not going to ge t into the issues of the intellectual – then I would not have a problem because those things are not mine.  I cannot give permission.    That is correct Chair.    It is correct yes.    Chair they had – I had raised it in the meeting with the investigators.  That is my only limitation which they were not willing to agree with.   The intellectual property yes.    Chair it – the issue is the issue of a condition.      Because anybody who had to investigate and you agree with him and then you come and you exposethe issue of the intellectual property then it becomes a problem in my understanding Chair.    No it has been done.    And I have also said to theinvestigators.    That I have been in communication with Estina.    And in our discussion with Estinal.    And this has been the problem.    This is – this one item has been the problem.    When I was discussing with Estinaand when I was discussing with the investigators.     Hm.    That is correct Chair.    Chair that is the problem.    Chair I had – I had – they had discussed with me the issue of the intellectual property.    But those documents of the intellectual property were not handed over to us.     So I understood what – what is – was at stake in terms of the intellectual property because they had to use some of those in the configuration of the project.     So that the output gets to what they are looking for.   So I understood and I saw those documents which they were referring to.     That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes it was Paras intellectual property in the hands of Estina.  Because they were implementing.  Let – Chair     I do not know if I can explain this?    In a – in a simple layman’s language.  A recipe for baking cookies, particular cookies.  You may not have until the person says here is the recipe go and do it so that you are able to produce this. And these things are exclusively mine.  Otherwise if youdo not use them the way they are you are not going to achieve that product.  Now I am just using that example.     No it is not correct Chair.    No, no I have not Chair.  The bone of contention in my meeting.    With the investigator was them wanting to go and investigate without any reservation.    Which I discussed with them and I told them [indistinct] the only issue which is a problem unless they were confirming that I said they refused to do investigation into the issues of intellectual property then it would be correct.     Chair …   I am – I am looking at my senior counsel.      Ja.    I hear you Chair.    Ja it is …     I – I do not want to speculate Chair.   The answer that I would give you …     Would be a speculation.    So that is why I say I do not want that.  That is why I am saying I am looking at my senior counsel.     Ja.  Chair.    Why I am afraid.  Yesterday I made a    I had to retract this morning.    And…    Ja because you see Chair the other fear I have I have seen statements being made at the commission and thereafter people were sued.  So hence I am saying…     I do not want to go to that area and make a statement and then I get into trouble.     Hence I am saying I am afraid to get there.   Yes.    That is correct.    That - that is correct Chair.  The indication here is that if - if we would say proceed.  Then they would do so having - after having cleared what we have been told is their concern because they had communicated to us their concern.     Chair …    Chair - Chair that was - that was correct …    Because in the discussion between me and him hence he had put it down was that for us to be able to have a clear understanding of - of what they would ask him.  He - he said if the department was there so that you make sure when they go to thearea where we are not comfortable he would be able to assist us.  That - that we said it is fine.  If I were to give an approval I would have then requested the investigator to say to me we are not interested in the intellectual property.  We therefore give you permission to proceed with the investigation.  So those were the two things Chair.    Yes.   Ja, ja.  Chair what - what I am …     Ja, ja.  Chair I am - I am respondingon the basis of my communication with Vasram.     Hence I am - I am commenting on this …    Not directly as it is …     Because it was their communication.     My input into it …   Is what we had agreed on.    Ja.  I am - I am trying to think.  I cannot remember Chair.    I cannot remember.   I am - I am not recalling Chair.    Yes.    Reports Bundle?    Page 48.  No Chair.  The one I am looking at is HH10B.    Okay.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   I have - I have got.    Page 14?    4-8.  Okay.  I have got it Chair.    I am - I am thinking Chair.  I am not denying it but I am trying …     Ja.  I - I cannot remember.  I might have been there …    Because I have been there with a number of people.    Hm.    Doing investigation but I cannot remember exactly …     I think this is the fourth investigation.     So there - there were many …     Instances I went there.  So I cannot remember (coughing).  I might have been there.     Ja.    On a site visit.    Hm.    Ja.  Chair - Chair I - I do not know why - why they would have struggled in the department to get tha t information because I had given them access to the department supply chain which had all these documents in terms of payments and what payments had been done.  So they - they had been there. They were able to - to access this information.  So I - I readthat they were not able to access information.  I - I - it - I - I do not agree that they would not have had access to this information because that formed the basis of the investigation and they were given access to the department’s supply chain to be abl e to do so.    That is correct.    Ja.  Chair - Chair they had nevercomplained me about refusing them access to the department.  So they had access to whatever they wanted to investigate.  What I had said before was that this report came to my attention for the first time in the court’s records.  I - I was never given an opportunity to respond to the report. I would have - because when a report is being issued normally they will then give you a copy and say this is the findings.  Do you have any comment to make on this report?  Now I was never given that opportunity to do so.  I would have corrected a lot of things in the report which might not have been properly done if they would havegiven me a draft saying this is our outcome.  We cannot find that.  We cannot find that.  We cannot find that in the report.  Either to correct or to make available that information which they are saying they a re not able to get.  Now I saw this report when - when the first draft that I had also made available tothe Commission.  I got the first draft before this report was issued from the legislature and I had a copy that was given to me at the legislature which - which was talking to the - to these issues before they - they released the report. Now the - then the question kicks in Chair where Counsel says but how - how was this working?  Everybody else had a copy of the report except the department and when I w ent to the legislature I went to answer questions on the basis of a report that I was not provided and then that is what I said and I was given a copy by the legislature and when they gave me a copy they wrote on top of the copythat I cannot use it for any other purpose other than responding to the questions of the legislature which is what I did.  Now that report which I got versus this report that was in - in court did not bear the same date but I had used the report at the legislature for responding to - to their question.  Now my question has always been and if you also read the - the Public Protector’s Report it - it comes out very clear in a number of areas that I did not have the copy of the report. It seems they had a copy of the report because they were asking me questions about it but I did not have and they, from theirside never - they never gave me a copy of the report to be able to - to talk to the report.  Until, I - I then went to court and then I got a copy of the report.  So the - that is - that has been my problem with regard to this report.  I would have made my inputs before the report would have    That is correct.    That is - that is correct Chair.    (No audible reply).   I am - I am trying to recall sir.  I may not remember the exact date.    That is correct Chair.    I - I …    I think Chair it - it could have been - I do not want to make a mistake because between us going to the Provincial Executive Council I am not sure whether it was before or after.  I think it could have been before because when I w ent to theExecutive Council I was then able to say what is - what is possible from us. I think it was during that time for us to be - to - to make sure and ascertain but it - it - I am - I am just trying to think I cannot recall properly.  It could have been after the Executive Council says to us go and - and look for money.  Then we went also to - to National to say we have this proposal and …    Okay.    Okay.  Ja.  I - I think so Chair.  It could have been after I have received approval to then go to Nationalto present this project to source funding.     That is correct.  Chair there - there are two documents.  There is a prefeasibility study that was done which was short and concise and then there was then the detailed feasibility study.  So the initial feasibility study also went into the big feasibility study.    Ja.  Chair, I am - I am trying to bringit back to perspective again.    When we went to the Executive Council and they gave us the first tranche of payment part of that money was also to do that feasibility study.  Hence then when wesigned off we then also got that money then to go and do the detailed feasibility study but then the prefeasibility study was already do ne which was positive at that time but we wanted the detailed one for us to be able to say yes indeed.    Chair it was also - it was supposed to do the larger.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  Maybe - maybe I am - I am seeing it differently.    Than the one he sees it.    Before I comment to that I want us tolook at his - his table.    Just below that.    1.4 under “Background” table numberone.    Now his table number one is looking - it is giving months and number of milk producers per province.     In different years.  Now I - I take it January 2006 the Free State had their highest number of milk producers.    1 006.   Which we have raised in our report that …    1 067.    Sorry Chair.    Sorry Chair.   1 067.    Now if you look at his report you will see how quick the decline is specifically in the Free State.  It will meandairy farming was doing well in the Free State irrespective of the statement that he is saying it is inland.    The number - it was doing well and then it started to …     Initially and then we started to see the decline.    Yes.    Then - then it started going down.    On top of the Free State …     Yes.    By - by almost half Chair.    By almost half.CHAIRPERSON   Yes, yes Chair.    By half.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes - yes Chair.  I - I just do not want to forget to answer your - your first question.   Yes, because he was saying the Free State is - is an area where you would not do dairy.  That - that is my understanding.  Why did you choice the Free State?     Because we - we are in the Free State.  We cannot choose another …     Province to do dairy …    Other than the Free State.        Nationally will do it differently butwe had an understanding that the Eastern Free State is the highest rainfall area, the arid part of the Free State is the worst in the Southern part towards Garieb, that is the arid.  Now the Eastern Free State is a very high rainfall area, hence we have got fruit production there, we have got dairy concentration and all that, so I would not agree with him that in the Free State you would not do dairy.         That’s correct Chair.       I accept that statement Chair.        Yes, but I want to talk to thatstatement also to say this decline was a national decline, it was not only the decline of the Fre e State so the entire country in terms of dairy production we were declining, not on the basis of arid but on the basis of cost to do dairy.  There was – the cost of doing dairy versus the return on the price of milk farmers were not making it, hence they were leaving dairy.Now that has been our opening statement when we started Vrede Dairy, we say we want to deal with that issue because we saw in the Free State the rate at which the number of dairy farmers were declining were very high, so we had to do s omething, so I agree withhis statement, his figures, but the statement he is mentioning here it is a country statement, it is not a statement specific to the Free State, because everybody has been declining, so that decline cannot only accorded to the Free State Province, because it was the true statement for each province, all provinces declined.         Yes Chair I have responded to the first question to say this is what is my understanding and his figuresare correct.        His figures are correct in the table        I am not saying the Free State did not decline but it is not only the Free State that declined.        So it cannot be accorded to the Free State.        Decline yes.       In the Free State but we had provinces that declined more than the Free State.      If you look at the last column on the right in terms of the percentage, the Free State had declined by 57, and then if you look further down the other Provinces had declined more than 57.     So the issues at play here there weremany issues, they cannot be accorded to one area to say this is exactly the reason, so it is a number of issues.      That is correct Chair, further on in the report he is saying the only reason why in other countries dairy farming is a success is because of government involvement in his report he says because government is assisting the farmers, he normally calls it in the United States and Europe a tariff, in South Africa we call it a grant.  That way we assist the farmers.  T he problem was that you  had farms that had infrastructure for dairy, the infrastructure is in existent and those farmers are pulling out they saywe can’t make it, the costs become too expensive, so we needed an intervention of government to come in and s ay we will make it easier for you by bringing in a grant because this project was going to be built with a grant from government, which is not going to be costly for the farmer to be able to go back to dairy farming because the distance for the supply will be closer and they would be able to focus in the production and then the cost element is then going to be reduced.   Now that was the thinking that made us to go back to say we need to assist, we can’t allow the decline of dairy in the Free State, being t he fourth largest producer of mealies in the country.  I agree with him thecoastal provinces were doing much better because of environmental factors, but the Free State did very well because in all the inland provinces, I would say in the inland provinces  it was number one.So we wouldn’t say we wouldn’t  do it there because we are inland, environmental issues are not so good for us, when before thatwe had proved that it can be done.      That is correct.     That is correct.     Ja, thank you Chair.  We had looked at that, the National Agricultural Marketing Council had done a study, and the study was indicating if this rate of decline of dairy farmers in the country would proceed the way it was proceeding it would mean that the country must then come with a plan of how to import milk,because our own dairy farmers were not making it.   It means that’s the direction because if you don’t come in with an intervention strategy it means you will end up with all the small dairy farmers going out, only the large will remain.So the report was saying something needed to be done, we cannot allow it to disappear because it is a food security issue now, if you look at the country, we cannot rely on milk that we are importing.  It is a problem but we have to  do something to make sure that we still have producers of milk in the country, otherwise we must decide we are going to import milk from somewhere, we have failed producing milk,we are leaving it.   And this intervention when we looked at this we thoug ht the issues that were being raised to be the cause of the decline could be addressed.  If you look specifically at the Free State, I think we have discussed this also earlier Chair that dairy – people that are sellingmilk are price takers, somebody comes and says I can buy your litre of milk for so much, take it or leave it.  It means you cannot decide how much you want to sell your milk, they tell you, you are a price taker, they tell you we can buy so much of your litre of milk, if you don’t take that price sorry, you are out of the market. That’s what we wanted to address, because for the Free State producers of milk it was very expensive, one of the elements that was making it very expensive was that cost of transport, because that cost of transport to come and collect your milk it is actually charged on you, the seller, that it costed me to send a truck to come and collect yourmilk, if I can’t buy your milk at that price. Hence then Chair you will remember I said that’s why then we reverted on the model Paras, because Paras was the one sending the trucks, collecting the milk, bringing it into the processing facility, hence we are saying this processing facility will solve the problem of most of the farmers because it will – the milk will be collected, closer and the price will be much better, because the facility, nobody needs to pay for the facility because government has paid for the facility, because if a private person comes and put up the facility or have borrowed money to the bank he must make sure he makes enough money to go and pay forthe facility if the farmer has done that, but in this instance nobody owes it because government has invested into the facility for all farmers to benefit into it.Now that was our first model to say let’s impl ement this one, we believe it will succeed, and then we will address the decline of thefarmers because the prices will now be better because of the investment of government into that.      Ja, Chair it is not only that, I havejust put that one ...[intervenes]      Remember in this model the farmers were also shareholders into the factory, this is not privately owned.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     But over and above that Chair also being a shareholder because it means per litre if milk you are getting more, more than only selling the milk to the processing part it means you are also a participator in the value chain, you are not only sellin g your milk to the private sector and that’s it, it means your beneficiation ...[intervenes]      The farmer yes.     It is not enough Chair.     Yes, that is why I am saying Chair if you are in – if you are part of ownership of the company that do processing you will get more money than only being provided with the     Because you will also get money in the processing which when you are only selling, you are not beneficiary to it, so it will then encourage even more farmers to get into it because you don’t only get the money for your milk and transporting for free but you also get money after your milk has been processed.      Costs and being shareholder that ...[intervenes]     Ja, ja, that was the part that will then assist them.     And hence they will then have enough money to be able to deal with the issue of the production costs.      That’s correct.    Ja, Chair water is critical but the     That will be a concern in an arid area.     Chair I do not agree, because we have a license form Water Affairs for access to water, which was issued by the Department of Water Affairs, so the problem he might have had he only focus the documents that he was provided with were three documents without any other supplementary information and he never came back to the Department to say but I do not see anything that  will assist you in here, what other information do we have, so – and he has a disclaimer on that in the report, to say this is the only documents that were made available to me by the investigator, because he was notinteracting with us, the investigator provided him with this document and he had no access to any other document because they were not asked from us, but we had permission from Water Affairs to access water, and hence I say I do not agree with the statement.      That is correct Chair.  That ...[intervenes]      That gave access to the dam that was on the farm and also access to do boreholes on the farm for additional water.     Ja, it depends on the strength of the area Chair, some areas the water availability strength is low, in some areas the water availability strength is high depending on the water table, and also depending on the rainfall in the area where you are, and the area that we are talking about had more than enough wate r.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   In the particular area.     And I agree with him when he says water is key in a dairy, you would not start a dairy when you are not happy with the amount of water.    Ja thank you Chair.  I have went through his report on page 294 where he was talking to a number of issues.    But what I want to get into Chair was – I am trying to get to the exact statement where he t alks about –because he has got a disclaimer on this.     Where he says his comment is only subject to an economist to do the evaluation and comparison.  Which he says he has not done.  Which makes it very difficult for me to agree with him because it is just his observation but he has not done any exercise to do comparison to say yes indeed.  Because you cannot say it is expensive when you have not done comparison to say what informs you to say this is too expensive.  So it is a statement that cannot be substantiated.  He should have gone and said this is the price of thisand this is the price of this why did you pay so much.     Yes Chair.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC    Yes what – what we provided Chair in our submission were cost estimate but when we were implementing then we presented the actual cost.  Now he assessed the plan not the actual cost.  Because those were two different things.  He looked at the document and he did the assessment in terms of the plan.     Yes.  Because there you put estimation of the cost and then when you then implement the projectthen you get actual.  Sometimes it is cheaper sometimes it more expensive than what is on the plan.     The actual documents Chair where the actual cost are it is when you implement and then you – we have those monthly reports to say this was done and this was the cost.     Yes.    Yes.    Because he assessed the originaldocument before the implementation.    Then on the basis of that he says it looks expensive.    But he does not say it looks expensive he says it is an expensive exercise.  Still I say to him he could still have done comparison to say why he says expensive because he has checked this tractor and this tractor – this size of a tractor in the market this is what is costs and in your plan it says thismuch therefore we do not agree with you.  H e is giving a general statement that this is expensive, this is expensive without doing any comparison.    That is correct.    No Chair.   Yes.  Now I think he is confusing.  There was a separate program called Ilema/Letsema where the department supplied tractors in that area to assist small farmers to doploughing.    So those tractors were not meant for this project.  There was in a particular stage where we requested assistance from those farmers to come and assist befo re we could acquire tractors for the project but they were never bought and supplied by the department.  In fact those tractors came from National.  They were donated to the Province and there were specific farmers that had to be assisted with those tractors.    Yes.    Ja.  Chair the department do not have tractors.  He might have been referring – I am not sure which tractors he was referring – he might have been referring to the tractors of the project which were being serviced by him that is the Vrede DairyProject because the project has been servicing tho se tractors and repairing those tractors with him.  He might have alternatively been referring to these tractors which were given to farmers by the department which are in the hands of the farmers.  So they are not depart – they are not tractors that belon gs to the department.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  So I am not sure what – which tractors Mr Basson is referring to whether those of the project or he is referring to the set of tractors that  were donated to farmers.     I am not sure which ones were standing with him.    No Chair.  There is a plan of how many tractors need to be bought for what purpose.     Now those tractors at a given time will go there for repairs, they will go there for services.  Now I am not sure why he referred to those standing but it could be that when the projects came to a stop because then they were not operationalanymore then he might be referring to those tractors still standing.  I do not know I am just – because I am not able to say exactly what tractors is he referring to that are standing with him.  I do not – it is difficult for me to answer Chair.    Ja Chair.   Ja.  No there was not stock readily available Chair hence we had to purchase tractors.     That is my understanding Chair.    Which flag number?    Okay.    That is correct.    As per the binding agreement Estina was requested to develop a feasibility study and a business plan.  Ithink Chair this is the big business plan.  The latest one not the preliminary.    Ja that is correct.    Yes.  Chair the one where we are now is the preliminary.    That is correct Chair.    There is a bigger business plan thanthis one Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I think what we are having here this is – the first document is the…     Is the preliminary.    Is the bigger plan.    Yes that one.    Yes, yes Chair.    Together yes.    They are two different.   That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  The – I had not received proper confirmation which I had later then received.     The proof of the payment yes.    That is correct Chair.    Because I had to provide evidence to that in attachment but then later then we got that.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes I am – I am Chair.   That is correct Chair.  I confirm because these were the amounts that proof of payment …     To include yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes I have got it Chair.    That is correct Chair.  You mean thenumbers that are in the …     That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes Chair the name of th e name on which the budget is gazetted it is Vrede Dairy.  It is not Estina.  So when you report you report the budget allocation under Vrede Dairy.     You report against the project because if this money is gazetted under a certain topic to say this amount of money goes to Vrede Dairy then when you present your report otherwise then it will confuse somebody which budget are you relating to.  Hence it says Vrede Dairy.   That is the name under which the budget was allocated.    Yes.  I - I hear you Chair.  Hence the comment that they are giving but remember the audit that is done by the Auditor-General …     They do the audit on our financialstatement.  Now the financial statement says so much money was allocated and - and this much.  Then they are then saying moving forward departments must then also reflect that - that is my understanding of the statement that we will then have also to reflect to whom the money was transferred?  How much was spent and so on.     Hm.    Ja.  Chair - Chair my knowledge on this is very limited.  The - the CFO and the - the finance section of thedepartment deals with this.  So they know the details of - of doing the financial statements which eventually get  to the Auditor-General.  I am only explaining my understanding of these but I will not be able to go into the details.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  Chair - Chair I agree but I would not have gone otherwise I - I will be a very super person to know the details of - of each - because this - this is going into the details.  What I would know is that so much money has been paid and - and the details then the CFO comes in because they are trained into these issues. They will understand even what Treasury - what the Auditor- General is saying here.  They will understand far much better than - because if I will try and explain these I may not be telling the correct thing.  What is it that they are saying?     That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes.  I agree the number is correct Chair …    But what - what is on top those statements that are on top are - are very key.    They need - they need somebody who understands to be able to implement what they say.     Hm.    Hm.   I - I hear you Chair, yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Hm.    Ja.  Chair - Chair that - that is correct.    What I was explaining Chair is that we - we are looking at this table.  We do not know what informs how they put it in this table.  May - maybe the - the mistake could have happened on the budget side.    Yes.    Hm.CHAIRPERSON   I - I hear you Chair.    I accept that Chair.    Hm.    Sits.    That is right.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.  I - I just want to check Chair …     Because I - I only see the extract of three pages.    I am - I am not sure if this was a final    It makes it very difficult for me to …     To talk to it whether was it a draft.  At this time whether it was already final.  I am - I am not sure.    Yes.    Yes.  I - I take it Chair they took it from the final …     Hm.   Ja, ja.  Chair I have a number ofother questions because if - if it was the final report because we would have then have engaged with the Auditor -General to say but why is column …    B empty?    We could have then engaged with that because …    Our - our audit statement leave s fromus to Provincial Treasury.    If there would be any problem Provincial Treasury will say no, no we do not agree with your …     Your statement.  One, two, three, fo ur is not there.  Before then it goes to the Auditor-General.   That - that is the reason why I am asking if …     Indeed this has gone through all - allour hands and we are not able to pick it.  Hence it is an issue now.  That - that is the basis why I am asking …     Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Hm.    (Intervenes) Chair.    That is correct.    Yes.  Hence my comment Chair because even the Provincial Treasury would have referred it back to us to say but you are giving us a - a financial statement that has gaps.    That is why I am asking but …    It might be that it - it might have slipped through …     All of us …     Without this information …     And - and I take it Chair that in that particular year we got unqualified audit.    They said to us your financial statements are absent.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja.  The one on top Chair is the clean audit.    No.  The clean audit is the one where they cannot say anything.    It is the first prize.    Clean audit.    Just below clean audit is unqualified .    Yes.  Unqualified says your finances are fine but we have the following comments to make to you to improveon.    Yes Chair but …     Yes.  That is - that is …    That is how it is Chair.    Next time.  That is correct Chair.     Yes.  That is the unqualified.CHAIRPERSON   That is the second from the top.    Yes Chair.    I - I …    Yes.    Ja.    And then the qualified one has a bit of holes …     In - into it …    And - and then there - there are two which are at the bottom.    Which …    Which are very bad.    (Intervenes).    It means you are not (intervenes).     Yes.  You are not even …    You …    It is a mess Chair.    You - you are not even able to present your financial statements.     Yes.    That is the correct.    That is the bottom.   Ja.    The - it is - it is not actually - it is - it    Will - will talk to but it is not a category.    Yes.  What do they call it?  I am trying to go back to it now.    It has been some time Chair that (intervenes).    Yes.    It is - it is the unqualified.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Which one is that one?    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   That is correct.    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  That is correct.    That is - that is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is …    That is correct.    No Chair.    Ja, ja.  The difficulty Chair the way you put …    Is difficult for me to say you are notcorrect Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  That is what I am - I am saying    What I am saying is difficult to say to the Chair you are wrong.                    That’s correct.        Yes.       That is correct.        That is correct Chair.        That is correct.        Yes Chair I think that was the issue that was also discussed in the Commission, I think it was the State Law Advisors in terms of dealing with the issue of the land.         That’s correct.        That is correct.        That is correct.     That’s correct.     That’s correct yes.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     Correct Chair.     Yes.     Thanks Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That is correct.     Chair I am going back to say this was a report of September 2012, which we have already ticked, that the shelf company has been registered.   Because the department had changed the conditions which then de layed, because it then became our responsibility to come forward and say here are the beneficiaries into which must be registered into the company and then proceed with the shelf company and the beneficiaries from the side of the departments are the follow ing, we need the beneficiaries from the sideof Estina to be then into shell, so the shelf company existed in the name Zana.  All that they are telling us is that we had said to them we would want it to be in line with the project to be called Mohama Mobun g so that’s what they needed just to change but it already existed.      Yes.     That exactly Chair, that would be the shareholding company.     No Chair it was not deregistered, it was the company that was supposed to be the shareholding company and that is what we had ticked off to say the company is in existence, ithas been done.  Then the change of the name and the inclusion of the beneficiaries into the shelf company then remained with us and that is the part that we have been dealing with, with the State Law Advisors.      Chair this is exactly the point where we had agreed with the State Law Advisors to put that on hold, because we could not have an individual who will hold the shares until furthernotice, when we were busy in the process of finalisin g the beneficiaries to come into the entry, hence then that process did not happen, because this was their report to us to say this is what they believe should happen and we did not agree with this implementation.      That is correct Chair.     No Chair, the responsibility fo r Estina to do was to go and register a company.      Yes.   Then they came back to us to say the company is registered, here is the registration number, here is everything so that is done.  Wh at then was required from us is to put the shareholder and then what they are suggesting to us is that at the meantime let’s keep this person as a shareholder into the company,which we did not agree with, hence the shareholding issue was delayed until the end of the project, we said the shareholding, the putting of the shareholders into the company let’s delay it once the project has been completed, hence it was not in the agreement that we had signed with     That’s correct.     Yes.     Chair I might not have been giving you the correct name, my understanding is that there was a company registered that was then presented to us to say here is the company, and their proposal was that at the meantime let us put one person, I am not sure how it was approved, whether it was approved as a company or how the process that was followed but the company was then presented to say here is the company.      That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC     That is correct Chair.     Yes.    That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Remember Chair I had – you read a statement from the report that says we vide that it should be him, where we then said we did not agree because we will provide the beneficiaries, all that we needed that time is that that company must be registered and must be in existence.  That’s then when he went to correct that then he put it in his name, so the shareholder at that time ...[intervenes]      Kamal, Kamal Vasram the director.    Then he registered and opened the company now in his name, in anticipation that we will then come and say here are the beneficiaries.     What he is talking about.     Ja, my understanding of the shell company it did not matter who you put there, but during the time when then you are ready to put your beneficiaries into it then that discussion would be entered at that time, to say here are the beneficiaries fromthe farmers, who are the beneficiaries from Estina’s side, then they will decide who they want to put.     Yes Chair.    Ja.  Chair, I - I am aware of the lettershe is referring to of the change of the Dire ctors of Estina in 2015 …   But in 15 we had already terminated the agreement with the department.  The - we had terminated in 2014 to say that relationship has been ended.     Chair that - that was the - the - because that relationship had collapsed because it would not be - because we have terminated the relationship between ourselves andEstina.  What my understanding is that that shell company because it is our shell company it would then revert to us and - and become our asset whether we want to use it in the future or not but it had - from after the termination it had nothing to do with Estina anymore.     We - we never came to the stage of transferring the projects to the beneficiaries.  That - that is why it did not happen.  We - we requested the Free State Development Corporation to manage it until such a decision would have been agreedupon.    Ja.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   That is correct.    Yes.  I - I whoever is there now would have decided differently from what I would have.     I do not know what would they have decided to do with it.    Okay.    That is - that is correct Chair.    Okay.   Chair these reports to do not - did notcome to me directly.  They - they were sent to the Chief Director.  They - they are not reports that go to the HOD because in receipt of this letter he need to go and confirm whatever that is being carried here if indeed it has been done . By the time he tells me he says I am happy because I do not need to also go there myself.  He confirms it.  Then - then it is accepted.    That is - that is correct Chair.    Yes.    Hm.  Ja.    Ja.  Chair although I may not go to the details of this during - during the - the investigation that was done by the Hawks in - into the investigation of the - of the banks.  They confirmed to me that there was a loan that Estina had - had taken.  Ithink in - in one of the statements.  I would not be able right away now to go in there …    And - and show you but there was that proof which they had actually brought to say we …     We are aware that there was a loan that was taken.    Even though when - during theimplementation they had never explained to us that they had taken a loan …    For us to be able to deal with that …     I may not remember exactly how much the amount was now …    But there was such a document.    So whether it was later or and so on but there - there was something like that that existed.  Now what was ofinterest to us if they would come to us and say as Estina we have paid this money and we have bought a tractor we would then go and check if indeed there was a tractor and then if the tractor did exist we will then tick and say we have seen the tractor that you have bought.  So that - that is what we would do.  So that when they say we have done one, two, three we  will check that and say okay we are - we are happy with that because it has happened.  You are telling us it has happened.  We have seen it.    Yes, yes Chair.    In - in the agreement Chair during the - this phase of implementation.    They would not have started with their implementation.    Hence they say we want to start withyour part of the implementa tion …    But it is your obligation.  It is not Estina’s obligation …    But we are now beginning to pay our money …    Into your obligation of Phase 1.    So that we - we do not stall the process.    Which we believe when your money    Yes.    Hm.   Chair that - that is- is possible.    What - what I am coming is that the - the portion which they had been implementing was the portion that we were responsible for the cost but here the indication is that they started paying for the cost that we should have paid for …     As a department.    It means they - they - because we - in actual fact we were waiting for the new financial year because that is where …    Our money was sitting …    And - and if - if they would not have proceeded with the project.    It means it would have stalled the -the whole activity.    Hence then they proceeded - hence in their statement they are saying with the understanding that the money     Will then cover that money that we …     Are spending.    Which is correct.    Yes.    That is - that is correct Chair.   That - that is …     That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   That is correct.    Ja.    Yes, yes.  Chair I remember we - wediscussed this …    And - and I had indicated to you that we had engaged them because we had not agre ed with them …     That they should - they should do that …    But their - their understanding was that when - when they were doing inquiries into the - into the dairyproject itself which is the parlour, the machine that does the - the milking.  They were supposed to place an order and if they place an order then it had to be - to be manufactured and you would not just place the order. You - you have to guarantee that if they start manufacturing that equipment for you.  You would be able to - to pay.  So if - if your money is sitting in a bank.  The bank will - you cannot touch it once you have issued a guarantee on that particular money for them to be able to construct. Now hence I said they - they have done that but we were nothappy because we had agreed that this money was meant for specific purposes for us to be able to proceed and - and that was those things that we had listed that they - they should have done in that particular stage.    Yes.    Yes.  This - this money was put aside …    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.  What I had said they should have first - because it was a correct - it was a necessary thing to do but our problem was that they had not consulted with us before.  We could have also agreed but the issue was that then do not delay the issues that the money was meant for.  It - it should not do that.  Hence then they had the n to go and - and find money so that those issue happen.  They had to happen and - and we - we did not have a problem with that but we did pick up a fight with them and say you should not have done it but we are comfortable.We know you have reserved it an d here is the papers and here is what you are saying to us you - you have done.  So that - that is - that is what I had explained also before Chair.     Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    That is correct.    Ja.  I - I hear Chair what - what she is saying.  We - we had engaged that after they have provided us with the report to say this is not what we had agreed but we were convinced with the explanation with the  understanding that it - it is something that we have to place and order on time for you to be able to get it becauseduring - earlier on when they had not engaged with these none of us had known how much time we will require to do that …     But then they said to us Chair on all these activities that you expect us to do there would not be any delaybecause that part - that part of the - of the equipment was still part of our responsibility to deal.    Okay Chair.    Hm.    Oh - oh - yes.  No.  I - I hear it now Chair.    Yes Chair.  The - the understandingthat we had Chair we - we were doing the detail feasibility study.  We had already done a preliminary feasibility study which already g ave an indication to us that in - indeed these projects can be done but then we were going into the details of the project.     Chair - Chair there - there was not any rush.  We - we had already agreed and spoken how the money would be allocated.    The terms.    Yes.   That could have been done Chair.    It is a difficult one Chair to answer.     Yes, yes Chair.    Yes Chair.   Yes.    That is correct.CHAIRPERSON   Chair I was convinced that there would not be any problem.     Is it …?    Ja.  Chair - Chair in - in - I am - I am trying to - to put it the correct way Chair.    Is that - heads - Heads of Department works within a time frame.  When you come in and you say  this is what is going to be my deliverables in terms of my contract.  You have to make sure that the deliverables happen as per your contract because if- if you do not deliver as per your contract then you would not have delivered what is expected of you . So I had the contract and - and those things were part of my deliverables of - of the contract.  So delaying those would mean you    So I - I had also to work within time frames to say by this time as in my contract this has to be delivered.     No, no it did not Chair.    That - that is correct Chair.   Thank you.    Huh-uh.    That is - that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC   Ja.  Chair in - in my thinking hence we - we - like I have indicated this is what had agreed and this is what Estina had explained to us which I have indicated that we are not comfortable but then after their explanation on the reasons we then agreed with them.  On the basis that they spent their money to complete what wehad.  It means if there was going to be any loss in that money it would not be a loss of the department because what we would  have asked them to do with the money they had would have been done.  So that - that guarantee after we have discussed with them.  We said it is fine you can guarantee that the activities that we had money available for must happen.     Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  I - I accept Chair.    Yes.    Ja.  Chair there - there was not - there was not a reason for the rush because all - all that I needed was to be seen delivering what I had made commitment to deliver.     At - Chair at that time my thinking was that after we have interrogated and discussed it.  We - we then proceeded.    Ja.  May - maybe Chair it is difficult for me to understand - to get into your thinking.  I am - I am trying to see what is it that is …   Yes.  That is correct Chair.    Yes.    That is …    That is …    That is correct.    on - only to the point to say …     The detailed feasibility study …     Will then give you the details.  The - the initial feasibility details will give you the go ah ead to say there is no problem in - in doing this project but then you need to go into the details of - of doing everything to say this is how this is going to bedone. So the detailed feasibility study you go into it because you already have a green light to say there is no problem in doing this project hence you can then move to the next.     With this, yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is - that is correct Chair.    Of this …    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    I am fine Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETH E:  Okay.    That is correct.     That is correct Chair. 
MR MBANA PETER THABTHE:  Yes.  So we have delegations to be responsible in - in the entire industry of agricu lture to do monitoring on certain aspects.  So those - those - you do not want to mingle those two …

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Then I just want to clear up Mr Thabethe these emails that really give a different version to what you say because I am not going to read all of them.  I have read the most important one it is just the one we read into the record.  That one wasdated the 5 December 2013.  But before that on the 1 December there was an email sent by again Ms Jacobs to Mr Vasram saying  “You have further not responded to my request to inform us on what basis you and or Estina and or Paras are claiming confidentiality.  During our meeting with Mr Thabethe on Friday the 22 November he informed ENS that he had discussed our request with you and that you were not willing to meet with ENS or to cooperate with this investigation.  We therefore have no option but todeduce that you are not willing to cooperate with this investigation and the request from National Treasury.  So the important thing there is we have spoken to Mr Thabethe on the 22 November.”     So the date of the email Chairman it is on page 249 of the Reports bundle page 249 and it is an email dated the 1 December.    The Reports bundle.    It is bundle B.    Emails.      So it is from Jacobs dated 1 December to Vasram and copied to Cele, there is a Barnard as well and the title isclear Vrede Integrated Dairy Project.  So it was very clear.     I understood your evidence earlier to speak about production lines specific issue – specific products that you would have wanted ordered for the dairy farm.     Was that what you were communicating.     So in fact as the Chairman has beenasking you it was Paras’ intellectual property?     That you were concerned with?     Not Estina’s?    Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe I think I really do not want to belabour this very much further because my understanding of the emails and Chairman I  just commend them to you.    They run from page 249.    Through to page 251.    And they will give further context to the same discussion.    Or at least the evidence is there.     They are – end of 2013.    Discussions that is what they reflect.    So I think I will just commend     Thank you Chairman.    In fact it boils down to this Mr Thabethe.  The email dated the 1 December 2013 to Mr Vasram communicates clearly that you Mr Thabethe informed ENS that you Mr Thabethe had discussed ENS’s request with Mr Vasram and that Mr Vasram was not willing to meet ENS.  That is what you communicated to ENS.    It is from Jacobs to Vasram.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Correct.    Mr Buthelezi would like to address you     That is a view that you hold Mr Thabethe.  If we turn to page 293 of the same document so it’s 293, I just want us to look at that feasibility study and his comment regarding water which is right at the bottom of that report, resources for site evaluation.  Water is one of the major considerations when establishing a dairy, a sustainable clean source of water is very important.   There is no clear indication in the feasibility study on the source of water, you wouldagree with that comment?      Chairman I notice that it is just on one  o’clock, this might be a convenient time.     To take the lunch break.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is what he had before him.     Now that actual document that you are talking about what is – what – where is it?    Oh I see.  No then I am with you.      If you are saying that the numbers you aretalking about that you can relate to are in the monthly reports and the quarterly reports.    And he…    Yes.  No I have understood what you have said and will deal with the detail when we get to the monthly reports.     But now that you mentioned tractors.  Do you – I – the evidence we have heard is that the department supplied a number of tractors to this particular project, do you recall that?     You – are you saying that the department did not supply tractors?     Yes.    Departmental tractors that are parked in Vrede you are saying that you would rather still use money that has been allocated to the Vrede Dairy Project to buy new tractors and not try and use stock that belongs to government that is sitting in Vrede and doing nothing at all.  What is the distance?  A five kilometredistance between Basson’s premises and the farm – less?    If I – my recollection serves me well the donation was mentioned in Mr Jankielsohn’s evidence.     Mr Basson spoke about tractors that belonged as I have – I understood him to the project.   And as you saythat he had been repairing.  So I think that these are two separate sets of tractors.    I think that would be correct because there are two different individuals who gave us this evidence.     But…   But if you were referring to tractors that belonged to the project that have been repaired by him that are still sitting in his premises you would be checking the invoices to see why anew tractor is being purchased whereas three months back a tractor was in fact purchased.  Is that how you would monitor the expenditure on tractors?    Yes.    That is fine because the point really I had been making at the beginning was the extent to which stock that is available is used for the dairy project as opposed to purchasing new items when the money for the new item could be used for something totally different.    Your understanding is that everything thatwas purchased for the dairy farm was new?     Thank you Mr Thabethe I want to move on because we have a long way to go and we have got a couple hours this afternoon.  If we then go back to your annexures to the 2017 affidavit MPT14 – Annexure 14 at Tab number 14 was not received.  This is the preliminary – all the detailed business plan.  I was not too sure which one you were really referring to.  If we just go to paragraph 16 of your affidavit.  So just go to the front of that same doc – same file.  If you – paragraph 16 you will find on page 249.    Yes.    We are talking about 14, 14 and 14 says not received.  So when you go to  the affidavit to see what it is that has not been received.    We go to paragraph 16.  You know we were trying to give content remember Mr Thabethe to what you say in your affidavit.  We had the affidavit but no annexures. So now we arejust putting the two together.  So MPT14 refers to the preliminary.     Or to the detailed business plan?     So if you go Mr Thabethe to Reports bundle B – Reports bundle B.     That we were using earlier Chairman.     And you go to page 3 – no this is a feasibility study.  We go to page 321.  Can you identify this and tell theChairman whether this is the preliminary or the full business plan that was commissioned?  Page 321 Reports bundle B.     This is the only copy as far as I am aware that the commission has.  Is there a bigger document than this?     You might as well tell us about the feasibility study which is the very next document at 331 just now that we talking about final and interim documen ts. The commission hasunderstood certainly the evidence leaders have understood that that document that runs from page 331 all the way to page 396 is the final feasibility study of October 2012.  Is that correct?     Excellent.      Of the feasibility.    Yes.  Thank you.  Then we have Annexure 15 which is the deviation memorandum.  We have discussed that we do not need to go into that at this point in time.  If we go to 16.  Now at    Oh Chairman we are back yes – we are back to HH…    Do not close it Chairman.    Thank you.    HH10 we are back with the affidavit andthe annexures.    We are at Tab number 16.    16 Chairman.  And here you have actually – it is just that the photocopying has chopped off some of the letters at the top.  But you have got a 16A which is on page 424.  16B is legible on page 425.  16C…    A little Chairman yes.    Reinstate it.CHAIRPERSON   That one is legible.  And the third one is 16C.    Yes.    They are not very legible.    But I will – I will deal with them as best Ican.    So if we go to paragraph 18.  They are actually set out in this schedule here Chairman.     Is – these are the payments that you believed had been made?     To Estina.    Because at the time you prepared this affidavit you were not aware?    Yes.  The second amount was R30 million.  You have it there?    That is the second item.  And these are both April payments that were effected.     Just a few days apart Chairman yes.     Yes.  And then the third one is    Yes.      Now I have a copy of the – the AG’s report.  My colleague is just getting the reference I made the error of not putting the reference in here.  I normally write it in.  My apologies Chair just if you would please indulge us.  In essence a total of R113 950 000.00 was paid.    In that particular financial year.    I actually want to point you to a particular note in that AG’s report.  Well I will come back to this point because I actually am trying to cover a bit of time.  Coming back to the same paragraph 18 we then find that in 2014 an amount of R30 million was paid.  That you will find at 16E – Annexure 16E.  And before that of course the R29 950 000.00 which you will find at Annexure D – 16D.  I just want – all I am asking you to do is to confirm these amounts that you are happy with these amounts Mr Thabethe?     Thank you.  My colleague has located the document that I was looking for.  So we are looking at Reference bundle F that is the one that was admitted into the record yesterday F.  Are you there?    And the page is 106.  Oh they did saythat. Chairman can I explain this?  My colleague is correct.      Because we took these…    It is page – if it is – there are two numbers – two page numbers.  Please use the centre page number.     And that is 1968.  Because these came out of a different bundle Chairman the one in the corner belongs to the other bundle.  For this bundle we are using EST reference 1968.     So in the middle…    The one on the right?CHAIRPERSON   We will do that Chairman.    It is Tab number 91 if your bundle is tabbed.    Now at note 5.4 what I found instructive was the second paragraph.  Because it deals with these transfer payments that we have been trying to come to grips with.  And the note is as follows in paragraph 2.“Departments are requested to provide the name of the transferee.”    Yes Chairman.    1968 which is the next page.  The – one the far right it will be 1060.    But it is 1968 that is the correct number.    Paragraph 2 Chairman is the one that I am focussing on.    I see.  Yes.CHAIRPERSON   It is 5.4.    But it is the second paragraph.    Thank you.  Yes.  So it reads as fol lows    In this – that column that firs t column?    Aha I thought so.  So the name of the transferee here the name you have put in is Vrede Dairy?     Is there any reason that it is Vrede Dairy and not Estina because Estina is the implementing agent and it is Estina that is held to account?  I just failed to understand that but I knew you would be able to explain it.    You see…;     The most important milestone for phase 2was the establishment of the milk processing plant?      And that is the plant Chairman that Estina was going to pay for in total and you had a debate with Mr Thabethe at the time about whether the money was coming from Estina or from Paras and I think that’s t he evidence you have.     At the back of your mind.     But that phase 2 according to MrThabethe, correct me if I’m wrong, would only kick in on ce phase one had been signed off.     Thank you Mr Thabethe.CHAIRPERSON    Chairman it was a three year program.      Phase one was within the first year.     And as Mr Thabethe explained if we just very briefly look at page 1378, these are matters we did debate with him.     On the 18 t h of January 2013 he signed off on the completion of phase one.     Because he at the time was satisfied that all the phase one obligations had been met.     So those are the – because we are in September of 2012 Chairman we are still talking about those phase one milestones.     Am I correct Mr Thabethe?      Thank you sir.  Then the report goes on to say in the very last paragraph Chairman that all the above activit ies can only be initiated after the land is officially handed over to Estina, however Estina has already commenced work on the feasibility studies which should be completed by the 30 t h of October 2012. And Mr Thabethe if I recall your evidence you underst ood that first R30million to be allocated to in part that feasibility ...[indistinct]      Thank you.  Over the page at page 1400 the identity of the BEE entity and the set up of the BEE entity in theagreement, I think it is clause 7.1 Mr Thabethe if the department, I actually went back to verify, you did say the department took responsibility for identifying the beneficiaries, not for setting up the BEE structure but certainly for identi fying the beneficiaries.     Am I correct, thank you.     Now Mr Thabethe I need your input on that first paragraph, in fact everything that follows under the Agri BEE     Two things arise Mr Thabethe, numberone this is September 2012, we know that the Zana Investments Pty Limited entity was part of the 5 t h of June 2012 agreement.     We know that you accepted the advice of the State Law Advisors when they told you that that particular agreement was not a valid agreement.       Hence the signing of the new agreement on the 5 t h and the 7 t h of July.  When you saw this entry that still spoke about Zana Investments on receipt of this September 2012 report fromEstina what did you do?  Did you – what was your reaction?   How did you start dealing with this issue?        I see so you were intent on using thesame company once the dairy project was established.      Is that what you are saying?     So you did not deregister it for that reason?     It is clearer to me, can we look at the     But the only custodian or shareholder on behalf of the beneficiaries whom you had nominated was told that youwere changing the shareholding structure, or what exactly – because you have told us the company existed, so who were the shareholders?      A shelf company?     And then you just take it over.     Or a shell company, which as I understand it a shell company is a company that has no shareholders, but you have got to correct me on this, what did you understand Estina to have done for you?    ...[Indistinct – mic off]     In fact Chairman my colleague has just given me the Mohama Mobung Dairy Project Pty Limited.     Yes this is what is reflected in that first paragraph Chairman that they were changing the name from Zama Mohama Mobung Dairy Project Pty Limited, so that docu ment is in reference Bundle B, which is the one, no you have D Chairman, B is a different one.    At page 426, you may just want to make a note.     So as the enterprise name, they’ve got a registration number here, there’s the enterprise name which is Mohama Mobung Dairy Project, the registration date is the 11 t h of October 2013, the business start date is the 11 t h of October 2013.   Enterprise it just says private company.  En terprise status “in business”, financial year end February.   Main business/main object entered here “no restrictionon business activities”.  Postal address 111 Shimbali Sands, Naviyasha Road, Sunninghill, Gauteng, 2192, that is Mr Kamal Vasram’s address,  I know that off by hand, by heart.     If I might just clarify the last point Chairman I can just see where your question is going.      I think.     On the following page at 427 ...[intervenes]      Which is where I think you were about to go to.     And the surname and first name Vasram Kamal, status active, ID number, director  type is a director, appointment date the 11 t h of October 2013, postal address again that Sunninghill address.     So you have a company that has been set up ostensibly the same company that this report speaks to , the same company that the HOD knew was going to be set up to house the beneficiaries of the Vrede Dairy Project, is that correct?      We come back to you Mr Thabethe because we now have Estina whose sole director is Mr Vasram.      In 2012 it would still have been Zana.     But again sole director Mr Vasram.      Who is he?     Vasram.     Sorry to interrupt you Mr Thabethe she was appointed as the sole shareholder, sole director of Estina on the 1 s t of July 2015.   
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.      Mr Thabethe’s difficulty with regards to this question because we did p ursue it with him as well is that there is a certain level of a version towards making unsubstantiated statements which may in due course open him up to legal liability fromparties outside these proceedings who may then have – go ahead and say you said XYZ at the state capture commission and we now want to sue you for those statements.  So he says he has information that he has from his position as person having operated in the Department of Agriculture. And the nature of this information and that was shar ed with him in confidence in the implementation of the project was of interest to other persons outside the process.     But he cannot make that as a statement of fact.   He may state it as an opinion.    Or a thought that he has for himself    By those third parties now  pursuing him for having made such opinion.    On such a – in such a hearing.    That is the only difficulty Chair.     So maybe between myself and Ms Gcabashe we could just confer for like five minutes.    So that we clarify what the position needs to be.    Because ultimately he needs to assist the commission, get to the bottom of the issues.     And without any fear.    Of reprisals from outside.   And we need to then couch that information or those statements in such a way that they are helpful to the commission.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair if …    Thank you chair.    If - if I may …    Add an additional point.    The issue in this instance was not somuch National Treasury itself but what had emerged was that National Treasury had outsourced to an independent outside investigator to conduct the investigation on behalf of National Treasury.  Now that now places it in the realm of an independent third party doing the work for National Treasury itself and if that information is now sitting w ith the independent third party it is no longer in the exclusive control of National Treasury.    Indeed so Chair …     But I accept your point Chair.    We will take it up during the lunch break.    Thank you.
CAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
INQUIRY RESUMES CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Gcabashe?
