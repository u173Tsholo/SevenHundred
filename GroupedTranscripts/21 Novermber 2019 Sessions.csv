CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Thank you.    Good morning – yes.   Thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you.    One second.  Bring them here.  Bring the files.  Thatis fine because they are not many.      I was changing the norm because there are not many.    Like we sometimes have so I can manage them.    Yes.    Do – do we have the bundle that has got the report of that joint committee that was appointed by government to investigate this matter.  Do we have it here?    Oh.    But it is in one of the bundles?    Oh okay no that is alright.    The small file containing the statement by Ms Maite Emily Nkoana-Mashabane will be admitted as Exhibit FF14.   Yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation?    I do not know what is happening with our microphone.  When you speak.    I do not know if there is an echo or what it is but it is not as audible.    And as clear as it normally is.  I do not know whether…    When I speak people hear the same problem whether I am clear and they can hear me well.    Oh okay.    Okay.  Okay. So just repeat what you were saying because I did not hear it.    Okay.    Thank you.    Okay.  You may administer the oath or affirmation.    You – you may sit Minister.  I just want to say before we start welcome and thank you for responding to the request that you come and share with us information relating to the Waterkloof landing that you may be able to share with us.  I confirm that you are here because I requested that you come and that you are not under any subpoena so I thank you for responding positively to the request.  I thought it was important that we should have you to come and deal with certain aspects because it is important that as far as possible thecommission gets all perspectives from role players as to certain things before it reaches any conclusions.  So that – that is why I requested that you be asked to come here and thank you for responding positively.    Thank you.  Okay.    Oh.    Oh is it – is – is there still a problem?  There is.    Okay.  How much time do they think they need to – five minutes?    Okay.    I am sorry we will just have to adjourn for a short time to enable the technicians to fix whatever the problem is.    We adjourn.    I understand the problem has been sorted out?    Yes okay.    You may proceed.    I am sorry just repeat – repeat that.    Oh okay.    Oh maybe before you get there maybe you can just tell me the whole story that you heard on television.  Because probably whatever was said might have included something about your department and then you reacted in a certain way bla, bla, bla.    So maybe what did you hear on television and then how did you react bla, bla, bla?    So what – what was said on television?    Did not include any reference to your department at least what you heard at that time?    Yes okay.    So your reaction was you know well at least there is nothing – it has got nothing to do with my department at that stage?    Yes.  Okay please continue.    So when you say you called the DG that was Mr…    Matjila – ja Matjila.    And when you say the former Ambassador you referring to Mr Koloane?    Yes and there is a third person that you say you called?    Yes okay alright.    Yes continue.    This is now Mr Koloane saying that to you?    Yes okay continue.    So – so where an aircraft would bring in diplomaticpersonnel maybe they – I do not know if that is the correct name.    But the kind of people that would require your department to be involved would you always know in advance or it would depend on the level of the diplomatic persons involved – as Minister?    Okay, okay.    Okay.  Okay.  You – you – the level at which you would have to know in advance would be from what?  From Minister level?    Yes.    And Deputy President or Prime Minister and so on.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.  Let us talk about the meeting because I take it to have been a meeting but you must tell me if I am wrong.    Where you heard the then DG.    Mr Koloane.    And the Head of HR.    That meeting.  It was a meeting, is that right?    Or was it not?  Where you heard this story?    Yes.    To be too involved?   Ys.    Yes.    But you – you did obviously want to know what happened and then in order to be able to make up your mind whether you should ask the DG to invoke some disciplinary processes?    Yes.    Get too involved.    ja.    Yes    So at that meeting did he – you said – I think you said he owned up and you said he said it was oversight, is that right?    Hm.    Hm, hm.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.     So at that stage did he say anything to you or did you know at that stage anything about the allegation that he had told some officials that the President knew about this aircraft that was going to land or that instructions had been given either by the President, President or Minister of Transport or Minister of Defence.  At that stage do you recall whether that was something that you had heard about or did he tell you about it or is that something that you might have got to know later?    Hm.    Too involved?   Ja.    Yes.  Okay.    If it is not official?    Ja.    ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  Ja, ja.    But if it is official you would know?    Yes.    Does that mean that one could have a situation where a Minister comes into the country – a Minister from another country.   Comes into the country on official business and all the documentation has been done.    But you might not know because he or she does not need to see you and does not need to see the President. In other words would you only know personally because the Minister concerned wants to see you while he or she is in the country or wants to see the President?  If they do not want to see you or the President they might be in the country and you might not know of personally but officials in your department would know.  Would that be possible?    Okay thank you.    Okay I am sorry Minister.    Before we get to that point.    You and I and Ms Norman and your council probably remember some of the details because we have had to look at thedocumentation ahead of today.    But other people might have forgotten certain things.  I think let us start with what you established the result of the disciplinary process to have been?    In other words the disciplinary process concluded and you got to know.  Tell us what you got to know had happened at the disciplinary process.      And what the outcome was and – so that we can then follow everything properly?    I saw – I saw your affidavit says that but I think the ruling says.    Suspension without pay for two months.  It does not seem to make any reference to three months.  You might be mistaken about that?    Okay.  I do not know whether my – there is a problem with my one now.  You must tell me if there is.    You can hear me?    Minister can you hear me quite clearly?    Okay.     I am saying I saw that in your affidavit.    You said that the sanction that had been imposed on him was three months.   I am saying that when I looked at the ruling of the Chairperson it said two months.  There was no reference to three months as I – as I read it.  So I am just wanting to check whether you might not be mistaken about saying three months.    Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  As I understand I think Ms Norman also says the same.    It says two months.    Okay.   I found it.    Ja.    It is at page 36 at the top.    Hm.    It is under paragraph 12, can you see it?    Yes.    Yes.    So the – your reference to the three months might have been    Mistaken.    Yes okay.    Thank you.    Hm.    Well maybe …    Before that.    I must just say this.  That last page Minister which – in which the sanction appears.     Is page 9 of the disciplinary Chairperson’s ruling on sanction.  I do not page 8 of that ruling and also there is no page – I do not have page 6.    I do have page 7.  I did not have these pages last time when there was a hearing.  I understand that various attempts have been made to try and obtain these pages.  I take it and which MsNorman will confirm including from the – from your former department probably you can do nothing about it now because you are not in that department.      So – so – excuse me.  One does not know what the Chairperson had said in page 8.    Which may have informed what he says or she says I do not know if it was a he or a she.    At the top of page 9 of the ruling – page 36 of the bundle under paragraph 11.  So – so I just mentioned that.  I do not know whether you have any recollection whether when you previously saw the ruling if it was given to you at the time whether it had all the pages?    Yes.  Yes.    Okay we have that disadvantage.  Yes okay alright, continue.    Maybe you should deal with that now so that we put it aside.   Just tell me what efforts have been made?    Well some of us     When it comes to technology have certain challenges.    But start wherever it is convenient to start.    Ja.    Is there no spare copy of page 5?    Okay.     She will read the whole …   Ja.    Yes thank you.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay.    Thank you.    And - and when you say after the sanction you mean after the suspension?    Yes.    The two months?    Hm.    I want to just - I want to go back to the - to paragraph 11 of that ruling, but before that I want to confirm that you - you did understand as the department or as the Minister at the time that as far as the sanction for his conduct was concerned.  It was only thesuspension for two months without pay …    And the final written warning    That is all that you were required to do to comply with the sanction.    You understood that part?    And then there was this other part which maybe -looks like a recommendation.  I just want to read it again.  In paragraph 11 of her rule - it was a “her” it was a “she” Ms Norman?  The Chairperson of the disciplinary hearing.    It was a lady?    Yes.    She says   So was your understanding that what you wereobliged to do was to put him on suspension without pay for two months …    And have a final written warning on his file.    That would be there for - that would be valid for six months …    But that there was also a recommendation …    With which you were not obliged to comply …    But which you could consider in your own way and see whether you would go with it or not.  Was that your understanding?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Yes.  I understand that part, but I just want to understand what your understanding was …    At the time.  Namely that as far as what appears in paragraph 11 is concerned.    You did not take that or did you as binding upon you to do what is said there.  You - you took it as a suggestion and you had to evaluate and see if you went along with it.  Whereas with regard to in - what is in paragraph 12 putting him on suspension without pay for two months and a - a final written warning whether that is what youtook as obligatory upon you, but the other one as a suggestion/recommendation which you had to weigh and see if you were going along with it.    Or did you take all of them as obligatory?    So you - you took paragraph 11 as advice?   Is that right?    And took paragraph 12 as obligatory?    Okay.  Alright.    Oh Ms Norman do you …    Not want her to deal with what happened - which she has started dealing with - what happened when the suspension period of two months expired.    She started dealing with it …    But I do not think she had completed.    I think I interrupted here when she was talking about that.    Yes.    Maybe let us - let us go back to saying how did you effect the sanction that says - that said he should be on suspension without pay for two months?  How did you effect that?  How was that effected or implemented at a practical level?    Do - do you know how it was effected at a practical level or is the position that you conveyed an instruction as to what should happen, but you do not know whether it did happen?   Yes.    You do not know for sure?    A report?    It did not happen.    Yes.  Yes.   But you also did not get a report to say Minister we have given effect to the sanction.  This is what happened.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    My understanding of the suspension part of the sanction is that he was - the department was required to - not to allow him to be at work for - for two months and not to pay him for that periodof two months.    Is - is that - is - was that your understanding as well?    Yes and to the extent that you may have given instructions to officials.  The instruction would have been along those lines?    Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Now that is a memo.  Is it from the Human Resources Unit of the department to the Director-General …    To approve implementation of the suspension without pay sanction?    Ja.  Okay.  Alright.    Okay.    You - you do not give - you then - you do not pay attention to it after the expiry of the period.  Is - is that your understanding?   Yes.  No, no.  I …    Understand, but I am just wanting to understand your own understanding of what it means to say it has expired.  Is it that you do not take - you do not pay attention to it after it has expired?    Hm.  Okay.    Ja.  Well …    Sometimes there are all kinds of interpretations of the law, but I do not think it is necessary for us to bother about that part.   Yes.    I am going to interrupt you Ms Norman.    I am sorry about that.    But I think let us before we get there …    Let us get they complete picture of what was happening with regard to Mr Koloane from the time he came back after the expiry of the two months of suspension to …    The time when you recommended that he be appointed as Ambassador for The Netherlands.  You have already started - you had already started saying he was sitting in the DG’s office doing work that a Director could do, but being paid at the level of Deputy Director-General.    So I do not know whether that is all you wanted to convey as to what was happening with him during that time.  I just want to make sure that if there is more you want to tell me in regard to what was happening.  You - you are able to tell me the full story.   And maybe going back - one step back.  With regard to the result of the disciplinary process did you get to know - I mean you told me that you got to know what the sanction was.  Did you get to know that he had pleaded guilty to three charges and to - did you get to know what those charges were?  Did you see the documentation and all of that at that time?    Yes.    At that time you - you …    You informed yourself fully …    About what had transpired at the disciplinary hearing?    You might not be able to remember now, but at that time …    You informed yourself fully?    And I take it that you would then have seen that hepleaded guilty to three charges …    And those charges - Ms Norman …    I think I would like us to refer to them.    They - they must be the same …    I was on …    That is of FF3?    Page 5?   Have - have you got that page …?    Minister.    The bundle that had the ruling of the Chairperson …    Of the     I - I think maybe somebody sabotaging you Minister.    May - maybe let us do this, because it is our - we are about to reach the time for the tea adjournment.    Let me take the tea adjournment now.    Will somebody just make sure that the Minister has got …    The same documents and bundles that we have …    And that she has all the same pages.    We must not have pages that she does not have …    And so on.    So we take the - the tea adjournment five minutes early.  So that this can be sorted out.   It is about nine minutes past now.  We are going to resume at 25 past 11.    So that that can be sorted out …    Or maybe I will make it half past, because there might be time to sort that out and you must have time …    For the tea - for tea.    We adjourn.    We were looking at the charges ...[intervenes]      I think I will prefer to go to the ruling of the Chairperson of the Disciplinary Inquiry ...[intervenes]     Where she also repeated what the charges are.    What the charges were, I think that appears, or the charge sheet appears at page 7 Minister, can you see page 7?   But I want to go ...[intervenes]     26.    Yes, okay let’s go to page 26, yes that is the Chairperson’s ruling, it starts at page 25.    Are you able to find it Minister?    Yes okay, please switch on your mic so whatever you are saying can be recorded.    Okay, now the representative of the employer at the disciplinary hearing is recorded as having been Dr H M Manzini, wouldthat be a person that you would have known at the time, or not really?    Oh okay, alright.   Now at page 26 the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry records that the charges were as follows. Charge one, it is alleged that during the period February13 to April 2013 the employee, that is Mr Koloane abuseddiplomatic channels and took it upon himself to facilitate anillegal request for landing of an international aircraft at theAir Force Base Waterkloof on the 30 t h of April 2013 between6h50 and 7h00 in the morning.Charge Two, it is alleged that the employee misrepresentedfacts in an endeavour to procure the illegal and unlawfuland/or wrongful landing.Charge Three, the employee compromised the processes andprocedures of his employer in that 14.1 there was no review and/or recommendation from the political desk in thedepartment on this particular request and 14.2 the inter-departmental coordination process that normally ensues didnot take place.Those were the three charges.  Now that I’ve read them and you have looked at them does that accord – do they accord with what you understood the charges to have been?     Yes okay alright, maybe if you can give your answer in such a way that can be recorded and heard, it accords with what youunderstood the charges to have been?     Okay, alright.  The actual ruling would you – do you remember whether it was – it may have been part or was part of the documents that you did see at the end of the disciplinary process.  This particular ruling by the Chairperson, the document that we are looking at now, do you recall whether it was part of the documents that you saw that may have been given to you to apprise you of what happened at the disciplinary process?     You can’t remember?     Yes, no, no I understand what you are saying, you know for me part of what I want to gain from your evidence is the benefit of what you knew and what you did not know about this Waterkloof landing incident and Ambassador Koloane as at the time when you made the recommendation that you made.  So I’m asking thequestion whether you recall whether you did see this document or you might not have seen the document but you knew important features about it, maybe because you were told in a memo or maybe you were told verbally or is the position that you can’t remember whether you did see it or you didn’t see it?     Yes it’s a long time but that’s why I’m asking so that I know if you say no I definitely saw it and I read or say, look I’m not sure whether I saw it or not but I think somebody may have sent amemo to apprise me of what had happened or somebody gave me a verbal report and I understood what I needed to know about the process for purposes of my decisions.     Yes, yes.     There’s lots of things you might not remember?     Ja, no that I understand but it’s important that I knowwhat you remember and what you don’t remember because I don’t want to assume that you knew certain things because you were Minister of the Department when in fact you might not have known them.  So that is why it’s important to find out what you might have known and what you might not have known.     Maybe what we’ll do – we should do Ms Norman, maybe let’s continue when we talk about the recommendation we might have to come back to what the charges are and what happened because I prefer that we will go through systematically but maybe wecan jump, let’s have that and then we can come back to it.     Alright.     I’m sorry Minister to interrupt you, maybe I’m not the only one feeling a little hot will somebody attend to the aircon but it shouldn’t be too much, okay I’m sorry Minister I interrupted you, you had just said you have to take the list that you got from the DG to the President, continue from there.     Maybe just to complete that detour maybe – was he raisin that question of Minister, are you serious that you want to train me as an Ambassador was it because he had served as an Ambassador at some stage in the past or because of any particular experience or was it simply because how senior he was as a Minister?     Yes okay.     Okay, okay.     Well she’s guiding you she must – ja.     May I interrupt you again Ms Norman, I’m sorry.  Before we get there I would like to know what the purpose is of takingthe names that you get from the DG to the President at the stage which seems to me to be the beginning of that six-month process, as I understand you and you must tell me if I don’t understand you correctly it seems that the first step you get a list from the DG of vacancies.  Now I don’t know whether you said you get – that’s what, that’s all you get from the DG or you also get names from the DG of potential candidates or is it only the vacancies you get from the DG?     You get both?     They don’t always get?     Yes I’m sorry you are getting into the part that she is still going to – I just wanted to clarify the procedure or process that leads to the appointment of any particular person as an Ambassador.  So you get both the posts that are vacant and the list from the DG, list of names but the DG doesn’t propose or nominate anybody but he or she gives you a list of potential candidates.    Ja you say internally does that mean he has a list somewhere or there’s a pool of career diplomats who are available and there’s a pool of potential political appointees from whom the President could appoint, in other words where does he get the list that he gives you, how does it come about?     Yes well I’m talking he – I’m talking in general but the particular one that you had was a he.     Yes.     Yes that’s what it’s about.     Well that’s fine, it sounds like what was said about the Constitutional Court for quite some time that we only had twowomen judges for a long time of course we have more now, not enough but also we are quick to remind everybody that the JSE which interviews and makes recommendations Judges make a very small number of percentage of people who are in that body a lot of them are politicians and politicians who are in parliament.  Okay alright, so that is what you were saying when you said you wish it was a she, you could say a she?     So the DG would know career diplomats who are available for posting.     And would he also know politicians, in other words people – and other people who might not be politicians who may be eligible that could be considered, is that correct?     I hope you don’t get any recommendation from the Judiciary as to what politicians should be appointed as an Ambassador, that would be improper.     So – but ..[intervenes].     So when you say 70% from internally, is that a reference to career diplomats?     Okay alright but you – are you saying that the DG would not have a list kept somewhere of people who are available orwould he have such a list?     Yes.     Not enough people.     Okay so are you therefore saying there might not have been a standing list that he had to consult each time there were vacancies but every six months he would need to create a list in the sense that he would need to be ready whenever you say there’s a need he would need to be able to say here’s a list.  How he got that list is his business, in other words, how he got the names other than the career diplomats who are internal, anyone who was not part of the career diplomats, how he got those names was left to him?     Yes.     Yes.     A free reign.     Now I understand from what you are saying that as far as career diplomats are concerned, he would know them.  He would know who’s available, who’s not available and what level of experience they have and so on, is that right?    Now I’m interested in knowing how he would get names of those who are not career diplomats, now…[intervenes].     Yes that’s what I’m trying to understand how somebody who is not a career diplomat would – could end up on the list.  This is just for general understanding, I know that maybe Ambassador Koloane’s situation might be different but I want to understand the generalities first.  So somebody might approach the department, let’s say a politician or former politician, I’m not sure and say, I want to put down my name if there is a post for Ambassador Iwould be available and they could give their name to the DG, is that right, could it happen like that or not really?    Yes.  But at a protocol level what I think I would do if I was DG and people were free to approach me and say, I am happy toserve.  I would put down their names and get their CV’s and keep those for when it may be necessary.  So I am trying to understand whether as far as those who would end up being on the list that would be taken to the President but who were not career diplomats whether the DG was free to say for example to the ANC, have you got names of people that can be considered either now or for the future.  Where there was a free to go the – any political party for example because I think it – I think it does happen that sometimes an Ambassador is…    Is somebody from another party.  You know I think there have been…    An Ambassador too who used to be in the DA.    I think Mr Gibson and I think Mr Tony Leon.   If I am not mistaken.    So – so I am thinking whether it was part of his job in order to collate names to make an approach to some organisations including civil societies or how did this list come about?  That is what I am trying to understand.  The career diplomats I understand.      I do not have a problem it is just the other ones.    Okay alright thank you.    Okay.  Are we back to FF3?    Okay.    No I am sorry I ended up not getting an – the answer to the original question that I actually wanted.    And I think both the Minister and I forgot about that or maybe I forgot and the Minister thought she gave me the answer.  So the original question was, what is the purpose of taking the list of names to the President at – after the – the DG has given to – given them to the Minister?  What is the purpose of that?  Is it for the President at that stage to say, I am happy about these people or to make the selection of who as far as he is concerned – I wanted to – I was thinking whether I should say he or she?  Whether it is to get the approval at that stage of the individuals for the different postings or whether it is to get an idea whether he has any issues with them but heis not at that stage making any final approval.  It is just to get an indication or what the purpose is?    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So…    Yes after he had the recommendation of the Minister?    So – so the purpose of that initial meeting betweenthe Minister and the President where you bring the …    The number of posts and the names.    Is for the President to give some indication if he has any problem with any of the names, is that right?    And if he has no problem you then go back to do some further work?    Is that right?    And you – you said that during the time of President Mbeki and I think you said President Zuma as well they would say, go back and do your work.    I got the impression and you must tell me if my impression is right?  I got the impression that what you were conveying was they would not be too interested in looking at details or names at that stage.  They would say, go and do your work.  Is that what you mean?    So would you at that stage of that initial meeting with the President to get an indication of his attitude towards the filling or appointing the people there.  At that stage would you have their CV’s and so on and would that information be sent to him ahead of themeeting so that when you meet he has had a chance to look at them?  Or how would that work normally?    To the CV’s yes.    Okay.  Okay.    And so when you leave that meeting you have an – if the President has not indicated any difficulty with any particular name you would take it that in principle he has no problem with anybody but then you would know that you must still go and do political work about these names and later on you would then make a recommendation.    And it is after that recommendation that you wouldknow whether finally he approves or not.  Is that right?    He would sign off ja.    Okay.  No thank you very much.  And then maybe because – before Ms Norman continues.  Also the – you know when – when Ambassador Koloane was appointed there were talks about him being promoted.  What is the level or ranking of an Ambassador compared to a DG and also maybe even a – I do not know – maybe I want to say even compared to the Minister because I understand thatonce somebody is an Ambassador to a country they represent the President but also I think they are referred to as Your Excellency and all of that.  So I just want to understand the ranking you know.  Is it a promotion if you have been at DG level?  Is it a promotion if you have been a Minister or is it a demotion if you have been a Minister?  Is it promotion – where does it rank?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    It – does it like carry a particular prestige sometimes because of the location where you are posted?  Maybe prestige is awrong name, is a wrong word.  I am saying – I said – I asked the question whether if you are posted to the UN.    Whether it carries a particular prestige, your posting and I am – I just said maybe prestige is a wrong word.      But you wanted to talk about that part if you are posted to certain countries or certain bodies you say you might need special expertise and experience to be appointed to those ambassadorships? MINISTER    Is an honour itself.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    But I guess the point you are making is you may have a country which is such that in order for the representative of the President of the country there to be able to carry out his or her responsibilities properly they should have a certain level of experiencein that kind of job which might not be the same if it is another posting and so on depending on the demands and the responsibilities?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  Ja.  Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Would I be correct in understanding your evidence in this regard to be to this effect?  That it may be something special to beappointed as DG of a department, as Deputy DG of the department.  Maybe it is even an honour okay.  But when you are appointed as Ambassador to represent the President, the Head of State and to represent your country in another country it is a special honour.  Is my understanding of what you are saying correct or not really?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay no thank you.    Ms Norman.    Receive.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja tighten the belt.    Ja.    Okay.  Well I do not know whether Ms Norman…    Yes.  Okay thank you.    Yes.  Okay.    Maybe a question I should have asked earlier Minister.  The list of names that you would have – you would receive as Minister from the DG every six months or as I understand the position.    Would it be a list – would the names as a norm be required to be more than the posts or would it need to be – there should be as many names as there are posts or there was no specificrule?    Yes.    They…    Yes.    No nothing specific    Okay.    Of course I am sure ja.    Yes.    What page must we go to?   47.    Yes.    Apply for appointment?    To be Ambassadors?    Oh.   Oh.    Oh okay.    Yes    I am sorry Minister again.  I do not know whether an attempt was made to put on the air conditioner.    I think it is on but maybe it should be increased a little bit.  Yes, yes. I am sorry you may proceed Minister.  DDG’s apply bla, bla, bla.    Without applying?    Yes.  Yes.  You just make yourself available to serve that is all.    Okay.    Yes.   Yes Ms Norman.    18?    Yes.    I think – I think Ms Norman it is important to read into the record the Minister’s letter to the President.    Maybe we could ask you Minister if you can read that letter?    At page – you letter to the President at page 47.  Have you got the page?    47 would be at the – at the beginning.    Okay where is your – somebody helping you.    Did they just absent?   Thank you Mr Sibeko.    Thank you.    Yes would you just read that letter aloud?    Yes – your letter itself is dated 3 June 2014, is that right, on the first page?    Yes.   Did you say 35?    Okay.    Oh.  I - I am sorry.    Minister you - you cannot see the page numbers?    I said they must not …    Sabotage you.    Oh.  Then you - maybe when you …    Refer …    When you refer her to a page maybe you must mention the divider …    And under what - what divider the page …    The document is.    Hm.    Pre Waterkloof?    Ja.    And there is post Waterkloof and there is post disciplinary processes.    I am not sure if I follow what you are conveying Ms -Minister.  Just start again.    There is no?    Ja.    Are you saying that there is no record or indication that he - after he had been posted to The Hague he repeated what he had done?    Is - is that what you - you are saying?    Because it is - it is important that I understand …    What you are saying.  It is important that I understand your perspective.    How - how you viewed the whole situation …    Because I do want to try and put myself as far as it is humanly possible …    In your position …    As you made that recommendation, because I do have difficulties with it.  So that I can tell you, but I am interested in understanding your perspective …    How you saw things so that I can see how that fits in.  So that - that is why I keep on asking you …    If you mean this or you mean that.    Okay.  Alright.  Continue Ms Norman.    I - I …    Yes.    Ms Norman I thought your question was about the fact that the - Mr Koloane’s role in the Waterkloof landing …    And the disciplinary process was not mentioned in this letter to the President …    And - and maybe the Minister has answered.  That maybe it is just that she went wider, but …    You - you see how you take it further.    Ja.    In other words if I can add …    To - to that question.  What - what counsel is saying is did you not consider it appropriate or necessary to inform the President that this person that you were recommending for appointment to receive this honour that you talked about.    To represent the President …    And the country outside South Africa.  Did you not consider it necessary to bring it to his attention that this person you are recommending is somebody who played this particular role in regard to the Waterkloof landing which was such a big topic …   And then you could say if you so choose, but notwithstanding that I recommend that you appoint him because of A, B, C, D.  You did not say that here and the question is did you not consider that it was necessary to place that before the President.  So that the President has a - had a full picture of this person you were recommending he should give this special - this honour to represent him in another country.    Yes.    Please repeat.    Because it means I did not understand it.    Well if you say to me you did not include that part in your letter to the President namely Ambassador Koloane’s role in the Waterkloof landing including what he was found guilty of in the disciplinary process and that he pleaded guilty to the three charges -what those charges were. If you say I did not include it in the letter, because prior to writing the letter I had a discussion with the President where I informed him of all of those things.  Therefore I did not see the need to put it in the letter.  It is one thing, because then you are telling me I did inform the President of all of those things, but not in the letter. In a discussion.  If you say no I did not tell the President all of those things even verbally and I did not put it in the letter, because I believed that he knew those facts, because of A, B, C, D whatever A, B, C, D is.  Then I understand as well.  So the question relates to your own judgment of what to tell the President before he could make such a decision, but also it will - it relates to what did the President know about Mr Koloane’s role in the Waterkloof landing before he approved his appointment himself. Did he know that he pleaded guilty to these charges?  Did heknow that he had been found guilty and there had been sanction or did he not know about that, because it maybe that people might know what is in the public domain, but that disciplinary process might not have been in the public domain.  I am not sure.  So that …    That is - that is where I would like you to clarify.    I am sorry.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    But he - whether he says no or yes.    Depends on what he knows …    And what he is told.    About the particular candidate.    Hence the importance of the question.  Why is it thatyou did not in your letter of recommendation to the President see it necessary to tell the President that this person that I am recommending has the following things that may be seen as negative, but here are my reasons why. That notwithstanding I am recommending that you should appoint.  So that you make sure that the President has a full picture about this person who must if appointed represent him in another country.    No, no.  That I understand Minister.    That I understand.    But - but …    Yes.    Well maybe - maybe we should start this.  Did you -do you accept that when you nominate - when you nominated any candidate for appointment as Ambassador to …    A President.    You needed to - you give the President concerned as full a picture of that person as possible.  Obvious in terms of things that are relevant.    Okay.    As a principle?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No, no I understand that.  Let me ask the question pertinently.  Did you at any stage before the President at the time approved the appointment of Mr Koloane as Ambassador for The Netherlands?  Did you at any stage inform the President that this is the man who played quite a significant role in the Waterkloof landing and that this man had been subjected to a disciplinary process? He had pleaded guilty to three charges which included misrepresenting facts and which included that he had falsely told official - officials in the Defence Force that the President knew about the Waterkloof landing or had given instructions and that the Minister of Transport at the time and the Minister of Defence at the time had no objection or also said they had been instructed.He pleaded guilty to - to that.  He was found guilty by - in a disciplinary hearing.  Did you ever place - obviously not necessary in these words that I am using, but the substance of what I am saying - did you place that before the President in a - in a discussion on any other form?    I am sorry.  Did you say normally carries or did you say does …   Normally does not carry?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Minister no I must interrupt you.    My question is simple.    Did you or did you not …?    At any stage inform the President of it?    You did?    So he was fully aware …    Of who Koloane was …    And that he is - he had gone through a process.  He had pleaded guilty blah, blah, blah.    He knew about that?    No thank you.  So - so the fact that you did not put it in the letter does not mean that you did not tell him?    No.  Thank you Minister.    Did you say 5-0 - 5-0?    I think somebody must assist the Minister.    Ja.  Go and assist the Minister.    I am - I am sorry.  Did you page 16?    Ja.    I am - I am sorry Ms Norman.  Page 3 of the statement?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.  Do - oh, you - you want to high - highlight that. “At that time he also had a top secret clearance certificate.  Therefore meeting all the criteria for the placement.”    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and that …    Is yours …    And …    Hm.    Yes.    Minister I - I had thought that we would finish earlier than - than lunchtime.  We have taken longer than I thought and maybe I also contributed to that, but we reach the lunch time at a time when I still have some questions to - to put to you.  So I thought we would be able to finish before lunch and we will disperse.  So - so we are going to take the lunch break, but I would like us to come back.  Is that finewith you?    Yes, okay.    So we - we are going to come back at 2 o’ clock, because there     There are still quite some things that I would like to hear the Minister on.    Okay.  We adjourn.  We will come back at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn.    ...of what a top secret clearance certificate says about a person who holds it.  What is your understanding of what possession a top secret clearance certificate means for the holder of that certificate?      I think the aircon might be creating some problems, if you can lower it a little bit, maybe let me repeat the question Minister so you can understand.     So my question is what is your understanding of whatit means about a person if it is said he or she has a top secret clearance certificate, what does that convey to those who know that this person has got that certificate?     Yes but that’s what I want, obviously there’s some work that the people who issue the certificate must do before they issue it but I want to try and understand in the context of the positionof Ambassador but maybe that applies to everyone who gets the certificate whether it means you are highly educated, whether it means you are a person of integrity, whether it means you are hard-working, whether it means you are very particular about doing your job the right way.  So I’m wanting to get, when you emphasise as you do this requirement, there must be something that is important about it in the context of an Ambassador and I’m trying to understand, exactly what that is. MINISTER     It’s all of the above?     You got it ten years ago…[intervenes].     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     And how regularly do they do – re-do them do you know or at that time did you know how regularly they would do them if…[intervenes].     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Oh so when you have been issued it in regard to aparticular appointment it doesn’t necessarily mean…[intervenes].     There is going to be – they’ll do another checking after a year or two or three, it just means you have it until there is another appointment, if there is another appointment then you must be subjected again.      Yes, now all of the above that we talked about thatyou’ve got to have them that’s in terms of a top secret clearance certificate but I take it that also for being appointed as Ambassador all of the above applies there as well, is that right, is that correct?     Yes, okay now in your own words are you able to say to me – to tell me what the factors or requirements are that are expected to be taken into account before a person is recommended to the President for appointment as Ambassador.  Now I know that maybe, all of the above that we have said apply but I just want you to, in your own words to say, these are the factors or requirements that, as far as you understood at the time that you were Minister of International Relations were applicable?     That you can serve your country…[intervenes].    Yes.     All odds, okay so that’s the overall one?     Okay but you say included in it…[intervenes].     If you accepted a?     Oh okay, you come back immediately?     Yes because that’s unacceptable.     Yes alright.  So there may be many factors that come in but the overall one is whether that person can serve the country and stand for his or her country against all odds.     Okay, no that’s fine.  Now I just want us to go back to FF3 will be written on the spine FF3 and then I want us to go to the document – the ruling of the Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry relating to – the one relates to sanction the other one relates to whether or not Mr Koloane was guilty of the charges.  So I want us to go to the one relating to whether he was guilty of the charges and I think it is to be found at page 25 of that bundle.  If you need assistance somebody can come and assist you, I think approach the Minister and assist her.  You’ve got it, okay.     We already dealt with what the charges were and they included charge two where the Chairperson recorded at paragraph ten which is at page 26 that,“it is alleged that the employee misrepresented facts in anendeavour to procure the illegal and unlawful and/or wrongfullanding”,And that refers to the landing of the commercial aircraft at Waterkloof.  In paragraph three on that page, the Chairperson records some objection that Mr Koloane seems to have expressed and then in – at page 27 he refers to the fact that the employer representative argued that the charges are as stated above and the evidence in support of the charges was intended to show the employee the evidence that was going to be led to prove each charge, then under four it says, “the parties asked for the adjournment of the proceedings inorder to deliberate among themselves on the point raised bythe employee”,Then at paragraph five – I think five and six are quite important and seven he says,“when the matter resumed the employee informed me that heis ready to plead to the charges as captured above with theexclusion of the facts and evidence in support of thecharges”,And then in six he says,“The employee pleaded guilty to all three charges, I wentthrough each charge in order to satisfy myself that theemployee understands the elements of each of the charges,the employee persisted with his guilty plea on each charge,then he says under seven, I consequently find the employeeguilty of charges one, two, thee”. Now it seems to me that what this tells me – tells us is that Ambassador Koloane pleaded guilty to, among others, a charge that he had misrepresented facts in an endeavour to procure the illegal and unlawful and/or wrongful landing.  My understanding of his evidence, because he did give evidence here, I did not understand him to dispute that part but also one of the things that he said when he was giving evidence here was that he admitted that in effect, he had told some officials that the President knew about the aircraft that was going to come and land or had given instructions or had put him under pressure.  One of these might be wrong but in effect, he admitted that he hadconveyed to certain officials at Waterkloof that he – the President knew about what he was trying to get them to do to facilitate the landing of the aircraft.  Now – and he said here that, that was not true, in other words what he had told those officials was not true.   My understanding is that that, that’s what he also said in the disciplinary hearing, I think when he was here he may have said – he said the same thing at another forum and I can’t remember the Committee that he talked about what it is called.  Now it seems to me that he had been dishonest in saying to those officials anything along the lines that the President had either asked him to assist or had puthim under pressure or had instructed him.  Now that is on his version, if he – if we take his version, namely the President never instructed me, the President never put pressure on me, the President did not know about the landing as far as I know, that is Mr Koloane here before me, if that is true he had said something contrary to that, to the officials and it seems to me that he had been dishonest, would that be your understanding of what it amounted to, what he said, namely the President gave instruction or knew about this but then he comes and says, no the President didn’t know about this, I didn’t speak the truth when I said that to the officials?     That would be your understanding as well?     Yes now was that your understanding also at the time, after the disciplinary process that he had actually acteddishonestly by invoking the names of the President and the Ministers, the two Ministers in order to try and get this landing approved or cleared?     Yes.     His position.     When he gave evidence.    Yes well you have gone ahead to a part that I was still going to come to but that’s fine.  I just want to read some excerpts of how one of the witnesses who came here, former Minister Ramatlhodi viewed this whole Waterkloof landing.  I’ll just really read some excerpts from his evidence he says,“now my attitude, I did not know these people, they came in  to South Africa and one day I met correctional services that a  private jet lands at Waterkloof Air Force Base carrying  wedding andpeople, wedding people.  That for me was the  last insult, I mean it was a stab at the back for those who  died because there were many who died when I was there  with them that we should get foreigners, they come in here  and then they land a wedding charter in our Air Force Base.   So we had a meeting of the Security Cluster because I was  sitting in correctional services, I told my fellow Ministers that  this is the last insult, this cannot happen in our country from  then inside we told the President, do not attend that wedding,  do not do it because you have just messed up”,And then later on he was asked whether the President didattend and he said,“Not only did they land there they actually got even theescorts of the security everything to that place there”And then later I put a question to him,“Was it your understanding that the landing of those aeroplanes there could not have happened without hisknowledge or approval or not necessarily, I’m just asking thatbecause you are saying that you said to him, you know I thinkyou must tell me if I did not hear you properly, you said tohim you have messed up this is not acceptable.  This  is notdone or something like that then Minister Ramatlhodi says,we said to him, Mr President it is unacceptable that a privatejet carrying wedding party from another country lands at ourAir Force Base, we had fought for this base to be under ourcommand so it is not acceptable, so do not grace this thingby going to the wedding, in addition to what has alreadyhappened and then he says, I had a feeling that it could nothappen without his knowledge and in fact there was talk likethat because the Chief of Protocol in the Presidency,Ambassador, I forget his surname, he was in Holland nowbecause after that he had to be redeployed to Holland andthen later he says, so apparently that fellow got a call fromnumber one as they called him those days and then he says, then he authorised the landing, then he says – he was asked,where did you hear about that if I may ask, how did you learnabout what you have just told us, that number one was calledthen he says, well we have meetings in the ANC we spokemost of us.  I cannot say I got it from so and so or the otherone but my impression was precisely that he actuallyauthorised it and then later he says, you see Chair,  Presidents I’ve got friends in the business community and so  on they do see people and so on but these ones, I felt they  were insulting even the President because what they were  doing was to show off, you know that they had captured the  Republic it is theirs.  They are not Presidents but they can  land at an Air Force Base, later he says, so it’s just important  that we get that full picture, so I just invite you – oh that’s me  talking to him, he says, Chair what happens at the Air Force  Base of South Africa is only Heads of States land there and  when they land we receive them with all the protocols either  one Minister or the other is sent to go and do that but on thisoccasion, this aeroplane from India just landed there. There was preparations because even the traffic copswere escorting those busses which were going to North West,so he says, so it was well planned reception which could nothappen without higher authority knowing, while theymobilised even the Municipalities to provide security forthose busses that went there”.I think those are the parts I wanted to read.  On his evidence he viewed this Waterkloof landing of a private aircraft in a very, very serious light, many people did, from what you said, I think you also –you viewed it very seriously because you say, what he did, that you cannot condone, I think you say but you talk about what to do after that has happened. So he – Minister Ramatlhodi was saying this was very serious, now I understand him to – when he says they were showing off, I understand him to be saying in effect, you know that place is a special place, Heads of State land there, these people are not Presidents but look at what they do in our country.  They want to show that, look we are in charge, we land where the Presidents land and when you view it like that, certainly for me how bad it was, comes back.  Is that also the way you see it or maybe you might put it in your own way to see how seriously you view it?    But Minister I am sorry to interrupt you.    There are times when I just want you to talk in general.    On the principle.    In general not whether it is Koloane or whatever.    Then when we talk about Koloane we can talk about him.    I just want at this stage how you viewed this thing irrespective of who made it possible?    That is what I want at this stage.    Who are you talking about now?    Okay.  Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes okay.  No thank you.  That …    No I accept.    Yes.    You talk for yourself?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.  No that – that is helpful Minister.  Now I think what could have been done and what could not have been done with regard to Ambassador Koloane afterwards would be influenced in part – I am not saying it is the only thing.  But in part by how we view the incident.    That is at one level.  Then there is the question of him having misrepresented facts in order to get the landing to be approved as I understand his position.  So part of my difficulty with your decision to recommend him for appointment as an Ambassador stems from this that I understand that in order to be an Ambassador – in order to be conferred with this honour that you talked about which you get when you are appointed by the President as Ambassador torepresent the President in a foreign country, to represent the nation of the country in another country.  That honour requires that at least you must be somebody of integrity.  You must be somebody who is honest.  Now I do not know about you but my thinking is that somebody who uses the name of the Head of State in this way of Ministers and says, the President knows about this aircraft.  Or the President is putting pressure on me or the President has instructed that this should be done when actually he knows that is not true is not honest.  Is that – is that your thinking as well?    Now – no I understand that Minister.  I think we – weare on the – up to a certain point at least so far we are on the same level I understand what – how you viewed the situation.  It seems to me that what you would do with him as somebody occupying the position of DDG in the long term was something that was an important factor in your mind.  Am I right?  In making the decision to recommend him.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Now let …   Yes.  Let us talk about the joint security cluster.  I do not know whether that was the correct term for the committee.    But we know what – which committee we are talking about.  My understanding is that they were investigating what the facts were.    Excuse me.  I have not refreshed my memory on theirreport recently but I do not think they would have had power to say he must be dismissed or not.  And I – I doubt whether in their report they – they were going – they would go that far.  Because they would – were not the disciplinary committee of the department.    So to the extent that you say there were two disciplinary…    Hearings.    And you mentioned that committee.    That might be – that might not be correct because they were not a disciplinary process.  You accept that?  They were a fact finding committee not for purposes of disciplining anybody.  Is –are you with me?    They could say he should be – they could saysomething along the lines that your department should consider initiating a disciplinary process.  They could say that I would imagine.    Yes.    Oh you were already?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No but what I am saying is it would not have been their place to say what the sanction should be for him in circumstances where there was a separate disciplinary process that would deal with that issue.  They – they – it would not have been right for them to – that is what I am thinking and you can just tell me.    You – for them to pre-empt.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No not necessarily.  I do not know whether when you talk about one individual you refer to Ambassador Koloane  I am not talking about – that is the only.    Yes.    Well you see – you see Minister part of what needs to be done when a problem has arisen when something like this Waterkloof landing has happened is to establish the roles of different people.    In order to see who did not do his or her job properly.  And we are not going to see that if we – if we do not look at the roles of individuals. We just deal with people collectively.  We have got to see what did you do?  What were you supposed to do?  Did you do what you were supposed to do?  Did you not do what you were supposed to do?  Why did you not do what you were supposed to do?  Because we have got to find out how did this happen.  I do not know about you but on the evidence that I have heard and what I am saying about some of these things is what I am thinking at this stage and it is not my final thoughts.  They are not my final thoughts.  My final thoughts will bewhen I finish the whole work of the commission.  But what – what – part of what I am thinking at this stage provisionally is that whatever we say Mr Koloane played – to say the least – a very significant role.    In enabling Waterkloof landing to happen.    Because he told certain key officials something to the effect that this is what the President wants.  So that is – we are therefore legitimately trying to enquire if this is the role that this person played and subsequently he was appointed as Ambassador.  Aposition with such honour.  What was the understanding of those who had a role in his appointment?  What were they – what did they know about his role and what was their perspective?  Maybe they saw matters differently and that is part of the reason why I am trying to benefit from your own perspective to say, look I was the Minister who recommended – who made the recommendation to the President.  This is what was in my thinking.  Yes I see that what he did was very wrong.  See actually that maybe he played a very significant role but nevertheless this was my thinking.  I think we are one at saying he played to say the least a significant role in enabling the landing to happen.    We are one on that?    Yes.  And we are one – we have already reachedagreement that he had acted dishonestly in telling officials that the President and the other Ministers had –knew about this or had instructions. We are one on that as well, is that right?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   25 years or more.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Oh I am sorry the microphone was off.    Yes, yes.    Continue.   When you said that they were all there, they knew about his nomination I take it you meant the cabinet, you meantsecurity, peoples officials, high officials in security – in the security cluster that many of them would have known he has been nominated and nobody came to approach you and said, no but how can you make this person an Ambassador. Is my understanding correct?    Yes.  Yes.  Okay. Now – but…    Ja.  No I understand that ja.    Ja.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Now what do you say to somebody who says thisperson’s conduct in relation to the Waterkloof landing that is Mr Koloane and the findings made in the disciplinary enquiry including his own plea of guilty to the charges that included misrepresenting facts, telling officials that the President knew about the – this or wanted this to happen or something to that effect.  That this person lacked integrity and therefore lacked an important requirement or – or quality that somebody who must be given the honour that you were talking about to represent the Head of State and the country should have.  This person did not have this very important quality and therefore you should not have recommended him. What do you say to somebody who says that?   Lawyers and so on and so on.   What about this?  That there are certain things that if you are guilty of that if you have done.    Are such that it does not matter what academic qualifications you may have.  It does not matter what good you may have done before. But if you have done that you do not deserve certain appointments.  You do not deserve certain honours.  Not that your track record is not being recognised.    Not because your high academic qualifications are not being recognised but because somewhere a line must be drawn.  You cannot for example say, I admit that I have raped this child.    But because I have admitted and because I was in the struggle …    Because when I working in that job - in that job I did so well.  Please just give me a suspended sentence.    You have to go to jail.    So I think some of the people in the country would look at Mr Koloane’s role in - in the Waterkloof landing incident and theseriousness of the Waterkloof landing incident and his dishonesty using even the name of the Head of State to achieve what he wanted.  To shame the whole country and say that person did not deserve to be given the honour of representing the Head of State of this country.    No matter who the incumbent is.    The Head of State of this country and to represent us as a nation in another country because that is a special honour.  That should never have done …    Have happened and we do not understand how Minister Nkoana Mashabane recommended this person …    Against this.  Please use this opportunity to deal withsomebody who might look at it that way.    Let us assume that you were still Minister of International Relations now …    And the facts relating to Waterkloof had happened 12 months ago.    Would you and - and Mr Koloane had played the role that we now know he played.    Would you have been able now to recommend him for appointment as Ambassador?    But you know Minister, part of the problem starts with what our values are as people.  What is our sense of right and wrong?    And do we visit wrongful conduct with consequences …    Or do we paper over the cracks.    It might - we might be dealing with gender based violence, people raping children, people raping women, people raping elderly women who cannot defend themselves, but it may be starting somewhere.    What are our values?  What values do we insist on?  What are the standards …    That we insist on.  Is the standard that we insist on that somebody can say the Head of State said we must allow this head of this - this aircraft to - to land here and therefore influence other officials to say - to think the Head of State wants this to happen and something that - that shames the whole country happens …    And when it has happened we recommend that thatperson who admits to having said - done this, knowing that it is wrong.  We say to the Head of State give him the honour to represent you outside the country and to represent us as a nation.    To him.    No.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    But he is the person who when certain officials in the - in Waterkloof were saying this is not right.  Where is the note verbal?  As I recall the evidence he is the one according to some evidence who said it has got to be done or words to that effect.  The President or number one wants it to be done or something to that effect.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    They asked for documents?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Ja.    Yes.   Well I can tell you Minister that the - the legal team of the Commission if I - if I understand correctly they - they were looking at what the practice was - what - what normally happened at Waterkloof.  Maybe there was some evidence that was given or maybe it is still coming. I know that we are not done with all the witnesses relating to the Waterkloof landing.  There is one witness who - who is still coming, but anyone who thinks that the evidence we have about Waterkloof maybe is one sided or is not complete or does not give us a complete picture.  They must feel free to make evidence available to us to make sure that we have a …    A complete picture.    I do want to have a complete picture.    I do not want to have half a picture.  That is part of the reason why I wanted to hear your own perspectives …    Before we move forward about your decision to recommend …    Mr - Mr Koloane.  So - so - and - and that is - that is - we have dealt - we dealt with it, but I think the important thing is thatyou - you have been able to indicate your - your perspectives.    I think there is one or two things that I want to - to - to check.  The conversation that you had with the former President where you told him about Mr Koloane and the disciplinary process and so on.  Do you remember whether it happened at the time you were discussing the list at the beginning of the six month period or it happened later or - or is it something you cannot remember?    Yes.    A number of times.    Ja.  Pre-appointment.    Ja.  Oh you mean …    Oh the Waterkloof.  Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Well - well - no, no the - well.  Well I can tell you this Minister before we started in the morning I thought whether we should ask you, but because it was not part of what had been planned …    I thought you might say you know maybe you should have been given notice and we …    We do intend and it has been quite some time.  I did say this publically.    We do intend asking Ministers - all serving Ministers and past Ministers …    Whether they have had any interactions with the - with the Gupta family and if so in what way.  You might remember that we already have an affidavit from the President …    Because when I spoke to the President I said President you must be the first one.  You must give us an affidavit that tells us whether you know the family and what interactions you have had with them.  No maybe I - maybe I - I think he is the one who offered to be the first one.    I said I want affidavits from all the Cabinet including you Mr President …    And the Deputy President and he said I will be the first one to give you …    And he has given us and we have made that public.    So - so it is not like we - we were not going to askyou, but we thought because we did not notify you any …    About anything.  We said this is what we are talking about.  Maybe you would feel it is - it is unfair.  So let us wait for the process where you will file …    You will give us an affidavit.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    In India.    Ja.  Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    No, but you were saying that this Waterkloof landingwas discussed with the - with the President.  You discussed it a number of times …    And you said he asked you to ask whoever whether your name was asked or something.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    So - so you say he was at some stage quite angryabout his name being used in this way?    That is the impression you got?    Yes.  Yes.    At the time that you made the recommendation and you had the discussion with him did he not say anything like how can you recommend this person who lied about me or who misrepresented things about me?    Ja.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Well it is the only - well maybe it is not the only issue, but certainly with regard to you.  It is an important point of discussion, because …    You made the recommendation …    And we - I want to understand …    What your perspectives are …    Is or are, because …    For me I look - I look at it and it does not seem right.    That somebody who acts dishonestly and does so in regard to something that brings the whole country into shame like this.  Who has the temerity to use the name of the Head of State in this way should be given the honour …    To represent the country elsewhere.  Something says to me it is like we are saying it is fine.  Even if you do not have integrity we can give you the honour of representing …    The Head of State in another country and you are representing us and you say could there not have been other people who have this quality of integrity …    Who could have been given that honour and maybe he could have - could have been dealt with in another way.  So, but Isay all of these things because as I have been saying throughout today I want your perspective …    And these are not my final thoughts.    I want to benefit from how other people including yourself …    Viewed this, but from my side that is how it appears and I wanted …   To benefit from what …    You have to say.    Okay.    Thank you.  I do not know if there is anything arising …    And I know that counsel for the Minister is pressed for time.    Yes.  There is - there is nothing.    Yes.  So, but just to round off as we - as we close.  So the position is that you are saying the President at the time was fully aware of the role that Mr Koloane had played in - in the Waterkloof landing including what had at the disciplinary processes - hearing, but and - and he was angry at some stage at least.  As far as you were concerned …    About how his name was used, but you said to him it would be justified to appoint Mr Koloane to - as Ambassador because of a number reasons that you have articulated today.  Is that right?   Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    Thank you very much Minister for …    Coming to give me your perspectives and your understanding of the issues in making the decision that you made to recommend Mr Koloane.  I appreciate that you came.  We have taken much longer than we - we should have, but I think it was in the interest of making sure that I understand completely …    What your thinking was and what your perspectives were.  Thank you very much.  You - for now we will excuse you.  You are excused.    Thank you.    We will adjourn for the day.    We are not going to be sitting tomorrow, but we will sit next week on Monday and Tuesday the Commission will hear evidence from former officials from the intelligence - senior officials.  I think Mr Njenje and Mr Maqetuka and Mr Shaik.  They will give evidence on Monday and Tuesday.    We adjourn.

Oh Chair I was – it was just the – the report that you were looking for just before it is at pages 52 to 88 of FF3.   That is – thanks – thank you.    Thank you.      Thank you Chair.  Minister is it correct that you are the Minister in the Presidency, Minister of Women, Youth and person with disabilities?    Thank you.  How long have you been a Minister in that Portfolio?    Yes.  Thank you. Is it also correct that during theperiod February 2018 to 29 May 2019 you were a Minister in the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform?    Yes.  And then before that you were a Minister in the Department of International Relations for a period of about nine years from the 10 May 2009 to 26 February 2018?    Yes.  Is it also correct that in 2011 you were the President of the United Nations Climate Change Conference?    Then lastly on – just on your brief summary of your career is it correct that during your tenure as the Minister of International Relations that is when South Africa became a member of Brics?    Is that correct?  Yes.  Minister then as the Chairperson is already allow – outlined the purpose for your presence today it relates to the Water landing – I beg your pardon Chair I see the technicians raising their hands.    They are requesting an adjournment Chair.  They have a technical problem.  They are requested an adjournment for five minutes>    Yes thank you.   They say five minutes Chair.    Thank you.    Yes thank you.    Thank you.   Thank you Chair.    That is what I was advised yes.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you very much.  Minister I believe you also served as a High Commissioner in various countries.  Could you just tell the Chairperson where did you serve as an Ambassador when during your time before you became the Minister of International Relations?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Minister just to put your evidence today in context and you are aware of the Waterkloof landing or what is the incident where a commercial aircraft landed at the Waterkloof Defence Force Base.    And I am not sure whether you had followed the evidence that has been led before the commission from various witnesses including Ambassador Koloane’s evidence.  And thathappened on the 30 April 2013    How did you get to know about that incident?  Because at the time you were the Minister of International Relations.    Yes. And was the…    Yes.  And as a Minister what steps did you take?    Yes so that would be Ambassador Matshela because he has also testified?  Is that…    Yes.    Yes alright.    Yes thank you.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.  And then – and then at whatpoint then Minister did you realise that – you had to take steps now as the Minister of International Relations after you have heard = heard the report from the radio – ag from the TV?    Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  So just by –because of your – of your experience having been a Minister of International Relations.    Was this the first incident to occur where you would have an aircraft of this nature landing at an air base and you have your Chief of State Protocol being part of that exercise and without you as the Minister having any knowledge of that?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  And at the time then when you had – just before you had directed that disciplinary hearings proceedings be brought against Ambassador Koloane did he make any mention of why he did what he did?    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Minister would it – ordinarily is it possible for any Ambassador –I am so sorry – for any Minister or Head of State at the level at which you have already identified that is senior Ministers and Heads of State, is it possible for them to arrive in the country without you knowing as a Minister of International Relations?   Yes thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  And then Minister moving then to – then after you then had directed that disciplinary proceedings should be levelled against him and then as you have told the Chair that happened.    Then when next did you get involved in the matter if you did?    Yes.    No Chair I can – I can hear you properly.   Yes.    Yes it is.  Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    May I just direct the Minister to the relevant page?    Thank you.  Minister in – next to you, you will find that there is two lever arch files.    The one is marked Exhibit FF3.  If you just turn it on the spine.    On the spine – inside – outside the spine – outside the file – sorry.      Oh sorry okay.  Sorry.   Thank you.  FF3 – yes thank you.  If you may please turn to page 36, 36 of that bundle. Chair it will be under a divider marked.    Oh have you found it?    Yes thank you.  Marked 6.      Page – yes.    Thank you Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you Chair.    Chair may the witness – may the Minister also read paragraph 11?  Because it seems to tie in with the sanction above paragraph 12.  Where you have just read on the same page.  Paragraph 11.    Yes.    Thank you.  Then upon receipt of this then what did you do Minister?   Sorry.    Yes.    Yes.    It is a she.   Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you Chair I confirm Chair the steps and we have prepared a small bundle for the Chair of the efforts that the commission had made but…    Yes Chair.  May I just…    Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  That is a document that consists of various emails but maybe we could start Chair – I know emails we have got to start backwards but I am advised that maybe we might need to just.    You want to start with the basics?    Yes.   Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Chair may we start then at page 5 of that?  Which is the latest communication again another last attempt which we made yesterday to Advocate M B Matlejwane who was the Chairperson and I confirm that I spoke to her personally and she    Page 5 I beg your pardon.    It does not have page 5?   Thank you.  May I just read into the record Minister?  I am sorry I am sure it was in – copy notes.    No unfortunately there were only three Chair.  Only three.    Yes but..    We will make it available.    Yes.    Thank you. Page 5 she says   Is an – consists of emails – maybe I should – Chair if you would let me please start from page 1?    Because then that – that is a flow of emails from …    Yes.  Page 1 it is an email from Mr Pat Mlambo to myself for my information of – he had forwarded all the emails.  We requested him to forward all the emails in relation to this matter which he forwarded yesterday.  But then below that there is an email which was sent on the 14 August 2019 at 17 minutes past 8 to the Advocate Joiney who is a legal advisor within the Department of DIRCO.  I was copied and the subject – it was from Mr Pat Mlambo the investigator.  And the subject was Re Ambassador V B Koloane’s sanction. “Morning All.  I did get hold of Advocate Matlejwane just now and she informed me that they are still trying to find the document which unfortunately and he puts in brackets [and mysteriously] is missing from her file.  Also that it has since been a while thatshe presided over the matter and in the process she has since had a new PA.  I therefore advise that you [indistinct] this into your statement that she could not find the missing pages of the sanction instead of just a telephonic discussion about it.  She undertook to do so as advised.  The following is the email address she provided for future correspondence.” Then Chair the next page, page 2, it is an email from Advocate Joyini    Yes.  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Then Minister - then you then receive the sanction and you - you - what is the steps then that you took?  Were you satisfied with the sanction and then if you were then what steps did you take?    Yes.    Yes.    It was the Chairperson.  That is …    A lady Chair.  Yes.    Thank you.    Yes.  Thank you Chair and then if - my calculation then if one interprets that sanction would be that because the sanction was dated 29 July 2013.  Then and the written warning part which appears at paragraph 12 - 12.2 - would have expired on - in January 2014.  That six month period.    Yes.  So then at the expiry of that six months period then what happened?    Sorry.    Oh, yes.    Oh.    Oh, yes.  When …   About - oh, thank you Chair.    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Just for record purposesthat part that Chair has just asked appears at pages 38 to 40 of the same bundle.  Minister if you could just turn to page 38.  There is a - a memorandum to the Director-General which - which is approved.  That relates to the sanction without pay.  I am not sure whether this is the answer …    That you have given to the - to the …    Chairperson.    Yes.  Pages 38 and 39 Chair and it is signed by the Director-General and that signature appears at page 39.    Yes.   Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Then - then Minister -then that is the first part of the sanction.  Then the second part was the written warning part …    And then if you go back.  Then that written warning would have expired in January 2014.    Yes.  How does it work practically in - in civil service?  If there has been a written warning …    And then that period comes.  It - it expires.  Does that mean that it is expunged completely from the records?  How does it work?    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you.  Chair.  Then Minister at page - if you go back to your statement now.  Thank you.  At page - in - in paragraph 4 of your statement Ambassador Matjila did give the Chairperson a background to the process, but we would like to understand the process at ministerial level when a person is to be posted now as - as an Ambassador and - and the consideration that you would have taken into account in dealing with Ambassador Koloane. Could you just give the Chairperson how does the wholeissue of vacancies that you make mention of in paragraph 5 - how does that happen and what do you mean by the cycle that you make reference to in both paragraphs 4 and five.  If you could just explain that process.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes Chair.  The page …    To - to them.  I will give you the page now Chair.  Sorry.    They appear at page 25 of the same bundle.    I beg your pardon Chair.  Page 5 of the - yes.  Page 5.  I beg your pardon.  What appears at 25 is …(intervenes).    Of FF3.  That is correct.    Page 5.  Chair, yes.  Page 5.    Minister.  Do you have the page Minister?    The relevant - page 5 on top.    You do not have five?   There is something wrong with your bundle.    Oh.  You can do that.  Thank you.  Chair that one that Minister - counsel is giving is - is the Commission’s bundle, but it is an actual bundle.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    The full set.   Yes.    Thank you Chair.    That she does not have.  Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    We will do it.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.     Yes thank you Chair.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     That would be page 26 Chair.     26 yes.     That is correct Chair yes.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you, minister you were at the point where you were just going to briefly explain the process of posting of Ambassadors and who does the Minister consult and how does that process happen.  So this is now after Ambassador Koloane had returned, I would imagine to the DG’s office as you’ve already indicated to the Chairperson and you say in paragraphs four and five you deal with the process and how they can post of Heads of Nations are dealt with in a particular cycle, that is what we would like to understand.     No.     Thank you Minister, let’s just take this situation where we have this particular nominee that would have been Ambassador Koloane and on the charges that the Chairperson has already referred to then it became known that in fact, he admitted before this Commission that he had name dropped not only the President’s name but the name of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Defence.  So would that …[intervenes].    Yes thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  Minister if you may take – just turn – the same Volume FF3 – Exhibit FF3.  If you could just turn to page 45 please?    Ff3 yes Chair.    Yes.  Page 45.      Yes.   Thank you Chair.  Just on the point Minister when you are an Ambassador in a country do you receive a salary from that country or do you retain your salary in South Africa?   Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes.   Thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Minister at page 45 of FF3.  Are you there?    Yes thank you.  There is a list of heads of nation posts June 2014 cycle.    When you were talking about this deployment are we referring to that list and when you answered to the Chairperson that you would have received a list from the DG, would that be the list of the countries that had vacancies?    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you Minister.  And then if you turn over to the next page of the – page – from page 45 you have the letter – the submission that you made to the President.    Page 47 Chair.    Yes 47 of page of Exhibit FF3.  Now at this point then when you write to the President because you have already answered to the Chairperson that you would go to the President, you would discuss the vacancy list, possible nominees, at this point then when you the as a Minister start putting down a submission to the President would the country where the particular incumbent is going to be posted to, would that have been decided already by the President at this point when you make the submission?   Yes.  And then in this instance of the – of the letter which is dated 3 June which relates to Ambassador Koloane.  Would you have chosen that country for him?    Yes.    Yes thank you Chair.  I see in paragraph 15 of the statement you – if I may just read that quickly? “During the June 2014 cycle placement he was considered for the posting together with 17 others.”So were these 17 considered also for the Haigh or were they considered for the various countries that appear at page 45?    Yes.    Yes.  So at this point then when you made therecommendation is it correct Minister that in this submission that I have referred you at page 47.    There is no mention of any disciplinary hearings, charges against him, having served any sanction, is that correct?    Yes.    Yes Chair.  Thank you Chair.    If you could read – yes thank you.    Yes thank you.  Have you got it Minister page 47?    47.    It is in the file – oh FF3 that file.    Yes, yes that is the one.  Yes if you could just turn to page 47.    Yes it is.    I am sorry I have just…    Yes, yes 47.      Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Yes.    Yes and also signed by the President on the 4 June 14?    Yes thank you.    Yes.  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  May I just ask Minister to turn to page 35 of the same bundle?      35 yes Chair.    Although – although it is incomplete.    But I will just take – page 35.  Have you got it Minister? 35.    Oh.  Sorry.    Okay.    Alright.  Okay.    She is going to assist.  Just turn to page 35.    Thank you.    Okay.    It is - it is …   No, no.    I - I think what confuses the - the Minister is that they had actually numbered the dividers themselves.    So sometimes when you get to the divider you do not know whether there is actually a document underneath, but …    (Intervenes).    (Intervenes).    The divider number.   Yes.    Thank you Chair.  I will do that.    Are - are you there?    Page 35.  Although that paragraph is incomplete, but there is something that I would like to just deal with in response to some of the questions that you gave to the Chairperson’s questions,but in paragraph 7 …    It is stated by the Chairperson of the disciplinary. “The facts show that Ambassador Koloane abused diplomatic channels and took it upon himself to facilitate the illegal request of - for the landing of the aircraft.  In mitigation Ambassador Koloane admitted hereto error - due to error of judgment.  He failed to verify if the Indian High Commission provided a note verbal to the department.  That was despite the fact that he is expected to be well versed with diplomatic protocol.” And then you went further by directly speaking to the common    And the person actually represents the country.    Now there is as finding that already he had abused diplomatic channels.    When you made the recommendation where you not at least - even in the very least concerned that having abused his diplomatic powers when he was State of Chief Protocol.  Would he not do the same when he was posted elsewhere?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.  I beg your pardon.  Thank you Chair and then - so in other words if I - if I really - just to summarise the answer you have given to that Minister is that the fact that he hadabused previously diplomatic powers that he had was not a factor that - that you considered when you prepared your submission, because according to you there had been charges.  He had served his sanction so to speak?    Thank you.    Yes.    That is correct.  Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.    Thank you Minister.  That - that answer you have given relates to now communicating to the outside world …    What he had done …    But then insofar as the President is concerned, because the portion that I read out in the sanction relates to him had abused his - his diplomatic powers and also having abused the name ofthe President and Ministers.    In that regard was there a reason why you did not place that information before the President?  I know you have answered that it was known countrywide, but in your submission now as a Minister …    Was it not something that you said you would say to the President?  I would also want you to consider this.  This is the man that has actually abused you name, but I want - I - I would recommendthat you place him in The Hague.    Yes.    Thank - thank you Chair and then just maybe lastly Minister there is at page 50 if you just turn over the page.  There is that - the agreement is that what you referred to from the - from The Hague.  At page 50 Minister there is from - do you have it?    (Intervenes).    5-0.    Thank you.
