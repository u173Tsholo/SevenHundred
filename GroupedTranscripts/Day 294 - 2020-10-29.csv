CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Kennedy, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Thank you.    Okay alright.    Yes thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you; you may proceed.    The statement/affidavit of Mr Martin Drevin starting at page 237 is admitted as Exhibit W16.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Mr Drevin.  I am going to ask you to raise your voice please.  Thank you.    Okay.      Mr Drevin are you drinking tea?  It is not right that you should be drinking tea while you are giving evidence there.  I am going to adjourn for five minutes to allow you to finish your tea so that when we continue we – you will be done.  You can drink water but not tea or eat.    I will adjourn for five minutes.    We adjourn.    All rise.       The legal team and other people must just make sure witnesses do not bring tea or food to drink or eat while they are giving evidence.  There is time for tea when we will all take a break and have tea.  Water they can have while they give evidence.  Okay let us continue.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    This is going to be quite difficult to read?  422 you said?    Did you say 422?    Oh.    Oh okay.      That is the one that I think…    I cannot read.    Yes.    Are you able to read what is written there Mr Drevin?  Oh is there a better copy somewhere or can it be made or can this be enlarged?    It can be enlarged.    Okay alright.  Would you struggle to read it Mr Drevin?    As it is?    Yes.  Okay no that is fine.    Yes.  If it can be enlarged then this can be replaced with the one that is enlarged.    Ja.    Okay alright.    Yes.  Yes well..    No, no that is fine as long as we will have an enlarged one.    In due course. I had said last year or even the year before to the legal team that they need make sure that they identify beforehand copies that are not legible and take steps to get legible ones or …    Get them – get them enlarged but I think it does not always happen.    But at least if they can attend to that even after then that will be better.    Yes.    Mr Drevin can I ask the question what is your recollection of how big the gap was in terms of functionality between LMT and VR Laser in terms of scores?    What is your recollection of the gap between the points you gave to LMT and the points you gave to VR Laser in terms of functionality?  How big was that gap in terms of scoring them?    It was quite a significant gap okay alright.  Thank you.    And in terms of scoring functionality a bidder ’s experience would not count would it?  In other words if LMT had done this quite – this type of job for some time and had experience but VR Laser did not have any such experience but maybe in terms of its responses in regard to functionality questions on functionality you might be satisfied that it should get higher scoring compared to LMT who might have some experience but maybe have not responded to questions on functionality in a certain way?    Thank you.    I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  Mr Drevin you might not be able to answer this but you will tell me.  One would have thought that experience should count for something in this type of competition.  You do not know whether it counted for anything not necessarily on functionality but on everything that was supposed to be taken into account.    Yes but what I am asking is would you not agree that experience in doing a particular job should count for something when bidders compete to do a job you know.  Somebody who has never done the job that should be something to take into account compared to somebody who may have a track record of doing the job in a certain way whether good or bad.    Sorry.    No, no I am just speaking now in general.  I am just saying I see that in terms of scoring here there is no reference to experience you know.  There is just the price, functionality and you said that functionality here did not include history or experience you know.  So I am just wondering why there would not be a factor or some points that should go to experience.  But as I say it might be something you are not able to answer.  I am just thinking if somebody says I have experience of driving a bus for the past fifteen years without any accidents and somebody says I just got my licence to drive a bus yesterday that it should count for something when you say who do you give this job to and it looks like here that there was no room for that.    Yes.  I just find it strange.  Okay alright.  Thank you.    Yes.    Ja but capability is not the same as what Mr Kennedy is asking.  If you produce a driver ’s licence that says you are permitted to drive a bus and you got it yesterday and I produce a driver ’s licence that says I am permitted to drive a bus but I got it a long time ago.  I have been driving for a long time.  We are not on the same basis I have – if I – if my experience as being – I have doing that job well that should count for something when I am compared to you who has no track record. Even though we both have the ability to drive a bus and we are permitted to.  You understand?    But now when you look at the scoring here it says you score for price, you score for functionality, you score for BBBEE and so I asked you earlier on whether when you score functionality the question of experience or track record comes in you said no.  And I could understand that.  But then obviously it cannot come under price and it cannot come under BBBEE.  So it means it seems to me that no provision was made for giving points to experience or a good track record of doing this job.  That is how it seems to me.  Does that accord with your understanding of what it was at the time?    Yes.    Yes then Mr Kennedy’s question arises is he was asking whether you did not find that strange that there was no provision to give points in relation to experience or check records?    Mr Kennedy.    Yes.    Hm.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, enlarged.       Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I am sorry.  Was that answer no or was it yes?     Oh, okay.     Thank you.  Just to complete the issue that we talked about earlier Mr Drevin.  Am I right to say, on the one hand there were three factors which was supposed to be scored, price, functionality, BBBEE?  But the questions that were asked seemed to have gone much wider than those factors.  And it seems to me that if you got a certain answer on a question that did not relate to price or functionality or BBBEE, whether you were satisfied or not satisfied with it.  In the end, it would not count for any points that you would allocate because you are only allowed to allocate points for the three, namely price, functionality and BBBEE.  And in your case, your concern was functionality and nothing else.  Is my understanding right?     Okay thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Drevin for coming to assist the Commission.  We appreciate it very much.  If we need you, we will ask you to come back again.  Okay.       Okay thank you.       Yes, we will take the tea adjournment.  It might not be as short as it usually is.  It might be extended a little bit because there is something I need to attend to.     So we might be 25-minutes or so.     But if I get ready before that, you will be told.       Ja.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I have taken much longer than I thought I would but are you ready, Mr Kennedy?     Okay, let us continue.     Okay, well I can tell you that I think if need be we can over five, maybe half past five.     Ja.  Okay, alright.     Yes.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Okay.     Yes, thank you.  Please administer the oath/affirmation.  Just place on the record that the interpreter has been sworn in.     I am sorry, we will have to start afresh.  Mr van den Heever, do you need the oath to be interpreted or you can understand English sufficiently?     In terms of the oath because it is very important, we cannot take a chance that later on you might say you did not understand parts of the oath.     Thank you very much.  Mr Kennedy, do you want to just place on record what is going to happen about the interpreter and so on?     Ja.     No, that is fine with me, maybe his legal representatives should place themselves on record and then confirm that arrangement?  Ja, you can do so from where you are, if you just switch on the mic.     Good morning.     Yes, okay, thank you.     And you represent Mr van den Heever.     Yes, thank you.     Okay, alright.     And, Mr van den Heever, you confirm as well that you understand the arrangement?     Okay, thank you.  If you struggle, you have a problem, just say so and the interpreter is available, will assist, but if you are able to understand and you are able to answer in English it is fine.     Okay, alright.  Thank you, Mr Kennedy.     Yes.     Oh, okay.     And then, Mr Kennedy, just a small supplementary affidavit can we done to say – to effect the corrections because …[intervenes]     Because one cannot amend an affidavit.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     We will have to have a different exhibit number of the other one so we must consider whether we should make this one EXHIBIT W14.1 or W14 and the other one W15.     So we should make this one 14.1, the other one 14.2.     Ja, okay.      The statement/affidavit by Mr Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van der Heever starting at page 5 is admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT W14.1. STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT OF MR VAN DEN HEEVER STARTING FROM PAGE 5 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT 14.1     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Well, we shall share the burden.     Well, we shall share the burden.     They were left out or something.     Oh, okay.     Yes.  No, that is fine.     Ja.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Ja, that is fine, let us continue on that basis.     Do I need this affidavit?     Point 2, ja.  The statement/affidavit of Mr Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van der Heever starting at page 83 is admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT W14.2. STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT OF MR VAN DEN HEEVER STARTING FROM PAGE 83 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT 14.2     Ja.     Ja.  No, that is …[intervenes]     Ja, that will be fine after all he will be testifying under oath.     But just for convenience it would be good to have that commissioned.     Okay, alright.     Yes, it will be admitted as 14.3.     Actually, EXHIBIT W14.3.     Okay, alright.     Yes.  Okay, that is fine.     Maybe I should say, Mr Govender – I am sorry, I am terribly sorry, Mr Kennedy, it is quarter to one now.  Maybe we can proceed up to quarter past one.     So we have about 30 minutes.     Before we take the lunch break.     Ja.  Okay, alright, thank you.     Ja.     Yes, I have heard a lot of evidence.     Experience.      No that is fine.      Okay alright.            Yes.        Yes, it will be I think I must just say I agree with you Mr Kennedy that Mr Van Den Heever ’s command of English is very good so…[intervene]       So I think it is good that he agreed to testify in English there are no glitches and we understand him very well.       We will not complain.      Yes.      And his attorneys, ja thank you.  Okay we will take the lunch adjournment we will resume at quarter past two, we adjourn.         Okay let us continue.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay no that is fine.    Yes.  Okay.    No, no that is fine.  That is fine.  Thank you.    Ja okay the changes that we requested was according to the clarification questions we had like for instance LNT did not include paint in their price that they quoted so they had to add the painting cost to the quotation.  But there was various like according to the questions that we asked that we needed clarity on they had to amend their quotations that they sent to us with the new information and then resend it.    I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  I am sorry.  Is this the one that is supposed to be better?    Is this the one that is supposed to be better?  This is the one which is supposed to be legible?    Oh.    Yes.    Oh we have not got a larger one or a clearer copy?    Oh okay.    Oh just that – then I am relieved because I was thinking if this is the better copy then …    We are in trouble.    Okay alright.    132?    Okay.    I am still trying to get there.  Did you say 134?    Okay.  Let me just get there.  You know when you see 132 you can think you are close to 134.    Because of…    You find yourself travelling a long distance before you get to 134.  Yes I have got 134.    What – what – sorry – what did it mean to say it was going to be a ceiling amount?  It did not mean that there will be – there would be negotiations to try and bring it – VR Laser down on the price but if there was no agree – if they did not agree then that would stay as the price.  The ceiling amount would remain as the price?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    But – but     But what does this reference to a ceiling amount add to the meaning of this thing because if there is an agreement that your price is R262 million obviously that cannot be increased without agreement?  So what is this whole thing about it is – saying it is a ceiling amount?  Is it just to mislead people to think there is some value it will not increase?  So they must find comfort in that.    Okay alright. But what it represented is they accepted this price but just said we will try and negotiate them down. But obviously if they do not agree to go down this will remain as the price.    Ja.    Okay.     W.     14.3.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  That is fine.     Ja, that is fine.     Oh, okay.     Well, it looks like that maybe today is one of those days when there is always going to be something that is goes on somewhere.  Well, it is signed by him but not by the commissioner or oaths.     Yes.     Yes.  [laughing]  No, that is fine.  I am sure it will be fixed.  I was just saying, you know, sometimes just everything goes wrong.  [laughing]       Ja.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Ja.     Okay.  Are you going to be asking questions on that one now?     Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Okay.     H’m.     What page is that on the supplementary?     What page?  Page 2?     Alright.     Yes, that is Exhibit W14.1 starting at page 5.     Okay.     [No audible reply]  ADV KENNEDY     Thank you very much, Mr van den Heever, for coming to assist the Commission.  If we need you we will ask you to come back but thank you very much, you are now excused.     Thank you.  Thank you, Ms Interpreter, you are also excused.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, that is fine.     Yes, thank you.  Yes, are you ready, Mr Kennedy?     Yes, my registrar.     The Labour Court technology has stuck with you.     Ja, thank you.     Thank you, you may be seated, Ms Geldenhuys.  I think you will need to sit on the other chair otherwise you will be too far from the microphone.  I think the other microphone does not work.  Okay, alright.     Yes, you may continue.     Just one second, Mr Kennedy.  Just pull the mic closer to you.  Ja.  Okay, alright. ADV KENNEDY     The statement/affidavit of Ms Carene Geldenhuys starting at page 151 together with its annexures is admitted as EXHIBIT W15. STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT OF CARENE GELDENHUYS STARTING AT PAGE 151 TOGETHER WITH ANNEXURES HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT W15.     You may proceed.     Yes, non-controversial matters.     I am sorry, who was saying that?     Did you have any impression as to whether, whoever came up with the idea to put up this nonbinding agreement, was actually trying to avoid getting into a legal binding agreement because he or she could see that there could be trouble here?   You could say you did sign an agreement.     But you could always say to Mr Ntshepe you did sign an agreement.     This is not what I wanted.     You and your team were caught out.     Yes, Mr Kennedy.     And did you contemplate that if at all possible you wanted to postpone for as long as possible the day when you might have to make – to tell them but we have a problem with this?     Yes.     Ja, okay.     Ja, she said it is a window, she could see.     But your position seems to have been clear that your position at DVS, that you had no need to go into any agreement with VR Laser, you were fine.     Yes, okay.     Now did Mr Steyn or van der Merwe, who was the CEO of DVS?     Mr Steyn, did he ever tell you or his team that he had confronted Mr Ntshepe and say, but I don’t understand what you are asking us to do, tell me what I – I don’t understand the logic, why do we need to give some business to these people and if he said he did, what answer was he given because from what you have said, it’s clear you and the team at DVS which must include Mr Steyn, didn’t see the need for DVS to give some business to VR Laser but did he confront him and say, give me a rational reason, I don’t understand why you want us to do this and did he give him any reason?     No, no my question was whether Mr Steyn ever reported to you that he had asked Mr Ntshepe…[intervenes].     You don’t recall?     But from what you are saying, are you suggesting that there were meetings between yourselves from DVS or some of you, with Mr Ntshepe, maybe other people, where you did tell him this or…[intervenes].     In a meeting.     And there is no indication that he had an answer for them, a proper answer.     Ja, okay, alright.     You must have been in a difficult position at DVS?     Because it seems to me that you could see that there was something untoward into this whole thing.  You had discomfort associating yourselves with it, you had discomfort being party to any agreement that would give VR Laser some business in these circumstances where you were satisfied you had all the capacity to do the work that you were doing but at the same time you seem to have had some pressure and you had to try and walk quite a tight rope between having to incur the wrath of your top leaders and – or lose your business, your core business, you had to try and say, how do we strike a balance and still, not do what seems to us to be wrong but at the same time, still be there or not lose, does that reflect, more or less what you think your situation was?   Yes, so it was based on your assessment of your business?     To say we don’t need to do that but obviously if somebody keeps on saying do it and you can’t understand why, your thoughts have got to start wondering.     Ja, okay, alright.    What page is that – I heard 193?    Oh okay.    Yes.    I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Kennedy I have lost you.    Oh the top – the top one.    Okay alright.    Do you know whether the reference to chairman in that email is reference to the chairman of the Denel board?    Corporate.    And at that time who was that?    Mr Mantsha?    Okay alright.    Yes you must just think it through carefully because there are boards for different entities and then there is the overall board for Denel …    Yes.    Yes SOC.    And the chairman of that board.    Okay.     Okay.     And was this a binding one?     [laughing]       [laughing]       You ...[intervenes]      H’m.     But this agreement, was it signed after you have gone to the board, Denel Board?  Because I heard earlier on the idea that well you would have to go and tell the board and see what it says?  Had that happened by the time this agreement was signed?     Oh.     In terms of the emails exchanged, it is not clear whether when Mr Ntshepe said this is approved, he meant that that had been approved by the board or whether he meant as acting Group CEO, he was approving it?     You cannot ...[intervenes]      H’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  Oh, okay alright.  Mr Kennedy.     [No audible reply]      No, maybe you are able to assist me in terms of the question I was asking?     Ja.     Ja, okay, okay.     Ja.     H’m.     You see, what stands out here is, that it does not answer the question raised by Johan to say who has the authority to approve this and because he says he thinks it is the board but he says he is not sure.       I am sorry.  We are at five.     How does it look like in terms of how much time do we need?     You think we will finish at half past?     Okay alright.  Maybe let us just take a short adjournment.  Maybe five minutes.     Ten minutes.  Maybe let us say ten minutes because five minutes is going to finish while you are walking if you are going out.     Okay let us take a ten minute break and then we will come back.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     So by the time of the agreement that we are talking about now, the binding one, had the instruction to divisionalise DVS been carried out or not?     Oh.     Were you working towards it in the same way you were working towards a nonbinding agreement?     Oh, okay.  Yes, Mr Kennedy.     Ja.  No, no, you do not need to.     So you were not very confrontational or not but you knew what you were trying to do.     That is VR Laser?     And by the time of this email you recall how long the agreement had been in place, for how long it had been in place?     So this was about a year and a half?     Okay.     But I may have missed something.  I understood the idea of restructuring and maybe Mr Burger taking over and the DVS CEO being under him if DVS was divisionalised, as you put it, but if DVS was not divisionalised and remained legal entity on its own, I do not see how that talk would fit in unless the talk may have been meant to intimidate the DVS executive or soften them up because they were being difficult.  In other words, to make – to kind of threaten them, you know, if you continue like this, this is what may happen, you had better behave.     So you had a de facto restructuring?     But not a de jure restructuring.     But from a certain point you at DVS and the executives knew that from now one we are under Mr Burger, or whatever.     Ja.     Oh, yes.     Yes, yes.     So it was from that moment.     Ja.  Yes, Mr Kennedy?     Who said your people are jeopardising Denel’s business going to VR Laser?     So in other words saying they should not be going there?     It is quite a telling remark.  Yes, okay.     Ja.  No, no, we understand.      We understand, ja.     Thank you.  Thank you very much, Ms Geldenhuys, for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very much.  If we need you to come back we will ask you to come back but thank you very much, you are now excused.     Thank you.  Mr Kennedy, tomorrow your estimate of how much time we need for your witness is what?     Yes.     We can start at nine.  Should we start at nine?     We want to finish at twelve.     Ja.     Yes.     Okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     That is fine, so tomorrow we will start at nine then.     Yes, we will adjourn for the day and tomorrow we start at nine.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good evening Mr Seleka, good evening everybody.     I apologise to everybody, particularly to you Mr Tsotsi because we asked you to come this evening and then somehow I forgot that we have an evening session and when we finished at five I said no we will adjourn until tomorrow, so – but arrangements had been made and I apologise to the team as well, the legal team and the television people who find themselves having to work beyond the time that they have planned and to everybody, I am grateful that everybody is able to continue. Thank you for coming Mr Tsotsi. Okay, alright.     Yes, Mr Seleka are you – yes we will have to I think get Mr Tsotsi to do the oath afresh before we proceed.   Let us do that, yes.     Thank you very much Mr Tsotsi.  Just for the – to inform the public we are having an evening session this evening in relation to Eskom in accordance with our programme for this part of the year where we are trying to finish the hearing of oral evidence within the time that we have been given so some of the evenings we are going to sit during the day, finish at four or five, take a break, come back, continue so this is one of those sessions and in next week and the weeks to come we will be having more of those so we will have day sessions and evening sessions to try and finish the work of the Commission. Okay, thank you.   Mr Seleka?     Maybe you will - it might help for – to just recap where we are so that the public can follow.     And Mr Tsotsi has given evidence a few times before, he is here because he needs to finish, there was some – there’s some issues that had not been dealt with when we had to adjourn last time he was here.     You had learnt that the Minister had attended the meeting, is that what you are saying you were aware of?     Just for the record we are using Eskom Bundle 07A, is that right?     Yes, and what page will I find that?     158?     Okay thank you.  Yes.     And look at, remember the black numbers as opposed to the red numbers.     Use the black numbers.     Ja.     Are you back to Mr Tsotsi’s bundle.     Okay.     158?     Continue.   Of course Mr Seleka in putting to Mr Tsotsi other witnesses’ versions where they don’t contradict him, his version, or don’t implicate him in any wrongdoing you don’t have really to go through that unless you want him to confirm something.     Ja and I take it he has had a chance to read all of these emails.     Ja, if there is a particular one here he feels he would like to comment that you don’t touch he may do so but the ones that you need to focus on the evidence you need to focus on ...[indistinct] where they either say something that is inconsistent with  his version or they contradict him or they implicate  him in some wrongdoing or if you are wanting to confirm a particular version.     Well I don’t know what you have in mind Mr Seleka, but I do recall that I think Dr Ngubane it would be fair to say to a very large extent he struggled to explain at least some of these charges.  I do remember that I asked him whether he agreed that they could not charge Mr Tsotsi for involving Mr Linnell in the affairs of the Board and Eskom and the role he was to play, because they had a chance to tell him we don’t want this man here, you have to follow procedures and my recollection is that Dr Ngubane could not defend that part of the charge and he sought to say something else, I can’t remember what he said and – which my impression is might not have been in the charge sheet, in the first charge. So where, whatever they have said it doesn’t really contradict seriously what Mr Tsotsi has said, we don’t need to spend much time on it and the best – one thing you can do is just mention to Mr Tsotsi what they said and if he has comments he can comment and move on.  It is only in regard to those where they may have sought to resist or justify their decision to charge him with the various charges.  Now I know that on the one about the media statement both – certainly Dr Ngubane I seem to say really struggled as well in the face of questions to defend that.  But you might have a better recollection and you might have a recollection that is different from mine.   All I am simply saying is where – where we do not need to be detained where they did not come up with – they were not able to defend the charges.  But there may be one or – that they seemed to defend I am not sure but even with that I am struggling to remember which one.  But you are young I saw you – you – and your junior is even younger so you might have a better memory than me.    Okay.    Yes okay alright.    Ja.    Ja.    I can understand Mr Tsotsi.    Yes.    Ja no I think Mr Seleka on that one..    We have a problem because I asked Mr Tsotsi – Dr Ngubane why the Chairperson would have wanted to leak a media statement when he knew that all he wanted is to get the board to approve and you remember what Dr Ngubane’s response was.  He said something like about a ego or something like that.    So – so continue but really…    Ja.    If other board members come and tell us something different then you know we might bring you back you know.  There are some board members who must still come.    Like Mr Romeo Khumalo but…    There are those that have testified on this I think there were some challenges.    I think did they not say CEO – acting CEO or maybe not acting CEO but ja.    What do you say to that?    I wonder Mr Seleka whether…    In the minutes or in the transcript recording this part is reflected in any way…    Oh okay.    Have I got the Reference Bundle here?    Okay and what is the page number?    230 okay.    You can continue as soon as Mr Tsotsi has found the page in the meantime.    But you will know whether we need to check or where to find it.    And we can do without …    It just in [talking over one another].    Okay.    So this is – these are minutes of what meeting?    Of what date?    Oh so this is now Mr – they are recording what was said on that date.    About something that happened before.    And it would be interesting now if there is anybody who said no, no, no but you said you want him to act.    And there is no indication of anybody who contradicted Mr Tsotsi to say that is not what you told us at the board two weeks back or whatever.    Ja.    I remember.  Okay no that is alright.    Well it looks like Mr Tsotsi these minutes seem to be consistent with what you are saying in terms of what you say you had told the board about Mr Sekhasimbe because you are saying – you had told them that although he would have been in your view the right person to act he was suspended and therefore could not which is what this says.  Ja okay.    Ja well at least there seems to be an acceptance by many of the witnesses that the idea that he and the other executives should be suspended is an idea you got for the first time at the Durban meeting.  So there is that but he will give his evidence and we will hear.   He might have genuinely believed that it was because of that and maybe by now he has heard a lot of evidence if he is following about where the idea of the suspension of the executives seems to have come from.  So he will come and he will give evidence.    Oh.    To Mr Tsotsi.    Yes okay alright.    Yes.    Okay alright.    The Reference Bundle?  Not the Reference Bundle.    Oh what page?    Hm.    Yes.    But – was it something acceptable for any executive at Eskom or any SOE for that matter other than at least the CEO Group CEO to bypass this Group CEO, bypass the board and go and speak to the Minister about issues at work?  Was that something that was permitted; was that using the right channels? Was the position not that normally you would be the contact person for the Minister but obviously if somebody needed to complain to the Minister about you they would not ask you to speak to the Minister about it. But then one would have thought that any executive would speak to the Group CEO and it would be the Group CEO who one would have expected would first raise the issue with you or with the board.  But certainly if the Group CEO approached the Minister about a complaint relating to the board or to the chairperson one might be able to understand that compared to an executive lower than the Group CEO bypassing the Group CEO; going to the Minister to speak about the chairperson of the board.    The Minister.    The channels.    Yes.    Okay alright.  And the Minister does not seem to – does not say anything here about having taken objection to this executive whoever it was if it was not the Group CEO bypassing the Group CEO and going to – and the board and going to talk to her.    Yes.    The executive ja.    Yes, yes.  Mr Seleka.    Well it does appear on her version – on her own version it does appear like she did not give you a chance to – to respond to whatever the executive concerned or board members who might have spoken to her what they really said you had done wrong.    It does appear she on her version she had made up her mind whatever they have told her you have done.    And she was then reprimanding you and saying stop it otherwise I will find somebody else to do your job.    That is the impression one gets from her own version.    Oh.    Yes.    So his suspension was found to have been unfair?    That is now we are talking about Mr Sekhasimbe?    Um.    Yes Sekhasimbe okay.    So you just making the point that your views that you held about his suspension were vindicated because the CCMA found that the suspension was unfair.    Ja.    Okay.     Ja.     Of course, she was not there.  She is just saying this based on whatever reports she had received.     Ja, but I do not know whether you want to first check with Mr Tsotsi because not somebody who was there.     So you see?  So I do not think you should... raise that with Tsotsi.     The people who can speak about that, the board members.  She must have received certain reports.     She is interpreting certain things.  So I do not think you... I think you should move on to something else, ja.     Because she was not there.  She was not part of the board meeting.     Ja, okay.     H’m.     Yes.     H’m, h’m.     Have you tried to get those minutes?     Ja, I think the one he is talking about is...[intervenes]    ...between the board and the ...[intervenes]      ...and the minister.     Yes, those minutes he is talking about.     Have you asked for them?     But we know whether minutes were taken.     What... I do not know whether during your time, the board or members of the board had... ever had the meeting with the minister other than in a situation where the minister came to a meeting of the board in which case there would be minutes.  But if they went to see here, would minutes normally be taken?  Do you know?     H’m, h’m.  If it is formal business ...[intervenes]      ...because they are coming to discuss formal business.     But in terms of your experience, had there been such meetings between the board or members of the board delegation with the minister outside of board meetings?  And if so, would there have been minutes that were kept in the past?  Because you were a long-serving member of the board.       Ja.     Ja, okay.  Well, at least what should be done is to get people who would know that about that meeting, such as the person who was the chair.  The person was the chairperson of the board at the time or who was acting as chairperson and the company secretary if her or she was there in that meeting with the minister.     To depose to affidavits to say    Ja.     Okay let us continue.     Well, I do not know if the two are not talking at cross-purposes.  Were you asking him whether he was not invited to the meeting between the board and the minister?     Okay.       Of 20 March?     That is the meeting that we have been talking about?     Yes.  And Mr Tsotsi, you said you were excluded from the meeting.  Were you saying that because the decision to go and see the minister was taken in a meeting from which you were excluded?  Or was there     Yes, the meeting with the minister?     Oh, okay, okay.     So that is fine.     Okay that is fine.     Yes.     Yes.     But the meeting of the 19t h, is the position not that that is the meeting where they asked him to leave the meeting.     And when he comes back, Dr Ngubane is chairing.     And suddenly he is just a director now.  He is no longer chairperson.  From then on, did he ever come back to be a chairperson?  Mr Tsotsi, you never came back to be chairperson or did you?     After that, ja.     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Ja. I remember you mentioned that in the past.      H’m, h’m.     Yes.     Ja, okay.     In your absence?     H’m.      Mr Seleka, has your team asked for the minutes of those deliberations?     Yes.     Ja, ja.     H’m?     yes.     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Ja.     Ja, that is for the 19t h.      Which is also important.  It is good that you have said that.       But he has added now something in regard to the 30t h, the minutes.     He says after he and his legal team had made a presentation, they were asked to leave for the board to deliberate, I guess on the presentation.  And he says he has asked for the minutes which would cover those deliberations.     But he says he has never been furnished with those.     And he says the minutes of the 30 t h ...[intervenes]      ...reflect that those minutes of the deliberations were kept separate.     Ja, so which means they must be in existence somewhere.     Yes.     H’m.     I think ...[intervenes]      I think make a note and the company secretary must be asked for the minutes of the board’s deliberations after the presentation by Mr Tsotsi and his legal team ...[intervenes]      ...on the 30 t h.     Ja.  Okay alright.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  Well, Dr Ngubane’s evidence – I do not know whether this is what may have emerged from those deliberations – his evidence was that somebody – I do not     Ja.  So it is just that I do not know whether he said that was discussed outside of the deliberations of the board or whether it was during the deliberations.  But we know that in the end, that is what happened.     Yes, yes.  But it might be helpful to get those minutes if they exist.     Okay alright.  Let us move on.     We are at twelve minutes past eight.     Oh, that is Ms Klein’s evidence?     Okay, okay.     Okay.     Do we know what page it is in the bundle?     But if you do not think I need to go to it, it is fine.     Maybe it is fine, I think.     You can let me know later on.  You can put to Mr Tsotsi what you want to put.     Page?     On the same bundle?     Oh, okay.     But continue.     Just repeat the page for Mr Tsotsi.     447.     I am now at 454.  You say I must go back to 447?     Oh, 457?     Okay.     Okay yes?     I see Mr Khoza says that as well.     Ja.  He certainly says that at paragraph 47.     He says    And he thought that they had been prepared by Mr Linnell.     That is what he says at 46 but at 47 he     H’m.     But I ...[intervenes]      Yes, I do not know Mr Seleka we should order to let him comment because in effect, Mr Khoza seems to be retracting that or is that not your understanding?     Ja.  He first says he thought he got them from Mr Tsotsi and after they had been prepared by     Ja.     Yes, move on.  Move on.     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka.     Well, if you want to ask him about that, you can ask him.     Ja, ja.     Yes.     But are you sure that this was your composition?   You remember there is another composition that we are still looking for, I do not know if you found it in the meantime.     Oh.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, it obviously means that, I would imagine.     No.     Yes, would not have imagined that you would spell Khoza like that, Mr Tsotsi.     H’m?     I mean, I cannot imagine that you would spell Khoza with an x.     Unless it was your secretary and your secretary was someone who could make this kind of mistake.     And then you did not check properly.     Ja, I mean it is...     But also, I see you were going to serve – you, being Chairperson of the board, you were going to serve as a member – as an ordinary member in various committees, is that normal?     If you are Chairperson of the board do you not chair just the board and you do not go to other committees and – because they must report to the board, those committees, and you are chairing the board?     Just looks very …[intervenes]     It looks very strange to me because if the Chief Justice who chairs the heads of court goes to a committee and he is then just a member, an ordinary member of that committee, that committee is chaired by somebody else, it looks very awkward if the President, who chairs a cabinet meeting then goes to a subcommittee of the cabinet and then he attends as an ordinary member and that committee is chaired by somebody else, it is strange.     But is what you intended because one of the things I think Mr Seleka is looking at and I am looking at is whether this genuinely came from you.  But if it genuinely came from you, that is what you say and we accept.     It came from you?     Yes.  Okay, alright.  In which case obviously your secretary would not have put your name in certain committees unless you had said …[intervenes]     Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.     Well, probably secretary typed but if she typed or he typed what he said she should type then it is not her fault or his fault.  I think what Mr Khoza - Mr Tsotsi, I am sorry, Mr Tsotsi has said is the composition reflected what he wanted.     Ja.     Well, he has said it is his.     Ja, he has said it is his.     So you accept that, ja.     Okay.     About the composition?     Ja?     Yes because in regard to that committee or those committees she has the power.     Now in regard to other committees has she got any power?     So to the extent that she says in the email that the composition of all the committees of the board is subject to her power, she has the power to decide that that would not be correct.     Yes.     Yes but not because she has the …[intervenes] MR     …to the decide that.     Ja.  In her affidavit does she repeat this?     I guess we are wrapping up now, hey?     There may be – there may be staff who might still need to go some long distances home who did not know they have to stay longer today.  It is all my fault.     Yes.     What does she say?     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, no that is fine, if her affidavit says she is only responsible for those two committees, that is fine.  When she comes she will give evidence about that email.     And she can provide clarification.     So is the position that for – that in regard to all the committees you or the board ended up basically letting her have or decide the composition.     That is what ultimately happened?     Yes.  Because in the email she had said it is her, as the shareholder she would decide.     Okay, alright.     Ja.     Well, unless – well, you remember your evidence previously.     Was that you received a composition, a fax or email from Mr Salim Essa.     With how the committees of the board should be composed of.     And you were not happy with that.  You sent your own composition of the committees of the board to the minister.     And then you said – you testified and you said the minister sent you her composition and you said her composition of the committees of the board was exactly the same.     As the composition of Mr Salim Essa that you were not happy with.     You remember you said that?     Now it is possible – if you say your composition of the board committees of – is it 26 January?     If you say that was the culmination of the to-ing and fro-ing involving you and the minister and Mr Salim Essa and if you say that that composition was what the minister wanted and if what the minister had previously sent you was the same as what you had received from Mr Salim Essa, then it may be that the minister sent you a list with those spelling errors because those spelling errors maybe were included in Salim Essa’s list, composition, and what you did not do is to correct those spelling errors.  That is one point of looking at it.     Because for you it really seems very strange that you would spell Khoza with an x.     But anyway, I think…     Was that your last question?     If there are any other questions you can always send them to Mr Tsotsi.     With a request for him to respond to them by way of an affidavit.     So that – ja.     Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr Tsotsi.   Sorry – oh yes…     Oh, I looked for you here because I think – I thought last time you were sitting this side.  I may have been mistaken so I did not realise you are there.   MR     Yes, yes.     Two questions?     Okay, alright, yes.     That is re-examination, hey?     Ja, okay, alright.     Yes.     Okay.     Ja, you mentioned that last time.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     No thank you, I think that is the right approach ja.  Okay Mr Tsotsi thank you very much, I know that you will still come back because – or Mr Seleka knows that he thinks he has troubled you enough, I thought he might be needing you for the secondments but now I remember you were no longer there during the secondments, ja. Okay, thank you very much Mr Tsotsi for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very much and thank you for coming in the evening.     Thank you very much.   It is two minutes to nine, we adjourn, thank you to everybody for all your cooperation.  Again I am sorry to those who did not know that we were going to end up working so late, next time we will try and make sure everybody knows well in advance. We adjourn. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Morning Chair.    We are thank you Chair.    Chair may we – may we indicate that today we plan subject to your directions to be calling three witnesses.  The first will be Mr Martin Drevin from DLS.  The second will be Mr Hendrik Van Den Heever also from DLS.  And the third witness will be a Ms Carene Geldenhuys who was at the relevant time at DLS and they will all deal with aspects of the procurement process relating to some of the relevant contracts.    May we then – may we then with your leave ask to call Mr Martin Drevin.    D-r-e-v-i-n and Chair all of these affidavits are to be found for today are to be found in the same Denel Bundle 04.    And Mr Drevin’s affidavit is Exhibit W16.    May I then ask leave to call him and to have him sworn in?    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Drevin you have in front of you a file with a section open already for you against marker W16 and if you can look at the page number at the top left hand corner the last few digits 237 you see that?    Am I correct that this is the first page of your statement/affidavit?    If I may take you now to page 251.      Do you see near the top there is signature above the typed name Mr Martin Drevin. Is that your signature?    And is it correct that you signed this in front of Commissioner of Oaths?    Right thank you.  Have you been through this document and its annexures and can you confirm for the Chair please that you are satisfied with its contents and that those contents are true and correct?    Thank you.  Chair we would then ask formally for your leave to admit the affidavit with its annexures starting at page 257 that is Denel Bundle 04 Exhibit W16.    Thank you Chair.  With your leave may I lead the witness on what I believe is uncontroversial.    Issues relating to his background etcetera?    Thank you.  Mr Drevin you currently employed at DLS is that correct?    And what is your job title?    Hoefyster Phase 2?    Right.  You are en engineer by background?    Right.  A senior engineer.  You joined as a senior engineer in 2008, is that correct?    Were you involved in relation to the Hoefyster Project Phase 1?    Right.  Now you then refer to in paragraph 13 to your being involved in – in relation to the contract variation order.  What did that involve?    Right and then you…    Thank you Mr Drevin.  You then refer to your being moved in October 2011 to a newly created department in Infantry Systems.  Did this – did this mean that you were carrying on dealing with issues relating to Hoefyster or were you removed from that?    Still involved.  And then there was a further change in your job functions in 1.5 where you were now tasked to concentrate only on Hoefyster.    During the design and manufacture etcetera.  And then you refer to DLS being awarded the Hoefyster Phase 2 order and you then became responsible for the execution of the order and that was around October 13.    Right.  And then you set out your previous work background.  Then you refer also once you became Program Manager for Hoefyster Phase 2 your responsibilities in 1.7.  Is that correct?    Alright thank you.  Now let us get to the – the meat of your affidavit.  If you can turn please to paragraph 2 that starts on page 240.      Right.  Now here you are dealing with the platform hull request for quotation abbreviated as RFQ, is that right?    And so there was a request for quotations issued in 2012 and if you then look ahead to paragraph 3 there was a request for quotations issued in 14.  Were there two different separate RFO’s the one in 12 and the other in 2014 for the same thing?    Was for what?    For updates. I see so it related to the same …    The same subject matter.  Right.  Now you refer to the RFQ in 2014 I am in paragraph 3.2 being synced out as an updated request by Mr Henk Van Den Heever.  He will be the witness that follows you.  And then you refer to the specification.  You were not involved in it?    Yes.  Who in fact had to draw up the RFQ?    Supply Chain.  Right. And you are on the technical side rather than the Supply Chain side, am I right?    Okay.  Alright and then you refer to input also from a quality assurance department.    And …    Yes. MR    Right.  Can I just please ask you again to try and speak a bit more clearly and a bit more loud so we can all hear and the recording can pick it up.  Thank you.  Now you then refer in paragraph 3.6 to the updated request for proposals.  May I take you in the same bundle to one of the annexures – page 252?      Right.  Now 252 is one of the letters that you refer to with the name and signature of Mr Van Den Heever the Procurement Officer for DLS, correct?    And 252 is a letter sent to LMT.  253 is also a letter to LMT a longer letter.  And – and that is accompanied by certain emails.  Then I can take you please to 259 that is a letter from Mr Van Den Heever to VR Laser.    Another one at 260, is that correct?    And then a further letter – a series of letters to DCD from page 264.    Right.  Now so these were three entities LMT, VR Laser and DCD.    What was the purpose of this letter as you understood it?    Their offers.  So had they – had each of these three entities submitted proposals previously which were now being asked to be updated?    But if they – my question is simply this.  If they are being asked to update proposals presumably they submitted original proposals prior to being asked to be updated.    And when did they do that?  Was that in response to the 2012 request or the 2014 request?  The original proposal.    2012.  Now in that process in 2012 had it been submitted – had it been advertised generally to the marketplace resulting in only three people responding or had they been specifically invited in 2012 to submit proposals just those three?    Invited.  Why was it not put out as it were on open tender in 2012?  Are you able to answer that?    Okay.  Alright.  Now if I can take you back please to your affidavit.  Paragraph 3.6 and we here now at page 241.  You refer to a request for the updates to contain a breakdown of prices, what were they being asked for now was the price for the armour hull – the armour hull excluding mine protection. Then a price for mine protection only.  And then prices to exclude all jigs and fixtures as Patria was responsible for the supply of these.  And then further – yes.  Now why were you as Denel Land Services wanting to have a split of the prices – a breakdown in the prices?    Alright then.  Thank you.  Now you then refer to responses having been received from these three entities, correct?    May I just have a moment Chair.      If I may take you now please Mr Drevin to…    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair I must apologise I had not noticed I have got bad eyesight and I am at an angle.    Where I had not noticed so I apologise otherwise I would have dealt with it but we will bear that in mind for future witnesses.    Thank you – thank you Chair.      Now the – if I can take you please to page 268.  Is this the revised proposal or response that you refer to in your affidavit as having been received from LMT?    And if I can ask you to turn now to page 274 is this the response that was received from VR Laser?    And from page 282 is this the response you referred to in your affidavit as having been received from DCD?    Now you refer in your affidavit to a bid evaluation committee in 2014 a cross-functional team.  Were you involved in that?    In what way?    Right.  And your affidavit sets out the various other members.  We do not need to go through those.  They include though your name as well as Ms Malahlela the Supply Chain Department Head from DLS together with her colleagues.    Right.  And then there are various other people with technical and business roles.  Now you have referred in your affidavit to the three suppliers attending feedback sessions at DLS’s premises in its Eagle board room and these were seen individually for the feedback session VR Laser, DCD and LMT.  They were seen at different times that you have set out in your affidavit.  Did you take part in those feedback sessions?    I am sorry just speak clearly.    You would have been there?  Okay yes you have referred to the attendance register and then if I can take you please to page 389.  It is Annexure MD10.  It is headed Meeting with VR Laser.  And then there are a number of questions that are put and responses that are filled in in the last column.  What is this document please?    Right.  And so was this the questionnaire with the responses that were given during the feedback session with the relevant respective supplier in this case it was VR Laser?    And was the same process followed in relation to the other two?    DCD and LMT and you refer to that in your affidavit and you have attached the – the list of questions and the answers in your further annexures, is that right?    May I just ask before we proceed to the next item in your affidavit did it strike you as significant that each of them was dealt with separately in private question and answer feedback sessions rather than them all being in the same room at the same time?    Now – and the process to be followed from a Supply Chain Management process that was not your responsibility – am I right?    Okay.  Alright thank you.  And then you refer in your affidavit to something that happened after these feedback meetings.  They were given an opportunity to submit revised proposals based on the issues during the meetings.  Now they had already submitted proposals in 12 which they were then asked to update in 2014.  Is this now a further opportunity for them to update their proposals again?    Yes.  Who decided on that?  Was that the cross-functional team of which you were a member?    Was that Supply Chain itself?    Was it unusual in your experience for Supply Chain to be asking parties who have submitted proposals and then revised proposals to be given a further opportunity to revise their proposals further?    Okay.  Now were further revised proposals then received from these three interested parties?    Can I take you please to page 422.  Sorry may I just have a moment I am sure that is a correct …[mumbling].  Apologies Chair.    I am sorry Chair?    Ja I said if you can just hold on I think that that is – that is in fact a wrong reference.    I apologise.    Yes may I take you rather to page 393?  You have that?    Now you refer to that in your affidavit as being the further revised proposal received by LMT in response to that invitation.  Is that correct?    And then at 401 is that the further revised proposal from VR Laser?    And then 40 – 410 is that the further revised proposal from DCD?    Right.  Now you have referred in your affidavit for the Chair ’s assistance it is paragraph 4.16 of the affidavit to the bid evaluation committee reconvening to do final scoring.  Was that part – or were you part of that process?    And what specifically were you required to assist in for scoring?    Right.  Can I take you back in your affidavit to page 245?  You refer in paragraph 4.20 to a consolidated evaluation sheet which we are going to look at in a moment.  There was a weight allocated to each category of items. Price was 25%, Functionality 45% and BBBEE 30%.  Now you were looking at the technical side.    I am sorry.    The functionality yes.  So it was the functionality with a 45% weighting for the scoring?    We – you were not involved in looking at price and what score to give to each – each of the bidders in their revised proposals, is that correct?    Okay thank you.  And then if we can just for completeness look at the document you referred to.  Can I take you to page 422?  Is that the evaluation…    Yes that is…    That is where I was confused earlier.    Thank you Chair.  422 this time is the correct reference Mr Drevin as I understand it but I would like you to confirm. Is that the consolidated evaluation sheet that is referred to as being the one that was populated through the scoring that was given by the team of which you formed part?    Okay and you – you were presumably responsible for advising on what score would be appropriate for the functionality element when you compared the one – the one bidder with the others?    Right.      It can be enlarged Chair.  We will…    Make sure that that is done.    Thank you we will…    We will attend to that.  Thank you Chair.    I am afraid some of the annexures in some of these affidavits do suffer from the same problem.    But I do not believe that I need to take the witness through it subject to your guidance as to the different components of the contents of this particular page.    We will certainly attend to this.    Indeed.    I am afraid not.    As you please Chair.    Thank you.  Now may I take you back to page 246?      You refer to the scoring that was then done and in 425 you refer to the scoring that shows that LMT came second in line by receiving an overall score of 64.78% which was 0.76% less than VR Laser but in relation to the price I am here now reading from your paragraph    If we compare that with VR Laser you deal with that in 4.23 and we see there in 4.23.1 that their price was in fact R262.4 odd million which is almost R100 million more than the LMT offer.    Despite that VR Laser was able because of the weighting presumably of the factors to beat LMT in terms of scoring by 0.76%.  Now you then deal in 4.26 - 4.26 with BBBEE credentials and scoring.  Was that part of your duties and responsibilities?    Okay.  And we have heard evidence from previous witnesses dealing with this. Now you refer in the next paragraph to a supplier audit having been done for the platform hull previously by Patria.  Were you aware of that at the time and what did this involve?    And was this an issue that related to your interest in functionality?    Okay.  Now there was then a recommendation made 4.28 – made after the consolidated – consolidated evaluation template was done that we have looked at.  There was a submission to EXCO of DLS recommending that VR Laser should be awarded this Hoefyster contract for the platform hulls because it was the highest scoring bidder.  Were you part of that – of that process making that recommendation?  Was that part of the cross-functional team that you were a member of?    The evaluation – right.    In favour of VR Laser?    And can you just give very briefly a summary of why you scored them higher – VR Laser?    Thank you.    Mr Drevin your affidavit then goes on to – in paragraph 431 to refer to your becoming aware of press articles referring to links with the Gupta’s and that you raised..    Thank you Chair.  If I might just pursue this for a moment?    Mr Drevin did you not find it strange that if – that there was no question or scoring attached to the experience of a particular perspective contractor relating to its experience?  Because as the Chair points out is that not a relevant issue that you should consider when evaluating bids to see not only is for example do they have a factory and do they have technicians and so forth.  But do they actually have experience not just skills on paper or resources on paper but actually a track record?  Did you not find it strange that that was not being looked at?    That covered in the questions.    Was that…    But – indirectly? But would it – would it be taken into account when you actually determining the scoring?  Because it is the scoring that ultimately is what gave VR Laser by a marginal difference a superior score to that of the others?    Thank you.  I think I have taken it as far as I can on this – on this aspect.    If I may proceed then Chair?    Mr Drevin may I then take you please to page 476?      Right now at the top of that page we see an email from you addressed to Ms Avishkar Govender who was she?    Is it he I am sorry.    Right we are going to look at in a moment at what you said in the email that you refer in that email to something that appears below.  There is an email below from Mr Govender and then below that he appears to be forwarding what appears at the foot of the page which is an email that originated from Heyns Van Der Merwe addressed to Mr Steyn, Mr Cartwright, Mr Kok, Mr Lubbe, Mr Klapper, Mr Govender and Mr Van Den Heever.  Did you come into possession of this email?  Were you aware of this one at the bottom that refers to a media article?    Yes.    That is if you look at the email from Mr Govender on the 7 July.  It is addressed to Infantry Systems Management PCPO and Celia Malahlela.  So you are part of PCPO?    Right.  Now we can read for ourselves the media article and the heading is – appears in bold at     Right.  And may I just read of the brief     Yes. “...that at the end, we will still be forced by Denel to change the LMT possible after the TOT has happened.” What does TOT mean?     Transfer of...?     Technology.  Thank you. “...has happened which will make it even worse.”     Right.  Then your emails says that    Yes. “...that the below input and the low price LMT quoted...” We have dealt with that earlier.  Was that the 162... R 160 odd million compared with VR Laser almost a hundred million higher?  Is that what you were referring to?     Yes, let us continue. “...brings me to a point where I get the feeling that we go with LMT.” Were you suggesting that rather the decision should be taken by the senior management and instead awarding it to VR Laser it should go to LMT?     Okay.  You were not in your job vested with the power to make that decision but this was a recommendation, was it to your colleague, Mr Govender, that it should be reconsidered the award to VR Laser?     It was what?     It was not within your power.  But you could still express your views, correct?     And that is what you were doing here?     Is that right?     Right.  And then you say apart from... “...that we go with LMT, avoid fallout from Denel.  Avoid possible fallout from this potential debacle...” What debacle were you referring to there?     Right. “...and spend the difference in price to get LMT up to standard with sufficient space facilities and resources to handle the Platform Hulle manufacturing.” This last part, what were you referring to there?  Just expand on that, please?     Right.  And you were suggesting that the difference in price be used to help LMT get up to standard.  Was that the difference in price between VR Laser at R 260 odd million compared with LMT, about a hundred million less than that?     Okay.  And then you just conclude    Yes.     Sorry?  Without them being...?     Blacklisted.  I see.  Alright thank you.  Now I would like to proceed to the next topic that you deal with in your affidavit and that deals with a different contract.  We have already dealt with the Platform Hull contract for the vehicles.   Now we are going to move to the single source supplier appointment to provide for turret FCM’s and related armour steel components.  Now you have referred in your affidavit to an instruction you received from Mr Teubes.    It is Reenen Teubes who prepared a motivation.  Mr Teubes – how did he fit into the organisation compared with you?     Right.  And mister...  So and he was the COO, Chief Operating Officer, correct?     Of which entity?  Would that be still Denel Land Systems, DLS?     Not the corporate head office but DLS as the division?     Okay.  And what was his instruction to you?     Were these components something in addition to what was dealt with in the Platform Hull contract, it was separate from that?     Okay thank you.  Now can I take you please to page 484?     484 and following.  Could you please tell us what these documents are?     Yes.  The text of your email run about     Were you aware of how it came about that he gave you that instruction and why it was now being considered appropriate that a single source supplier should be appointed?     Right.  Now I need to take you back please to your affidavit where you summarised your reasons for the motivation.  If I can take you to page 248?     Paragraph 5.2.  Do you have that?     You say    Alright.  And then you say, 5.2.2.  As one of the reasons, you referred to certain processes being specialised and you recommended that the supplier to be chosen should have all of these processes in-house.  Is that correct?     And then your further recommendation     Right.  Was LMT involved in that?     Right.  And then you say 5.2.4. “It was highly recommended that a supplier be chosen with a proven track record of manufacturing armour steel structures e.g. hulls, delivering on time to the required quality standards.” Now were the reasons that you were putting forward here, especially the last two, were you in any way suggesting that LMT should be eliminated and that VR Laser should be favoured?     Had you been asked by Mr Teubes or anybody else to write the motivation in a way that favoured one supplier rather than another?     Now you then deal in 5.3 with particular aspects being focussed on only addressing the interfacing components and you give the explanation but I     Right.     Right.     Right.  Now you continue then to say     No.  So why is it that you mention it here?     Yes.     Right.  And in fact, you continue    Yes.  And then you explain 5.5 how it came about that you have identified specific technicalities.  But we then come in 5.6 to your later learning that the motivation that you had prepared – that is the document that we had just been looking at, correct?      That that became used as a basis to conclude a memorandum of agreement between DLS and VR Laser Services where it was appointed in May 2015 as a single source supply for the provision of all fabricated steel services and goods such as fabrication of hulls, turrets, FCM’s and fabricated armour steel structures.   Now there are a couple of issues I need to question you on that.  You refer to VR Laser Services being appointed on the strength of your motivation.  Correct?  That was used that your...  Your motivation that you used by others to justify the appointment of VR Laser.     You just told the Chair thought that in your motivation you specifically did not recommend anybody whether VR Laser Services or anybody else.       And you raised some concerns with Ms Malahlela that we have already dealt with.  And she then as the head of Supply Chain Management within DLS felt that it should go out to tender.     Do you know whether it went out to tender?     You doubt it?     She has given evidence in relation to that.  The Chair has already heard.  Were you...  How did you feel?  Did you feel surprised?  Was this something you accepted that VR Laser was appointed, apparently, on the strength of your motivation?     MOA or MOU?     MO...     Right.  Now if the contract had in fact been put out to open tender as Ms Malahlela had suggested would be done, would you have been involved in evaluation of the tender once they came in, at least, from the technical side?     You do not know?     It could have involved others.     Now the other point that I would like to look at here is, that you refer in this paragraph 5.6 to what VR Laser Services was appointed to do as a single source supplier.  It would provide all fabricated steel services and goods such as the fabrication of hulls, turrets, FCM’s.  Just remind us what FCM mean?     Trunnion machine?     Yes.  Thank you.  And then the other example that you give is fabricated armour steel structures.  Now was this the same scope of different components that was the subject of your motivation, the written motivation that we looked at earlier?     Did i...  Was it exactly the same as the range of components or products that you dealt with in your motivation?  Was it less than or more than?     More than?     So you saying then...  Are you saying that VR Laser Services was given the contract for single source supply of components that went further than the components that you had looked at in your motivation?     Okay.  Do you know how that came about?     Yes. MR     You became aware of her evidence?     Yes.  But you do not have your own knowledge as to what others may have done, why they used your motivation to dealt with products, A, B and C that then was used as a basis to award VR Laser, a contract for sole supplier of A, B, C, D, E and F as well?     Not before Monday.  Thank you.  And were you ever consulted by Mr Teubes or anybody else to     Did they ever come back to you?     Are you aware whether they asked anybody else to do that?     Do you believe that...  I am sorry?     Being asked.  Would there have been anybody else who could potentially be asked or were you the only man in the or the only person in the organisation who would have been appropriate to ask?     Okay.  But you would have expected because you have done the motivation for the first lot of products, that you would have been approached to deal with the second or the further products as well, the additional items?     Okay.  Now thank you.  Still on your affidavit.  Page 250, paragraph 6.  Sorry, before.  I should have just asked this final question on the last topic Chair.  If I may just go back to that?     Are you able to tell the Commission to what extent the additional items made a difference?  In other words, was it just a couple of very minor items in addition to those items that you have dealt with in your written motivation or was it a substantial, a major or a minor add-on, as it were, to the original items you dealt with?     Yes.  Was minor.     Quite a lot.       Right.  Thank you.  Now we come to the value of the orders placed on the VR Laser from 2014 to date under the Hoefyster contract.  Now which contract are you referring to, the Single Source Supplier contract or the earlier one for the Platform Hulls?     So it says in fact the entire range, is it?     Right.  Thank you.  May I ask you please to turn to page 538?     Again, Chair.  I am afraid, for those of us with eyesight problems, the printing is a bit small.  I think one can make it out.       It is not ideal.  If you like us to replace these pages with enlarged copies?     We do not need to go in the detail of this but these are pages that go on for many, many pages in the bundle.  It runs from 538 to 599 and there are tables that have in pretty small print various columns, amounts, items and so forth.  Can you just tell us in broad outline Mr Drevin what is this document?     And what does it tell us?  What is the purpose of the report?     And what information were you able to extract?     What does it tell us?  Was this for purposes of responding to a request from the Commission to give a value as to the business that was given to VR Laser Services in relation to these contracts from 2014 to date?     Right.  And are you able to tell us what the total is?  It appears, if I am right, to be set out at page 598.        For that particular schedule there.  There are separate schedules that set out the various prices but can you just give us the totals on page 598?     Are you able to see that?     No, I am afraid it is difficult for me.  And you have not spelt out in your affidavit what the total is.  But Chair, may I give you the reference that we will provide a legible copy of that.       As soon as possible.     Thank you.  May I just have a moment?     My learned colleague, Ms Molefe, has drawn to my attention a point in the papers that relates to the question that was posed by the Chair earlier about experience.     May I take you please Mr Drevin to page 392?     Mr Drevin, are you there?     In fact, this appears to be the questionnaire relating to questions raised with LMT.  Am I right?     Okay.  And if I may direct your attention to paragraph 4?  It is 9.1.   “Taking LMT track record into consideration, what has LMT done to improve?” And then the response is.   “The Patria data pack is fixed and will not have any reason to cause delay as for the previous DLS contracts.” Did you receive that response from them as recorded or summarised in that column?     And what does this relate to?  Just explain, please?  What did you understand this to be?     Right.  Were you satisfied with that answer?     Did you believe that they gave a proper explanation that reassured you, that explains the previous... that the previous problems already expense would not recur would not happen again if they were to get the new business?     And of course, we have already seen ...[intervenes]      Yes said yes.     Is that correct Mr Drevin?  You said yes?     Right.  And I took you earlier to your email where you commented about the allegations that have been made in the media article.   You remember your email to Mr Govender and you had then suggested that LMT should in fact be awarded that contract because although they had previous issues. And they now had moved to smaller premises, you could perhaps do a deal with LMT where, at least, using the difference in price between VR Laser and LMT that that could perhaps be used.   You could perhaps increase their price to allow them to expand their operations, et cetera.     Okay.  Thank you.  Chair, those are the questions from the team for this witness.  Thank you.       Would this be a convenient time to take a short adjournment if that...     As it pleases Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes, we are ready, thank you, Chair.     Chair, I know that you have issues later in the day as you have indicated previously, other commitments.  May we just indicate we will be as quick as we can and we are still optimistic we can finish by five.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  This witness will take some time but I hope not too long.     And then the next witness should actually be fairly quick.     Thank you.     So with your leave, Chair, may we then ask leave to call our next witness, Mr Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van den Heever?     Yes, may we do so?       Thank you, Chair.  May I then place on record that we had a consultation with Mr van den Heever a week or so ago.  It was conducted in English, virtually over Zoom or Teams and we are aware that Mr van den Heever does not have English as his first language, Afrikaans is his first language and we are aware that sometimes he has to be a bit careful with understanding the English but overall he has, if I may say so, Mr van den Heever, a pretty good workable command of English and you were helpful to us and we appreciate that.  At one stage, Chair, it was indicated to us that Mr van den Heever would prefer an interpreter to be present to interpret and we engaged in discussions with his legal team, particularly Mr Pillay of the attorneys firm who represents Mr van den Heever, who are actually present, Mr Pillay and Ms Wilsnagh, and we reached an agreement, as I understand it, that the interpreter will be here not to interpret every word of every question or every word of every answer but the interpreter can be used if Mr van den Heever does not understand anything in particular that is put to him in English.  He will also, as far as he is able to, answer the questions in English but if he struggles he will call on the interpreter and so that is what we have arranged with Mr van den Heever with his attorneys’ assistance.  And may I just place on record our appreciation to the attorneys who have played a professional role in this and in all other regards.  Thank you, Chair.  It that is acceptable to you we would like to proceed.     Thank you, Chair, and we appreciate …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  May I add something to the Chair ’s points to you now, Mr van den Heever?  I will try to be careful and clear in everything that I put to you but if you do not understand anything either because you did not hear or your mind was racing ahead with something else or you did not understand the English, please just immediately say can you repeat it, can you explain it and I will then try and explain it and if that is not possible then Ms Oosthuizen, the interpreter is here to assist.  So please take comfort from both reassurances.  Okay?  Thank you.     Mr van den Heever, do you confirm you did in fact consult with the legal team that I am part of with my learned colleagues behind a week or a couple of weeks ago?     And is it correct that we consulted with you in respect of two affidavits that you have helpfully provided to the Commission?     And that was after you were asked questions by the investigator ’s team of this Commission.     Right.  Before you you should have a file.  Yes, I see you do.  And your two affidavits appear in the file but I am going to ask you to confirm that in a moment.  Can you please – Chair, may I just place on record we are now referring again to Denel bundle 04.     And here we are going to deal with EXHIBIT W14 and W14, Chair, we will take the witness to this in a moment, includes two affidavits.  The one appears - Mr van den Heever, will you just follow with me on this sheet, just look on the top left hand side, there are numbers, I am going to just refer to the last digit.     Number 5, page 5, that is your one affidavit, is that correct?     That is in divider A and then if you turn to page 83 you will find your other affidavit, is that correct?     Now may I take you in the first affidavit to where you signed it and if I can take you please to page 23?     Is that your signature at the foot of the page?     You signed it in front of a Commissioner of Oaths, we see that on page 24.  Do you confirm that?     Now before we ask you to confirm that the affidavit that we have just looked at is correct, may I just ask you, is it correct that during the consultation you alerted us to   I am sorry, may I just have a moment?  Is it correct that you in the consultation that we recently had you alerted us to some errors that you have picked up that you wanted to place on record?     Right.  Sorry, M’Lord, may I just – Chair, may I just have a moment?  Yes, it is at page 14, do you have that?     Paragraph 24.     Just to get our thoughts on this, you     Just tell the Chair please?     Right, thank you.     We can do that, Chair.     Indeed.     We will attend to that.     Thank you.  Mr van den Heever, I do not recall that in this affidavit – I am not talking about the other affidavit.  As I do not recall any other corrections that you felt needed to be made are you able to tell the Chair is there anything else in this affidavit you feel the need to raise for correction?     Do you confirm that you have gone through this affidavit?  You know what is in it and you confirm that it sets out the facts as you know them.     Thank you.  Chair, we will then ask for this affidavit formally to be admitted.  We will deal with the other affidavit in a moment but may we ask then for the formal admission of this affidavit?  It is in bundle Denel 04, EXHIBIT W14 from page 5.     Yes, W15 has already been allocated by those responsible.     As you please, Chair.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  Now, Mr van den Heever, the other affidavit should be found at the marker B.  If your file has a marker B and you will find it at page 83.     Right.  Am I right in understanding this is the second affidavit, the front page bearing your name?     And turn please to page 113.       Is that your signature again at the top of the page?     And again you signed in front of Commissioner of Oaths?     And is it correct that you have raised both in our consultation and since a few issues that you want to correct?     If I can ask you please to turn to page 101?  Is it correct that you alerted me to an error that you had picked up in paragraph 55.5?     55, just to give the context, is you gave a list here in your affidavit of the people who formed the BEC, the bid evaluation committee, correct?     And you alerted us, as the legal team, to an error in paragraph 55.5.     Is it Mr or Ms Khoza?     And what was the error?     Right, thank you.  And then on the following page, 102, is it correct that you alerted us to a spelling error in 55.8?  It should read Mr Rakadukwe.  With a k before the w.  His name appears in other documents.     Okay, thank you.  And then if I can ask you to turn to page 111.     In paragraph 93 you say the     Is it correct that we, as the legal team, have been alerted by your – through the kind assistance of your attorneys to the fact that you wanted to correct that by way of a supplementary affidavit?     March of which year?     2014?     So in fact that came at the request from who?     Right, by members of the legal team.  Thank you.  And is it correct that you have provided a supplementary statement.     And we are going to deal with that a little later, if we may, Chair.  That is not currently before you in the file.     That only came to us this morning and it has not taken a form of a commissioned affidavit.     There were some problems in that regard.     I have to burden you with other problems that have burdened us, Chair, but we hope we can deal with them.  May we just indicate …[intervenes]     I am sorry?     Thank you, Chair.  Unfortunately, it emerged only yesterday from the bundle that has been provided and handed to you, Chair, that some of the annexures in the photocopying process or the packaging of these bundles, for some reason, we are not sure, there was a slip up …[intervenes]     And they did not find their way into the bundle.     Chair, there are two ways that we proposed dealing with it.  We do not believe that it should pertain us in asking questions of this witness because only certain annexures are going to be referred to in the questions at least as I am anticipating and the annexures that I would have liked to have taken to Mr van den Heever to comment on happened to be annexures to the affidavit of Mr Drevin, the witness who you just heard who deals with some issues that overlap with that of Mr van den Heever.  Those happily are to be found in the same file.  So with your leave may we then refer to those pages?     Where it is relevant.      But the second solution that we propose is this, that a complete copy of the affidavit as provided by Mr van den Heever with all of the correct annexures will be provided by the secretariat.  In fact I believe that they are dealing with that now but we do not want to detain your further in this regard.     So we apologise on behalf of our team and the secretariat.     But, with your leave, may we continue on that rather complicated basis?     Thank you very much.  I would like – so I think I just need to ask you, Chair, I do believe I have …[intervenes]     Yes if you would accept the second of Mr van den Heever’s affidavit from page 83 of bundle Denel 04 which should be admitted, we would suggest, as EXHIBIT W14.2.     Thank you, Chair.  And then I have mentioned the supplementary statement that is not in the form of an affidavit, we are going to deal with its contents a little later, if we may, and then ask for at least the statement to be handed in provisionally to you but we will do that at that stage.  I am told by our learned friends who appear for Mr van den Heever that apparently there was some logistical problems but they have given an undertaking that they will ensure that that is transformed into a commissioned affidavit as soon as possible and that will then be introduced into your own bundle, Chair.     But we do not believe that – if we should have a difficulty subject to your decision in taking him through what is currently an unattested statement.     It can then be confirmed in due course.     Exactly.     Thank you, Chair, that will be done.     And may we propose that that, when that is included in the bundle, should – in an attested form, would included as EXHIBIT 14.3?     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you very much.     Alright.  Now, Chair, with your leave may we then ask questions of this witness, first with his second statement that appears in the bundle?  It just seems to flow nicely from some of the earlier evidence that you have heard.     Thank you.  Mr van den Heever, may we take you first to your affidavit?  It starts at page 83.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     That would help, thank you, Chair.     Alright, Mr van den Heever, this affidavit deals mainly with the platform hulls contract which was given to VR Laser, is that right?     Okay.  Now your current employer is Denel, the division DLS, is that right?     When did you start at Denel?     Before it was even called Denel.  What was it called then?     Right.  And what was your job title when you started in 1982?     Right.  And then you moved up the ranks in Denel, is that right?     You refer in paragraph 5, page 84, to working in the planning office at one stage?     And then you moved to the supply chain management department as a buyer where you had 22 years experience as a buyer.     Or a senior buyer and then other titles, commodities specialist and procurement officer.  What is your current title?     Alright, so you left supply chain management after 22 years and now you are in production.     Thank you.  Now you referred to your training on page 85, is that correct?     Paragraph 7 and then you set out in paragraph 8 your duties in supply chain.     Because your affidavit is dealing with issues relating to the Hoefyster contract for platform hulls given to VR Laser at the time that you were in supply chain.     Is that right?  Thank you.  Now may I take you to page 86?  After setting out the purpose of this statement which was to respond to specific issues raised by the Commission’s investigators, you then set out in paragraph 10 the standard procurement procedure at DLS at the time, is that right?     And were you in fact running the process from the day-to-day point of view for procurement in relation to the contract that we have just mentioned?    And did that include the Hoefyster contract that was awarded to VR Laser for platform hulls?     Alright.  Now if we can turn to page 89, your paragraph 12 deals with the delegation of authority and this was a delegation of authority applicable you say in paragraph 12 at DLS after 27 November 2012.     Alright.  And it gives the range of different prices that the value of particular contracts within specific ranges.  There were have to be specific levels of     Right.  Now we have heard evidence that DLS was a division along with other within Denel Group, correct?     And is it correct that Denel Group had its own procurement policy?     Yes, yes.  In fact we have heard evidence that it was based on that and that the Denel Group Policy imposed a requirement that above a certain value contracts had to be approved by certain levels and are you aware that the Denel Group policy required that a contract over the value of 200 million would require approval by the Denel Corporate Board?     Right.  So what you are referring to in 12.5 is simply that within the division a contract for a purchase order for more than R5 million would require Exco procurement committee’s approval.     But you became aware that in addition to that the board would also have to approve a contract above 200 million.     Right.  Okay, in the next section of your affidavit and with your leave, Chair, I am going to go through it very selectively.     So we do not waste time because you have a fair bit of evidence about the background.     Thank you.  You refer to Armscor awarding DLS a contract for the 217 hulls, correct?     And then you explain the process the rest of the page and then you refer at the top of your next page 91 in paragraph 17 to a situation in 2011 when DLS sought to contract a supplier to manufacture and deliver the platform hulls, the platform hulls contract.  So this was one element of what needed to be provided by Denel to Armscor, is that right?     Okay.   Now you then refer to LMT and LMT had - a majority shareholding was bought by DLS in LMT at a certain stage.  What was your understanding as to what LMT - which would participate in work such as this in general, before we get to the specific contract.  LMT was now a majority owned and controlled by Denel, correct?     Okay, was there any need from what you understood to give LMT this work for the 2017 Platform Hulls?     Right.      Okay we will get to why that route was followed and where it led you to.  You refer in this     Am I right in understanding that you are not a technical person in the sense of for example being an engineer who would know the ins and outs of quality issues?     I beg your pardon, tell us?     Right, thank you for correcting me.  So you in fact did have knowledge in this.  So the quality issues that were raised about LMT were those that you personally had identified or did other people in other departments raise that with you?      Alright thank you and then we now     You would have kept the money within the group, was the point you made earlier but instead of doing that it was decided no let us go out on an open procurement process because we have some concerns about LMT’s quality.    But LMT would still be in the race, it would still be a horse in the race it could tender if it wished to do so.     Right.  Now you then set out in paragraph 19 and 20 variance of the particular combat vehicle, correct?     Then you deal specifically at page 92, just remember the page numbers is top left from paragraph 21 was the process that was followed by the procurement of the Hoefyster Platform Hulls supplier.  Now you referred to a three quotation basis and you mentioned a moment ago to the Chair three quotations were in fact received.  This was not an openly advertised public tender where everybody out in the marketplace could tender.  Is that right?       Right.     Right and this was around 2011 that this started you say in paragraph 22 for the Hoefyster Platform Hulls.      Right, now you mentioned a budgeted price per hull of being R950 000,00 per hull exclusive of VAT and the total budget would then have been in the region of R206million.        Now then you refer to the fact that there was no previous supplier or last purchase price information.  Why was that?     Right, and then you explain why – how you went about choosing who to send the request for proposals to, just explain to the Chair briefly what that involve?     Those are the entities you refer to in paragraph 27?     Okay, and then you deal with their background how they had been dealing with DLS or Mechem, is Mechem or Mechen?     Mechem, what is Mechem?     Right, now may we turn to page 94 paragraph 30.  You referred to an RFO, a request for office specifically for the hull manufacturing on the Hoefyster Project or contract.  Did you then send out the RFO?       Was that your personal action to send it out?     And did you in fact send it to them?     Was it to the four suppliers that have been mentioned or to three?      Right, so it was sent to LMT, VR Laser and DCD, am I right?     And then you refer to their responses that each of those entities sent in a response in response to the RFO, is that right?        And you give the dates in paragraph 32 to 35 and you attach them as annexures and we apologise to you for some of the annexures being missing from the file in front of you due to the slip up in a photocopying process but that will be fixed but we thank you for providing all of those documents so they will be provided as you have heard in due course to the Chair in the way that we have discussed it.        Now can we deal on page of 95 with a visit by Patria to the suppliers just briefly what is this relating?       Right.     Now on page 96 the next heading is updated request for office.  Now you referred to an email from Ms Malahlela who was the Head of Supply Chain at DLS, is that correct?     Did you report to her?     And who was the line manager?     Right.      And then there is reference to a request made to LMT to update their proposal.  Did you attend to that request made to LMT?       Well let me get straight to the letter.  Chair this is an example of where the annexure that Mr Van Den Heever helpfully attached to his affidavit has not come in the photocopy but fortunately we have another copy of the same letter elsewhere in the same bundle.  So Mr Van Den Heever if I can take you to page 253 in attached to Mr Drevin’s affidavit.  We do not need to look at his affidavit, if I can just ask you to look at page 253 to five.  So Chair again this is just for the record it is in Bundle Denel 04 on page 253.      This is a letter that bears your name on page 255 as the procurement officer DLS Mechem, is that right?      Is that the RFQ itself?     I am sorry I had the wrong page number given, so is that the actual RFQ the request for updated proposals.      Okay, thank you.  It appears my note was wrong it is apparently 252 is the one that I should have drawn your attention to.        Yes, thank you so this was the request for an update of LMT’s proposal.     Now why were they being requested to update?     Yes.      And then in the letter the ticks to the     Okay thank you.  Now this letter was sent to LMT was there similar letters sent requesting an update to the other two that you had received proposals from that is VR Laser and DCD?       Right, and did they in fact respond all these three potential suppliers?     Right, and the Patria point is mentioned in your affidavit paragraph 45 page 96, is that correct?     Top left paragraph 45.       Now why did Patria have to give you the go ahead for parties other than LMT?       Yes.      The Commission has already heard evidence that Patria was the original manufacture of this type of equipment.      That had some intellectual property, they had patent rights.      And is that why they were saying we are not happy if you do business with BAE because then they could get our intellectual property and you had to check with them that the rest of the list was acceptable.        Right.      Have they already approved LMT?     Right, now if we can turn to the next page 97 paragraph 50 you referred to the revised proposals or their responses that you received is that in response to the request for an update?      Okay and that you set them out in paragraph 50.1 to 50.3.       You have referred to the relevant attachments.  Then you deal with paragraph, in paragraph 51 with the pricing that you received in terms of these updated responses, is that correct?          And then just to get to the sort of bottom line or the points that you have highlighted in bold print in LMT 51.1.3 there total price that LMT quoted was R159million plus a few thousand.      Right, and the VR Laser their bottom line the total price 51.2.2 was R262million and some thousands.      And DCD you have set out a schedule and their total price for the contract we see at the top of page 101 was R301million and some thousands.       So it ranges from the cheapest was LMT R159million, VRL R262million and DCD R301million.       Right, then you refer on page 101 to the bid evaluation committee which was also known as the cross-functional team and is it correct that Ms Malahlela as the Head of the DLS Supply Chain Management Department organised for a BEC a, bid evaluation committee or cross-functional team to be appointed?      And you were one of those members.      And those members are set out in paragraph 55.1 to 55.10, is that right?     And you are the person mentioned in 55.10 and you have already made the correction of 55.5 and we have dealt with Mr Rakadukwe’s spelling issue.  Right, now you mention in your affidavit that the committee was Chaired by Ms Malahlela, correct?     And its purpose was to evaluate the responses from the three suppliers, is that right?     And these responses were not simply the responses you had received in 2012 they were as updated in 2014.       Right, with the total cost that we have seen already from 159 to over R300million.       Right, now Mr Van Den Heever you then deal in paragraph 57 with a feedback session on the 26 t h of June and you refer to an attendance register which was signed for VR Laser ’s feedback session but you say in     Right, if I might just have a moment.  Yes, can I take you to page 387 Chair again just to explain this is an annexure that we find attached to Mr Drevin’s affidavit for the same reason discussed earlier.  Page 387, do you have it?       Thank you Chair.      And this is the one for VR Laser and you see the names and signatures of the various people including Ms Malahlela at the top there.        And is that your name if you look at the handwritten portion the 6 t h person to write and sign appears to be your name and is that your signature?      Okay thank you and then what follows is a list of a number of people from VR Laser.       Right, now what was the purpose of this feedback session?     Thank you it certainly does Mr Van Den Heever.  May I just ask one further question before we take the adjournment that you proposed for one, fifteen, Chair.      Thank you, may I take you again as an annexure to Mr Drevin’s affidavit although it should have been attached to yours as well because of the problem in house here.  Can I take you to page 389.      What is that?     And then at the following page 390, is that a similar questionnaire?     Yes, so it is different questions specific to your queries about their proposal.     Yes, thank you Chair would this be a convenient time to take the adjournment?     It is.      So can I fire her?     But may we as the legal team just express our thanks to Mr Van Den Heever for his attitude on the day and everything else.      And his attorney, thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Thank you Chair.  May we give you an update on the solution to the problem about missing annexures.    The Secretariat has very helpfully sorted out the problem.    By copying the missing annexures and slotting them into my file that is the witness and we have taken the liberty after first checking with – with your – with the Chair’s associate.    To uplift your file.    Chair and all of those annexures have now been slotted in in their appropriate places.    So it is now comprehensive and we must thank the Secretariat for fixing up the problem that arose yesterday.    We apologise to you Chair for the difficulties.    Thank you.  Mr Van Den Heever let us- let us deal if we may with the last few sections of your – of this particular contract that is the – that is the platform hulls’ contract procurement.  You have already taken us to the – you already explained what happened and why at the sessions – the feedback sessions. And then your affidavit refers to a further request that was then made by DLS to revise prices – revise their proposals.  You indicate in your affidavit based on issues raised during the meetings.  Now can you tell us what that relates to?    On page 103 that is your affidavit.    And then on page 104 most of that page is devoted to the information contained in the revised proposals of 27 oh sorry 27 June 2014 can be summarised as follows.  That is a reference to their response to your request for further revised proposals?    As I understand it LMT tried to explain its pricing did they actually make any change to the pricing?    Right.  And then DCD made no changes.    And VR Laser sent in a response but there they did not revise their pricing either.    Okay.  Now you then deal page 105 with the evaluation sheets and the bid scoring.  May I just check were you part of the process – were you involved in the process of actually scoring the bids in question?    Just explain to us please why you were involved in part but not the final part?  What actually happened?    You what?  Just repeat the last bit.    Right thank you.  Did they change any of the scoring that you had agreed to in the bid evaluation committee when they did that process?    Not to your knowledge right.  If I can please take you to page 132.39 and just to explain for the record the reason why the point 39 appears is that this is a document that was missing earlier and has now been inserted as it should.  So in order not to disturb the overall pagination that is why it has been done Chair.    132.39.    Now admittedly we saw the same document in a different annexure to Mr Drevin’s affidavit earlier when he gave evidence.  But – and as the Chair pointed out there are two as here I am afraid Chair the – the photocopying is meant that is very small letters printing but can you confirm is that your name and hand – your name and your signature with the date 27 June 2014?    And what is this document?  At least we can read consolidated evaluation sheet.  What does it tell us?    Supposed to be?    No, no.  We are not suggesting that.    As I was saying earlier it is has got the same problem as the one we looked at earlier for Mr Drevin.    So that has not been done yet.    Not yet so far we have only achieved a resolution to the one problem is that it is present.  It is now not absent.    But now we need a bigger copy.    I am sorry – I am sorry to disappoint you.    It was the first problem not the second that we have thus far been able to remedy with the assistance of the Secretariat thank you.    But – but does this reflect the scoring that was done in the evaluation of the bids?    Okay.  Then to go back to your affidavit because there at least the font is big and the copying is clear you deal with the evaluation back at page 105 paragraph 65 you refer to the – split the price points for technical and BBBEE the percentage for each of those and then you refer to how there was discussion within your committee about how the weighting would be – would be dealt with.  Is that right?    And there was agreement by the committee as to how the scoring would be done.    Then you deal at page 106 with the topic we need to spend a few minutes on and that is the BBBEE requirement.  Now at page 106 you mention that there was a problem in relation – that you had – that – that was due to an error on your part.  You did not include a requirement in the original invitation.  Tell the Chair please what – what did you erroneously omit?    Now you refer there to the – this is apparent in the RFQ invitation – you refer to the annexure number HVD28 and now fortunately it has been now located and put in the bundle.  If I can turn – ask you to turn please to page 132.102.    In fact the doc – the first documents at the previous page 132.101 that is the update request and then 132.102 is that the original request for offer    Now is this the document where you – where you should have put in a request for a BBBEE certificate?    And you say that that was omitted – why was that?  How did that come about?    Right.  But the – but the certificate was important was it?    Right.  Now then to go back – you – did you then request suppliers to submit their BBBEE certificates?    The feedback – sorry the clarification meetings that you held separately with the three on that day?    Right.  Did they then supply them?    Right.  If we can – if I can take you please to – sorry Chair if I can just have a moment you would indulge me?  Right now you refer in your affidavit to expiry of LMT certificate.  Just explain what in fact was – was there a problem and why?    If I can take you please to page 132.113.      And what is that…    132.113.    So this letter refers to Empower Logic having been engaged by LMT to perform their BBBEE verification and they indicated that process was still underway but the verification would take another four to six weeks.    Did – did you in the BEC or did anybody else give a score to LMT in relation to BBBEE?    Right.    Right.  Thank you.  Let us move if we may for a moment to – yes page – page 109 of your affidavit.    You refer to a consolidated evaluation sheet and that you refer to as being Annexure HVD031.  Just turn for a moment to page 134.      Is that the evaluation sheet that you referring to?    Here I must point out to the Chair although it will be perfectly obvious to him but I am afraid the print is even smaller here and that will be remedied to.    134 Chair yes.    That is right.    Logic is changing Chair.    Yes. And the way in which it was done when you were just presented with that as a – as a result did you find that normal?  Did you find that acceptable in terms of process or did you find it unusual and disturbing?    Right thank you.  Now although at that page we have just looked at the print is very small you have helpfully in clear print on your – in your affidavit on page 109 set out the important features.  And here you refer to VR Laser receiving the highest score – received a total of 65.54% and then  you give the breakdown.  10.39% for price, 50.15 for functionality or technical and 5% for BBBEE.  And you have referred here to the price of VR Laser in 81.1 of being R262 406 000.00 etcetera.    And which was – which is of the same order as the previous – previously submitted quote, correct?    Then you refer to LMT coming second it received an overall score of 64.78%.  That is very slightly less – in fact less than 1% it is 0.76% less than the VR Laser score in percentage terms, is that correct?    And then DCD came third their price was still over R300 million.  Correct?    Now then you refer to your preparing a submission to EXCO to be reviewed and signed off by Ms Malahlela.  Now if I can ask you please in the bundle to go to the document page 136.      That appears to be an email from you to Ms Malahlela saying hope I have captured most of the points required this morning and was it – was there attached to that email the document that then follows at 137.    And following.  And what is this document?    Right.  And so we see at page 141 paragraph 7 a recommendation.  Correct?    Now this is what you have said – you  prepared this document is that right?    Okay.  Now what the document says in    Right.  But then the document continues 712 this is a ceiling amount as further negotiations with VR Laser Services will take place to obtain a price below DLS budget.  Now you referred us earlier in your evidence to DLS having a budget – what was that budget amount?    And what was here being recommended was a contract to be placed on VR Laser for a value of R262 million which clearly is considerably above the maximum – the budget maximum amount that is available.    Yes.  So – but – so this point about it is going to be for R262 million but if that is the ceiling amount it would be subject to negotiation to try and bring that down.    To bring it within the budget maximum.    And…    Thank you Chair and just arising from those questions Mr Van Den Heever.  If VR Laser was approached to negotiate a reduction below the R262 million and they would not agree to any reduction it would stay at 262 you have said that to the Chair but then that would still be above the budget – what would the result of that be?  That they would get the contract for 262 even though you were way exceeding your budget or that the contract would not be awarded to them?  What was your understanding?    Right and then if I can take you at page 137 the first page of this document.  It is addressed to EXCO.  Would that be EXCO of – of DLS.    Not head office?    Not the Group EXCO?    Right.  This does not indicate unless I have missed it.  Anything is to who should approve it outside DLS.  If I can take you to page 142 there is provision for various signatures.    Right.  So this was – this was simply for the first – it was for the approval within ….    DLS and if approve – was approval required outside DLS?  In other words at head office level.    As far as you are aware.    Okay and that would then be dealt with in a separate document presumably?    Right.  You were not involved in the preparation of any document for them?    Right.  Now Mr Van Den Heever you refer in your affidavit to disciplinary proceedings happening against you.  If I can take you back to 110.      But as I understand your affidavit that does not relate to the procurement process of scoring and awarding the contract to VR Laser or does it?    And were you disciplined for alerting VR Laser – sorry alerting LMT to the fact that VR Laser was also bidding for this contract?    And subjected to a disciplinary hearing that lasted five weeks.    And you do not say whether you were found guilty or not guilty but a sanction was imposed so I assume that you were found guilty?    Yes.  Alright.  Now finally in your affidavit I would like to take you to page 111.  Purchase orders issued to VR Laser and here we come to paragraph 93.  Now here you – we as mentioned earlier but we did not go into – into a full detail of it.  I mentioned earlier to the Chair that you have at the request of the team updated certain figures and you have prepared a supplementary statement that is the one that I mentioned earlier Chair that is with - well, that you have indicated earlier to be filed as Exhibit 14.  Sorry.     W14.1.     Point 3.  I beg your pardon.  Yes.     Chair, again, we have had some logistical constraints but with your leave, may I hand up the signed supplementary statement as indicated to you earlier Chair?     This has not been yet attested but that will be attended to.     May I, with your leave, then hand up to you Chair, subject to the arrangements that will be put in your file in due course, properly marked and then replaced by the affidavit.     I am afraid we have not had enough copies for everybody to be made.     I think perhaps...  Unfortunately, the witness does not have the supplementary statement in front of him.  Perhaps my copy should just be made available with your leave.   And I would just put a few questions to Mr Van den Heever as to what the effect of the amendment is.  May I ...[intervenes]      That is right.  There is just a logistical...[intervenes]      ...yesterday.     I am afraid this particular body of the evidence has had all these hiccups.     But hopefully been able to get to the end of it.     With that sorted.     So we apologise for all these issues Chair.     Just if I may then ask the witness to explain why it was done and what was done.     And what the outcome of it is.     Mr Van den Heever, would you help us with that?  You have indicated earlier to the Chair that you were requested by my colleague, Ms Sibiya, to update the figures.  Is that correct?     And those are the figures that appear in your paragraph 93.  Now what are the figures show?  This is a spreadsheet but you have now given the updated spreadsheet, correct?     And what does it show?  Does this reflect payment or value of purchase orders?     Alright.  Thank you.  Then to return to your affidavit that we have been looking at 111, page 111, paragraph 94.  It says you confirm from the period 12 August 2009 until the signature of the memorandum of agreement with VR Laser Services in 2015.  I issued purchase orders to the value of R 232 959 000,00, et cetera on VR Laser.       Alright.  Now does that relate to orders placed under the hull contract?     Right.       Okay.  And then at page 112, you refer to the facts that is common cause that all the other witnesses have confirmed that there has been a memorandum of agreement signed between VR Laser and DLS on the 16t h of April.   That is where VR Laser was appointed as DLS’s single source supplier of all fabricated steel services and goods.  And were you involved in the procurement for that contract?     Single source supplier.     Alright.  So your affidavit does not deal with that process but your affidavit does deal with the rest of this page 112 for certain figures that relates to payments.  Oh, sorry not payments but the total value of orders in R 97, R 102, R 112.8 million.     Now that relates to the single source supply contract.     Okay thank you.  And then you refer to the outstanding order lines, at the time was closed.  There was a directive that all outstanding order lines be closed.  Why was that necessary?  Do you know?     I see.  What was the R 56.1 million represent?  Is that orders that have been placed that were then put on hold?     Yes?     Right.  And then you explain that in the next paragraph.  Right.  Thank you.  Alright.  Thank you.  May I just have a moment to confer with my team Chair?     Sorry, Chair.  May I just...     May I just ask that the file be returned to us for just a moment?     Thank you.  May I return the file, please Chair?  Sorry about the interruption.     That is my team just giving me valuable input.     Now the amount we are referring here Chair and Mr Van den Heever to your supplementary statement.  You give at the foot of that page that has been presented to you a figure of R 3.5 million approximately.  Correct?     That is the value ...[intervenes]      I am afraid I do not have a file in front of me but I think ...[intervenes]      ...it is on the supplementary.     Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Sorry.  At the foot of the second page of that affidavit you give a figure of R 3.5 million.  Is that correct?     And was that the value of the orders placed on VR Laser prior to the change of ownership in VR Laser?     I am sorry?     That you have put... that you had placed?     Yes.  Were there other colleagues within the organisation who were also placing orders?     Or were you the only one who placed orders?     I see.  But from your knowledge, from your own involvement it was R 3.5 million before the change of ownership in VR Laser that provokes so much media interest and subsequent investigation by the Public Protector and this Commission?     Thank you.  And then, if we can compare that with the value that appears in the affidavit that you have presented of the R 345 million.  Was that before or after or at the same as the change of ownership?     If you look at page 111, your affidavit, paragraph 93.      Right.  And then, if we look at paragraph 94.  There you refer to a period between 2009 and 15.  The purchase orders then amounted to the value of R 232 million.     Right.  Perhaps if...  I am sorry for the interruption.  Perhaps if I can ask the question, really, in this way?  Before the ownership in VR Laser, what sort of amount was placed by way of the value of purchase orders compared with what happened after the change of ownership in VR Laser?     So it was a big difference once there was a change in ownership?     Right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  With your leave Chair, may we then turn to the other affidavit that has already been submitted.     That is correct Chair.     Thank you.  If you have that in front of you Mr Van den Heever?     Right.  Thank you.  Some of the initial pages are pretty much stuff we have already dealt with.  So we do not need to go into that.  This affidavit, as I understand it, deals specifically with an earlier contract which is referred to as the Trunnion Contract awarded to LMT.     And you deal with that from page 12.     The heading is the Trunnion Contract and the R 12.7 million prepayment.  Now you have set out on pages 12 and 13 the procedure that was followed.  Various entities were asked for quotations.  Is that right?     LMT was one.  ELCA and IAD for the others referred to in paragraph 15.     And then you refer to a proposal or a quotation received from of these entities such as LMT.  Paragraph 17.  That from IT, D and 18.  And then you deal with your interactions with colleagues, Mr Teubes, Mr Burger and Mr Knoetze and others.       Now if we can just to what appears to be the main focus of the affidavit from here on page 14.  You     But that stage, was LMT owned by parties other than Denel?     Right.  But they later...  There was later selling of 51% shareholding in LMT to Denel?     Okay thank you.  Page 17 refers to a suspensive condition in relation to this contract.  What did this relate to?     Are you meaning that if you did not complete Phase 1, you would not get Phase 2?     Right.  And did they in fact complete Phase 1, LMT?     Right.  And then you deal with the termination of the contract, paragraph 41 and following.  Was that the contract with LMT still, the same contract?     And did you give the notice of termination that is referred to in paragraph 43?     Who is... you say there, you received the notice of termination.  It was signed by Dr Nel and Mr Burger. MR VAN DEN     Page 18, paragraph 42.  Perhaps that helps you.     Right.  Do you know why it was cancelled?     Can I take you ...[intervenes]      I am sorry to have interrupted you.  If I may take you to pages 45 and 46?     This is an email from Mr Dabiedeen(?) (De Bardien(?)), Veron(?) Dabiedeen of DLS Financial operations.  Is that right?     And he attaches a signed cancellation letter.  And is this the letter of cancellation that is referred to in your affidavit on the following page 46?     If I can just read it into the record?  Second and third paragraphs.   “It is recorded that the said contract number has not yet come into effect as a suspensive condition as set out in Clause 6.3.1.2.   The contract has to date not been fulfilled.  It is further recorded that Denel (Pty) Ltd has recently acquired a majority shareholding of LMT Holdings that in light of the above, the parties have elected to evoke Clause 7.6.1 of the contract, hereby effecting a consensual cancellation of the contract.  Cancellation notes will come into effect upon signature of the dully authorised representatives of both parties.” And then we see there are signatures below that on the 21s t of September 2012 by Mr Burger for Denel Land Systems and Dr Nel the then CEO for LMT Holdings.     Right.  Now you then deal with another issue in your affidavit which I am going to try and deal with very briefly Mr Van den Heever and that is LMT purchase order.  Can I take you back to page 18 of your affidavit?     You refer to a Malaysia transaction.       Now you were asked to evaluate the feasibility of facing the manufacturing of the Malaysia LCT 30 turrets on LMT.  Was the client there Malaysia?  Were these turrets to be supplied to Malaysia?     Not Armscor?  This is different from the Hoefyster contract?     Right.  And had Denel got that business to supply armoured vehicles to Malaysia?     Just turrets?     Right.  And so this was business that could be given to LMT, is what your affidavit refers to.  And then if I can take you to page 19, paragraph 47.  Mr Teubes indicated that DLS had to contract with LMT in this regard. “It was in the process of being acquired by DLS where DLS became a major shareholder but its business strategy had to change.” Were you informed of this by Mr Teubes?     And was this the reason why you understood the Malaysia turrets business must be based on LMT?     Is that what you were instructed to do?     And then you refer in paragraph 50 to an instruction from Mr Van der Linde to create urgently requisitions for the purchase order to be placed on LMT.     Right.  And that was to the value of R 10 million and you have attached to your affidavit the relevant documents.  We do not need to go through that I believe Chair.     In relation to the ordinary procedure which would have required going out for quotation.  That would have been the RFQ process of inviting three suppliers that you knew were suitable to invite them.     Is the answer... is a possible answer to that concern about the fact that the process did not follow     Right.  So procedure still required that there would be a measure of competitive process?     Not just with a company that of course are being acquired but also to get benefit to Denel.     And then you deal on page 21 with tax invoices an advanced payment.  Please explain to the Chair what the significance is of the advance payment that was made in this regard?  Who made what payment to whom and why?     Yes.     Was this according to standard procedure?     And was there a good business reason that you were aware of for such a prepayment to be made?     Right.  Now you deal from pages 22 to 23 to steps after the invoice was received from LMT and then you had dealing with a Ms Liz Laveshnee Chetty from your Finance Department.  Correct?     Who was wanting a copy of the agreement.  You told her there had been no agreement except for the purchase order.     Were some purchase orders issued in terms of standard procedure without needing an agreement or was there a contract actually required in each case for this type of transaction?     Right.     And then you refer to a number of communications, I think all by email with Mr Jurie Human, Mr Du Preez, Mr Wynand Meiring.  And they referred to a need to close the order and make the... and in paragraph 66, Mr Du Preez responded that you could close the order and make the quantity and price zero.  What is that about Mr Van den Heever?     Are you saying that there was an irregularity here?     Now in paragraph 70, page 23, you refer, after giving the background facts, to getting information from finance department showing that out of the R9.698 million – was that the value of the order itself?     Yes.     Then you make a point about of that 9.225 million, a the shortfall of 472 000 appeared.  What is the point that you are trying to make there?  There is a difference and you said finance department could not give you a difference.     Yes.     Right, may I have a brief moment, Chair?  Mr van den Heever, thank you for your help.  Those are the questions that I have.  Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair, we are ready with our next witness.  As I indicated, I do not believe that she will be that long.     She is available, may we ask leave to call her?     Her name is Carene Geldenhuys.     And while she is coming forward and before she is sworn in may I just for guidance refer to her affidavit in the same bundle, Denel 04, it appears from page 148 and we will be asking for it to be admitted as EXHIBIT W15.  You should find the tab there.     Yes, thank you, Chair, may we ask that your learned associate swear the witness in?     Your registrar.     Old habits.     Thank you, Chair.     Good afternoon, Ms Geldenhuys.  You have a bundle in front of you, a file.  I hope it has been opened at page 151, if you look at the numbers on the top left.     Right, thank you.   Can you confirm that your name appears on this page which is the first page of a statement?     Which you have in fact signed before Commissioner of Oaths.  If I may take you to page …[intervenes]     And is it correct that as seems to appear from the foot of the page you signed that in front of Commissioner of Oaths?     So this is in fact an affidavit.  Do you confirm that you have been through the contents of this affidavit?     And that you confirm that in fact the contents of the affidavit are correct according to your own knowledge?     Right, thank you.  Chair, we would then move formally for you leave to have admitted this affidavit, statement/affidavit with its annexures as an exhibit in bundle Denel 04 as EXHIBIT W15.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you.  May we just for the record indicate – no, in fact you were previously represented by attorneys were you …[intervenes]     Yes.     Was that Mr Pillay and his team?     Diale Attorneys.     Thank you.  But you are no longer represented by them.     Thank you.  When did you leave Denel?     Right.  When did you start there?     And the business previously owned by BAE that was now acquired by Denel, did that then come to form a division within Denel?     Right.     So it is a separate company.     What is the name of it?     Right.  If we can refer to it from now on as DVS as everybody seems to do.     So it was DVS under its previous name and then under the DVS name it was your employer while you were employed in the Denel Group.     Okay, thank you.  And what was your job title?     Now in – now we must bear in mind your affidavit was signed on the 15 January 2020.  We see that on page 105.  So when we go to your first paragraph, page 151, obviously that was representing the facts as they existed in January 2020.  You were still then employed at DVS, correct?     Right.  And you there refer to the fact that you were employed as the legal and commercial executive of DVS.  You were not involved, or were you, in anything to do with DLS?     Right.  Now on page 152 you refer to the area of business of DVS, that it has its own three divisions and you described that in some detail in 2.2, correct?     Okay.  Chair, with your leave, I am leading the witness on matters that are believe are not controversial.     Thank you and then you set out in 2.4 your key responsibility areas.     Right.  You referred to legal advice in 241 that you would provide the CEO and business.     Where warranted and then also your functions including as part of your key areas drafting and reviewing legal documentation and agreement.     Right.  Now, Ms Geldenhuys, the Commission has already heard some evidence in relation to an agreement that was concluded between DVS and VR Laser.  Is that – you deal from page 153 with an instruction that you received to prepare a Memorandum of Agreement between DVS and VR Laser services.     And what sort of services were to be provided or goods were to be provided in terms of this agreement by VR Laser to DVS?     Yes.     Right.     Okay, thank you.  Now you mentioned Mr Ntshepe who was then Acting Group Chief Executive.  We know that he took over then as the fully fledged Group CEO.  When Mr Saloojee left Denel he was the previous Group CEO.  Was Mr Ntshepe, when he was acting, was at the time that Mr Saloojee was on suspension?  Do you know?     Okay.    Alright.      Okay.   Now referred to the instruction coming from Mr Ntshepe and your affidavit says that that went through Mr Steyn.  You refer in 322 to Mr Steyn as being Chief Executive Officer of DVS.     Now did it strike you as normal or unusual that an initiative to enter into a contract with an outside entity such as VR Laser should come from the Group Chief Executive rather than something that was generated within the division itself?     So were you instructed by Mr Steyn to perform some duty?     And that was to prepare an agreement?     Now you refer to in your affidavit to two agreements being signed initially.  The one is a confidentiality agreement and the other a memorandum of agreement, your affidavit says, but may I take you to page 171?  Do you have it?     This is a memorandum – the title is Memorandum of Understanding and it is a five page document running to 175.  Are you familiar with this document?     Is this the document that you referred to in your affidavit as the nonbinding agreement?     Alright.  Did you draft this?     Yes.   And was that then finalised by Mr Steyn signing it on behalf of Denel, page 175?     And it was signed on behalf of VR Laser by Mr van der Merwe.      Alright.  Now can we go now to the confidentiality agreement, that starts it seems at page 166.  Again an agreement between Denel and VR Laser.     Signed on the same date as the memorandum of understanding.     Right.  Now what did you understand the purpose of these agreements to be, the confidentiality agreement and the MOU?  Let us start with confidentiality agreement.     Right.  And then there is a reference to patent rights in clause 9 on page 168.     And then if we go back to page 166, above clause 1 in the preamble it refers to the parties and the addresses and so forth and then on the fifth line in the top paragraph that they desire – the parties desire to protect certain proprietary or confidential information which may be disclosed or exchanged between them both prior to and during the term of this agreement.     So was the purpose of this agreement?  If we are going to do business together this agreement is going to ensure that VR Laser keeps confidential what we entrust to them in confidence.     Right.  Now if we can turn to the MOU, the memorandum of understanding, page 172.  Perhaps the easiest point by way of the overall objective is page 172 in the preamble.  It refers to Denel and VR Laser    “Whereas DVS has as its main  capability the development, manufacture and refurbishment of landmine protected and armoured vehicles, which vehicles are sold to the local and international market, whereas VRL is a local supplier of armoured steel and has experience in the fabrication of armoured capsules inclusive of laser cutting and welding.  VRL is an existing supplier of DVS, performs laser cutting and the supply of armoured steel under subcontract of DVS.  Both parties realise that its capabilities are complementary to each other and requires further investigation into possible collaboration to the mutual benefit of both the parties.” Right.  So this was a memorandum of understanding, as you have it, nonbinding, it was really, as I understand it, and correct me if I am wrong, it was really a framework for the parties to agree to as a concept to move forward then to negotiate a binding agreement.  Is that right?     And it would be an agreement that ultimately would give business from DVS to VRL for VRL to provide specialist laser cutting and other requirements for armoured steel relating to armoured vehicles.     Right.     Right.  And then if I can refer you to clause 2 on the next page, 173.  That sets out the general intention. “The intention of the parties is to explore the feasibility to strategically collaborate and develop their relationship relating to future opportunities and the contracting models relating to such opportunity exploitation. The parties have identified the following as possible areas for collaboration noting that this is not an exhaustive list. (a) The possible future local manufacture of specialised steel structures in the RSA. (b) The supply of steel products by VRL to DVS on a preferential basis, and  (c) The future optimal fabrication of armour vehicle hulls.” That was really  - we are going to now explore the way forward to see whether we can do business with each.  Is that a fair reflection of what …[intervenes]     Right.  And even the items in (a), (b) and (c) showed the sort of business that was going to be explored but it was not an exhaustive list, as you put it.     Okay, thank you.  Now if I can take you back to page 154.  You refer to – you deal in     Thank you, Chair.  But just so that I understand fully.  Was the intention never to take the matter forward from the executive point of view as far as you understood with the MOU or was it a genuine intention to negotiate further with VR Laser once the MOU was signed?     Yes.     So you were trying not to upset the leadership, the Acting Group CEO in particular at that time, but you – but am I right in understanding you were saying you are saying felt uncomfortable from the beginning?     Right.  One thing I omitted to take you to and I apologise for this, Chair, is that when we refer again to page 175, the signature page of the MOU, your affidavit refers to the signature having happened at the offices of DVS when the representatives of VR Laser were present.     Were you yourself present when this was signed?     Now you are aware who actually attended for VR Laser, it seems to be signed by Mr van der Merwe.     But your affidavit refers also to a person being present known as Kamal Singala?    How would you know if he was present if you weren’t there?     But what – sorry to interrupt – what I am interested in is how do you know that – you knew some people were there, and you knew what they were there and how did you know it was Mr Singhala did Mr Steyn tell you or were you introduced to Mr Singhala or did you see…[intervenes].     Fine thank you and then your affidavit refers to a Rumour Mill informs you – you found out through the rumour mill that Mr Singhala, in fact has a fuller name, it’s Kamal Singhala Gupta.     Okay, alright, now you’ve mentioned that Mr Ntshepe was unhappy, you deal with that in 3.7 and one of the points that he was unhappy with was that it was an non-binding agreement, it was not yet a binding agreement and there’s reference also, to his complain that – about a single source supplier.  What did you understand Mr Ntshepe’s requirements to be?     Right, so you will procure something exclusively from VR Laser?     What would that something be, that you understood Mr Ntshepe desired?     Right, now your affidavit then goes on to talk of email and other communications involving yourself and Mr Steyn and Mr Steyn with Mr Ntshepe, is that right?     And Mr Wessels was also involved at a certain stage, we’ll get to that in a moment but what did management feel – what did you at the Executive level of DLS feel once it was clear that what Mr Ntshepe wanted was, firstly – immediately rather than through a MOU and some negotiation and exploring the way forward, rather go straight for an actual binding agreement, secondly that it be a sole supplier, single supplier and thirdly, that what needed to be supplied included construction of hulls?     I beg your pardon.     Right.     Now, your affidavit refers, at the top of page 155 to DVS having the necessary fabrication capacity and that it was required to run pre-production pilot fabrication to industrialised hulls for specific vehicles.  So, what Mr Ntshepe asked you or instructing you to do to move from a non-binding agreement about talking about the future is something that is binding which would include fabrication of hulls.  Was this something that could be done in-house by DVS itself? MS     It was your core capability?     Right, and then you refer to Mr Steyn in 3.10 informing you about a meeting earlier that day where the strategic intent of the Denel Landward Business was conveyed to VR Laser and it was explained that a signature would follow after the approval of the Board.  What does this relate to, the Landward Business Strategic Intent?     Yes, so are you saying this, and correct me if my understanding is wrong, within Denel, you had various entities that included LMT that was controlled by Denel with a 51% shareholding, you had DVS that was a company on its own but fully owned and controlled by Denel.     LMT had certain core business of its own, you had core business of your own which had previously been conducted when it was owned by BAE, correct?     It had now been brought within the Denel Group, you had capacity and what was now being intended in terms of the Landward Business Strategy, was to try and enhance the in-house capability for such products.  That you would work together and maybe, ultimately, restructure. So, the focus was to carry on your respective core businesses in a coordinated in-house way, is that correct?     I understand, so it was, at that stage just a broad strategic vision?     Right and did you understand that, that broad strategic vision is what had been decided on at the Executive level even above you?     At Board level of the Group?     Right, and…[intervenes].     Right, so although you hadn’t got into the nuts and bolts of how this was going to be realised, this vision, that was where the Group wanted to move?     Now, how did you find that the instruction from Mr Ntshepe at the level of Group CEO or acting Group CEO, that now some of your core business should be contracted out on a sole supplier basis to VR Laser?     Right, now your affidavit in 3.10 at page 155 refers to Mr Steyn giving you feedback on a meeting that he seems to have had with – that day with VR Laser Services where he was trying to explain to them, VR Laser, that this approach had to be subject to the Landward Business Strategy.  Do you understand why he was explaining that to VR Laser because they’re outside the Group, isn’t it an issue that he should have had with Mr Ntshepe?     Thank you Chair.  On this point may I take you to an email that – as you point out is referred to in your affidavit, can I take you please to page 185.     It’s referred to as Annexure CG4.1, I see in your affidavit you refer to CG4 but is this the CG4 that you’re referring to…[intervenes].     Correct, thank you.  Now this is an email – let’s leave aside the top section because it seems to be forwarded at a later stage but the actual email starts about a third of the way down, do you see under in bold print 13 November, then there’s a little table which shows the subject of the person who’s sending it and date and so forth, the usual email heading?     And that is sent from Johan Steyn, that’s your CEO of DVS.     And it’s addressed to Piet Kruger.     Who was he?     Okay and then it refers to yourself, is that right, Colette Geldenhuys?     Percy Indaba also a DVS colleague?     Okay, and then, is it, RP du Plessis, was copied in?     At DVS?     So, he was on the DVS Board?     Okay, then it’s also copied to Johan Wessels.     He was the Group COO, at the time, is that correct?     So, he wasn’t working within DVS, he was above that at head office.     At Group level reporting to Mr Ntshepe?     Right and then who’s the other person, Odwa Mhlwana?     So, although, he was a bit distant now in a sense that he was elsewhere within the Group, no longer in the DVS…[intervenes].     Right, now this appears to be a report back from Mr Steyn about a meeting.     He refers – he says, “Apologies for the lengthy email, I got stuck on the RG21 on my way back to the office from DCO.  Due to the urgency of the matter this cannot wait until Monday”, So as far as you, as an Executive team, within DVS were concerned, was this viewed as something significant and important?     Then he says, “Following Zwelakhe’s [?] request two weeks ago”, Is that Zwelakhe Ntshepe?     Right, “To formalise an agreement with VRL for the fabrication of our hulls in future, several interactions take place between DVS and VRL to start the process. Evaluate VRL’s capability.  Looking into the negative effect of such an agreement on our fabrication workshops, recoveries etcetera, I had a follow-on meeting with Zwelakhe, Jan and Odwa yesterday on the progress and next steps”. He seems to be saying, we received this instruction, we’re trying to deal with it and take it forward, one of the things we have to look at is the negative effect that such an agreement would have on our business.     Did you understand there to be some interaction between Mr Steyn, who was the head of the Executive of DVS with his superiors at head office?     Acting Group CEO, Group COO and CFO?     Right and then he says, “Attached, a few slides originally drafted by Jan, updated following the meeting yesterday to illustrate our intent and clarifying current opportunities for VRL. Zwelakhe asked that Jan and I meet with VRL today and share this with them, Pieter van der Merwe, the CEO”. That’s VR Laser ’s CEO, is that right?     Then he says, “At our meeting, Jan and I explained that DVS has a fabrication capability”, Now is that confirming what you said earlier, you could make these things in-house?     “And that we are required to run pre- production pilot fabrication to industrialise hulls of specific vehicles. Pre-production quantities can vary depending on customer requirements etcetera.  Then the next line, in the end we agreed that a more appropriate way to approach an agreement is to use the DLS/VRL agreement”, That’s the DLS, that’s your sister entity – well you’re a separate company but DLS was an operating division of Denel itself.    And so the agreement reached, it seems, between Mr Steyn, Mr Wessels and Mr Ntslontlo  with VR Laser is that, to accommodate the concern about the giving of business to VR Laser, despite the fact that DVS had an in-house capacity was to follow, as an example, another agreement which had already been entered into by DLS with VRL?     And that would be to – yes, ending up with a Denel Landwards VRL agreement excluding LMT. “Jan’s request is that we draft the appropriate clauses, principles and potentially amend the DLS/VRL agreement, incorporate the DVS part and finalise it by next week Friday, Pieter will forward the version”, And then there’s discussion about Jan explaining how it would be done by way of Denel Board of approval on the 7 t h of December then he says, “This is the background leading up to what needs to be done now. 1. Finalise the detail of fabrication workload over the budget period, five years, based on our current budget, Percy will complete this.  2.  Calculate the negative effect on recoveries”, Now what are the recoveries that are referred to there?     Okay, and then 3, at the top of page 186 is, “The next step is to draft the additional clauses required to cover DVS’s part in the current DLS/VRL agreement to include the principles and outline very high level on the last slide, herewith some guidance”, So, he’s giving you some pointers as to what you should do in drafting the clauses based on the DLS agreement with VR Laser, is that right?     And one of them is in, “a) Other than in the DLS case the preamble should include the fact that DVS has a world class fabrication facility capability.  DVS requires a high quality hull fabrication supply department to manufacture hulls for production that meets the requirements of Government’s Black Industrialist Programme initiated by DTI and in our opinion VRL meets such requirements”, Now that seems to raise two issues.  The one is that mention would be made that DVS has its own capability but now needs somebody that is a top-class supplier of particular items. Now, had your view changed or were you persuaded that DVS couldn’t provide all of this in-house?     Thank you Chair.  Ms Geldenhuys so this email correspondence that we’ve just looked at wasn’t copied into Mr Ntshepe, according to the email address list but it was copied into Mr Wessels as COO, Group COO.     And he reported to Mr Ntshepe, then acting Group CEO.     Mr Mhlwana as well?     At Group head office level?     Right, now just – the slide presentation that he’s referred to in the email, is that the set of three slides that we see, or four slides that we see.    And what did this – did this depict what the objective was for this landward – landward objective to incorporate the VR Laser that they had in mind    Right.    Right.  Now to the extent that an email earlier suggested that if you followed the V – sorry the DLS single source supply – single supply agreement with VR Laser that that might somehow bring it within the landward strategic objective of Denel to try and keep things in-house.  In your view would it – was that possible – was that feasible?    Just – sorry I am – I was not very clear.  You gave evidence earlier about this landward strategic policy.    That Denel board had already adopted.  They brought in what was previously owned by BAE.    But then became DVS your company.    They already had a – their own capacity and other divisions as well.    And they had bought a majority controlling share in LMT.    And all of your entities and businesses had certain core capabilities.    And capacities and in your case that included as part of your core business the ability to manufacture hulls of armoured vehicles.    Correct. And you said earlier the strategic objective was to try and enhance the in-house capability.    Right.    Right.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes you testified earlier that how it would be achieved would be something that would still developed.    But at this stage were you under at least the understanding that that broad objective was still in place?    Okay.    Yes.    I am really just asking…    yes.    Right.  But that – what I am suggesting to you and just ask you to comment on one way of looking at it perhaps is that if you have an objective that  tries to keep in-house it does not make sense to go out of the Denel’s divisions and companies.    Including DVS to now start getting some of your core business done by VR Laser.    Is – do you share that concern?    Or do I express – do I summarise what your concern was?    Okay.  May I ask you then please Mr Geldenhuys to turn to page 191.    The email half way down seems to be an email from the 13 November 2015.  And it appears to come from – is it from Mr Steyn to Mr – from Mr Steyn yes? Is that right?    And it seems to be addressed in confidence to Jan that Wessels and Odwa that is Mr Mhlontlo.     I beg your pardon Mhlwana yes.    Thank you.  I beg your pardon.  And then Mr – I do not want to go through all of this but you have mentioned this in your affidavit as being an email that Mr Steyn shared with you to show that he had expressed concerns with Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana, is that right?    Okay.  And then if we look at the top email that is from Jan Wessels back to Mr Steyn again their colleague – or Mr Wessels’ colleague Mr Mhlwana was copied in and it is headed Pitfalls and concerns fabrication    Was Mr Steyn raising concerns along the lines that you have raised with the Chairperson today?    With his colleague who was his superior in the group Mr Wessels.    And his colleague also his superior Mr Mhlantla.    Ms Mhlwana I beg your pardon.    I do beg your pardon.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Right.    Okay.  Thank you.  And then I would like to refer again to the email from Johan Steyn to Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana at the foot of this page 191.  We dealt with that but what I am interested in is the following page immediately after the heading or the conclusion regards Johan.  There is a heading Fabrication outsourcing considerations in my copy I assume that everybody has the same copy – colour it is in brown, light brown or tan.  And there are 15/16 points that are considerations relating to the outsourcing of fabrication.  Who do you understand these to be considerations – who do you understand to be the person listing these considerations?    Was that Mr Steyn or who?    Okay if we can look at – as you point out the email itself refers to what you have said about him not giving the input it was from a collective team effort.  I am back at page 191.  Email at the bottom and the first sentence     “To form a small team and brainstorm all the issues/angles concerns with respect to outsourcing our fabrication work.  Below an unedited version of the list I have received an hour ago.  We will use this list to ensure we cover most of the potential pitfalls in the agreement with VRL.  Most notably of it all is the general view not influenced by me that this would not be the right thing to do.” Right thing to do from whose perspective?    From DVS’s perspective and then he puts in brackets items 1 and – item 1 and 2 and then he puts four explanation – exclamation marks I beg your pardon.  Then if we go to look at items 1 and 2 on your list at page    Right.  And then 3  “The outsourcing of all fabrication will rob DVS of the opportunity to develop fabrication QSE’s and EME’s for a purpose of empowerment.” What is QSE’s and EME’s?    Right.    Right.    What about the possible counter argument that well if you giving it to VR Laser if they have black empowerment credentials are you not achieving the same thing?    I see.  And then the fourth point.  Hull – I am sorry. “Hull fabrication is critical for protection and the accountability and reputational risk will remain with DVS but the responsibility will be with another party.” Just explain that to us please?    Right.    So you would be accountable?    If for example soldiers are blown up in a – in an unsafe armoured vehicle you would have to be accountable but you have not manufactured it.  You have got somebody to do it and you…    You leaving it to them to achieve the standard.    Okay.  Thank you.  And then – and then I am not going to deal with all of the other issues but I just want to highlight a few. 7. Consider PFMA requirement.  That is the Public Finance Management Act that an entity must preserve and protect its IP and capability. And then highlighted in yellow Carene to check. That is yourself.    Right.  And then the other point that I would highlight is paragraph 10 Retrenchment or reallocation of current resources in fabrication must be considered.  So one of the various other items that you were concerned about is that there could be implications for having to retrench people who were employed in fabrication in the in-house capability if no longer were they doing the fabrication.    Do I understand you correctly?    Thank you.  Now I would like you to go to another chain of emails that we find immediately following that that is page 193 to 195.  Let us start at the email in November on page 194 from Jan Wessels 17 November 2015 that is an email from Mr Wessels to Mr Ntshepe.    Sorry Chair 194.    About a third of the page down you see from Jan Wessels sent on Tuesday November 17, 2015.  You with me Ms Geldenhuys?    And it appears and I am not going to go through this all but it appears that Mr Wessels was raising some of the concerns that had been raised by Mr Steyn.    And he refers to a meeting on the 13 November which had included Mr Van Der Merwe from VRL and Mr Steyn and Mr Wessels himself.  And then he says – do you see a number of bullet points?    Yes in fact before we get that.  I think I should read into the record if I may Chair the next sentence.     “I have to repeat again that the process and complexity differs from when DLS appointed VRL as preferred single source hull fabricator.  DLS had no in-house capability anyway and used a variety of outsourced fabricators from now with DVS with DVS having a strong in-house capability which needs to be converted in an optimal way.” Am I right in understanding he was raising the point that you have gone into some detail with the Chair to say in DLS’s case they did not have an in-house capability so it might make sense to have an outside provider on a single source basis being VR Laser.  But you were different.  Here DVS as opposed to DLS had its own in-house capacity so why contract it out?    Is he referring to the same point as yours?    Alright thank you.  And then he says   And then there is reference to  “Discreet programs, practicalities, timelines and then the fifth bullet point is acknowledged by both sides that the DVS business plan budget for 2016/2017 plus four years will be affected.  DVS becomes more of a systems company than a manufacturer.” Did you understand that that was where DVS would be heading if it entered into this agreement with VR Laser where a lot of your core business was now – was manufacturing which was now to be done by VR Laser?    Right.  And it says   Sent on the 17 November at 8   It is the top of page 194 line 3 Chair.    That is correct.    So this is an email from Mr Ntshepe replying to the lengthy and detailed email that Mr Wessels had sent him raising inter alia the concerns about the impact this would have on DVS’s core business.    Okay.  So Mr Ntshepe comes back with    We see that he criticises Mr Wessels firstly for being too long in the – in his email and secondly for raising issues that perhaps require rather discussion presumably not discussion by email but face to face and then he – the rest of his email seems to be saying he is under pressure from the chairperson to make structural changes within Denel and the matter was accordingly urgent.  Were you aware that – whether Mr Ntshepe and this email or anywhere else actually got to grips with giving a response of substance to the concerns that Mr Wessels had raised in his email concerning for example the impact on DVS’s core business being taken away?    And that was one of the concerns that you had raised that then went to Mr Steyn, that then went to Mr Wessels and Mr Wessels then was conveying it by way his email below the one that we have just looked at.    Right.    So this is not a reference to the chairperson of the DVS board?    It is a chairperson of the Denel SOC Limited board SOC Limited board to whom Mr Ntshepe reported.    As Group CEO.  Was that your understanding?    SOC.    Right thank you.  May I then proceed to page 193.  That is an email – if you look at the table including subject and who it comes from and to whom.  It is an email sent on the 20 November from Johan Steyn, is that correct?    It is addressed to Mr Mhlwana, Mr Kruger, Mr Du Plessis, yourself Ms Geldenhuys and Mr Ndaba and copied in Stephan Magabolo.    And what Mr Steyn says is this   Did he explain to you why or did you understand why that instruction was – came as a surprise to Mr Steyn?  Was it the point that your raised earlier?    Yes.  And then he continues we have made good progress with Jan Wessels’ help and oversight.  We had several discussions with VRL and DCO about this. DCO meaning?    Corporate Office that is head office?    Headed by Mr Wessels reporting to Mr Ntshepe?    Right.  The process evolved mainly around OMC – what is that?    I see.  So mainly around that division’s fabrication capability how we protect it not to increase risk in the business and we utilise it in the future.  And then says    At that stage.    But the DLS already had its own single source supply agreement with VR Laser?    Is that correct?  You were a separate – in fact not only a – not a separate division in fact a separate company from DLS which was a division of Denel itself.    Is that correct.  What did you – do you have any comment or feeling about why suddenly now Mr Stephan Burger from a separate entity is now becoming actively involved in negotiating and finalising the agreement with VR Laser?    Right.    Okay thank you.  And then it continues.   “I will keep you posted if and when I get feedback.” Am I right to read or do you also read into this a measure of unhappiness on the part of Mr Steyn that he was not necessarily being kept in the loop?    Did he express that to you Mr Steyn?    You cannot recall.     “And then my understanding is the Denel board approval is required before DCO can enter into this agreement. See Jan’s email below.  We – that is Jan, Odwa and I discussed and agreed this with Zwelake last week so until then and after the agreement is signed no – and until after the agreement is signed in other words no onward communication please.” What did you understand that to be instructing you to do?    And then his next paragraph reads    Thank you.  I am sorry Chair.  May I just find the reference?     Yes.  I just need you to confirm.  There is a draft agreement at page 196.  In fact, not a draft.  This is a signed agreement.       Were you involved in the drafting of this agreement?     DLS?     Oh, so that was the one that was actually concluded.  It seems at pages 291 and 220 on the 18t h or the 14t h and then the 18t h of December 2015.       Is that correct?     The signature was in December.  Page 219. The signatures happened on the 14t h and 18t h of December.     But that is, as you pointed out, was the agreement between DLS as the ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  I beg your pardon.       Thank you very much.  I do beg your pardon Chair.  It is actually at page 203.  It is what I was looking for.  Thank you very much.  Is the 19t h of May 2015.       Is that correct?     Yes.     But you were told to use that?     As it were, to copy ...[intervenes]      ...and paste to do a similar agreement for ...[intervenes]      And then the DVS agreement is from page 209.     Right.  Now apart from the initial drafting that you were involved in.  Were you involved in the finalisation of the drafting of this agreement?     Right.  And was that according to instructions from anybody?     Alright.  And did he in fact do that?     Alright.  Let us just take a look at 219.     That was the reference that I confuse myself with earlier.  That was the 14 t h of December.     Signed by Mr Van der Merwe.  I see there is a witness who has signed there  Geldenhuys.  Is that yourself?     I see.  And then on the following page 220, it was signed in Pretoria on the 18t h of December by Mr Steyn.     Is that your signature again as a witness?     You were present this time?     How did it come about that you signed as a witness?     [laughing]       [laughing]  And does this in fact mirror in substance the earlier agreement between DLS and VRL?     In the sense that there was a commitment by the Denel entity to appoint VR Laser, obviously for different things to do, but it was on a single source supply basis.     And what was the period?     Yes.  Similar to the DLS agreement, which was also for a period of ten years, correct?     Right.  Did you and in fact...  Yes, did you have any view on that specific point?  Leave aside whether the issue of whether it was a good business decision to give away a lot of DVS’s core business to an outsider.  Did you have any views as to whether it was appropriate to enter into an agreement for ten years?     Yes, thank you Chair.  May I just have a moment?  I have just been drawn... my attention has just been drawn.     If I can just pick up a point that has just been drawn to my attention?  If we can go back for a moment to page ...[intervenes]      Exactly Chair.       I am and I hope to get with the assistance Chair.     But just before I get to the emails that Ms Geldenhuys has just referred us to, that we will get to.  May I just ask to go back to page 194?  That very brief email that came from Mr Ntshepe.  Mr Ntshepe said, page 194.      And as usual, he refers to a letter coming from the chairman, instructing to divisionalise.  That, of course, was not an instruction from the board.  It seems to specifically approve the VR Laser contract.     Correct?     Okay but now if I can take you ahead to page 207?     You will see this is a trial of emails.     I would like to start at the foot of the page.  The one from Mr Steyn on the 15t h of December to Mr Ntshepe, copying in Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana.  You have it?     Okay.  Then what he says here.  Ja, I think it is with reading it into the record Chair.   “...following your instructions a few weeks ago to sign the agreement with VR Laser for DVS’s fabrication work, we had several discussion with them, initially, with Jan involved and recently with Stephan Burger.   VRL how now signed the agreement attached with minor adjustments of the DLS, Stephan and Denise have reviewed it as well, DVS’s legal, Carene...” That is yourself, is it?     Yes. “...also checked it from a legal point of view.” Now if I can just stop at that point just to get some clarification. His email, we note, is dated the 15t h of December and we have noted a moment ago that VR Laser, in fact, signed it on the 14t h of December.   So he seems to be referring to the very agreement we     With a few minor amendments.  And     Corporate?     Okay.  And then    Yes. MS     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Now I just want to ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I hope about 30-minutes Chair.     I hope so, yes.  I think that is probable.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     We were leading the nonbinding agreement, somebody else was leading the – working towards divisionalising.     Thank you, Chair.  Could we turn to page 159 of your affidavit.   You deal there in paragraph 6 to the next few pages with an item that you have headed the outsourcing of the 40 outstanding N35 hulls to VR Laser and the termination of the Memorandum of Agreement. Now is that the termination of the Memorandum of Agreement we have just been looking at, that was concluded in December 2015?     Right.  Now can you just – I do not propose, Chair, unless you guide me otherwise, to go into the detail of this, this affidavit is there for the Chair to read.     Thank you, Chair.  Can you just sum up for us before we get to the actual termination of the agreement, what did these 40 outstanding N35 hulls and their outsourcing to VR Laser, what did they involve?  Were they hulls covered by the agreement that was concluded, the single source supply or was that something separate?     Right and that took place in 2017.     And then you refer – if I can take you perhaps to page 230.     230, yes.  At the foot of page of page 230 is an email from Pieter van der Merwe who was from VR Laser, is that correct?      And he was addressing your Mr Steyn and yourself, Ms Geldenhuys and others.  What was this email relating to?  What was he requiring?       Was this relating to these additional items to be fabricated?     Which is then?     Yes, thank you.     Alright, then if I may take you to page 232 and 3.  These are two letters that you sent.  The one 232 is dated 8 March 2018 addressed to VR Laser CEO and that refers to a termination that relates to Denel     This does not say you are cancelling a complete agreement though.     And does the same apply to the subsequent letter of 3 April page 233?     I see.  So it was really just clarifying something from your previous letter.     Again not a termination of the agreement itself.     Were you involved in that?     Now I just want to go back to a comment that you made earlier that Mr Steyn was expressing perhaps in diplomatic terms in the emails that we looked at earlier to a feeling that he was being sidelines or kept out of the loop and Mr Burger was now taking the lead in dealing with VR Laser, etcetera.  Your own position, as a member of the executive team at DVS, was there a change in what you understood to be the attitude of others in the Denel organisation in relation to how you were being treated in particular when one looks at how Mr Burger was now taking the initiative, Mr Steyn was no longer kept in the loop to the same extent.  Did this affect you also as an executive team in relation to these matters?     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Geldenhuys, I just want to take you through a couple of – the final paragraphs in your affidavit.  Some of those we have touched on already so I do not propose to go into those.  In paragraph 9 you refer to the prescribed procedure in identifying a single source supplier.  When did your company move into the Denel Group?  At what stage was that?  How soon before this agreement took place?     Which year?     2015.     Five, six months prior?     You indicate your lack of knowledge of particular processes within the Denel Group at the time.  Just explain that to the Chair please?     Now may I just go back to one point that my learned colleague has drawn to my attention which I think does indeed need reference.  Just go back to page 185.  Yes, this is the email we looked at earlier, 13 November, from Mr Steyn to inter alia yourself.  The second – the third after greeting Piet, Carene and Percy,     But ultimately they in fact concluded a single source supply agreement for all the work?     Chair, may I conclude with just one more very brief topic?  On page 163 you deal with the legal status of the Memorandum of Agreement and you refer to certain litigation that was initiated, brought by VR Laser against DVS.  Were you still the legal executive at DVS at the time that was started?     And just very broadly, what does the litigation relate to?  What is VR Laser asking the court to against Denel Vehicles Services?     Yes, certainly.     Right.     Thank you.  And then in 11.3.4 on page 164 you refer to an intention by DVS to review and set aside the Memorandum of Agreement.  Notwithstanding that, it paid an amount of R2.7 million to VR Laser.     Had that been started, that review application, before you left office as legal executive of DVS?     Right, thank you.  Thank you, Ms Geldenhuys.  Chair, we have no further questions from the legal team.     My estimate is still probably three hours, Chair.     So I hope that we can finish comfortably.     I believe so.  That would assist, thank you, Chair.      Yes, thank you, Chair, that should be feasible.     As I have indicated to your previously we plan to call only the one witness, Mr Teubes.  He will in fact cover quite a lot of material but we think that we can finish it comfortably within three hours.     May I just draw to your attention one logistical thing?  You have previously been given a bundle of his documents, his affidavit and annexures.  We have been given at a late stage a supplementary affidavit.  I have in fact not yet had a chance to work on it, I will tonight, but may I just indicate to you that you should expect a supplementary affidavit coming tonight.     Which I understand will be sent by your registrar.     Thank you very much.     Thank you, Chair.

MR DREVIN:  My full name Martin Johan Drevin.    No I do not.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes.    That is correct.    Got it.    That is my signature.    That is correct. ADV KENNEDY    That is correct.    I have been through it and I am satisfied Chair.  Correct.    That is correct.    My job title is Program Manager Hoefyster Phase 2.    Phase 2.    Yes I am.    That is correct.    I was involved in the Project Phase 1 as a Systems Engineer.    The contract for Hoefyster actually right from the start included Phase 1 and Phase 2 the development and the industrialisation and production.  But with – before Phase 2 started off there were further negotiations that changed the contract.    That means that I was – I was still involved in Hoefyster.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I have got it.    That is right.    The one in 2014 was a request for update.    A request for update.    The same.    No the specification is actually comes from Patria the platform supplier.    That was Supply Chain.    Correct.  That is correct.    Yes.    The RFQ has got this different annexures.    I have got the page.    That is correct.    I found it.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    This was the request to update their offers of 12.    Yes before the – or during the negotiations for Phase 2 we priced some of the more expensive components we went out for RFQ to ensure that our price basis was still in line.    Yes.    2012 request.    They were specifically invited.    No.    There was a thought that the work could be dished out to different suppliers and that we could give the contract for the mine protection to one company and a contract for the armour hull to a different company.    Ja it is correct.    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I was involved in that yes.    I was a member of the bid committee.    That is correct.    I signed one of the registers so yes I did.    I signed one of the registers so I would have been there.    There was a questionnaire that was drawn up for each of the suppliers and this was a record of their responses in this clarification meeting.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No it did not strike me as unusual.  The questions were different for the different suppliers.    That was not my responsibility no.    That was a further opportunity.    No it was Supply Chain.    Yes.    No it was not but this was the first time I was involved in such a process.    Yes.    I have got that – I found it.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I was part of that process yes.    We did the scoring for the technical component of the bid evaluation.    The functionality.    The functionality.    That is correct.    That is correct we did not look at the price or the BBBEE score that was populated by Supply Chain.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is…    This is correct yes.    I can recognise it.    I am there.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No it was not.    The supplier audit was part of the tasks that Patria were contracted to and I know about – I knew about the report.    No I did not take that into account.    No our work stopped at finishing the evaluation.    I am sorry Chair can you just repeat?    It was quite a significant gap.    In favour of VR Laser.    We had different questions to answer in the evaluation sheet each which had its own score and going through that process of answering each of these points that was the end result.    Yes.    No as far as I remember when we did the scoring it was not known that VR Laser had a link.    It would depend on if those resources were still available that had built that had experience.    It would depend on if the resources were still available the knowledge was still – most of the knowledge is imbedded in the people.    There was no question for that in the evaluation.    There were certain aspects of that covered in the questions.    Ja certain aspects.    That we could – that would cover that indirectly.    The – I think the relevant question in that regard was one about the capability – the current capability and the current…    Ja I understand.    The questions on the – on the bid evaluation did not specifically cover experience but indirectly it covered the capabilities.     Current capabilities.    No it felt like all the aspects were covered by the questions in the bid evaluation.    I found it.    He was the …    It is a he.  He was responsible for the overall program management on Hoefyster both phase 1 and phase 2.    I received it – my superior Mr Govender cc’s it to me.  If you look at the middle of the page.    I am part of the PCPO group.    That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Transfer of Technology.     Technology.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     No, it was not within my power.     It was not within my power to ...[intervenes]      Yes.     [No audible reply]      That is correct.     The one that is the Transnet transaction.     LMT at that stage did not have sufficient space.  They had moved to a smaller facility.  So they would have needed to get more space to be able to manufacture the Platform Hull and then outfitted so that it then becomes a facility.     That is correct.     We discussed it in the corridor and asked the question that should the whole process go ahead because at that time, the contract was not yet awarded.  It took a long time for the contract to be awarded.     And what came out of those discussion was that we cannot just take them out of the equation without then being blacklisted.     Blacklisted.     Mr Teubes was the – if I remember correctly – the COO at the time and he was Avishkar Govender’s superior.       That is correct.     That would be.     DLS.     That I should prepare a justification for the single source supplier of this limited basket of critical components where the interfaces are very critical and problematic.     It was separate from that.     [No audible reply]      Page 484, that is my email to Celia with the draft of the motivation.     That is correct.     No, I was unaware of the processes behind the screens.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     These were my reasons.     That is correct.     These were the first of the engineering development models where there was a delay from finishing the welded structure in having that machine.     LMT was involved in that.      No, I specifically wrote the motivations so that the supplier that as open ended.     No, these were my reasons.     The main concern was that these components fit together in a proper way.  Being all welded structures, the pollens is a big problem ...[intervenes]      ...to maintain between these assembles.  And in the past with other types of assembles where this was a factor.  If something does not fit then it is always a question of who is responsible.     Which takes quite a time to sort out.  So if you have it at one place then that one supplier is responsible no matter what.     No.     This was just my motivation behind writing the motivation.  It was not.  I specifically wrote it not to specify the supplier.     Because I did not feel comfortable in specifying a supplier.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes, it was part of the motivation.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I do not know but I doubt it.     Yes.     I was especially surprised that the... to the extent of the MOU.     MOU and/or MOA.     Because I was just focused on just specific components.     I do not know.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      The FCM is the Fighting Compartment Module but it is a term that also refers to sometimes what we call the turret hull and I think you would have run across another term, Trunnion(?) machining.  That is basically the same component.       Yes.     In terms of armour steel components, yes.     It was more than.     [No audible reply]      That is correct.     Well, unfortunately, I listened to the testimony of Celia ...[intervenes]      Yes.     No, not before Monday.       No.     No, I was not.      I am not aware of anybody else ...[intervenes]      I am not aware of anybody else being asked.     There is a slight possibility that the programme manager on the other programme AV8 could have contribute.     Yes, I would have.     The value of the separate components was minor.     But the whole basket would have added up to quite a bit.       Ja,     Under the breakdown of the orders that VR Laser received before the... our contract was placed, the Platform Hull contract and then in the interim from the Platform Hull contract up to the MOU and then after the MOU.     It is for the entire range.     [No audible reply]      Okay I found it.     This is a financial report from the VL System.     This was the report from which I extracted the information.       [No audible reply]      That is correct.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Not clearly.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     With previous order that was placed on LMT and I take this to be the AV8 turret hull order.  There were changes from Denel’s side as well as reasons from LMT side why the project overran its schedule.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]  
DREVIN: And different annexures were the responsibility of different departments.   ...on Monday. So, then I became ...[intervenes]  
HENDRIK JOHANNES CHRISTOFFEL VAN DEN HEEVER:  Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van den Heever. (through interpreter)    So help me God. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No.     Yes.     I can...     Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van den Heever.      No.     Yes.     Hundred percent, Chair.     Thank you, I will do so, Chair.  Thank you.     Thank you.     Yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     Yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     Yes, I am there.     That is my signature, yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     I have got it, ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     I would like to change that to state that the prepayment had to be structured and not I had to structure it.     So you want to delete the word “I” and you want to insert the word “be” before structure and you want to amend the word “structure” to read     That is correct, yes.     Currently not, thank you.      That is correct, yes.     I have got it.     That is correct, yes.     I am there.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     It is Mr Khoza.     It states that he was from infantry systems department but he is actually from finance department.     I am not sure if it is Rakadukwe or Rakaduwe.  I think it is Rakaduwe, I am not…     Yes.     That is correct.     Ja, I was requested to amend the spreadsheet to indicate the value up to the end of March.     2014.     That is correct.     I think was Carole, if I am not mistaken.     I have, yes.     I am there.     That is correct.     That is correct.     January 1982.   It was called Lyttelton Engineering Works at that stage.       I started as an artisan – ag, firstly as an appie trainer and then as artisan and worked my way up.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I am currently with production planning, I have moved on back to production planning again.     That is correct.     Correct, yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Can you just explain that to me? ADV KENNEDY     I was just responsible for placing the order according to the procedures, prescribed procedures and stuff.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     Ja, but I think ours was derived from it, I am no hundred percent sure.     It became known to me.     That is correct, ja.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     Ja, I think it was still in process at that stage, it was not – I am not sure if they were already part of this.     The fact that he is part of Denel I felt that the money is kept in Denel if it was given to them.     But the going out on the three quotations that we did as we will see later on changed the route of what was happening.      I was aware of issues, yes.      No, I disagree.      I am a trained artisan so quality and the fact that I have been with Supply Chain for 22 years going out – and I was responsible for half of that time for the quality myself I knew what the standard was for the quality that we required.      No the quality department did raise it but I also had the “ondervinding”.     The experience that is correct, ja.      That is correct.       That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct, yes.       Ja, we have been working on three quotes all our lives, tenders only started coming in since I think 2014/2015 they started talking about tender processes.       But we have been using three quotes system basically my whole 20/22 years that I was there.     That is correct, ja.       That is correct.       That is well basically because we have not bought any hulls on previously and only after stuff has been bought then you start get the system use to on the system which give you a last purchases prices and all that kind of information.      Ja, basically we had a supplier database and with the experience and backing that I had plus my colleagues could determine which supplier is currently in the database has got the ability and capability to manufacture these heavy structured hulls and working through that and getting the inputs it was decided on four suppliers which was then LMT, VR laser, BA Systems and DCD-Dorbyl.     That is correct, yes.       Mechem.     They were doing landmine lifting and clearing, the landmine clearing department and dog training.     I did.     No, I got an email from Mr Riaan Badenhorst with the attached RFO that I was supposed to send to the three suppliers.     I did, yes.     Only to three as BA Land Systems at that stage was sort of competition for part two and they requested us not to give them their IP.  So they were removed from the list.     That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       Okay.     Okay that as far as my knowledge on that is that Patria came to visit – the identified suppliers in South Africa that DLS has identified and to give us there input due to their background and the fact that they have manufactured so many of them already of who will be according to them will be the best supplier and with the best capabilities…[intervene]     To manufacture the hull.      That is correct, yes.       I had a line manager between me and her.     At that stage 2014 I think it was either Mr Dupree or Cindy Minnaar I am not sure which of the two.     But there were a line manager between me and Celia.     Just explain by attending to it?     Yes, that is correct.       That is correct that is actually the RFQ but, ja.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct.       Ja, now this 252 is the letter from Celia.     That is correct, yes.       Because the previous quote that we received was I think in 2012 and then in 2014 the request came through to update their quotations.     So after two years you would expect a change in price so that is why we request the update.     That is correct, yes.       That is correct, yes.       Yes, they did just one thing is we first sent the updated request to LMT and then a week later we got confirmation from Patria of which we were waiting for to say that we can continue with the rest of the suppliers in South Africa that we have identified and we received those letters, that letter on the 6 t h of I think it was June 2014 and then we sent exactly the same RFQ’s to all three of the suppliers and informing LMT that there response date is also extended to the same as the other two suppliers.         Ja.     That is correct, ja.       That was like where we identified the four suppliers and where they came back and they said sorry if OMC is not acceptable or if BA Land Systems is not an acceptable supplier.       And we just had to confirm with them that this is now the three suppliers that we going to and get confirmation from them that we can go to them.  So we got the letter back from them that said that they happy with the suppliers.      That is correct.       That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       Ja, because LMT was part of Denel they had no problem with them.      That is correct, yes.       That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct.   ADV KENNEDY     That is correct, yes.       That is correct, yes.        That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct.       That is correct.       That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct, yes.       Ja, there was a separate feedback on the same day different slots.      Yes, I have got it.     That is correct.       That is correct, yes.       That is correct.       Okay, the process like I said it was something near to us on the 25 t h when we received the quotations the BEC got together and they worked through all the quotations and as they work through it they were looking at some stuff that needed clarity they had questions about it was painting included.  So there was various questions working through the quotes and working through them we drew up a list of questions that we need to ask the suppliers just to clarify on their quotations.   So the next day on the 26 t h they were invited to come and give clarification on their quotation.  So each supplier came in at a certain time and we asked them the questions that came up in there quotes and they gave us the answers and they were each then asked to update their quotes with that latest information, with that explanation for that, ja.        I hope that makes sense?     Yes.      That was the list – this specific list on 389 was the questions that was raised with VR Laser regarding clarification required on their quotation.       Similar questionnaire but on top you will see that is for DCD.      That is it and it indicate what time they were supposed to be in.     Which page are we on now?    That is correct yes.    Yes their price changed from 736 534 to 763 191.  That was due to the paint included.    Ja they just confirmed I think there was a bond – the bond – raising a bond – performance bond – the cost of it.    That is correct yes.    Yes I was part of the bid BEC they did the scoring but I was not involved in the final consolidation of everything.    I cannot give you the reason but after the BEC got their – did the evaluations and the scorings and stuff all the documentation was collected and then taken by Rolland Rakhaduwe and I do not know who helped him or who was involved in it but they did the final reconciliation and consolidation and everything and then I just received the final results at the end.    I just received the final result at the end.    Not – not that I am aware of anything.    What page again 132?    I am there.    That is correct yes.    This one is where they – where the consolidation…his one is where they – where the consolidation…    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    Okay when I sent out the RFQ I did not request each supplier to submit a BBBEE certificate or a valid BBBEE certificate but that was requested during our clarification session that we had with each supplier and we asked them to submit the certificates for us.    Okay I am there.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    I just – well during that stage it was almost standard for a supplier to submit a BBBEE certificate and a tax certificate with their quotations that they submit to us.  And I just forgot to request that or put it in the request.    Well that was a standard I could not place any orders without BBBEE certificate and a tax certificate – tax clearance certificate.    That is it during that clarification meeting we had with each supplier on the 26t h June.    That is correct each supplier was asked to submit the BBBEE cert.    Yes I think they were given fourteen days to submit if I could remember correctly.    We were in June 2014 at that stage and their expiry date on their certificate was 20 May 2014 which was just over a month expired.      I am there.    That is a letter received from Empower Logic stating that LMT is in the process to do their BE verification and that it will be done within four to six weeks.  It will take till six weeks to complete.    That is correct.    No that was not part of the scoring process done by them – by the group.    That information was done on the next level where Mr Rakhaduwe collected all the documentation and did the finalisation.    I am there.    Ja.    That is correct yes.    Can I just say that I receive – at that stage I received a whole file with all the evaluations and final scorings and consolidations in one file given to me in my office telling me there is the results or the VR Laser is the winning bidder and we are going to place the order on VR Laser.    Well as mentioned in my affidavit is that we have never done this BBE or this scoring and I was not sure how it worked and what the – where the percentages and stuff came from so I had no background on it, no training.  The whole team had no training it was a first for all so I could not find any fault in what was happening.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct. ADV KENNEDY    That is correct.    That is correct yes.    I am there.    That is correct yes.    That is the executive – Chief Executive Supply Chain submission requesting the approval of the order.    Yes.    As you can see from my mail that I have sent to Celia where I said I hope I have captured most of the points required this morning.  She basically told me what to put in the document.    That is correct yes.    If I remember correctly it was I think R206 million or R209 million I am not sure.    If I cannot remember correctly but this was – I was told by Celia to put this in with the negotiations – putting in the ceiling amount for further negotiations I think she said there was some sort of a – a mandate that we had for R1million and 50 or R1 million or R1 million and 50 per vehicle that we need to negotiate so that is – I think that is why this was put in.    That is correct.    That is correct yes.    Well that is basically what it is saying.    Ja that is the ceiling amount that will not go above that.    It could stay the same.    But …    But its idea was to negotiate it down ja.    Ja it basically comes down to you can approve this it will not go higher than that but it can lower.  So that is what it is basically saying ja.    Ja at this stage it was on management level for their decision.    Of what could happen and what the plans will be.    Well if you look at the document if they approve that amount of 262 you have got the mandate to go and place the order for that but you still need to prove that you tried to negotiate the price down.    DLS yes.    That is correct.    That is correct yes.    Ja you see the process that we normally follow there is a DLS Supply Chain Committee that we take this to them.  They sort of approve or recommend it and then it goes to EXCO.  Then once EXCO sees it and recommends it then to DCO.  That is the process that we follow.    DLS.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is it ja.    No.  It gets done on EXCO level.    That is correct.    No but it was during that process that a communication with the suppliers that I made LMT aware of that there was other suppliers also in the running for the contract.    That is correct yes. ADV    That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja and a final written warning was given.     That is correct, yes.      That is it.     Ja, it is the value of orders placed by me on VL Laser for a period from August 2008 to the requested date of 30 or 31 March 2014 with the reasoning that that was when VR Laser ownership changed to the ownership.     That is correct.     That is hull contract, everything or armour plate work that VL is required.  It was plate based on VR Laser by me.  It comes to that version for that period.     I am not sure.  I think...  Ja, the whole price could be included in...  No, the whole price was not included in this one.  I cannot remember but we will have to have a look on the spreadsheet.     Which are you referring to here?     No, I was not involved in that at all.     H’m.     Yes.     The directive that was issued by Denel SOC stated that all business relationship with VR Laser must be separate(?) on 1 June 2018.  And that was due...  Well, when the State Capture or investigation.  All work with VR Laser was ended.      Ja, what I am saying.  The R 56 million...  Okay, the periods run from R 112 million was the amount that was placed based on the MOA.     And after that directive, open lines was closed which telling us that R 56 million, of that R 112 million was already delivered and completed.     [No audible reply]      Page 2.     Page 2 of the supplementary.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.  By myself, yes.     By myself, yes.     Yes, correct.     Correct.     There were other colleagues as well.     Yes, that is correct.     [No audible reply]      No, that was for the whole period.  That includes the hulls, everything, up to 2018.     Ja, that is correct.  That was before the MOA period.     Well, there is a magnificent different but we did not have it, the contract at that stage and it will explain the change in figures.     That is correct, yes.  ADV KENNEDY     Nothing that I can think of now.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     Where?     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Well, my understanding was that LMT had a cash flow problem and that they needed the assistance of DLS.     I think so, ja.  They were not part of us yet.     Ja, my understand was that due to this contract, which was not paid or something, resulted in becoming or getting the ownership in LMT.  That is my understanding of it.     It is basically that if you do not get Phase 2 of the Hoefyster Contract from Armscor...     That is correct.  Ja, and then you deal with the suspension conditions because the suspension condition refers to that.     No, DLS did not even, at this stage, has not completed Phase 1.     That is correct, yes.     H’m.       That is correct, yes.     I am not sure.  I think it was due to the fact that... the money was paid or whatever.  I do not know.  But there was no need for the contract ...[intervenes]      ...any longer, I think.  I am not sure.     [No audible reply]      That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     [No audible reply]      H’m.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     Ja, it was just turrets.     Which they delivered to Malaysia that was fitted on an Indian fabricated vehicle.     That is correct, yes.     Well, it makes sense to me, yes.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     Okay firstly, the procedure is to go out on quotation and...  In other words, compile an RFT(?).  Send it out to the supplier, get your quotations or to the three suppliers which is part of your purchasing file that you need to have.  And this was not followed.   I was just given a quotation that came from LMT and requested to place the order to that value of which Mr Van der Linde... the requisitions that are used, to place the order.   And then the approval of the order to that value of R 10 million normally takes two to three weeks for approval.  And this only took about two days for all the signatures.     That is correct.     Well, according to me, you still need to follow procedure.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     Well, the order was loaded by me and sent to LMT for signature.     And it was returned on the same day and invoiced the next day for payment of R 5.7 million and payment went through.  So I do not know.     No, not according to me.     Only what was told to me by Mr Teubes that the money will be paid back once LMT get their money from somewhere in the Middle East.   I am not sure what country it was but they were expecting an amount from UAE or somewhere and then they will refund this money.  And if they do not refund it, then we will have the 51% ownership.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     Sometimes.  Depending on the value.  But on this R 10 million there should at least be some sort of agreement but there was no agreement.       Except for the order that was placed on LMT.     Okay.  When the order was loaded, the requisitions that was generated by Mr Van der Linde were used to create the lines in the purchase order. And that comes from a note where the project stores their money.  And all the payments that was done on this, never went through on that requisitions.   It went through on advance payments and on different accounts.  So those requisitions are basically unused and it was just connected to the order.   And then the project manager needed that money because he, well, I assumed he paid some of the money from these advanced payment accounts. It was taken out of his notes.  So he wanted us to close the orders that those requisitions... the money that was... that R 10 million that was allocated to that order become available for his project again.  If that makes sense?     Normally you should have – get a delivery against an order, a delivery note stating this is what we deliver which then goes through the stores for receipt and invoice to finances to pay against the requisition that is linked to the order.  This, we just received invoices and it was paid out of advanced payment account.     I think that was what was paid out on that order of R10 million, R9 698 370 was paid to LMT.     And …[intervenes]    Ja, if you go back I think to point 69.     Finance verified that they  - LMT paid the full amount back to LMT on the order and when I got the information and did the calculation I saw that there was – not all the money was received back but 472 971 was still outstanding but they could not give explanation why.     Thank you,  Chair. 
MNR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ek verstaan, ja. 
MR PILLAY:  Good morning, Chair.    I confirm what Adv Kennedy has conveyed to you this morning.    Thank you.    Mr van den Heever, that is correct.    Thank you, Chair. 
KENNEDY SC:  And it appears that you were suspended, is that right? 
HEEVER: Ja, I think it was a Mr De Bardien(?) that requested that documentation.  It is somewhere in my statement.  Let me just see.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   Carene Geldenhuys.     No, I do not.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, I have.     That is correct.     Yes, I was, when I was still employed by Denel.     Yes.     No, it was Diale Attorneys.     Yes.     No.     Then end of March – no, the end of April, sorry, 2020.     August – it was – when I started it was still BAE Systems, Land Systems South Africa, that was in 2006 and then in April 2015 we were acquired by Denel, our business in South Africa.     No, it was a standalone entity.     With its own board but fully owned by Denel SOC.     Yes.     It is Denel Vehicle Systems (Pty) Ltd.     Yes.     That is correct.     I was legal and commercial executive on the DVS executive team.     That is correct.     No.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     At that stage we got an instruction through Mr Ntshepe who was the Acting CEO of Denel at that stage to enter into an agreement with VR Laser.  We were not – because it was not something that came from within the business as a requirement that we have identified VR Laser as to be partner with us, we were not quite sure what it is that we need to contract with them, what type of arrangement it was.     We then took guidance from Mr Jan Wessels who was the COO of Denel at that stage.  When he guided us to enter into a very high level nonbinding noncommittal type of agreement wherein we will agree that we will explore avenues to maybe in future collaborate together.     And that was then the agreement that was drafted.     I believe so.     I am not one hundred percent in terms of the timeline.     But this was – we – I know that Mr Saloojee was suspended at the end of September 2015, this is in the beginning of November, so I doubt it very much if there would have been a formal appointment already.     That is correct.     Like I have explained, we just became part of Denel.  In the previous way that we did business under the BAE System’s flag it would have been very strange because the business would identify who they need as a partner and they would substantiate why they need that partner.  It was strange that it came from the corporate office that we have to enter into an agreement but it was also well, maybe this is the Denel manner.  We were too new in the group to one hundred percent say this is not the way that it is done.      Yes, I was.     Yes, so I got a basis of the agreement from Mr Wessels which you will see in the pack where he said well, he has used this type of agreement before and he suggests we use it as a basis.  We then took that agreement, which is nonbinding, noncommittal and we just amended it so that it fits into the current circumstances in terms of the type of business that we are doing and then talking that we will then investigate further if there is indeed collaboration opportunities for the two businesses to work together.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I am.     That is correct.     Yes I did but it was from – with input that I received from Mr Jan Wessels.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct. ADV KENNEDY     Yes, I did.     So as it is reflecting in clause 3 of the confidentiality agreement it was discussions and information to be exchanged that relates to the exploration of possible future collaboration between the parties to exploit  the complementary capabilities there is between the parties.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes I do.     That is correct.     I think at this stage that we entered into this agreement it was not the intention of the business to give some of the DVS business to VR Laser at that stage.     We entered into this agreement to see if there is something that is not part of our core capability that we can give to them but we will need to have discussions with them to figure out what is there that we can give to them.  It was never from the beginning the intention that we will give our main work to VR Laser.     That is a fair reflection.     That is correct.     We understood that Mr Ntshepe contacted Mr Steyn and said to him that this is not the instructions that was given, what we have entered into is nonbinding agreement without agreed work share and this is not what was requested.  It is requested that we entered into a binding agreement guaranteeing that there will be some work going to VR Laser.     As I understood it, it was – this was communicated to us by Mr Steyn, which was the CEO of DVS, who was my boss and he was conveying it to his executive team being the information or being told by his boss, Mr Ntshepe, that this is not – this agreement is not what they want.     Well, as the executive team we all knew about it and this was with Mr Wessels, it was our plan, we are going to kick the ball into the future, we are going to do an agreement, it is not going to be binding and we will see what it is that we can do, we have got the …[intervenes]     …the powers to be from our backs and we are going to go forward with our business as usual, it did not work.     We did say to him we signed an agreement.  He received the agreement, as far as I recall, and then a day or two later …[intervenes]     No, he was angry.     We were cheeky that way.     We did not really understand what it is that we need to contract with them for.     I mean, it was uncomprehendable [sic], we have got our business, now we are asked to enter into agreement with another business and – but for what?  I mean, it was – so you will see throughout my affidavit there is various actions we took and brainstorming we did and feedback, that we kept on getting and say but this cannot work and this is why it cannot work.   So we were told enter into agreement and we entered into agreement.  It was not binding and – but let us see if there is something that we can do that is not giving away our core capabilities and our main business.   And yes, there was a real intention to see if there is on the side something that we can give to them but the intention was never to give our core capability or our core business to them.     That is exactly the way the contract is structured.  You will – and I might be jumping now into the – what you will lead me to.     So what we did is we first entered into a nonbinding agreement and then it was said no, better you go for a binding agreement.  There was various – and we will most probably go through it, iterations how it ended up, what the binding agreement looked like. But there is a little rider that we put into the agreement where we kept on – where we were saying okay, we will do that but on condition that we need to look at a couple of things.   And in our mind if we get there one day, we will fight the fight again, that it will not make sense for us, as a business, to give our work to VR Laser. So as the executive team under Mr Steyn’s leadership we felt that we were keeping our backdoor open a little bit although we are not upsetting our leadership in the Denel Group too much.     We were extremely uncomfortable.     That is correct.     I was not present in the meeting but the meeting took place in Mr Steyn’s office which is directly opposite my office and it is glass offices, so I could see the meeting happening although I was not in the meeting.     Yes.     That is correct.     Like I said my office is ...[intervenes]      ... it is over ja, and Mr Steyn giving – this instruction came to entering into an agreement like in the day before, they were in his office while I was sitting across the aisle drafting and finalising it, so he would walk in and out in my office to find out how far am I with the agreement already, and I know they were in there, I might have walked in there ...[intervenes]      I think I was cc’d on the invitation, the business invitation, the outlook, and that says Singhala     Yes, only later on.     I want to come back to my evidence earlier on, we were quite new in the Denel stable so the PMFA and the PPPMA – we weren’t accustomed to it yet. So, at that stage, when the words, single source supplier was used in our environment it was just exactly the same what the layman will say, single source supplier.  So, it was not linked back exactly to how we would from, a supply chain perspective from the state-owned entity look at a single source supplier.  So, to us it is team with these people and you can have a type of exclusive agreement with them to work with them.     Yes.     We still did not know at that stage.  So, it only, later on panned out that they were talking about that they want us to do all our hull manufacturing at VR Laser. So, throughout this period that we were entering into new agreement or entering and discussing agreements, it came out that they are talking about hull manufacturing at VR Laser. Although we started off, let’s see what there is that’s not part of our core capability that we can give to VR Laser.     That’s correct.     I just want to correct you, it’s DVS not DLS.     No, it’s fine.  So, we were, at this stage being told that there is already agreement that was entered by DLS with VR Laser and that they would suggest then that we mirror the type of agreement that DLS has entered into with VR Laser.  So, there was then stages where they said, well let’s combine DVS and DVS become a party of the DLS and VR Laser agreement.  That posed various issues in terms of the amendment of the agreement because it’s – DVS is not a division of Denel, it’s a separate legal entity and then it was decided, well the best and the fastest route for us to go is to enter into a similar agreement that DLS had with VR Laser. Yet again, that’s where we did a little bit of changing, sort of giving ourselves the opportunity to get out of this agreement should we – the business case mean that we are not bound by this agreement.    That’s correct.      Absolutely.     After we have been acquired – the DVS business by Denel there was a lot of talk, let me rather say, after the – if I recall correctly, after the suspension of Mr Saloogee there was a lot of talk that the Landward business will consolidate, which will mean that it will be the LS, DVS and LMT that we will consolidate but there wasn’t a proper manner in which we were going to do it and there wasn’t a real direction what the type of legal entity would be, it was just this cluster that will have a joint vision and this is then talking to the cluster being those three – or two divisions and our business’ joint vision as it is envisaged by the DCO teams.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     That’s correct. ADV KENNEDY     I just want to add here, this was very early stages, very high level.  The detail was never flushed out, so it was very much blue sky statements that was being made. Definitely for us in the business unit, there was no tangible plans at that stage, understanding how it will work, how it will flush out into the day-to-day of the businesses.     Yes.     Absolutely.     Absolutely.     Board, Executive level at the Group, I’m not sure where.     That’s correct.     It did not make sense to us.     I think at that stage, and I don’t want to put words into Mr Steyn’s mouth, I think he was very much aware that, through the VR Laser channel it – there is feedback into the Executive level in Denel.  What I was referring to in this paragraph is – and it’s supported by the emails that I attached hereto, is where Mr Steyn explained to Mr van der Merwe that we cannot just enter into an agreement and say, okay we’re going to give you some of the work, we are a business, we’ve got an integrated business plan that we’ve prepared for a five-year period where we committed that we will give a certain return to our shareholder.  If it is that we need to change and take some of our core capability and our core work out of our business plan then we will have to change our business plan and go back to the Denel Board who is the authority that approves our business plan, they then need to see what is the impact of us taking out our business, out of our own business plan and they need to authorise it. So, this is the reason why we kept on – or they kept on referring, it needs to be approved by the Board because the Board needs to see the impact, financially, what it will mean to the DVS business if we take the business that rightfully belongs then to DVS and we place it on VR Laser.     Mr Steyn.     I cannot answer that question, what I can answer is that, continuously, Mr Steyn, through correspondence which is added to my affidavit and from our business we continuously conveyed to DCO and Mr Ntshepe why this cannot work.  So, we reiterated why it cannot work, I do not bear knowledge whether he asked, why must we do this.     No.     Where we did tell him this cannot work for our business?     I do believe, not where I was present but I do believe, if I look at the correspondence which I was copied in to, it does look like there have been meetings where Mr Steyn was present and some of them where Mr Wessels was also present wherein they explained or tried to explain to Mr Ntshepe why this cannot work and does not work for our business.     Not to my knowledge.     I’ve got it.     That’s correct.     Yes.     That’s correct.     Yes.     He was the – he was from DVS and he was the Operational Executive.     That’s correct.     Also, a DVS colleague, he was, at that stage, I believe the General Manager of Gear Ratio     That’s correct, he was the Director of Programmes and IT at DVS.     Yes.     Executive team, so both Kruger, myself, Indaba and du Plessis was part of the DVS Executive team.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Odwa Mhlwana, Obo was at that stage the acting CEO of Denel after Mr Saloogee and Ntlontslo …[? 17.58] were suspended.  I need to say that Odwa came with us from BAE Systems. So, there was a close, at this stage, a very close relationship between us because it was one of our colleagues that was now pulled up to head office.     That’s Correct. ADV KENNEDY     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Yes, it was.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Yes.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Absolutely.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     So, we’ve got a baseline for the amount of people that we’ve got and we have to sell a certain amount of vehicles or product, whatever it is to cover the amount of people and the overhead cost that we’ve got. So, if we don’t sell enough, we have got under recoveries or we’ve got over recoveries.     That’s correct.     No, at that stage there was – and this is exactly what he referred to, a white paper, if I recall correctly, about Black Industrialist Programme that the Government wished to roll out and it was then decided that we will use this Black Industrialist Programme at least as some sort of justification why we are entering into this agreement because we can’t just follow the DLS agreement because they say in their view they don’t have the capability to do it.  We’ve got the capability, we have to state that we’ve got the capability but now you have to rationalise, if you’ve got the capability, why is it that you need to outsource it and this is the best and the close to getting to somewhere wherein you look then at the Black Industrialist Programme.  I have to say I know there were talks about it, I can’t recall the detail of the programme so unfortunately, I can’t comment further on the programme.     We were in an extremely difficult position.     It was definitely what our situation was in – hindsight is always a perfect science but when we were in the happenings, I think the business rationale for this does not make sense for us.  We are an old business, we know what we do, we’ve shown profits, we are good on what we are doing. It does not make business sense for us to give our business away to anybody else.  That was a bigger drive for us than whether it was VR Laser, whether it was for DLS, whether it was LMT, the drive for us is, why must we give our business away. So, at that stage the big – the red flags was definitely on our level, not what we know now it was more, why do we – business principles, this does not make sense.     Absolutely.     Yes.     That’s correct.     Yes, so both Mr Wessels, Mr Mhlwana and Mr Steyn reported to…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes.    That is correct.    According to Mr Steyn yes.    So this was very high level it was not on the executive level of the business discussed or – it was for information for us.    Just repeat the question please.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I – I also just want to say the – the direction or the strategic intent it changed quite often.    So – so I would not know at this stage what it was; where it was.    Whether it was let us consolidate and be one company and we bring you in and we divisionalised you whether you going to stay on your own but we just going to manage.    Whether it was very fluid.    That is correct.    Yes it was.    But there was also an understanding that there was a strategic agreement that was being entered into a VR Laser.   For what I do not know.    For the bigger – for the bigger part of the business.    I mean we knew we did not understand for our part of the business why we need to do it so the rationale why it was there for the bigger part of the business was they have shared with us.    No.    No it does not.    Yes.    It is 100% correct because if we would have done that it would have meant that DVS would have ended up in a systems house and not with the manufacturing capability and that was not what our main business was.  Our main business was physically manufacturing.    Yes.    That is correct.    No Mhlwana.    Yes.    That is correct.    So…    Yes.    That is correct.    Mhlwana.    That is correct.    That is correct and then the – the coming back yet again we were new in the groups so Mr Jan Wessels was the COO.    So Mr Steyn at that stage leaned quite on him because it was guiding into the group.    As the COO I mean with him as well.    And Johan kept raising the concerns that we have got.  We have drafted lists; we have calculations; we showed what our concerns is and then Jan I do believe that he tried as well to convince Mr Ntshepe that this is not the right and you will see it from the emails that this is not the same scenario as the VR – DLS scenario because they do not have capacity or capability to do hull manufacturing and that it cannot be seen as exactly the same that Mr Wessels eventually said well the best thing that you can do now is the board needs to decide.  You will have to tell the board what is the impact of this agreement.  If you enter into this type agreement what is the impact?  You will show it in your business case and your business plan for the next five years on the board meeting that was scheduled for the 7 December and then the board needs to decide what is it that they want to do.  Does the board want you to enter into an agreement like this or not?    This is what I understand from this email.    So…    So how this list came about was Mr Steyn requested myself, Abrie Du Plessis, Piet Kruger and Percy Ndaba to brainstorm if we go through this agreement what the impact would be on our business.  And this was – we had off site strategic session and we just in 10/15 minutes compiled this list to indicate what we see as the executive team or a core part of the executive team why this agreement would be problematic.  And you will then see in the email on the previous page where he then actually informed Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana that this agreement was drafted by his team and there was no influence from his side.  I think it – at this stage it must be said that Mr Steyn was now obviously at this stage seen in the group as being blocking all the agreements because he just did not – he kept on coming back and saying no this cannot happen, this cannot happen.  So it was seen or it was – he was seen and most probably then the executive team have – of DVS was seen as being a – a little rock in somebody’s shoes.    That is correct.    From DVS’s perspective.    Absolutely.    It is micro enterprises and qualified enterprises.  It is part of the – the BBBEE score card and how you develop.    The industry.    As well as previous disadvantaged individuals.    Ja but I do not think that they were – or they were the qualified enterprises or the micro enterprises.    So when he is referring to protection.  He is referring to landmine protection.    So the fabrication of the hull is critical for landmine protection and the accountability will remain with us but the responsibility to ensure that there is landmine protection is now outsourced to another party.  So we will take the risk but we are not 100% in control of the risk.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes I am.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Exactly.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes we were.    No I am not aware.    That is correct.    It is indeed.    It is indeed.    Mr Mantla.    Mantsha yes.    No.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes so…    So this was talking to the Denel SOC board.    The chairman of that board.    What I understand from this email was what happened was that Mr Ntshepe indicated that the chairman said DVS must be divisionalised meaning we cannot be a stand-alone business anymore we must be pulled into Denel group and not be a stand-alone company anymore and that real cost savings must be shown which I read between the lines as a subtle threat in if we need to show cost savings you have got two businesses, the work is there but the only thing that is duplicated is the executive teams. So some of the executives need to go that is the real cost saving. He also then goes further when he said and Stephan will take the lead on this which in effect will then mean that Mr Steyn’s authority level is taken away from him and he is moving underneath Mr Stephan Burger from DLS.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Because it was not driven by our business.    Denel Corporate Office.    Yes.    That is correct.    So it is stands for Olifant Manufacturing Company.  It is an old legacy name of one of the divisions of DVS.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Mr Steyn was resisting too much and his executive team.    And like I said earlier on in effect him and his executive team was moved one layer lower than the authority then that sits with DLS.    Ja I definitely read it that he will not be part of discussions because he is resisting too much.    I cannot recall it was so many words.    But we all knew this is what is happening.    So we have to wait for the board approval and let us first see if there is approval before we communicate within the business to the people in the business that there is an agreement being entered into.     That is correct.     That is correct.     No, this is the agreement between VR Laser and DLS.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Just repeat again, please?     Yes, that is correct.     No.  You... there... the one agreement starts on page 209.     Correct.     [No audible reply]      Ja.  So I was not part of this agreement.     So this agreement starts on page 196 which is with VR Laser and the DLS.  And I was not privy to this agreement.  I was given this agreement afterwards.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, on that basis.  Yes.     That is correct.     Yes, I was.     Yes.  So we were then told to complete the agreement.  It was then given to DLS and some of the senior people at DLS, reviewed the agreement as well.  And when they said they are happy with the agreement, we then concluded that we are in a position for Johan Steyn to sign the agreement.     I believe, if I recall correctly, that VR Laser signed it first.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is but I was not present at the signature.     That is correct.     Yes, and I was present here.     Yes.     I cannot recall.  I was now shocked when I saw this.  [laughing]     I do not know whether I maybe have signed on the wrong line.  I do not know.     This is a binding agreement.  Yes.  [laughing]       But not a binding witness.  [laughing]       That ...[intervenes]      That is correct.     It was for a period of ten years.     That is correct, yes.     I cannot say that we have given this a lot of thought.  At this stage, we were so... we tried everything ...[intervenes]      ...to enter into this agreement.  We just... we had a couple of sentences that would give us an out but we stopped the fight.  We could not proceed with it anymore.  I mean, it ended up that, like I said earlier on, that the business was sort of restructured because we were resisting too much.       So I cannot tell you that at that stage, I even thought about the duration of the agreement because this is the agreement we are going to enter into.  We will enter into it and we have given ourselves a caveat in certain circumstances, we will not proceed with this agreement and let us fight the fight when we get there, when we were supposed to place orders on VR Laser.     I do not know if it happened.  In the evidence it is that Mr Steyn asked Mr Ntshepe if it indeed happened, if the board gave authority for us to proceed with the agreement.  And then in my pack there, there is an email back from Mr Ntshepe that said this is approved, go ahead to sign the agreement.       So whether it happened in front of the board, whether the board ever discussed it, we bear now knowledge.       No, I ...[intervenes]      I just want to look at the emails again.  I...     The email trails specifically referred to, there is a board meeting.     This need to go to the board meeting.     What happened now...     So if it was not said physically.  Did the board approve it?  It is definitely alluding to it that the board approved this.     Yes.     That is correct.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes, these are the emails I referred to earlier on, to the Chair.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Fortune was the Legal Manager at Denel Corporate office.       Ja.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember or recall her surname.     No.  But I understood this to be, there was a board meeting and it is approved at the board.     So whether the 7t h of December, this board meeting took place, whether this was an agenda item on the board meeting, I bear no knowledge.     It never actually came to fruition.     So we were working towards it but it did not come to fruition.     That is correct.     They would have been covered by the agreement but there was more than this 40 hulls, if I recall correctly, and now I might be wrong on the amount of numbers.  We designed this vehicle and then we built 30 preproduction units.  Now part of the – you recall that we said that there is pilot runs that needs to happen before you can outsource your fabrication so that you get to a certain maturity level.  We built the vehicles in-house to get to the maturity level. Then there was a follow on order on – or it was part of the same order, but there was 40 vehicles to be built which was now in a state that it is really to be outsourced and it is now past the certain maturity state but then we decided that this 40 vehicles and this is – we kicked the ball to – from 2015 to February 2017.  So now we are in February 2017 and we did our sums and we said it is not worth our while to outsource this, we need to build these 40 vehicles within DVS and then Mr Steyn informed Mr Ntshepe and Mr Mgwana that we are going to build - the executive team and himself decided we are going to build these vehicles within DVS.     That is correct.     That is correct.     230?     That is correct.     So for …[intervenes]     I am not hundred percent sure if it was only to that specific order but it is indeed to all the work that has happened in DVS.  So what happened was, in the binding agreement we kept that caveat for ourselves, if it makes financial sense for us, we will look at it to contract VR Laser but what we kept on doing is we did our business case each and every time before we placed the order and what we did is we did ask VR Laser to quote and we did ask other people to quote as well and then based on information that we got we figured out what it is that we can do ourselves and then we decided.   So this email that was written in July 2017 by Mr Pieter van der Merwe – and I have to just qualify that I was not deeply involved in the supply chain process and the various programmes and opportunities that was running at that stage which he is referring to.  He came to us and he said but we have entered into agreement, we are seen in the market that we are quoting, you are never coming back to us and saying whether we are successful.  We thought we have got a single source supplier agreement with you but we do not see orders coming to us, do you still think that we have got a single source supplier agreement or do you not agreement anymore?  Which is in effect his email.     Which is in effect the contents of his email.     We have got an agreement but we do not get work from you so what is happening?     VR Laser, yes.     Since December 2015.     I can bring it under the Chairperson’s attention that there was indeed one order that we did place on VR Laser for fabrication of hulls in this period but our business case at that stage, where we were in our business, it would have been more to the business’s profitability if we outsourced it because we did not have enough people at that moment.  We had to ramp up and everything and it made sense.  At that stage VR Laser was cheaper than us then what we could have done it inside.     So it made financial sense to us.  I think, if I recall correctly, it was for 9 RG32 vehicles that we placed the order on them.     That is correct.     No, it was the orders.     The subsequent letter is actually the – the order number was incorrectly – so the subsequent letter was just fixing the incorrect quoted order number.     Yes, yes.     No, I understood that the strategy agreements with VR Laser, according to my knowledge, was cancelled at a corporate level at a certain stage.     No.    Yes, during divisionalising discussions there was a new structure for the landward business.  Like I explained, show cost savings, there is just two executive teams one needs to end up and there was discussions with various executives members as to where you will fit in, who you will report to and – ja, so we had to compete for our positions again to be in this landward structure on the executive team.     From a legal point of view I agree with you, the structure cannot work like that, it is two separate legal entities and you cannot now just dissolve a legal entity by a piece of paper overnight.  Somebody that is not your employer now decides – that we know and that we have, myself particularly raised numerous times to Mr Burger and saying but this cannot happen this way and it was ignored.   So whether it is a combination of a bit of threats going on or whether there was a, in my mind, as a legal person, legally that could not happen, it just cannot happen.  They do not have legal stance but from a business perspective from divisionalising and consolidating and Mr Burger being the head of our business, in terms of the Denel Group that happened and he has got authority over us.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     From that email where Mr Ntshepe     So there was a meeting – he referred in that email, I showed an email to everybody from the     From that moment.     From that moment, yes.     So it was, if I recall, 28 April the transaction closed.     2015.     So it is five, six months prior.     Yes.     So when we – obviously, from the regulatory framework for a state owned entity is vastly different from what it is for a private company and we understood and we were informed that for the first year while we are part of the Denel stable we will not be subject to the PFMA.  So we updated our processes, we started with integration and everything whilst we are doing our day-to-day work but there was no real knowledge for us during that period of exactly the PFMA and what is required from us because the integration was not completed and we did not know that – or we were told that the PMFA was not applicable to us.     I know that Mr Steyn requested Mr Kruger and Mr Ndaba to visit VR Laser to go and sort of do an inspection or to go and see what their capabilities is and what is happening there and I know that was, if I recall correctly, that was also met a couple of days later from Mr Ntshepe to Mr Steyn in a very unfavourable tone wherein he said that your people are jeopardising Denel’s business going to VR Laser.  So that is what I recall that happened, I do think …[intervenes]     It was Mr Ntshepe that said that to Mr Steyn.     Yes.     I also think that the reference to capabilities that Mr Steyn made in his email that you referred to is also referring to maybe there is additional work that we can sent to VR Laser that would not be the hull fabrication.  So go and see what it is that they can do, maybe we can send them other work and not our core business.     Yes but the wording in this single source agreement was a – we gave up.  We gave up.     Yes, I was.     So I referred earlier on that there was indeed an order that was placed on VR Laser that made sense to us and we received goods from them.  We never paid them.  When the – there was a combination of activities between – Denel ran into financial difficulties, we got a new board, allegations of state capture, allegations of state capture with VR Laser, it was you are not paying.  Let us first look at what happened here and let us see if the agreement is tainted and how we are going to deal with it further.  And now I do not want to testify anything further because then I will…     It is sub judice.     I cannot testify …[intervenes]     On this point.     That is correct.     If I recall correctly, the review application has not started.  What happened in this circumstances, DLS owed VR Laser a lot of money as well because DV – or Denel was in financial difficulties, there was a lot of work that was with VR Laser, that the moment that it is released, DLS would get money, to make a sale, and they could get money in for the business.  So the payment from DVS of half of R2.7 million was sort of to secure that VR Laser release some of DLS’ goods that was work-in-progress so that DLS can sell it so that they can generate more cash. So it was a group type of arrangement to get more liquidity into the business at that stage.     Thank you. 
CARENE GELDENHUYS:  So help me God. 
GELDENHUYS:  Absolutely that was our core capability.   The tone throughout the correspondence was, it needs to go to the board on the 7t h of December.  And this email is after the 7t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good evening DCJ.     Thank you Chairperson.     Yes, thank you Chair.  When we adjourned last time Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi, we were at the point where I had just asked you a question about the meeting of the 16 t h of March 2015.  The meeting which was testified about by firstly by Mr Nick Linnell, you added to it also as a result of my questioning, and you had testified in response to the question I asked as to who the persons were who attend the meeting, that you had been informed it was Mr Romeo Khumalo and Mr Zithembe Khosa.   Is that correct?     So we had gone through extensively also the affidavit of Ms Dudu Myeni in regard to the events that took place at the meeting of the 8 t h of March 2015, do you recall that?     And we gave you the opportunity to respond to her version of events and also to interrogate your own version, do you remember that?     So I would like to pick it up on the meeting of the 16 t h of March and what remains thereafter Chairperson is to put further versions of other witnesses to you Mr Tsotsi and I think that should then wrap up your evidence in regard to the suspensions, and that version ultimately includes what they have said before the Chairperson in regard to the grounds for your what they call disciplinary action or whatever steps they were subjecting you to as the Board. Do you follow that?     Thank you.  Now you did confirm as I recall, because I did watch the video of your testimony, that this meeting that you were in fact informed that the meeting did take place on the 16 t h of March 2015, you can confirm?     And as I recall your recollection was that you were informed by Jabu Maswanganye about this meeting?      Yes, can you tell the Chairperson what was said to be the purpose of this meeting?     Mr Tsotsi were you invited to that meeting?     Did you know that the meeting was going to take place?     Now I have also gone back to listen to the evidence of Mr Linnell and towards the end of his evidence he testified on the 5 t h of October and on the 6 t h of October, he couldn’t finish on the 1 s t because there was a lightning interruption.  On the 6 t h towards the end of his testimony he says that he was also informed that the Minister did attend the meeting of the 16 t h of March, were you aware of that?     Yes, I had learnt that the Minister had attended the meeting yes.     Now Mr Linnell he has since, he is in touch with the Commission, with us in the work stream, and he will be providing the Commission with a supplementary affidavit on this issue, because as he explains to us, and maybe you can confirm this because he says he sent an email to your legal team back on the 30 t h of March 2015, seeking to propose certain questions that your legal team should ask the persons he said should be called as witnesses to your disciplinary action, do you recall that?      Okay, now we will show when Mr Linnell has provided us with that, because he mentions names of certain board members who he said should be asked questions why attended the meeting of the 16 t h of March. Now let me paint the picture for you sir that we move a little faster.  Mr Linnell, this is on the 16 t h of March, on the 17 t h of March he receives an email from a gentleman called Thulosilele, and he receives this email he said at ten to five, early in the morning, 4.50 am.  Chairperson Mr Linnell’s affidavit is found on page 158 of Eskom Bundle ...[intervenes]      07A, thank you Chair.     Page 158.      Yes.     And I – this is the evidence already testified about Mr Tsotsi from paragraph 42, and 158 it is the black pagination ...[intervenes]      158.     Yes.     In the left hand corner.     You have the, you have that?   Now I am not going to read from it but I will tell you, because the evidence has been testified about, so Mr  Linnell testified on the very day of the 16 t h of March 2015 he had a meeting he thinks he recall with Ms Mabude at your house to plan the way forward in regards to the terms of reference.  Ms Mabude was the Chairperson of Audit & Risk Committee, you recall that?       Now he testifies that there was an agreement with Ms Mabude for them to meet further the next day but on the 17 t h of March 2015, the early hours of the morning, he receives an email to the effect that he is no longer needed at the Audit & Risk meeting to which he had been invited and he thinks this was the turning point, and he reads that together with the attitude of Ms Mabude the night before or the day before which he refers to as a cooling of enthusiasm in regard to what he had been assigned to do, Mr Linnell.     So he then says this – he read this email, and linked it to the meeting which was said to have taken place on the 16 t h of March, a secret meeting, a private meeting where some Board members were present together with some suspended executives.   Did you hear that?     Now obviously this has to be tested before the Chairperson by those who are coming, we have to put this version to them because we have only so far heard the one side of the story from Mr Linnell and from yourself, because if indeed some Board members met with suspended executives on the 16 t h of March, if indeed that is the case, and you might not know, Mr Baloyi was removed from the Board for having made communication with a suspended executive.  Did you know that?     So these board members if the facts are established to be true, they were – they “charged”, and I use the word in inverted commas “charged” Mr Baloyi and found him guilty of an act they themselves had committed way back on the 16 t h of March, fresh after the suspension of the executives, five days after the suspension of the executives.   You follow that?     But we will test that with them when they are here, because you have alleged two names, Mr Sithemba Khoza, and Mr Romeo Khumalo.     Now what then develops Mr Tsotsi is that on the 18 t h however, and you see that further in the affidavit of Mr Linnell, he says he ignored the – he interpreted the email to the effect that he is no longer needed.     But nonetheless he disregarded that and he proceeded to prepared the terms of reference, which in paragraph 46 of his affidavit he forwards them to you and to Ms Mabude.      Because – and you know why they are forwarded them to Ms Mabude because the Board had delegated the power to Audit & Risk to oversee the inquiry, so Ms Mabude was the Chairperson of the inquiry, is that correct?     And on the next page, page 158, he says also – well he touches on what’s the terms of his reference, the essential terms of his reference were he recommended that a retired judge be appointed, he recommended that a law firm be appointed together with, I think that was ENS, together with an auditing firm, Grant Thornton, and that you see in paragraph 50 of the affidavit.  And remember paragraph 45, sorry 49, that is – those terms of reference are also emailed to Ms Dudu Myeni and then there is a meeting again at your house in the evening of the 18 t h of March.  Do you recall that?     Because you indicated in paragraph 52 he says the Chairman contacted me and informed me that he had spoken to Ms Mabude and she had undertaken to come to his house as soon as she was able to discuss the documents sent.  He asked that I also attend.  And by mid-morning there was no further response from Ms Mabude and I called the Chairperson and I suggested I visit him as the media were asking for comment.   And I want to skip some of these paragraphs – if you go to paragraph 64 on page 160, because that’s where he says I was later informed – this is still on the 18 t h, later informed by Mr Tsotsi that members of the board had met with the Minister on Friday, so I skipped a paragraph which I want, because you meet with the two of them and there is a discussion that ensues and there is a debate about the acceptability or otherwise of the terms of reference and I remember he says you interjected and said cut it out because the two of them were becoming angry with each other.  Can you recall that?     But the nonetheless he says he gets invited to another meeting of Audit & Risk that was to take place on the 19 t h of March.  Now Chairperson that email there is an email in fact that shows that Ms Mabude did have a meeting with Mr Tsotsi and Mr Linnell at your house and she advises members of the Board that I have agreed with Mr Nick that he must come to our meeting and meet with us as Audit & Risk, that email Chairperson is found in Eskom bundle 10, Exhibit U20.  Exhibit U20 is Mr Baloyi’s bundle, and he provided the Commission with a couple of emails, the one I am referring to now is on page 330.     330.   Page 330 it is the second – it is technically the first email from the top Chairperson but the second in this case, which is from Chwaita Mabude, it is an     22    18 March yes.  It is an email sent to all the Board members, the company secretary, you were also     Just say that again, you recall?     At your house, thank you.  Do you recall that the agreement was to this effect?     Well according to Mr Linnell even though the meeting was scheduled to take place the meeting was subsequently cancelled.   Do you recall that?     Yes, and it is interesting that now that I have read the subject line, dealing with a media statement I would like to go back to that affidavit of Mr Nick Linnell in your bundle, the paragraphs that I have – that I had skipped.       So that is back to page 158.     Mr Tsotsi’s bundle Chairperson.     Yes.     Page 159, sorry.     That is fine Chair.     Yes.    Thank you Chair, I am with you.   Let me approach it this way Mr Tsotsi.  Thank you Chair, because that helps me expedite it.   Let me approach it this way Mr Tsotsi, the involvement of Mr Linnell is apparent from the facts, the involvement of Mr Linnell by the Board, in matters pertaining to the intended inquiry, you can see that from the documentation, correct?     Yes, and I want to then accelerate to the charges that get brought against you by the Board, because that is decided in the meeting of the 19 t h.     And one of those charges is that you had commissioned the drafting of a media statement which went without the Board approval, let me see that you find in the reference bundle, Chair I will quickly read it.     Ja.    Ja Chair thank you.  Then that is exactly the reason why I left charge 1 and 2 and I went to 3.    Because 3 that is where they seem to be.    You know like a dog holding onto a bone and I did not want to let go.    Mr Tsotsi.    Ja.  The first part of charge 3 I agree with the Chairperson in neither here nor there because we can see from the documentation the evidence led that they engaged with Mr Linnell in the drafting of the statement.  But they say the statement was leaked and they want to – you will know that you leaked the statement.  And they are hanging onto that.  You want to respond to that quickly?    It is also the problem.    Yes Chair.    No that is fine.    No, no we will not belabour the point but that was just to give you a chance Mr Tsotsi to put your – your response to that on record.    Ja.    There was not…    Ja.  Thank you Chair.  Chair let me then – let us test this one.  They also Mr Tsotsi mentioned something about you having proposed to the board – to the board members that one Mr Malesela Sekhasimbe who was at that time on suspension the fact which they say you did not disclose to the board.  You proposed that he be appointed to one of the acting positions of those who were suspended.    Mr Tsotsi will…    May I say that as you answer Mr Tsotsi.  I am aware that that is not one of the charges but I am aware that they have said they were unhappy about that as well.  You understand what I am saying?    Yes.    Sorry Mr Tsotsi you may deal with that later when I put to you Mr Koko’s version.  But just address this one of whether or not you had suggested to the board at the time of the suspension of the executives that one of the acting persons should be Mr Sekhasimbe and you did not disclose to the board that he was in fact on suspension.    Is that…    Yes.    I have the minutes right here Chair.    So that is telepathic communication Chair.  That is – in the Reference Bundle Chairperson Mr Tsotsi the – the minutes of the 30 March 2015.    The Reference Bundle.  Eskom Bundle is it 12?  Yes Eskom Bundle 12.    The page number is 230.    230.    Yes.      Correct Chair.    Oh ja.    Let me read it?  Let me read it.     “Mr Tsotsi you are called to this meeting on the 30 March that is because you could not be removed on the 19 March.  On the 30 March you have the charges given to you and now you are making your presentation to the board on each of the charges.”   And although Sekhasimbe issue is not one of the charges.    You did address it in that meeting.  At the    These are minutes of the board meeting Chairperson page 226.    On 30 March 2015.    Yes.    That is right.    Chair if you turn to page 232 these are the minutes that get to be signed more than a year later by Dr Ngubane on the 18 November 2016.    Not at all Chair.    Because in fact on page 231 the second    Thank you.    Yes.  Mr Tsotsi then related to this issue of Mr Sekhasimbe is the Sumitomo issue which is alleged quite extensively by Mr Koko; Mr Koko has provided the    Yes Chair.  Chair I may just point out yesterday we received a supplementary affidavit from Mr Matona where he rebuts those allegations     We have forwarded it…    To Mr Tsotsi and Mr Koko.    That affidavit will find itself into the bundle of Mr Matona.    In due course.    Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Koko – Mr Tsotsi I beg your pardon.  Linked with that because you know it is important we have not touched on the sequence of events and you need to tell the Chairperson the sequence of events insofar as you recall.   When I talk about the sequence I mean the chronology, the dates of the events.  Because then you get to the time when you meet with the Minister.  Where the Minister says to you Mr Chairperson I understand from the management and from the directorate that you are interfering with the executives.  Now that is in 2015.    The State of the Nation Address.    That is in February 2015.  Because Mr Tsotsi alleges that the issue of Sumitomo arose during or about June 2014.    Mr Koko.    Yes I beg your pardon.  Mr Koko.    Now the Minister in her affidavit explicitly says an executive came to her – one executive and complained about you interfering with management.  Chairperson the same bundle of Mr Tsotsi page 450.      Not the one of Mr Tsotsi.    Page 450.    Yes Eskom Bundle 7[a].    Page 450 paragraph 1 – it starts at 100 but I want to pick it up at 101.  Because at 100 the Minister refers to the question which we asked her and we put the version of Mr Tsotsi to her about the meeting in February 15 which she reproduces there.  Am I – you found it?    Mr Tsotsi okay.    Then paragraph 101 the Minister says  “The only related conversation I remember having with Mr Zola Tsotsi related to his interference with management for operational issues as opposed to directorate issues.  In his oral testimony before the commission he confirms this referring to me he says whereupon the Minister had.  Well in this instance he was not happy about the fact that I was said to be interfering with management.  There have been complaints about Mr Zola Tsotsi both from the executives and the directorate.”    Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi I intended exactly to ask you the question.    No, no that is fine because although the Minister says what she is saying the question is did she mention that to you?  Did she say it to you this is the reason why I am speaking with you.  One executive has said to me you have written a letter committing Eskom to payment in respect of this Japanese company.    Well your version is up there.  The Minister has reproduced your version in her affidavit.  Do you see that?  And this is where the Minister says to you “Chairman I have received complaints from management and board members that you are interfering in management.  Please refrain from doing so because if you do not I shall have to find someone else to do your job.”    But she later in her affidavit says   Then Mr Tsotsi there is another version of the Minister which I want to place to you.  Turn the page to 451.  This is now in regard to your removal Mr Tsotsi.    Vindicated.    Sekhasimbe.    Now Mr Tsotsi you will assist us obtain that information.    Ja.  Thank you.  Was he reinstated?     Thank you.  Then in regard to your removal.  I have said page 451.  The minister deals with the removal of yourself as chairman of the board and she says in     And that is what we want to test Chairman.  That is exactly ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Okay.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Should I ask him one question, Chair?     And that is that she did not interfere.     Mr Tsotsi, are you able to respond to that allegation by the minister that she did not interfere in the issue between you – what she says is an issue between you and the board?     The minutes Chairperson of the 19t h when Mr Tsotsi is ...[intervenes]      Oh, no we do not have those minutes Chair.     Yes, Chair.  There is the minutes.  I see my investigator is signalling to me.  Yes, they did ask for the minutes.  They were not given if those minutes exist.     No, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Ja.     Mr Tsotsi, so you are saying there was a meeting on the 20 t h of March?     So you were not invited to that meeting?     Who told you that you are excluded?     Yes.  No, we ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Of 20 March.     Yes.     That is right Chair.     Yes.     So he is there on the meeting – at the meeting on the 19 t h Chairperson.     That meeting that takes place overnight.     They stopped at around – to one the next morning.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Is there anything further that you want  to tell the Chairperson about the meeting of the 19 t h?     Chairperson, what we have in regard to the meeting of the 19t h.     We have on single documents which is the minutes of the meeting.  It records when Mr Khumalo comes in.  It records when the board takes a break and it resumes.  And at resumption, Mr Tsotsi is asked to be excused.  And you have a minute of what takes place in his absence to the end of that discussion when he is called back.     And the meeting gets adjourned.     So you have it in the same document.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, no ...[intervenes]      I am looking ...[intervenes]      Ja, that is if they recorded them Chair.  They do say, as Mr Tsotsi points out, just before closure the minute-taker had indicated in-committee minutes are kept separately.     I know that we do have some of the minutes of in-committee board meetings.     But the investigators do not have... they do not have the one which Mr Tsotsi is referring to where he was excused in that meeting.      So we will make a note of that.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Ja, we will finish ...[intervenes]      Yes.  I have got...  Chair, we are finished.  The Chair is correct that that Mr Venete Klein’s evidence.       That is Ms Venete Klein’s evidence.     Yes.     Mister...  I have got three points Chair.  Arising from the affidavit recently received and the Chairperson has not seen that affidavit of Mr Zethembe Khoza.  Mr Tsotsi, which you... a copy of which you were favoured with.  Has it been included in the Reference Bundle?       Chair, it has been included in the Reference Bundle.  But there is a paragraph there by Mr Zethembe Khoza.  Although he ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Ja, it is the ...[intervenes]      It is the smaller bundle.     Yes.  Page?     Page 447.     447.     From the Eskom Bundle 13.  It is a continuation of the Reference Bundle.     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Tsotsi, there is an allegation there regarding you ...[intervenes]      447.     On page...  That is the beginning page of the affidavit.  The specific paragraph I want to read from is, is 454.       Eskom Bundle 13.       Eskom Bundle 13.     You can have mine.     Just go straight to page 454.     Paragraph 34, Mr Zethembe Khoza     Yes, there is an allegation he makes about you regarding the pre-suspension letters.     46.  Thank you.  Page 457 Chairperson.     To 457.     457.     Paragraph 46.     Yes.  Mr Zethembe says    Mr Zethembe said you, although he cannot recall when and cannot find a record of same, he nonetheless says, he got pre-suspension letters from you.  And might I add?   That this pre-suspension letters are also talked about by Ms Venete Klein in her affidavit, although she does not mention you, nor does she mention Mr Zethembe Khoza in her affidavit.   But when she testified here, she said that she recalls she received these letters from Mr Zethembe Khoza.  Now Mr Khoza said he received them from you even though he has no record or recollection of exactly when.   Now Chairperson, these are the letters that in the affidavit of Ms Venete Klein, she says that were authored by Ms Suzanne Daniels together with Mr Salim Essa.       Says the same thing.     That is right Chair.     Yes.     That is right.     Yes, Chair.     Mr Tsotsi, your comment on this?     No, that is exactly my understanding Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Should we move on Chair?     I am happy to move on.     Ja.  And then.  Mr Tsotsi, a minor thing.  Well, I am going to leave that one.  There is a meeting after you have resigned.  You have resigned.  There is a meeting between you and Ms Molefe as she talks about in her affidavit where you – she says apologise to her that she should not have been suspended.     You confirm that meeting?     Chair, that actually marks the end of my questions.  I have something on the composition of the sub-committees but he has now dealt with it in one way.  We will...  I think we will test it with the minister.     Can I ask?     Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, Nokholo(?) has provided us with an affidavit to which some of the emails exchanged between you and the minister are attached and this specifically relates to the composition of the board.   Then the emails are dated...  your email to the minister is 26 January 2015.  The minister respond to that by email dated 28 January 2015.  26t h, 23rd(?) [clearing of throat by witness]   You first sent an email with the composition.  Chair, for your benefit, I think you need to have a look at it.  That is Eskom Bundle 10 and Exhibit U22.     And this is the last... I am exploring with Mr Tsotsi.  Eskom Bundle 2, Exhibit 22.     10.     Exhibit 22.     Page 471.  And your email starts on page – thank you Mr Tsotsi.   Your email is below the minister ’s email.  So your email from Zola Tsotsi, date is 26 January 2015 at 13.52.  You address the email to     472.     So you forward to the minister your     Do you see that?  And the list carries on, under Tender and Procurement you have Ben Ngubane as the Chairperson.  At the next page, it is Chwayita Mabude, Zethembe Khoza, Nazia Carrim.  And then the IFC, Mapamenzi, Pat Naidoo, Zethembe Khoza, Venita Klein and so on.  There are some mistakes here in the names.  The spelling of the names.       For instance, Nazia Carrim, she is not Nadia, she is Nazia.     Mr Kumalo is spelt without an h.     Mr Khoza is not Zathembe, it is Zethembe Khoza.     Then the minister …[intervenes]     Yes.     Chairperson, incidentally, we do have Mr Tsotsi’s email of December 2014 to the minister.     Which is not part of the record and I am going to beg the Chairperson’s leave to hand it up.     For the purposes of the Chairperson’s comparison and Mr Tsotsi’s benefit.       We will mark it accordingly for inclusion into the record and Mr Tsotsi could briefly then explain to the Chairperson how the two documents compare, one for the Chairperson, one for the witness.  So the email handed up, Chairperson, is an email from Zola Tsotsi sent on Tuesday 16 December 2014 at 14.02, also     Not a candidate attorney.     We may have to deal with media reaction to this change.  Are you contemplating limiting the board to 13?  The previous board had 14 members.  For those serving on three committees, depending on their day jobs, the workload may be quite taxing.  So would this have been the first email you sent, Mr Tsotsi?  And I notice the – sorry, can I give you a change to answer then, Mr Tsotsi?  Would this have been the first email you sent to the minister?     Yes.  And I also notice the errors in the surnames of some of your board members there.  Zethembe Khoza is spelt with an x.     Could this be in Salim Essa’s list, Mr Tsotsi?     Ja, in IFC?     Mr Tsotsi?     Ja, do you not leave the Chairperson with the impression that it is your secretary who typed this?     Thank you, Chair.  Okay, alright, and you were saying that certainly not you, Mr Zola Tsotsi, chairman of the board on the IFC.     Yes.     Yes.  But it also still begs the question well, is this your list?     It is alright.     It is alright.  Then, Chair, lastly on this, if you go back to the file, is the minister ’s reply to Mr Tsotsi.     Yes.     That email – let me see, I think it is duplicated.  We can read it on the next page, which is page 474.       The bundle where your email – Eskom bundle 10, EXHIBIT 22.     The same one, yes.     Page 474.     Ja, the next page.  So the minister responds to you 28 January 2015 at 8.21 and she copies a couple of people there, Matsietsi Makholo, Brandon     She deals with this, Chair, to some extent …[intervenes]     I am, I am, Chair.  I have in fact.  Let me …[intervenes]     Yes.     Sorry, sorry, quickly – that is back to your bundle, Mr Tsotsi, and that is on page 444, page 444 from paragraph 43 onwards.     She confirms that she is responsible only for the appointment of members of two board subcommittees.     Audit and risk and social and ethics committee.     And then she goes into the process at DPE that she would be guided in appointing members of the board.     But then she does not stop at audit and risk and social and ethics.  In paragraph 47 she goes on about she would have followed the same process for the other subcommittees.     In respect of the two that she said she     Yes.     Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, just right at the end now, there is an email in December 2014 you sent to the minister with the composition.  Then there is an email on the 26 January 2015 that you sent to the minister, with the composition. Now what informed the email, the composition, the composition, in the email of 26 January 15.  Now my question is, let me put it, is that the composition that the minister wanted in January when you sent it to him(?).       So that means the minister went beyond the limit of the two subcommittees that she is responsible for.     Ja.     No, that is one thing.  That is one thing, yes.     But I am talking factually from the composition in your subsequent email, that that is what the minister wanted you …[intervenes]     How to compose.     So it went beyond just the two subcommittees.     You see, the reason why I was remarking on the – understanding the states is because the Fundudzi report shows that a composition had been received by the DPE from businessman’s email info portal and the misspellings were like in your first email.  Mr Zethembe Khoza is spelt with an x.     And I thought that was remarkable.  Coincidence?         That is the end, Chair.     That is the end, Chair.       Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Certainly.       You want to say…? 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you Chair.     Zola Andile Tsotsi.     No.     Yes.     So help me God.     That is correct.     Yes I do.     Yes.     Yes I do.     Yes.      Correct ja.     Chair I really did not know, I wasn’t expressly told what the purpose of the meeting was, even what was discussed so I was not aware of neither the content of the meeting, nor the reason for the convening of the meeting, to that extent yes.     No, I was not invited.     No, I didn’t know.     Yes I was aware of that yes.     Okay, okay, yes.     I don’t expressly  recall that particular email, I will have to check with the legal team Chair but I don’t recall it myself.     What page?     Oh, okay.     Okay, got it.     Yes.     Correct.     I see that yes.     Yes.     Yes I recall Mr Baloyi’s testimony to that effect yes.       Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Right.     Correct.     Yes I do.     Yes I do.     Page?     Yes, 22    18 t h March?     Not explicitly no, I don’t recall the actual the email, but I recall the event of the meeting at my house.     I recall the meeting at my house.     Yes, absolutely.     I recall Nick complaining about that yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.    I am in the worst position memory wise Chair.    Ja.    Chair like I said.    Clearly that I deny my leaking the statement.  I am – it makes me wonder what will be the purpose of my leaking the statement in the first place.    Yes Chair.      Yes I do understand.    I just want to without belabouring this issue Chair just to put it in perspective.  The issue regarding Mr Sekhasimbe and Sumitomo dates back to 2008 for it is an old issue.  And I just want to confine myself with what they are concerned with meaning that I suggested someone who is suspended should act in a position of the Group Executive of Technology and Commercial.   Now the situation Chair is that after the said incident for which Mr Sekhasimbe was suspended I spoke and this happened at the end of February 2015 around end of February 2015 somewhere around there if not very early March 2015.   I then raised this issue with the Chief Executive Mr Matona and I said – I asked Mr Matona to look into this because I think at the time I said to him I felt that Ms Sekhasimbe was – was being hard done by because he really has nothing to do with the charges that is being laid against him and that he should see to it that Mr Sekhasimbe is taken out of suspension because he is not involved in …    Chair that is not correct, that is not true.  The fact of the matter is when I – when I raised the issue of – and queries the names of the people who are going to be suspended – I mean who are going to be taking the places of the people who are suspended I said to the board in regard to Mr Sekhasimbe he – he would have been the person appropriate to act in the position of Mr Matshela but he has been suspended and I even commented that I was very unhappy with the suspension because I did not believe that he merited to be suspended.   And the name that was brought forward was that of one of the engineers who worked with Mr Matshela who then subsequently became the person who acted.  So I did tell the board or the members of the PNG committee at the time that Mr Sekhasimbe was under suspension and therefore could not act.  I merely brought up his name because I felt he the person who was appropriate for that position.  It is then that the name of the other person came up who eventually ended up acting.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair that is a complete fabrication.  I think the corroborations of the other witnesses who have come before this commission for me are sufficient to dispel the idea that Mr Matshela is proposing to the extent that I recall very specifically that Mr Matona himself does not accord with what is being alleged he is supposed to have done or said.  So I am – I have to dismiss what Mr Matshela is alleging.    Yes that is in 2015 around the time of the- of the SONA.    Yes.    Mr Matona.    Okay Mr Koko yes.    Yes.  That is about correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  I must assume that when she says one of the executives came to her to complain about my interference in management she must be referring to this incident and hence consequently referring to Mr Matshela as the person who would have come to her.    You are correct Chairman.  If protocol in the organisation was very clear about how the communication should work.  The least I would have expected would be for the Chief Executive to have received such a complaint and put it to me and if he felt that he needed to pass it onto the shareholder because it involved the chairman then he had the opportunity to contact the Director General who then could process the issue at the level of the Minister.    That would have been…    The channel yes.    Yes.    Not only that Chair but to – just to elaborate some on this matter.  When she approached me about this particular issue and of course I knew what she was talking about she did not even ask for – from me what my side of the story is.    You know she did not say to what is happening, can you explain to me what actually transpired?  She decided that it was opportune for her just to reprimand me on the basis of what she had been informed by a member of the executives.    Without having – who did not follow – bother to follow any proper protocol.    Sorry Sir.    No she never – she never addressed the issue.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Chair I do not know if I am – I want to belabour this point but it is noteworthy that the individual who was the subject of all of this to her about my interfering with management went to the CCMA and was – what is the word now – what is the legal word?  Shall I say acquitted is that correct or was it?  The CCMA …    He was vindicated at the CCMA that he had been unfairly treated.    By this action.    Of suspension.    Yes.    Sekhasimbe.    Sekhasimbe.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    Yes.     I would gladly do Chair.    He – there was an instruction from the CCMA I gather that he was to be reinstated but the – the person in charge of the CCMA proceedings I gather indicated that it would be – he would be entering hostile environment – work environment.  He should – his entitlement should go back to work but the person felt that he would be entering a hostile work environment and may have to opt for negotiating his departure from the organisation.  But I think the ruling of the CCMA would make it clear as to what actually transpired.     Chairman, let me say what I know.     And want to make a judgment as well that constitutes interference or not.  The meeting of the 19t h of March where I was first or where I first encountered these charges, that meeting finished in the early hours of the morning around one o’clock or something.   And the same day, I knew and I was told that the board had requested – in fact, it is in the minutes – the board requested to have a meeting with the minister.   Now when they asked that I should recuse myself from that meeting, it was blatantly obvious to me that they want to talk about me and the issue that they have raised with me in the previous meeting.   Now I have consistently asked for minutes of that particular meeting because for me that would have been very significant because I needed to know how the board presented the issue to the minister because that will determine their own role in terms of how that meeting was conducted.   And I have persistently not been able to find those minutes.  I recall in Cape Town at the parliamentary hearing, I specifically pointed out the fact that those minutes are important for one to get a sense as to exactly what happened in that meeting of the 20 t h.   And I think it will be worthwhile to explore with members who were present in that meeting exactly what happened.  So her presence there and the discussion that went on, culminated in now my formal – me being formally charged.       Ja, I think it is up to whoever who wants to make a determination as to whether the minister effectively interfered or not.     The 20t h.     And the minister.     Yes.     They ought to be taken Chair.  There is no reason why they should not be taken.     ...the minutes were available.     Correct.   [Parties intervening each other and cannot be heard clearly.]     Chair, I do not recall there be a meeting with... Minister Gigaba, actually only attended, to the best of my recollection, a meeting when we have asked him or he has requested to address a particular issue.     But that did not happen very often.     Yes.     The 20t h of March, yes.     I was explicitly excluded from that meeting, yes.     If I recall, I think it was Dr Ngubane who asked that I should recuse myself because he was acting chairman at the time.     I was specifically told by Dr Ngubane that I should recuse myself from the meeting.     With the minister, yes.     Yes.     No, Chair I did not chair any meeting subsequent to that.     Yes.     Chair, something I thought I observed and I could not quite understand what to make of it, was that the meeting of the 19 t h when I was chairing the meeting at that point in time, was in process and we were discussing Eskom business.   And then, at some point, Mr Romeo Khumalo walked into the meeting.  And he whispered something to Dr Ngubane.  And it is at that point I was asked to recuse myself from the meeting.     Ja.       Yes.  So I got the impression, for what it is worth, that there was a message that must have come in from somewhere.     That it is time to deal with this person in this particular way.     That I thought was rather unusual but that was the last time I chaired a meeting of the board.     And incidentally, I also requested Chair the minutes of the discussion which took place ...[intervenes]      ...on the 30t h now when I was now defending myself in terms of the charges in the presence of my attorneys as well as the Eskom’s attorneys.     Because at the end of my presentation, I was asked and my team was asked to recuse ourselves.  And the board deliberated.  Up to now, I do not know what it was that they were deliberating on.  And I have not been able to find out.  And I have requested those minutes and I was never given those minutes.     Because I may add Chair just for ease of reference for Mr Seleka.  If you look at the end of the recordal of the minutes of the 30th, there is a statement there which says minutes of the – whatever they call it- minutes of in-committee or what – are kept separately.  I was very intrigued by that because ...[intervenes]      ...that minutes do exist...  Sorry, if you look at the minutes of the 30t h of March, the end of that minute, there is a statement at the bottom there.     Ja.     That is for the 19t h Chair.     That I accept.     Yes, exactly.     Can I just on that point Chair because I think this is very important because that deliberation will tell us what motivated ...[intervenes]      ...for them to discard my presentation.     And in fact, opt for ...[intervenes]      ...my having to be struck off as a director.     Yes, I do recall that Chair.     Yes.     I also heard that Mr Baloyi was a sending voice in those deliberations.     447.  I have got the wrong document.  What, what?  What document is that?     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Okay, I have got it.     [No audible reply]      46?     46.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  First of all, I think, I do not know where Mr Khoza got this from but without a doubt I never ...[intervenes]      ...sadly ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, Chair.  I felt very aggrieved about in particular about her suspension and I just felt the need to say to her that I did not believe she should have been suspended.   And I made this clear in the way I addressed the issue of the FD coming in as part of the list of the executives to be suspended.  I pretty much had a good sense of what is likely to happen.   Let alone the fact that I did not believe that there was anything to investigate in the Department of Finance.  When I say I had a sense of what was likely to happen actually did occur when I was confronted by a whole host of investors of Eskom who were asking these questions.   And they particularly wanted to know what has the FD done.  Because she, I mean, the Financial Director is the custodian of the investment of the investors of the business.  So I pretty much knew that there was going to be this problem.   And incidentally, Mark Pamensky also mentioned that during the one of the – I think it was the PMG Meeting if I recall correctly.   So I am just, you know, connecting these issues because I ultimately felt that I needed to say to Ms Molefe she should never really had been suspended.     Number?     Yes?     Page?     My email is on what page?     472, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Correct.     Ja.     Yes. ADV SELEKA     They must have been, Chair, typographical errors.     Yes, Chair, on the basis of this email it has to be, yes.       Well, let me [indistinct – dropping voice]     Chair, this email is a culmination of the back and forth that occurred on this issue between the minister and myself and I guess I should say between three of us, Salim Essa, minister and myself.  Now I would imagine that following the minister ’s insistence when we met at our house, where I said Tony Gupta was present and so was Salim Essa, this would have been ultimately what she had wanted to have.  So I am saying that this probably would not represent what I had wanted but the likelihood that it would represent what the minister had wanted and together with whoever was – Salim Essa, in this instance, would have wanted.   So I am saying – because I look at the date and I see that it is – we are communicating with the minister at the end of January and the back and forth with minister and Salim Essa started – would have started sometime in – conceivably in December, if not early January.      I cannot recall whether this is the first one but certainly it was December which accords with what I recall was when the interaction was taking place.     That is a gross error, Chair.     That is a gross error.     Ja, that …[intervenes]     Yes, I see that [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     His name has been repeated as Zathembe Xhosa.     Ja, that is definitely an error.     It has been a tradition at Eskom that the Chairman does participate in some of – in fact, the Chairman is limited – well, obviously, the Chairman would not serve in the statutory committee.  But the Chairman is generally limited to the people in governance committee and the social the – it is the ethics?  Cannot remember, there is another committee that the Chairman is …[intervenes]     But certainly not the IFC.     Yes.  I can accept that, yes.     This would have come from me, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes?     Yes, thank you, Chair.     Ja, well that is a bit odd.     It would not have been a good idea.     Well …[intervenes]     I can only say it is mine because …[intervenes]     I am the one who sent the email to the minister.      I cannot disassociate myself from it.     Yes.     Which bundle?     Oh, the same one we were looking at.     What page?     Oh, the next page.     Yes, exactly.  Chair, that is correct, when they [inaudible – loud coughing] committees what would happen is that the – whatever proposal the board may make on those committees is subject, expressly subject to the approval of the minister so …[intervenes]     Correct.     No, no, Chair, she does not have the power.     No, Chair, that is not correct.     What the board is doing is giving the shareholder the courtesy of knowing how is involved in which committees.     Correct.     That would be the case, Chair, because as I said, the back and forth occurred during the month of December primarily and what culminated in then the formal submission to the minister would then be the composition as the minister had wanted it to be.     That is the de facto situation, Chairman.      Yes.     Yes.     It would appear so by her own admission because she is saying that she needs the formal document for her consideration.  You will recall that is what you read earlier in the email.     Yes.     That is what the minister had wanted …[intervenes]      Ultimately, yes.     Yes, correct.     Yes.     I think just a coincidence, yes.  It is a very interesting coincidence, Chairman.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, absolutely.     26 January, Chair.     It seems to be, yes.  Yes, that is quite possible, Chairman.     Yes, exactly.     Chair, that is a very interesting question and not an easy question to actually answer.     Because you recall that the state if mind I was in was one of someone who is being accused of things that were certainly very flimsy.  I made the point in the meeting with the board in my own defence to say that these charges were definitely spurious and were of no substance whatsoever and this was confirmed by my legal team that in fact what they were putting forward is really of no substance.  And I realised that if I was to challenge this situation any further, it is going to impact on the company and take away from the focus of what Eskom should be doing and that is to recover from the situation that it is in and I really did not want to be party to defocusing Eskom and bringing the focus upon myself. So my resignation in a sense was – in a sense was forced because I felt that I did not want to be an albatross around the neck of the company and I consented to then resigning for that reason not because I felt that I did not have a winnable case nor that I capitulated to the - you know, to the accusations that they were making.  Quite the contrary.   As I say, it was really in the interest of making sure that the business does not have to have a fallout out of this situation occasioned by my resistance.  So that is really the – to answer the question, I felt it was a forced situation.     No, Chair, none of them were met altogether.  None of them were.  In fact I do not why you want to restrict me from commenting about what it is I should say what they are about but one important issue, has got to do with my legal fees.     So I felt done by, by the attitude of [indistinct – dropping voice]     Yes.     Chairman, I can only describe it as debilitating, to be quite honest.  I lost, you know, not only an income but I lost opportunities for further income.  It became very clear that people who were supposed associated or tainted with State Capture, if I may say so, were being shunned by you know prospective employers and there were all sorts of stories and rumours going around.  One in particular concerned me because it was said that Gupta family went out of its way to draw up a list of all those people who should not be engaged by – certainly by the public sector, and my name apparently is one of them. So I am just saying I would not want to relive that situation again.     I am available in a consulting capacity. 
ZOLA ANDILE TSOTSI:   [duly sworn, states] 
ADVI SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
INVESTIGATORS:   [No audible reply]      [No audible reply] 
TSOTSI: Not because [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
NGCEBETSHA: No, thank you, understood, Chairperson. 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   I have just two points only.     Yes, just…     Thank you.       Yes.     Mr Tsotsi, you spoke at length regarding the meeting of the 30 March in which you first went to your presentation, there was an adjournment and subsequently you were approached by Mr Romeo Kumalo together with Dr Ben Ngubane which culminated in you going back to the formal board meeting and tendered your resignation.   Now I just want first to confirm – tell the Chairperson in your own words whether the resignation tendered was voluntary or not.     Thank you.  Now on going through that, I suppose it is common cause now, that the resignation was received and accepted.  There were certain commitments made to you by the board to meet certain obligations.  Without naming them, were any of those obligations that were made to you met by the board or by the company?     Now my next question is, what effect would your removal – or rather, what effect did your removal from the board as Chairman of Eskom have on you seeing that you had already testified that this pretty much was the only job you could hold because of the enormity of the work that you had...?     Chairperson I think that concludes my questions, I just need maybe to place it on record that whilst we may receive from Tsotsi matters that confirm he is an implicated person by some of the witnesses, we have adopted an approach that says that we have been fairly satisfied with the manner in which the evidence leader poses the different version.     And instead of complicating and in the spirit of expedition of the work of this Commission we just want to formally record our reservation in the eventuality that it is absolutely needed then we will submit an application at that point.     Thank you, that is all.
