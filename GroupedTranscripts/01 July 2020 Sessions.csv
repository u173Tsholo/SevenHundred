CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody.  Are we ready?    Oh okay.    Okay no, no that is fine.  I thought that maybe the commission did not give him the correct address because I heard that he seems to have gone to the old venue.    Yes.  Yes.  Okay, no that is fine.  We are happy that he is here.  Thank you Mr Botes.  Yes Mr Soni.    Yes.    No you can do it but maybe let us start with him being sworn in so then you can put his evidence in context.    And then we – you – we begin ja.  Thank you.    Thank you very much Mr Botes.  Once again thank you for coming to give evidence.  The file that I have got here has it got his affidavit?    Well I have got Bundle H.  I have now been given Bundle G.  Is Bundle G the correct one?  I have now been given Bundle G I had Bundle H.    Okay.  Ja okay.    From page?    Hm.    Well I am not sure what that means.  Are you – do you mean that the files have not been paginated in the way they – they are supposed to be paginated sequentially from page 1 up to the last page?    Ja, no remember we talked it was it on Monday.    Yes.  Because we just need to consistent.    It helps when I pick up a file to know what I am expecting.    If I am looking for page 50 or 250 I must not find that there are two 250’s.    If I am looking for page 20 I must not find that there are three page 20’s you know in the bundle.    And it is a simple thing it has been done all along.  It is – will you just prevail on those who do this because in the end…    It is the evidence leader that takes responsibility for this. So when they do it just check that they have done it properly.    We do not have a choice now because Mr Botes is here we have to continue.    But it is not satisfactory.    We now need to be able to say on all the bundles the pagination is from page 1 up to whatever.    Even if there are different statements inside.  If they are in the same bundle the pagination covers everything sequentially.    Yes, yes.  Okay so how do I get to Mr Botes affidavit on this bundle?    Okay alright.    Ja okay alright.  They must just fix the one we discussed – was it Monday.    If they have not fixed it and then they must sort this one out afterwards.    Okay.    No that is fine.  I think that it is important also to mention other features that you might not have mentioned that make the commission to be interested in the interactions between the then Chairperson of the PRASA Board and Mr Botes.  Namely that PRASA is one of those SOE’s in respect of which for many years they have been in the public domain all kinds of allegations of serious corruption and maladministration.  And except for what we heard from Mr Popo Molefe who was Chairperson of the Board of PRASA at a certain stage except for the attempts that his Board tried to do it appears that not much has been done by anybody to deal with those allegations of corruption at PRASA.   And the former Chairperson of the Board now Judge Makhubele her assumption of duty and her appointment to – as Chairperson of the Board also happened under circumstances that are quite unusual. She appears to have been appointed sometime in October I do not know if it was the 19 October.    2017.  Prior to that she had been nominated for appointment as a Judge of the High Court and I think early in October I do not know if it was the 2 October, she had been interviewed by the JSC for the position of – of a Judge.  Now – so there are questions about why she allowed herself to be appointed when she would have known either that she was about to be appointed to – as a Judge or that there was a very good chance she would be appointed as Judge.   I mean I am one of those people who know a lot about what happens in the JSC because I have been interviewed probably about six times over the past 23 years.  Very u – I mean very often when you have been interviewed by the JSC you get told either by the same day or within the next day or two whether the JSC will advise the President to appoint you.  And the role of the JSC and the President also is such that the President – the general view is that the President is bound to go along with the advice of the JSC.  But even if it was said what the JSC does as strong recommendation over the past 20 or whatever years I think it would be difficult to find any case where the JSC advised the President to appoint a person as a Judge and the President did not appoint.   So there are questions about why would she have accepted appointment as Chairperson of the Board when she would have known that in all probability beginning of the year 2018, she would be expected to assume duty.   So there are those questions and then of course part of the evidence of Ms Ngoye if I recall correctly was that after she had arrived as Chairperson of – she had arrived at PRASA as Chairperson of the Board her interest for purposes of settlement was on Siyaya matters even though according to Ms Ngoye there were a lot of other matters with even larger amounts involved.    She only showed interest in that one.  So it is against that background that the commissions wants to see what role she may have played and then the exchanges that she might have had with Mr Botes.  You know that is the context.    So I thought I must just mention because also I think it important the public should just have as good background as possible.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  No, no she definitely has recently indicated that she will co-operate and she makes herself available to be interviewed by the commission’s legal team.    And the legal team has been in touch with her.    And certainly, her side of the story will be heard.  I do not know whether Mr Soni you want to say anything about a request for investigations – forensic investigations?    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.  Hm.  She is aware of course and she note that Mr Botes is going to give evidence this morning?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.  I am sure that she will feel free to pursue if she believes she needs that forensic investigation to do so.    My understanding of what she really wants to be revealed by the forensic investigation because I have seen the correspondence.  I have read an affidavit she has deposed to.  My prima facie view is that the issue that she wants to be revealed is an issue that does not appear to me to be relevant to the issues that the commission is looking at.    But that is not her final decision.  She should feel free to persuade me that it is relevant and then if I am persuaded then we can look at that.    And she did mention about – I think she did mention something about wishing to cross-examine Mr Botes but you know you – everyone applied for Leave to Cross-examine.    And there are certain requirements that need to be met.  One of which obviously will be whether the cross-examination will be on issues that are relevant to what the commission is looking at or not.    So she can bring that application or move that application in due course if leave is granted, I have no doubt Mr Botes would make himself available after that.    Okay I think we – I think we have put everything on record properly but if there is something, I have left out you can indicate.    Yes.  Yes.  Okay thank you.    Okay thank you.  Mr Soni I thought you should start by getting Mr Botes to tell us who he is?    He is an advocate and which bar, for how long he has been in practice those preliminaries just get them out of the way before we go into the affidavit.    Thank you I think that is the background that I wanted us to deal with first ja.    But I want to interrupt you Mr Botes.  I am very sorry.    Maybe it is not so serious.  I wanted to tell earlier.  In uh, either... in her affidavit, she also says here you... you are... you are a very good person.  I think you said you are charming. [laughs]    [laughs]  She... she... she may days apart where she says uh, you know, you... you... you are very... a very good person.  You know each other quite well and uh, you know, you are friendly and so on.   So I just thought because you have been uh, you know, saying very good things about her.  I must just tell you that she also has...[intervenes]     ...good thing to say about you.    Yes, I interrupted you I am sorry.   Thank you very much Mr Botes.  Uh...[intervenes]     ...I think Mr Soni, he did not have to... [laughs]    To... to less... of course... of course he knows exactly what uh [laughs] what the issues are.    And he... he has been very involved.  I... I am... obviously, if there are something that you want to...[intervenes]     ...cover or clarify.    But that was quite comprehensive.  Thank you Mr Botes.    Yes.  No, no, no.    No, it was fine.  It is... it was quite comprehensive.  I doubt if I have any questions but let me allow you to ask if there is anything to ask.    What... well, the appointment was to in actual fact the following year.    So... so technically when she started communications uh, she was not a judge yet.    She... she had been recommended for appointment.  She became a judge when the appointment ...[intervenes]     ...took effect.   That is my understanding of how...[intervenes]     ...uh, how these things go.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.      [laughs]    Yes.    Yes.  No, no, no.  Uh, they... uh, they... it is fine.  They have put that.    We have our own understandings.    Uh, when uh... when I was appointed as an acting judge in 1997, I think I got the letter of appointment uh, early in January and my acting appointment was to start on the 1s t of February 1997.  Between the time when I got the letter and the time and the 1s t of February, I did not go around saying I am judge, an acting judge.    [laughs]      And my colleagues in the profession did not start calling me a judge.    [laughs]  But um, I am just saying how...    I understand it.  Yes.      That is correct Chairperson.    Mr Soni?    When Mr Botes was giving evidence, I did not have to look at documents.  Uh, I focused on listening to him.  Uh, now I have to look at them because you are referring to this.    Uh, just tell me again where you are how this works?    Page?    Uh...    Page 45.  Uh... oh, is that the one that has got a “see”?    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Okay.    So, of course, you... you would uh, uh, [laughs] you would know that uh, it... it... it would be quite surprising to the attorney on the other side if he was unaware ...[intervenes]     ...of the communication.  So how... how... how do my opponents know what my instructions are?  But uh... but... but what you are saying and with reference to this uh, email or was it your email...[intervenes]     WhatsApp.... WhatsApp message.   Is you... you are putting it up to substantiate what you were saying, namely, your communications with the chairperson of the board were transparent.  Were meant to be open and transparent and that is why you felt quite free to say to mister...[intervenes]     ...Mogashoa that this... those are not your instructions because I know your... what your instructions and uh, the chairperson of the board did not in turn that like keep it secret.    H’m.     I am sorry, Mr Soni, I see we are at half past – actually nearly twenty five to twelve.     We are long past quarter past eleven but what is important is how much more time do you need with Mr Botes?     Yes.     Yes.     To put her side of that, ja.     Yes, yes.   No, no, that is fine. My own understanding is there seems to be very – the issue - , disputes which is very narrow, very limited.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no, that is fine, but I think let us take the tea break now.  Let us make it 15.  I was thinking of making it ten but we might rush too much.  15 minutes, so we will resume at ten to twelve.     And then with the aim that we should finish about 12 o’clock, or five past twelve or thereabouts.     Okay, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us proceed.  Put on your mic, Mr Soni.     I do not know why you always forget.     46, okay.     Yes, I see it, thank you.     I must just check something, Mr Soni, you might have read her affidavit much more thoroughly than I did.  At some stage when I was reading it, I was not sure whether she comes out categorically that Mr Botes initiated the discussion.  I seem to get the impression that she was not committing herself but she was saying I want a forensic investigation to be done on my cell phone as well to determine who initiated without her saying he initiated or I initiated.  I know that what I am certainly true in regard to maybe other things but I am not sure.  So I am just checking whether it is something that you had a look at carefully that she does say he initiated.      But if you are sure that is fine.     Ja.     Yes, she is quite clear.     Oh, okay.     Okay, okay, no, that is fine.  I mean, when I was looking at it, I was saying – at least, on the impression that I had, I was saying well, she needs to put up her version first.     So that we know if there is a dispute.     There is an issue, before we can have an inference in this stage because there is no point, she having a forensic investigation if there is no issue.     Or no dispute on the issue.  But I think put it to Mr Botes because …[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja.  I wonder whether any forensic investigation is needed to establish that, but …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     Ja.     I mean, if she accepts that the first discussion that she had with Mr Botes on the matter was on the phone, then – and if she accepts that Mr Botes could not have spoken from a landline then he could only have spoken to her on his cell phone so therefore Mr Botes says here is my cell phone, whoever wants to check whether there was any call I made to her between that time and that time, here is the phone.     And then she can provide her own to say, you know, let us have a look.     I am not sure that you need a forensic investigation.  But again, as far as this Commission is concerned, on the face of it there does not appear to be an important issue to the Commission but she might persuade me when she gets a chance that there is something relevant in regard to who initiated.  Okay, alright, yes.     Well, I also wanted to ask on that but I think you have made it quite clear because she denies that and the actual use of the term deployed, is that the term she used or is it your term of – that you used in terms of what you understood her to be saying?  Do you recall whether she used that term or she may have used another terminology but you understood it to be deployment? ADV BOTES     Okay.     No, no, that is fine.  My understanding of her affidavit – but again, one might need to double-check and you can ask questions to Mr Botes on your own understanding of Judge Makhubele’s affidavit. My impression was that she was denying that she told Mr Botes that she had been deployed by President Zuma.  And that is one. And two, she certainly did say she had never met former President Zuma before her appointment to the PRASA, I think, but she does say subsequently and in 2019 she was within the presence of President Zuma at a function at the University of Limpopo in a graduation ceremony or something.     But I think she says she had never spoken to him or something like that.     So but put it as you understand it.  I was not sure whether she was denying using the word deployed as opposed to appointed but she does she was appointed by the minister.     Yes.  So put it the best way you can to put her version.     Well, I am sure the answer has been given.     Ja, ja.     Okay.     Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, Mr Botes, for coming to give evidence, we appreciate it and you are excused.     Thank you.     I want us to adjourn for a few minutes and I would like to see you Mr Soni and Mr Nkatha.     Okay.  We adjourn INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes Mr Soni?  Your mic.     Okay, we will adjourn early for lunch and I will give you a little bit more time.  There are two ways of doing this, one is to paginate this bundle afresh, even manually, so that in the bundle I know that the pagination starts from page one and goes up to the last page and the sequential.  At the moment the problem is that different sections of documents in the bundle are paginated on their own.     So if you say to me page 20 I have got to ask page 20 of which section, whereas if you do it the way it is normally done, if you say page 20 on this bundle, I know there is only page 20.     So I can find it easily.     There are two ways of doing it, the ones that I have just said or you could take out of this bundle Mr Botes’ documents and make them – put them into a separate bundle and then you keep the numbering that is on his – I am assuming that, ja you keep that numbering and then later on you go on record, to place on record that it has been taken out of this bundle is now on its own and we give a separate exhibit number and confirm that the numbering that was used, the page numbers that were used to refer to various documents during his evidence remains the same.     Okay.  And then you then come to this bundle which would then be minus Mr Botes document and then paginated from page 1 up to the last document.     And prepare an index as one would do, which would be at the beginning and then it retains the same bundle number and the same exhibit number, but the pagination is sequential.     Okay, it is now nearly twenty five to one, so I think we will resume – we will adjourn and resume at two, it gives you I think enough time to attend to this and to have lunch and then to the extent that it may be necessary we will sit until latish to try and finish as many of the witnesses as possible, obviously we will check their availability if we go beyond, when we go beyond four o’clock but from my point of view we could go even up to six.     But we will talk and if tomorrow – tomorrow we are meant to have only one witness or how many?     Two, but both of them are short?   Or one is longer?     Mr Dingiswayo     Is it, and then ja okay so let’s see how it goes.  Okay we will then adjourn and resume at two o’clock.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Mr Soni is everything ready now?   Your mic.   Your mic, turn it towards you otherwise you’re sitting far from it.     Yes.     Okay, alright.     Okay and you will deal with that at some stage to place on record what we will call that bundle.     Ja, or do you want to deal with that now?     Yes, now what I mean is we will need for purposes of the record to say what bundle it is and what exhibit it is so that somebody who reads the transcript will not look for the number that was mentioned earlier and would not look for it in this bundle.     Ja, okay, alright.     Okay, no that is alright.   Okay.   Please administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you very much, you may be seated.   You may then continue Mr Soni.     Thank you.     Well you just want to mention where I find Mr Loubser ’s affidavit.     Okay, we’re using Bundle G, which is – and the Exhibit for his affidavit is SS16.     Ja, and it is page 106?     Well the covering note starts at 104 and then there is an index at 105 and then the actual affidavit starts at 106.     Okay for purposes of this bundle see we normally when we refer to page numbers, we normally refer to the red numbers on the pages, so let’s announce for the purposes of those who will read the transcript that – how this one is.   Is it the handwritten numbers, pagination that we follow from the beginning to end or is there a mix of red numbers and the handwritten numbers?     Throughout?     Okay in this particular bundle the pagination for the purpose of the record well it can’t be Mr Soni because I see Mr Mogashoa’s affidavit doesn’t have handwritten pagination.     Yes, I can’t say that we will follow the handwritten numbers until everything is handwritten, so I won’t say anything about the pagination because it means it is not consistent, okay, but for purposes –so for present purposes there are – there is pagination that is read and pagination that is handwritten, is that right?     But the red pagination will – you will paginate by hand but the numbers, page numbers will be the same.     Ja, I just wish somebody had just done the whole thing from the beginning to end and we could announce before we start using it that this is the arrangement, because all the other bundles the pagination is – we tell the witnesses look at the red numbers, that is the pagination, so here we have got to say handwritten, but now if I say handwritten then that is not correct for the other one, so we will say handwritten for – or maybe we won’t say anything we will just say we know that for his affidavit and documents it is the handwritten ones and then later on somebody will then do the earlier ones.     Okay, alright.   You may proceed. ADV SONI     Well I don’t know whether for purposes of enabling those who are listening and those who are maybe viewing the proceedings on television or elsewhere whether it is not necessary to mention the property transactions to say this is what appears to have been done and this is how the law firms appears to have been involved, or Mr van der Walt to have been involved and then so that when they hear Mr Loubser ’s evidence they can see where it fits in.    You mean Mr Montana made a profit of about…[intervenes].      Ja.   That’s the owner of the property?      Not the owner of Precise Trade?      And Mr van der Walt was not just a partner in the law firm, namely Loubser van der Walt but he was the sole Director, is it, of Precise Trade?     Ja, ja, okay.     Okay, no that’s fine, you may proceed.    I’m sorry Mr Loubser, although he’s asking the questions, you tell me the answer so you look towards me most of the time and then you can just raise your voice.      I don’t know whether it’s the aircon, please just repeat that, the aircon made your voice not to be clear, just repeat what you have just said.     Okay.     Look at me Mr Loubser.     Ja please repeat that.     Maybe what you can do as you speak, come a little closer to the mic or bring it a little closer ja, okay.     That’s much better ja.     18 t h  of June 2020?     Maybe for the sake of – I don’t know if you already mentioned but that affidavit appears at page -from page 106 to 113 that is the affidavit of Mr Loubser in Bundle G.     Ja.     Sorry Mr Soni, let’s start with this. First you became aware of certain allegations in the media, in the newspaper relating to Mr van der Walt or Precise Trade or both but also those allegations or those articles or that article mentioned your law firm in whatever they were saying, is that right?     But it said Mr van der Walt and his law firm, ja.     What was your impression of what was being said about Mr van der Walt or Precise Trade that made you concerned and want to confront him?     Were there allegations of some wrong doing made in the media about Mr van der Walt and/or Precise Trade which you were concerned people could associate with your law firm because the reference to his law firm was a reference to your law firm as well?     But it give the reader, did the article give the reader the impression of some wrong doing, allegations of wrong doing or not, why were you concerned about what was said in the media about him and the law firm?     Okay what I’m trying to understand is, whether you were prompted to confront him simply because from what you read in the newspapers it appeared that there may have been money that, according to the article, was either paid to the law firm or was paid by the law firm to buy some properties without your knowledge irrespective of whether there was wrong doing or not or whether the impression you got on reading the article or articles was that, whatever Mr van der Walt or Precise Trade was involved in or was allegedly involved in, was having a – may have a negative impact on the law firm.  It created the impression that the law firm might be involved in wrong doing, precisely what made you say, look, we must confront him about this.  Is it simply because there might have been some money transactions involved in the law firm that you knew nothing about, even if there was nothing wrong about them or was there – did there appear to be allegations of wrong doing of one kind or another?     Ja but was the – were the allegations or was the impression you got from the article that some monies had allegedly been paid from the law firm to buy some properties that you knew nothing about or was the allegation or was the impression that some monies were paid in to the law firm without your knowledge in regard to some properties, which exactly…[intervenes].     Okay.     Ja it starts on 119.     On what page?    I’m sorry…[intervenes].     Before that, Mr Soni, have you indicate from what publication this article comes?     Ja. ADV SONI     And – I’m sorry, I see on the right-hand side there, I see the name Pieter-Louis Myburgh and then I see Rapport.  Do we know whether the article was written by Pieter-Louis Myburgh or we don’t know?     Okay.     Well maybe he could read a few more sentences.     I think, Mr Soni, it’s fine he can just read and finish that article ja.   Just read and finish it Mr Loubser.       I’m sorry…[intervenes].     Ja I think so too, I thought – the paragraph that starts, “Van der Walt’s shelf company”.     Ja, thank you.    Look on this side again Mr Loubser.      So you had a meeting with Mr van der Walt?     Now that meeting that you had with Mr van der Walt, yourself, Mr van der Walt and Mr van Wyk, it’s very important that I get as much of what was discussed there as possible.  It may be that it was a short meeting because it was agreed that you must put your request in writing but I want to hear the full discussion but if there is not much other than that you put the question and you said, put your questions in writing, just talk more to me about that discussion.     Okay.     Okay, alright who asked that there be a written request for information, did you and Mr van Wyk say to him- to Mr van der Walt, we will give you something in writing to tell you what we would like you to deal with or did he, that is Mr van der Walt, say to you, please send me something in writing then I will respond in writing.     Well if you can’t remember it’s fine but in the end, it was agreed that you would put your request in writing, request for information.     And he would respond in writing?     Okay.     Is that 12 t h October?     What page?     Right, first line?     There’s an English translation isn’t it?     I thought some of these documents that were in Afrikaans there was some English translation provided?     Who provided it?     Oh okay, well if it’s accepted as correct then that’s fine, I don’t know if Mr Loubser has seen it, that translation.     Is it not here?     Oh it’s not here.     Oh, okay, alright well my Afrikaans is much worse than it was when I was at school, it was much better when I was at school, that’s centuries ago, so it would help if we could have, maybe, an official translation unless Mr Loubser is happy, later on to just provide an English translation, I think he’s fluent in English.  Mr Loubser is that something that would be easy to do or you would rather we should have an official translation?     You can provide, yes okay.     Yes, what of course, you can do today, is when a reference is made to a letter that is in Afrikaans you can tell us what you were saying in English because it’s your letter you know it.     I’m sorry.     You are talking about NJL3?     But I don’t have anything written NJL3 at page 119.     Is it the red writing?    Well that looks like an odd – an O6 NOL3 to me.  Why don’t you just use the pagination number.    Ja because – I think today …[intervenes].     Has not been the best of days.     Okay alright. I think just repeat the question to him.    Your letters starting at page 119.    Hm.    I am sorry before that.  The unofficial translations that Mr Oellerman had prepared are they available?    [Indistinct 00   I can have a look at them as he deals with the letters that are in Afrikaans.  Because I did have hard copies earlier on that were given to me.      Because if I had known they were not here I would have conditioned myself to reading Afrikaans and try and resuscitate my knowledge of Afrikaans.    Hm.    Okay that is fine ja.    Yes.    No that is fine.  Okay.  But in the meantime, we can continue.   I see that in that letter or that correspondence Mr Van Der Walt’s style or tone of writing seems to be very official and he does not seem to be just writing as himself or maybe it is out of habit when you write a letter on behalf of your law firm to other people.  I see that    Is that right or it might be out of habit of    Hm.  It is not a reflection of any tension that these issues that you raised caused among the partners?    Ja.    What he might have said ja.    Ja okay.    Hm.    Ja that is right.    Ja, no that is fine.    I did not hear an earlier sentence.  You said you do not – I do not know whether you said you do not mention the properties or something?    Hm.    Hm.    No, no, obviously we only interested …    In only certain matters and those are the ones that involve Mr Montana.    As well as Siyangena.    Or any company that might be related to – in one way or another to Siyangena.    Ja. Okay.    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Soni.    Mr Soni I wonder because he referred earlier on to TMM and maybe whether from now on it should be made clear who TMM is.    So that the viewer and listener can connect as the evidence proceeds.    Ja.    I was thinking Mr Soni whether seeing that Mr Van Der Walt in his letter that Mr Loubser read mentioned certain names at page 122 and two of the people he mentioned there are Ferreira’s.  I wondered whether he could say whether the Ferreira that he is talking about is one of these or not and whether also other names that are there if any…    You would know whether they have any relevance.    To..    I see and Mr Tom Dubek.    Ja.  So before we move away from this letter I would like that to be clarified.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.  Just to recap what does Mr Van Der Walt say in that paragraph 7 about the people that he mentions there including the two Ferreira’s and Tom Dubek?    Thank you.      So I am sorry Mr Soni.  So this relates to this so called Parkwood property or the property in Parkwood.    Ja okay.    Yes okay.  Okay.  So it is the Parkwood property.    Okay.  Okay thank you proceed.    Hm.    Yes but what – what needs to be done and that is why I was checking that it relates to the Parkwood property.    Is that we mention we associate the document with the property concerned.    This one is relevant to the Parkwood property.    Another one will be relevant to another property.    Ja.    So the document appearing at pages 145 to page 147 relates to the Parkwood property?    What is the date of the offer to purchase?    Oh then…    Ja okay.    The transfer had not taken place at the time of the addendum?    Ja okay.    I am – I am reflecting on your impression that is strange.    I thought that was because – that was because the addendum was done after the transfer had taken place.  But if – if it was before the addendum had taken place why would it be strange, I just want to make sure I can follow?    Even for later witnesses.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Well I – I can imagine that – you mean he agrees to that without saying let us adjust the purchase price?  You know so I am thinking that if that – the buyer could considerably sell to the seller; I know we have agreed the price but for maybe I have just become aware that the condition of the kitchen is actually quite bad.  I had not seen it properly.  I know that I have already signed and you have no obligation but you know what I gave you a very good price.    Can you not just fix – agree to fix this.    It will mean a reduction on the price on what you will get on your profit.    But I gave you much more than a normal profit.    So that might be the explanation.    Ja.    No, no, no that is fine but I wanted to make sure whether…    I can follow it.    Ja because I had thought it was strange but I think my thinking was that it happened after the transfer which is not correct.    Ja.  Okay.    I am sorry 148?    Okay now all the documents that you are going to refer to as you ask Mr Loubser questions is it documents that were furnished to Mr Loubser and Mr Van Wyk by Mr Van Der Walt?    Okay alight.    Hm.    Yes okay that is important ja.  This – the offer to purchase at page 148 relates to the Sandhurst property.    Okay thank you.    What page is that?    154.    To which property does this one reflect?    Waterkloof property.  Okay that is the document – offer to purchase – purchase and sale agreement from pages – from page 154 up to…    Hm.    Oh there.  Well the agreement goes up to 159 but maybe there is an annexure?    Okay up to 163.    Okay alright.  Thank you.    That is 2.1 at page 165.    Ja.    Over a period of twelve months.    In the year, when?    H’m.    [laughs]    Yes?    Uh, just to mention.  When you ask Mr Loubser about who Calitz is...[intervenes]     ...you are referring to a person who signed as a witness?    Oh, ja.  On... on... on... on the agreement at page 169?    Okay.    [Indistinct] appearing for or above the name, Precise Trade.  Is that of Mr Van der Walt?    Okay.  Alright.      What is the name?    Oh, okay.    Uh, just raise your voice and repeat again.    Well...[intervenes]     It appears to be an agreement on its own, does it not?  It does not seem to amend any other agreement, does it?  On these terms.    H’m.  It seems to be a standalone agreement.    H’m.  Okay.  You. you accept that Mr Loubser?    Or you are not sure?    It does not seem to be an addendum to...[intervenes]     It says addendum...[intervenes]     At page ...[indistinct]     ...when one reads paragraph 1 uh, it seems to be just uh, uh, fresh... a standalone agreement.    Ja, okay.    Yes, yes.  H’m.    I am sorry.  He has always been...?    So...[intervenes]    ...or was... was this work that ...[intervenes]     ...he was allowed to earn income if he did it outside of normal working hours?    He was allowed to do that?    Yes.    Yes.  But what I am saying is um, as far as you know ...[intervenes]      I am sorry, I think I have lost you or you have lost me.  Paragraph 10 at which page?     201.     Ja.  Oh.  Ja, I think you said at paragraph 10 and I was looking at – on the side which is paragraph 19.     So that is at paragraph 10?     Ja, but that appears at paragraph 19, okay.     I am sorry, what did you – you asked him whether he knew Mr Montana?     Well, I am not sure whether there is any issue between the two of you because the lighting here is quite bad, I think a few days ago I asked if somebody could arrange to get some lights that could help me here.  So when you were referring Mr Loubser to payment at page 191, I think of 20 February, I was trying to have a look here and I was expecting to see in the entries reference to Mr Montana but I was not able to see so I am not sure, so – but I got the impression that there is some issue about some question or there is no issue?     Yes.     No, no, I understand that, I see – I got the impression that Mr Loubser was not prepared to give an answer to a question, is that correct or is that not correct?     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay, alright.  I did not hear everything but I understood Mr Soni to simply want to check with you whether his understanding of this document would be the same as yours.     In relation to – with reference to what Mr van der Walt had said.  On the fact of it that did not appear to me to be a problem, ja.     There is no problem.     I am sorry, you say TMM as reflected in handwritten form at page 190 you understand to be a reference to Mr Montana?     Ja?     Oh, now I can see, TLM.     You say there is a handwritten TMM, so I thought you were saying TMM, you say TLM.     Okay.      You do not know about the fact of the transactions, the payments made into the accounts and the payment made from the account.     And all you can do is rely on what Mr van der Walt said.     Regard to?     Is that where he has written guarantee or something?     Yes.  Is that not with reference to that R2 250 000?     It is in relation to that?     On my page immediately after that there is something written there by hand that looks to me like guarantee but it might be something else.  Do you have the same thing.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  Is there any significance to that handwritten…?     Just raise your voice, that is the first payment?     Oh, made by Mr van der Walt?     Okay. MR SONI     And the reference to guarantee, is there any – or you do not know?     Ja, ja.  Mr Loubser, is that Mr van der Walt’s handwriting or not, that says guarantee, or not?     Do you have any understanding of what that guarantee means apart from what…?     You have no idea what it means?     Okay, alright.     While I am looking at that, this document, Mr Loubser, starting at page 190, the one we are looking at.     It is part of what Mr van der Walt furnished to you and Mr van Wyk, is it not?     Did you not have occasion to ask about what this guarantee refers to?     Ja.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  Page 1…?     198, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, I may have read somewhere, and I thought it might be in connection with the agreements relating to these properties or in relation to documents relating to this Swifambo or Siyaya or Siyangenda.  I seem to think I have read somewhere an agreement that refers to certain payments as guarantees or guarantee.     So when I see this guarantee I am wondering whether it has a connection with what I may have read somewhere, so – but maybe not.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes in relation to Swifambo.     Ja, ja, Siyangena.  So maybe that is where I am taking it from.     Okay, no, that is alright.     Yes, well in any event you – if you have not already done so, if you have information relating to Mr van der Walt, you could send notice to him to say these are – this is what we are looking at, you are at liberty to furnish us with an affidavit, obviously he at liberty even to come to South Africa.     And apply to adduce evidence.     So he might elect to put up an affidavit.     He might elect to come.     He might elect not to want have anything to do with us and, of course, since he is out of South Africa, we cannot compel him.     So that is fine but there is one question I want to ask.  Mr Loubser, there is a letter that – I do not know where exactly it is here in the bundle but there is a letter that Mr van der Walt wrote on the letterheads of the law firm if I am not mistaken or it might have been an email but he wrote to an estate agent, I believe, in regard to one of these property transactions and said to the estate agent that the law firm had, I think, R5 million in its trust account which was for financing that property.  I got the impression in the documents that there was no such amount in the trust account of the law firm when Mr van der Walt said there was.  Do you remember what – did you come across that in the documents or not?     Yes.     Yes.  So to the extent that that is what he said in a letter, that is not true, as far as you know.     To the extent that he may have said there was at a particular time when he wrote that letter there was an amount of R5 million in the law firm’s trust account for that property, that would not be true.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     5 million, is it not?  Not 500 000, 5 million?     So that much you can say, that there was never such an amount.     In the trust account.     Ja.  Do you remember that letter?     Are you able to refer him to it and the page so that for the sake of completeness we…?     I wonder whether your junior is able to be of assistance.     In another file.     Ja.     Ja, that is fine, ja.     That is fine.  Mr Loubser, if you can have a look at that letter?  You can say, in the meantime, Mr Soni, that is it is a letter date what.     Or if it is an email dated what, from whom and addressed to whom and about what.     Or you will not be able to say that until you get the letter back.     Maybe Mr Loubser you can tell us.     Who is it from?     Yes.     Yes.  Would that statement be correct that at that time – you know whether that statement is correct that at that time there was R5 million deposited in the law firm’s trust account in regard to that property?     Oh, it is not a trust -  the letter does not say trust account, it says investment account.  The letter, what does it say?     Is that something that can be checked, that you can check and maybe do a supplementary affidavit whether when you investigate you are able to confirm for sure whether it is so or it is not so or are you sure that there would not have been?  I just want us to be sure.     Ja, because we just want to – we want to see whether what he said there was factually correct.     Mr Soni and them can email you so that you have a copy or – so then you can do a supplementary affidavit.  He can keep it.     Okay, keep it and then by when would you be able to file a supplementary affidavit just to deal with that part?     Next week Wednesday, next week Friday?     Friday next week.     Okay, alright, no thank you.     Ja?     Hang on one second, you are saying you are page 190?     And then what date?     6 November 2014.  Yes?     Oh yes, there is a deposit of R5 million and is this the investment – Investec account that he was talking about in the letter?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes,      Yes.  But the letter does represent, as you read it, that the money was being held in the trust account of – or in the account of the law firm, is that right?     Would you have had such an account as a law firm?  Trust investment?     Or is it Investec or investment account that he refers.     The way you invest your clients’ money that you have not used, would that be where it…?     There would be a trust investment account.     That is where you would invest clients’ monies that you are not supposed to…     Oh, so that it gets interest in the meantime.     Ja.  Okay, but the reference therein that in that letter is it a reference to that type of account that a law firm would have or is it a reference to a different account?     You are not sure?     Okay, alright.  But as you read it, it could refer to – you say it may have – it may have meant Precise Trade’s Investec account.     Ja.  And the letter is dated what?     The letter is dated the 6 t h?     Which is the same date as the entry.     Do you see it as 6 or as 8, what is written there?     Very difficult and the lighting is not good.     Okay, but whether it is 8 or 6, if this deposit happened on the 6 it might not make a difference.     Ja.  Okay.     Oh, yes, which is the Parkwood.     Oh, Sandhurst.      Oh, okay.  Okay.     Oh, that letter is in regard to the Sandhurst property.     Okay.  No, that is fine.       Okay, okay.  Are you done?  Are you done with …[intervenes]     Yes, thank you very much Mr Loubser for coming to give evidence.  I guess that for the sake of completeness even though at this stage it might look obvious, it might help if you are able to confirm that roundabout that date of 6 November 2014 there was no such deposit amount held within the trust account in relation to any such property.     Ja, just so that it is clear and that line is Friday next week.     In fact, okay no thank you very much, you are excused.     Mr Soni we are at nearly twenty five to five, I indicated that I would be prepared to sit till later than that, but I was thinking we would go up to six, but I did say we would find out from the witness who would be coming in whether it is convenient because they might not have planned to be here for that long.  What is the position?  Who is the next witness?     Check what his situation is about us continuing or whether he is happy to come back tomorrow.  Well you can just ask him, he will speak from where he is, you don’t have to go there.     He is happy to continue.   Okay, and we won’t be long with him.     Ja, let’s take a ten minutes break now and if there was going to be another witness ...[intervenes]      Oh, what is her situation?  She can just speak from where – what is your situation?  You are happy to stay?   Yes, you are spending the night in Jo’burg?  Oh you live in Pretoria?   Oh you came from Cape Town, but tomorrow would be inconvenient for you?   It would be inconvenient tomorrow, okay alright, we will try and finish because your evidence won’t be long either, but let us take a ten minutes break, and then we will continue, it is twenty five to now, we will resume at quarter to. We adjourn.     Okay Mr Soni let’s proceed.      Yes.     Well you need also to say what makes their evidence relevant, namely that the transactions relating to these properties insofar as they involve Mr Montana happened in the context of certain contracts involving PRASA, of which Mr Montana was Group CEO and Siyangena, is that right?     And Siyangena and the relationship between TMM and Siyangena.     Ja, do you want to just wrap that up?     Just touch on that properly so that whoever is listening can follow, because you and I have read a lot of these documents, we know, but somebody else might say I am not following this evidence by this witness or by the Commission now.     Yes.     Okay thank you.  Thank you, Mr Green, for your patience and for coming to give evidence, we appreciate your cooperation, you can administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you very much, you may be seated.   You may proceed Mr Soni.     Although he will ask the questions look at me most of the time.     I’m sorry, do raise your voice a little bit because there’s some noise with the aircon here, thank you.     Maybe for the sake of completeness, 15, 2014?    That’s fine.      That’s fine the exact date you can look up later I just wanted us to have that ballpark in terms of time frame.    We are dealing with Bundle G hey, is that right?      Okay, and…[intervenes].     Did you admit Mr Loubser ’s statement as EXHIBIT SS16, I don’t think so, I don’t remember you asking me…[intervenes].     Yes, okay we’ll – it is so admitted as EXHIBIT SS16, that is now the statement or affidavit of Mr Nicholas Johannes Loubser.   And the Annexures thereto and now we are dealing with the affidavit of Mr Louis Green and that is in Bundle G and you would like me to admit it as EXHIBIT SS15.       The affidavit of Mr Louis Green is admitted as EXHIBIT SS15, ja.     That is which house now?     This was the last one?    Hurlingham house?      That’s where you met him for the first time?     Okay.     What was the property sold for, before he made an offer what was it up for. In terms of the amount, you can refresh your memory by looking at the documents.       To Mr Montana?    Yes okay, but you say that, at some stage before you got involved with the property it was about R18million?     But do you have any recollection of what the amount was at which you were selling it before Mr Montana made the offer of …[intervenes].      Oh okay.     Ja.     Yes he needed a sale as soon as possible    Ja okay.      Ja that’s fine.     Well before that, can I just clarify this.  When Mr Montana made the first offer as you recall, did he make that offer on the basis that he personally was the purchaser?     Okay, not for an entity or…[intervenes].     Yes okay, thank you.     Yes, okay let’s deal with that.     Ja.   I’m sorry, just before that, in terms of the agreement, what was the deposit that Mr Montana was supposed to pay?      R5million and that’s the deposit that was paid?     Okay, thank you.     I know that, because of time you may be skipping certain things deliberately but I think it is important to capture some of those circumstances under which the identity of the purchaser changed in terms of, if from changing it from it being Montana in his personal capacity to a legal entity.  So the circumstances under which – that should be captured.    Okay.      I think he may well actually – you know it’s a very short affidavit this, he could just read it.     Yes.     Read the whole affidavit ja.    Ja you can read the whole affidavit.      Or maybe you can start on the – on paragraph 2.   That’s 2014 hey?      No you do not have to read that.    Hm.    Werksmans.  Was it done by Werksmans?    The initial investigation was it done by Werksmans?    Oh okay.  No fine.    Let me ask this question.  Initially the person who was interested in buying the property was Mr Montana.    And he made an offer to purchase.  And he made an offer to purchase that was accepted by the seller?    And that was a deal then – there was a deal between the two of them.    A deposit was paid.  Until you received a letter or email from Mr Van Der Walt asking that the buyer be changed to be Precise Trade what you knew – what you knew as the estate agent was that there was an agreement of sale between Mr Montana and the seller.    Is that right ja.  Now when you got the email or letter from Mr Van Der Walt asking that the purchaser be changed before you and or the seller – before you took that request to Ms – to the seller did you have any discussion or communication with Mr Montana himself to say, I am receiving a letter from a third party who says we must change – change this you are no longer going to be the purchaser or is that …    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Did – did Mr – did Mr Van Der Walt in – either in that letter or in a telephone conversation with you around that time ever say anything to the effect that he was acting on behalf of Mr Montana in communicating with you that the purchaser should be changed?  Did he make any representation that Mr Montana was okay with that?  He was representing him or – or how did this come about because I would have thought that if as far as you knew at the time that you received the email or letter from Mr Van Der Walt this house was the subject of an agreement that had been concluded.    The first thing that would come to your mind but who are you?     This property has a buyer, there is a deal.  So I do not expect that you would ask that question so is there anything that allayed your concerns in that regard?    Yes.    You cannot remember.    Yes.    Yes.    That you did.    Yes.  So there I would imagine you know given my experience and how pedantic I am in my deals that I would have confirmed that with Mr Montana that this is in fact you know albeit it was not in writing I might very well have been in a phone call or I might have received a phone call from him saying listen this is what happening we cannot – I am not going to take transfer we are putting into a company.    Hm.    This was in order with Mr Montana because otherwise you would be causing your client – the seller to be in breach of the agreement, you would be in breach of the agreement.    It is not something you do because particularly when there was R5 million that had been paid already.    And if you were to go along with that request without having [intervened] yourself.    From Mr Montana that this should be in order that would be very strange that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Would it have been enough for Mr Van Der Walt to just say even in a letter, I am acting for Mr Montana in that situation where he says, change the identity of the – or you – would you still have said, look I want to hear from Mr Montana.  I want something in writing from Mr Montana.    Yes.  But you certainly would not have just gone ahead with that?    Ja.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    Yes. Yes Mr Soni.    Is that the one that you – was shown to Mr Loubser?    Ja.  Do I have it here?  The one you are showing him or not?    Hm.    It is not a bundle that is here?    I thought there was Bundle H during the day, during the morning.  What page of Bundle H?    Yes I have got it.    You must always just say the year Mr Soni so…    Because when one reads the transcript one will not know which year you talking about.  It said it is an email dated 10 May 2016 sent at three minutes past twelve from Mr Louis Green and it is addressed to Jan Adrian Van Der Walt and Mr Lucky Montana is copied.  The subject matter is electric pool cover keys.    Let us hear what he says what Mr Green says to him first.    Ja just read what you say in that email to Mr Van Der Walt.    Yes.  And you copied Mr Lucky Montana in that email, is that right?    This – would this have been after the sale of the property or before?    After the transfers.    Yes.    Yes.  You remember earlier on there was a question whether you dealt with Mr Montana after – after the transfer.    I think if I recall.    You could not remember or you would not sure that you did.  I am not sure.  But here you do copy Mr Lucky Montana.  Are you able to say why you would have copied him here since he was not the purchaser ultimately?    Yes I think that is the …    That Mr Soni was checking into.    And it appears at page 186 and it is marked SP13.    Ja SP13 just read it Mr Green.    Ja.    Yes.      Are you coming back to this email or not?  That the one he has just read are you done with it?    Okay.  Before you move to another one.  On this email Mr Green Mr Van Der Walt asks you to explain why you copied Mr Montana in your email to him alright.  Do say yes because when you nod the record does not capture nodding.    You agree?    Ja.  Now I am sure we will get to an email where maybe you give an explanation or where you will deal with that but he says here in this email of 10 May 2016 to you in the second line. “Before the property was even bought by my company” By my company I think he refers to Precise Trade, is that right?    Before the property was even bought by my company.  He says you know that before the property was even bought by my company you know that Mr Montana has nothing to do with Precise or this property.  Is my reading correct?  Is it the same as yours that what he is conveying is that on the face of it is that even before his company Precise Trade bought this property Mr Montana had nothing to do with it?    Yes that is why I am asking whether you understand this email the same way I – as I understand it because that is strange to me.    No, no.    No just leave that alone.  If you just read the letter.    You understand it the same as I do.    And that would be factually not correct namely that Montana had nothing to do with the property before Precise Trade became the purchaser.    Yes okay alright.    Mr Soni.    I am sorry again Mr Soni I am sorry.    In your response to Mr – email to Mr Van Der Walt why do you not give him an explanation.  He asked you – he asked for an explanation why you were copying Mr Montana who according to Van der Walt had nothing to do with the property or with the company.  But when you respond you say “apologies” but you do not provide an explanation as to why – how it came about.    Why not?    Yes.    Ms Langata please move back to your seat otherwise we – I am being disturbed.  Yes but are you saying that copying Mr Montana on your part in that email was not something you had done consciously?  Are you saying it was oversight or are you saying you had a reason to copy him but if Mr Van Der Walt did not want you to copy him in then you would not?  I am trying to understand that.  How did it come about that knowing that Mr Montana was no longer the purchaser you still long after the transfer of the property copied him and Mr Van Der Walt asked for an explanation and you just say “apologies” and it is left.  Because I am trying to understand that.    Hm.    Yes.    Do – are you able to say an maybe Mr Soni might know this from the documents here but do you know – would you remember whether after there had been a change of the identity of the purchaser whether you still dealt – you still included Mr Montana in matters relating to this sale or not?    Hm. MR    Hm.    Hm. Did you at the time or when there was a change of identity of the purchaser did you establish who the directors of Precise Trade were?  Maybe if the shareholders – did you establish whether Montana was involved in Precise Trade at all or not?  Or were you told or not?    Yes.    Has proof.    Is authorised ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Is that Van Der Walt or…    Van Der Walt or.    Van Der Walt.    So, so as far as you would have known at the time Montana had nothing to do with Precise Trade?    From your recollection.    Ja.  Okay Mr Soni.    Before the text the subject matter?    Which is the Sandhurst property.    Yes.  Okay.    Before that Mr Soni.  I am sorry before that who is Tumi?    Oh okay.    Yes.  Okay alright.  Then continue with the question Mr Soni.    But if you... maybe because... uh, but clearly because Mr Green, you do say... you have said...[intervenes]     Well, some of this ...[intervenes]     ...these members uh... but why would you talk about the same subject...[intervenes]     But... but... but if you are talking about the same subject, namely, the cover...[intervenes]    Yes. And what you have spoken to...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   But by that date... by that date, 23 June 2015... let us ...[intervenes]     ...let us assume it is 2015, was Mr Montana still the purchaser of the property?    So why would you be talking to him about this property if he was no longer the purchaser?    Yes, you can have a look.  We are... we are simply trying to understand Mr Green...[intervenes]     And we... we... we are sorting the dots in that there is anything funny that you did.  We are just trying to understand.    Ja.    Ja. MR DE    Ja, to assist.    Yes.    Mr Soni, can you help him with the agreement, please?    He is looking for the page for the agreement ...[intervenes]     But I do not know if that will help you in terms of... oh, you want the agreement be changed over?  The change of the identity of the purchaser?    H’m.    Uh, Mr Soni, are you able to help him?    So it is long after?    Oh, no not... not necessarily long after but it is after.    Yes.  Ja.    Yes, yes.  So.... so and therefore it means that when you wrote to Mr Van der Walt and he...he said to you why you are copying Mr Montana, you were not including Montana in regard to this property after the change of the purchaser for the first time?  You had done so before?    Yes.  No, no.  I... I... I accept that.  The point that I am trying to see whether you and I can agree on is that there are at least now two occasions when you are in involving... you were involving Mr Montana in regard to this property...[intervenes]     ...during a time when he was no longer a purchaser.    You agree with me on that?    Ja, ja.  Okay.    So... so but then... but to go back to... to the point was, when we are looking at the dates of the two emails and you discovered that the one is 2015 and not 16.    The... the question that uh, Mr Soni had asked you was, why would you have been communicating with Mr Montana at a time when he had nothing to do, to your knowledge... if to your knowledge...[intervenes]     ...he had nothing with this property?  And you had earlier said that you cannot explain uh, who... is that still your answer that...?  You can see that it is awkward ...[indistinct]     Yes, yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well, Mr Soni maybe you... you... maybe you need to put to Mr Van der Walt(sic) what you... what you... you think the position is.  Uh, if it is not too early to do that.    Because maybe that might help him even to remember.    But if you intended to do that a little later, that is fine.  I am just saying.    I am just saying...[intervenes]     ...maybe it.. it is the time to put to him so he can comment.    No, I... I... I think Mr Green, I think you are maybe saying and I do not know... I just want to clarify because maybe that is the area of confusion in uh, in regard to your answer and Mr Soni’s question.  You may be meaning, you were not aware when the deposit was made, who made the deposit?  Or is that not the case?    Yes.    Oh, you... you knew that when you had that payment of the deposit happened?  You knew that... where it came from?    Oh, okay.    All right.  Then we are on the same page.    Oh, then you are on the same page.  Ja.    H’m.    Does the email say...[intervenes]     ...the previous year.    Ja, okay.    Mr Soni...[intervenes]     Who did you think were partners?    Van der Walt.    What development?    What development?    Was unlisted development.  That... that property Sandhurst or is not uh...[intervenes]     A house.  Yes.    What are you talking about when you say it was... it had not been developed but it was a house?    Who gave you that impression?    Who gave you that impression?    H’m.    Mr Soni, continue.    Wait, before... before... before you do that Mr Soni.    When you copied Mr Montana um, when you sent an email to Mr Van der Walt...[intervenes]     ...and Mr Van der Walt said   “You know that he has got nothing to do with this uh, company... my company or the property”.  Why    ...uh, that might have influenced you.  Is that what might have influenced you?    But that is not...[intervenes]     But that is not natural.  That is not a natural reaction Mr Green.    If you genuinely believed that the two were in a partnership that relates to this property and you copy Mr Montana.  And Mr Van der Walt objects and calls upon you to give an explanation, it seems to be the natural or uh,    H’m.  No, no, no.  I am just thinking if... if... if... if somebody seems to criticise you on something that you genuinely believe was fine...[intervenes]     ...uh, then you would say, “Please help me because this is how I have always understood your relationship to be but if it is not uh, I will not but this is why I did it.  Otherwise, I had no other reason”.  That is what I would have expected.    Yes.    Yes.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  Mr Soni, continue.    H’m.  Ai.  Well, I thought you would uh, put to Mr Van der Walt(sic) what may have happened at least.    Um, having regard to a lot of evidence that has been led here and some of the evidence that will still be led, anyone knowing the evidence that has been led and some of the evidence that is still to be led, is likely to wonder whether, besides trade, did not become the purchaser... was not the purchaser simply by name in form but the real of owner of the house was going to be Mr Montana. Or that whatever name was written in the deed’s office as the owner of the property, the person who was going to enjoy the occupation, whether it was not Mr Montana. Now if that is the position, it may make sense why Mr Montana would continue to be involved in regard to this property after there had been a change of the identity of the purchaser.   It would explain why uh, you would have written... you would have copied him when you wrote to Mr Van der Walt about the keys.  Was it the keys or the cover?    Ja.  It would explain why.  Because if Mr Montana was going to be the person who was going to occupy the property or if he was the... the real owner of the property, he would be the person who would need to know where to find the keys and so and so on.  Did you... what do you think about that possibility?    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    But the questions I am...[intervenes]     ...the question I am putting to you is, whether you agree that if the person was going to occupy the property was Mr Montana, even though the purchaser was Precise Trade or, if in... if the real owner of the property was going to be Montana even though on paper.    ...of Precise Trade, would you agree that it would make sense why you would keep on um, involving him?    If that was your understanding.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m?    Yes, but you are not answering my question.  My question is.  Do you accept that it would make sense or you... it would have made sense for you to involve Mr Montana even though he was not the purchaser of the property, if your understanding at the time was that he was going to occupy the property or he was the real owner of the property?    That was your understanding.    Yes, but... but if you... if that was your understanding, would it... would you agree that, then it would make sense to involve him?    The real owner.    Ja, that kind of thing.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Otherwise, you cannot think of any other reason why you would involve somebody who is not the owner of the property.    Who is not the purchaser, who is not the tenant in discussing about the keys and so on.    Ja.  Okay.  Alright.  Um, it... it... it... it maybe that we... I do not know if we will put everything that should be put to Mr Van der... Mr Green?    Um...    Yes, but the question of what he knew and is it not because if he knew the position to be that Montana was the real owner then it makes sense that he was involving him.     Or that he was going to occupy or that he had some rights in the property under …[intervenes]     Ja, then it makes sense.     But it does not know, he did not know, it does not make sense.    And he concedes that.     It does not make sense.  Maybe we should leave at this, you can reflect on it.  Mr van der Walt, we may or may not ask you to come …[intervenes]     I am sorry.  I am terribly – it is late in the day.  Mr Green, we might call you back later on.     And in the meantime, you might or might not be able to refresh your memory in one way or another but I think let us leave it at that for this evening.     Thank you very much, Mr Green, we appreciate that you came and for all the patience.  I am sorry that we are finished so late.     But thank you very much, you are excused.     Yes, yes.     Yes, let her come through.  Those files, does Ms de Beer need them or else they could be taken away, those files that Mr Green was using.     She does not need any documents?     Then they must be taken away if she does not need them.  Does she need that file?     Oh, okay.  Ms de Beer, I am terribly sorry, we have kept you like the whole day.  We really apologise but we are very grateful that you have been patient.  Thank you very much.  Please administer the oath or affirmation?     Thank you very much, you may be seated.  You may proceed, Mr Soni.     Hang on one second, we are talking about a statement, a sworn statement, appearing at page 49, handwritten 49 of bundle G and the statement is admitted as EXHIBIT SS15. HANDWRITTEN SWORN STATEMENT BY KAREN DE BEER  HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT SS15     Ja.  It is a statement by Karen de Beer, is that right?     Yes, thank you.     Just for record just indicate what property we are talking about?     Waterkloof?     Yes, okay, that is the Waterkloof property.     Ja, Waterkloof property, yes.     Yes, okay, you owned the property?     Yes.     2010.     What was is being sold for, what was the price that you were selling it for?     For?     But what was the price that you had put up if you are able to remember?     Okay, alright.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     And who was the purchaser for the 11 million price?     Lucky Montana.      I am sorry, hang on one second?     Before this offer to purchase of Mr Montana for 11 million, did you know Mr Montana?     Even though he was five blocks away?     Okay, okay.     Oh, okay.     But you are now saying that you learnt that ABSA had valued your property for 7 million or was it somebody else who had valued the property?     Ja.     Development.     When you say you knew it was not true.     What was not true, was it the valuation …[intervenes]     Or that he had got the valuation?     Yes.     Of course another way of doing it, Mr Soni, and I do not know if it might be a faster way, to let her finish her story and then later on identify the documents.     Yes, okay.     This time what was the price, this time.  Was it 11 million?     Okay.     Yes, Mr Soni, I think you can…     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Look at me more than you look at him.  I am the one you are telling the story to.     Then it was Smith?     And then – but it later changed to Precise Trade or not?     Ultimately it was changed to Precise Trade.     Yes, okay.     Alright.     What you did understand is that the controversy was about in whose name the property would be …[intervenes]     He did not discuss it with you but from your lawyer you understood that there was a controversy.     Ja, okay.     And I guess what you wanted was the millions.     In what name the entity – the property was, you did not care, you wanted the millions.     What page?     Five zero?     Okay.   The top paragraph at page …[intervenes]     That is Mr Montana’s secretary?     Yes.     So, in other words, what Mr Montana’s secretary told you, Mr Montana said he would do to the house actually happened subsequently?     Okay.     Just before that, so all of this happened, the transfer happened, the transfer was – of the property was from your close corporation as the owner to Precise Trade as the new owner but you are saying as far as you are concerned the real owner was Mr Montana?     And you  say you had these interactions with him even with is secretary saying that Mr Montana said he would – telling you his plans about the house, which ultimately you saw happening?        Yes okay.       Thank you, I interrupted you Mr Soni.       I interrupted you, you can continue.     If that email hasn’t been read into the record I think ...[intervenes]      Ja, go ahead yes.     Whose email address is that one where you sent it to, and – is it Vision or something, do you want to, that letter at page 76, that email address.  Was that a common email address for the community or what?     Okay, okay.       Okay, just read the whole email.       The email address?     Okay.     At what page?      Well it also say to all my neighbours, but it says addressed to, okay, yes continue.      Is it identical?     Ja, okay.     Ja, okay.     Yes, yes.     Did you ever meet Mr van der Walt?     H’m?     And his secretary, yes okay, okay.     Yes thank you very much Ms de Beer, we will release you, we once again want to say we are grateful that you were patient, thank you very much for coming to give your evidence.     You are now excused.     We will adjourn now and tomorrow it is two witnesses, depending on whether an application is going to be brought in terms of ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay, so we will, but we will start at ten.  We adjourn. 
ADV SONI SC:  We are ready.  DCJ I must apologise and so does the witness Mr Botes he came from Pretoria but he just lost his way.    And he apologises most profusely.    That is what seems to have happened.    Mr Soni before I…    Mr Chairperson before we start may I put Mr Botes’ evidence in context and then we can swear him in so that we know that the purpose of his evidence is and it can be directed at those issues.    As you please Chairperson.    It is right – it is the last one Chairperson in Bundle G.    Oh I am sorry.      Mr Botes’ affidavits appear at – as SS17 and at – they start from page 1 Chairperson.    So it is a separate document.  Chairperson the way this file has been prepared is because there are short witnesses which short affidavits, they decided to put everything into one file.    I do not know if they have put dividers into file Mr Chairperson.    Yes.  DCJ part of the problem was and I was not involved in it was that what we would have is a person’s affidavit starting at page 15 or in this case it would be 100 and something and it was thought that it would be better to have them start with page 1 of the affidavit.    I know it is Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes.    He is here yes.    Yes.    No sure.    You want it from page 1 to …    It is marked Exhibit SS17.    I again apologise to you Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    DCJ before I lead the evidence of the witness because perhaps, I should place on record the background against which Mr Botes is being called because the matters that are contained in the documents before you are much wider than what the commission is dealing with.  But there is a significant part of Mr Botes’ affidavit and statement to the Pretoria Bar Counsel that contains matters that are of interest to the commission.  But I will just give the background Mr Chairperson.   You will recall Chairperson that Ms Ngoye gave evidence that in regard to the Siyaya matters there – the matters had been in court and they had been referred to arbitration.   There were five matters that had been referred to arbitration.  And the arbitrations we are going go on and then – and this now is the perspective from the PRASA Legal – the internal legal team.  And they – they were told that the Chair – the newly appointed Chairperson Ms Makhubele now Judge Makhubele was going to be dealing with the matter and you will recall that they said that when they contacted PRASA’s attorneys PRASA’s attorneys said to them PRASA’s attorneys had been instructed not to communicate with the internal legal team.   Then they found out that the matters had been settled and that there was going to be an application to court to make the arbitration awards and orders of court.  When they found out about that they then approached their firm of attorneys different from the ones that had initiated the settlement or had concluded the settlement to have those orders rescinded.  Eventually it was rescinded.   So that is the perspective from the PRASA internal legal team.  We are now going to deal with the perspective of communications between Ms Makhubele and the lawyers for the liquidators in the matter.  Mr Botes was counsel for the liquidators in the matter and at issue was a communication that Ms Makhubele had made to him saying that the attorneys who were applying for the rescission application had no authority to do so.   At issue again to put Mr Botes’ evidence in perspective is that when this application was made Mr Botes was surprised having regard to the fact that in a previous communication Judge Makhubele had said to him the matters are settled and the matters in fact were settled.  So he    Yes it was the 19t h.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  May I in fairness to Ms Makhubele Chairperson say that she has asked to consult with the commission?    So that she could answer those very issues.    Oh well that is what she said to me in a telephone conversation.    Last Saturday.    So – but Chairperson those are matters that will obviously have to be raised.    With her.    But – but we would respect that is the full background against which Mr Botes’ evidence must be assessed.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Chairperson as I understood what Ms Makhubele said is that because Mr Botes’ evidence – well communication to the commission was based on some Whatsapp messages between him and Ms Makhubele his phone had been subjected to a forensic analysis by the commission and she wanted the same in respect of her phone.    We indicated that we would have a person from the commission’s forensic team at the interview – at the consultation with her and if it was necessary then those investigations or the inquiries would be made.  But she would have to indicate what is it that is in dispute between her and Mr Botes.    Chair after we had finished Chair.    So I did tell her that – and she asked if her – Mr Botes’ evidence could be deferred until she gave evidence and I pointed out to her that that is not how the commission operates.  It is in fact very seldom if it has ever happened that when a person who is called by the commission gives evidence that the person so called implicated person is immediately called.  But I did indicate to her that Mr Botes will be called today.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    No Chairperson just – just to point out that we will point all of these matters out when we consult with her next.    Mr Botes just if I can ask you – you have submitted to the commission two affidavits and your response to Judge Makhubele’s complaint against you to the Bar Counsel – to the Pretoria Bar Counsel, would that be correct Mr Botes?    Yes.    Now Mr Botes the – do you know Ms Makhubele?    Yes.    I... I... this was expected...[intervenes]     Yes and...[intervenes]     Yes, yes.    Yes.    And... and I did not want to interrupt.    While he told the whole story.    Yes but it is more housekeeping for the purposes of record.  Now, your uh, response to Judge Makhubele’s complaint against you uh, I have not called the judge because at the time this happened, she was not a judge although she had been appointed.  So perhaps I should call her judge.    Is at... it starts at page...[intervenes]     Yes, yes.    Ja, I.. I accept that Chairperson.    Yes.    Took effect.  Yes, yes.    Yes.    I... I... I must accept that uh-uh Chairperson.    But in an application in Cape Town, unite behind...    And that is the complaint before the uh, uh, Judicial Conduct Committee.    Saying that as soon as the pronouncement is made, she becomes a judge.    I... I... just make the point Chair.    And that is why ...[intervenes]     Yes.    [laughs]  Yes.  Yes, Chair.    Ja.  [laughs]    Yes. [laughs]    Yes. [laughs]    Yes, yes.    Uh, Mr Botes.  So you... you have filed... uh, you made this affidavit uh, at the request of Mr Oellerman from the Commission on the 14t h of October.    Now, it... uh, again, it is not to test anything there but to the affidavit you attached your response to the complaint by Judge Makhubele and that is marked X.  Is that correct?    And then to that complaint you also... ah, sorry to that response, you also attached a few documents.    One document that you attached is this letter that contains the communication that became the source of controversy if I can put it that way.    One ...[intervenes]     Yes.  So this is the letter on the 8t h of March.  This was written by your attorney but uh, uh, I just want to point out that Judge Makhubele takes offence or she is unhappy that you communicated it to your attorney and I am going to deal with that in a moment but I just want to put into perspective. That is the importance of this letter.  Would that be correct?    And then you also annexed as B the report of the liquidator.    Oh, sorry.  The Commissioner.  Sorry.    Yes.    Yes.  Now in regard to this document.  In her communications internally to the PRASA’s legal team, Judge Makhubele says that this is the document that persuaded her that PRASA has no defence.  I am... I am just placing that on record. But did you give her this document before she made up her mind.  I think you have met on the 14t h of November at the PRASA building.    Oh, I see.    And... and then you attached as C the... a further communication by Judge Makhubele to you and this is a... a WhatsApp message.    And what is the relevance of this?    Yes?    Yes.    Oh.    That is... that is the one Chair.     Mr Botes, just on that point …[intervenes]     Oh, I am so sorry.     I am going to need at least 15 minutes to be fair to Judge Makhubele’s side.     That I can put what – she has now responded by way of affidavit.     And I just need to put that …[intervenes]     And then, of course, her affidavit will come at a different time.     But I did undertake to her that I will put her version to Mr Botes for him to respond.     Limited.     In fact, I could do it in about five or ten minutes, Chairperson.     And it may be better because then you can release Mr Botes for one.       But then we start with something new when we come back.     As you please.     Yes.     Sorry, Chair.     I am sorry.  Annexure D to your response to Judge Makhubele’s complaint.  Where did you get it from?     That was about the time that the letter was written which would be around the 15 October.     And then annexures E, F, G and H are in fact the awards, the arbitration awards issued by Judge Brand.       Now I take it these are all the documents – the only documents you submitted to the Bar Council.     And the Bar Council then effectively exonerated you, they said that there was no merit in Judge Makhubele’s complaint against you.     Chairperson, just for the record that letter from the Bar Council appears at page 62, Chairperson.     Now after you submitted your first affidavit you were asked to make a further affidavit and that is the second affidavit that you have already referred to which you made on the 20 May this year.     Now I just want to confirm again that what is contained in the two affidavits you made is true and correct. ADV BOTES     Now, Mr Botes, I want to get to the last part.  In both the affidavits you refer to your response to Judge Makhubele’s complaint.     And you confirm the correctness of what is contained in the response as well. ADV BOTES     I just want to now come to the nub of the dispute between you and Judge Makhubele as contained in her affidavit.  There are two areas of dispute and I will just put them to you.   The first is, she says that it is not you who initiated – it is not she who initiated the communication in relation to the Siyaya matters but it is you.   Now you deal with that in paragraph 11 of your affidavit and you have already given evidence on that.     Yes.     Mr Chairperson, let me – I perhaps looked at the affidavit, if I may put, jaundiced eyes, because it was informed by my conversation with her.  In my conversations with her.     All my conversations.     She has – she is adamant.     That that is the nub of the dispute.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I will certainly put it.     And it is just for his – so that when she comes, we can say that we have put it to Mr Botes.     Mr Botes, you have heard that and I just want to say to you in paragraph 11 you respond to what you point out in paragraph 10, namely her allegation that it was the liquidators who approached her through yourself around the second week of November in regard to this dispute and what is your reaction to that?  And I ask purely for the – I know what your evidence was but I am just asking as a response.     Because that will tell you who initiated the call.     And that will put an end to that.     It does not look like, Chairperson.     As Mr Botes correctly points out.     It is simply looking at receives calls and calls made.     Yes.     Yes.     The second issue and in a sense, Mr Botes, it seems to be tied to the first issue, is that you say she initiated the call, you congratulated her and it is at that time that she pointed out the circumstances or the purpose of her appointment as Chairperson of PRASA’s interim board.     Can I – and to get past this point, Mr Botes, can I take it what you recorded at paragraph 11 in your response, that is 11 – the whole of paragraph 11 is what really happened and we can accept that that is your version.     Now in response the question of deployment – so she said to you I have been deployed by former President Zuma.  She may not have used the word former President Zuma.     He was not former at that time.     So this is where, Chairperson, I am going to – I have read her affidavit and it does not seem as if she says categorically she did not say this but what she say is, I do not know Mr Zuma and so on.  But I am going to put two versions to you , Mr Botes, just for the purposes of not having to recall him.     Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     That is right, she does.     Mr Botes, she will come and explain but I just want to put two possibilities to you.  She seems to say at one level that she was not appointed or deployed by the President, that she had never spoken to him.  Now by implication she seems to be saying that she did not tell you.  What is your response to that?     And she gave you at that time the purpose of that appointment/deployment.     Now she also seems to say that she did not mention President Zuma in the conversation.  I am – as I say, I am not entirely sure, but whatever her version is I would like you to sort of respond to all possibilities as appears from the …[intervenes]     It has, no sure.     Finally, Mr Botes, I just want you, in fairness to you, because she is likely to come and make this allegation.  She says in her affidavit that in 2018 you tried to approach her to resolve a dispute that Siyangena had with PRASA.  Can you recall that?     She – just again for context, she puts it on the basis that she is saying because you initiated the Siyangena with her you must have also initiated the Siyaya.  That is what her affidavit – because I will just put that so that it is not out of context.   She is saying I am mentioning the question of Mr Botes’ approach to me to settle this Siyangena matter, she says I am mentioning all this as a basis to rebut the allegation that I initiated the settlement of Siyaya claims and that I told Adv Botes that I have been deployed to settle the matters.  I just put that to you. ADV BOTES     Just finally on that point and perhaps in terms of your evidence, Mr Botes, she says that in regard to this, in January 2018 you sent her letter.  Can you recall that?     Chairperson, those are the questions.     Yes, thank you so much, Mr Botes, on behalf of the Commission’s legal team.     Yes.     Chairperson I have noticed you’re having difficulty following the numbering in the bundles and they are not – they have not been done in the usual manner.  We would ask if we could be given leave to put the bundles right and ask if we could take an early lunch adjournment so we can sort that out and we could start again at two o’clock and go through the witnesses thereafter.  I apologise again, but it is not fair to you especially because we may be familiar with the documents but I noticed you were struggling to keep up with the witnesses and tally what was said, what is contained in the documents.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     The same, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Two witnesses.     Yes.,     Yes.     As you please.     Yes, yes, we hope it is Chairperson, we have tried and we have done as you liked it to be, and as it should be, starting with the – the first page being numbered one and then continuing, sequentially, until the end of that bundle.     Chair we are on Bundle G, we have removed affidavit of Mr Boulters from that bundle and we will put it in a separate bundle.    And then ...[intervenes]      Yes, and ...[intervenes]       Yes, so as you have suggested DCJ the numbering will be the same, it will just be a different bundle number.     No indeed, yes.     We will try and do it by tomorrow so it will save time.     Chairperson our next witness is Mr Nicholas Johannes Loubser.  May he be sworn in.     As you please Chairperson.     Chairperson may I take ...[intervenes]      Page 106 in Bundle G Chairperson.     SS16.     106 Chairperson.     It is the handwritten numbers.     Throughout.     Chairperson what we intend doing here is we will handwrite that as well so there’s consistency and people are not looking in different places.  So just those numbers will be the same but they will be handwritten as well.     That is so.    Will be the same for Mr Mogashoa’s affidavit.     Do the Mogashoa affidavit.     As you please Chairperson.  Now Chairperson you will recall that in regard to Mr van der Walt and why Ms Ngoye in her founding affidavit, and replying affidavit in the Siyangena matter says the Siyangena contract with PRASA is tainted.  She says there were four property transactions involving Mr Montana and Mr van der Walt, or is company which is called Precise Trade and Investment 02 Pty Limited. The first Mr Chairperson is a property that Mr Montana owned and which his own banker had valued at about R3.5million in 2012.  In 2014 Mr van der Walt bought that property from Mr Montana for R6.8million, he effectively made a profit, Chairperson, of more than R3million on the estimated value of the property.     Mr Montana made a profit yes.     The second property that is in question, Chairperson, is a property in Waterkloof in Pretoria and we’re hoping to have a witness, the owner of the property, to come and give evidence this afternoon, who will indicate that the property was – the first person to express an interest in the property was Mr Montana and then gradually he withdrew from the scene and Mr van der Walt, through Precise Trade became the owner of the property and that property was in the region of R11million Mr Chairperson.  The third property is a property in Sandhurst and the estate agent who sold the property is here, he will be giving evidence on that property, he sold that property for R13.9million, having entered into a contract originally with Mr Montana but then again Precise Trade entered into the scene and they became – the property was transferred into its name.  the fourth property, Chairperson, is a property in Hurlingham which Mr Montana bought and that was in the region of R13.5million and that property, they attempted to transfer into the name of Precise Trade but the owner would have nothing to do with it and you will see from documents, as to why that was the case…[intervenes].     At Hurlingham yes.     Yes, and eventually the property was transferred to Mr Montana.  Now the evidence that is available in respect of the payment of the properties, Chairperson, is that it does not appear as if Montana – Mr Montana paid any money for any of these properties.  Now, we accept that he sold one and two were transferred into the name of Precise Trade but the fact of the matter is, Mr Chairperson, he bought a property in his own name, it transferred to his own name, thirteen odd million rand but the documents that we have which show payment for these properties doesn’t reflect that he, himself,  paid even a cent for these properties.  So, that is the value of Mr Loubser ’s evidence because although he can’t give first-hand information, they confronted Mr van der Walt about this, he and his partner, Mr van Wyk…[intervenes].     That is so Chairperson yes.     And what we will also show through Mr Loubser is, that when they confronted him, Mr van der Walt gavel Mr Loubser and Mr van Wyk a set of documents which contain some of these property dealings but more importantly the funders for these property dealings and there are three main individuals who are the funders.  We will go through them, perhaps I must just mention them now, there’s a Mr Clansey, there’s a Mr Plimental and there is an organisation which you’ve heard of already, TMM which had entered into a contract, TMM and Mr Ferreira had entered into a contract with Mr van der Walt to have joint ventures in property matters and in respect of some of the payments, payments were made into Precise Trade’s account and soon thereafter withdrawals were made to pay for some of these property transactions but that will be shown via a bank statement that Mr van der Walt gave to Mr Loubser.  So those are the matters I’m going to lead Mr Loubser on Chairperson.     As it pleases Chairperson.  Mr Loubser, sorry you’ve heard the introduction.     Can I just ask you, are you still practicing as an attorney?     And how many partners are in your firm at the moment?     That’s you and Mr…[intervenes].     Now Mr Loubser your firm is still called Loubser Van Der Walt.     Alright, now how long had you and Mr van der Walt and Mr van Wyk been in partnership?     And after – sorry when did Mr van der Walt left?     When did he leave?     Now before he left though, there were concerns that you and Mr van Wyk entertained about certain dealings that Mr van der Walt appeared to be having and that had received adverse publicity, would that be correct?     Would you tell the Chairperson the circumstances of that?     Now, just to put it on record you’ve described all these matters in an affidavit which you made on the 18 t h of June, is that correct?     2020, yes Chairperson and in this affidavit, you attach a number of documents which Mr…[intervenes].     As it pleases Chairperson.     Now, you confirm the correctness of what’s stated in our affidavit?     Okay so you say you confronted Mr van der Walt.     And following that confrontation, what happened then?     Yes, sorry so…[intervenes].     Just to give some context to this, you wrote to Mr van der Walt on the 14 t h of October right, and that appears at page 120, that’s Annexure NLJ2 to your affidavit – sorry NJL2 to your affidavit, would that be correct, if you look at the bottom…[intervenes].    Yes, and your signature and Mr van Wyk’s signature is at page 120, is that right?     Yes, and it’s dated the 14 t h of October?     Can I ask you just to turn back to an Annexure before that which is NJL2?     Sorry page 117 Chairperson.  Is this the nature of the article, because I see you say in your affidavit you couldn’t find the article in question but you give a – there is a summary of the article which you Annexed to your affidavit, is this the nature of the article that was written?     And the date of this News24 article is the 4 t h of October 2018, is that right?     So that’s – two things, the articles or the media reports start early in October and you confront him about two weeks later, is that correct?     This is what the Chairperson was asking about, the nature of the article.  Would you just – you don’t need to read the whole article but would you just read the headline of the article as it appears on page 117.     And if you could just read the first paragraph of that article…[intervenes].     Chairperson you – sorry I should – Mr Loubser you’ll see under that headline the end is blotted out but it seems to be a News24 article, is that correct?  If you just look at the headline and under that on the left-hand side, do you see that?     It would be written by him and it would be a News24 report, based on what was contained in Rapport.     So, if you could read the first paragraph of that article.     Now, is the name of the lawyer mentioned, if you look at the second page of that article?     And…[intervenes].     Yes.     And then just so that your concern is noted, what does the next paragraph read?     And then the article gives a synopsis of some of the matters that they had uncovered…[intervenes].     As it pleases.     Mr Loubser…[intervenes].     There’s a paragraph that you didn’t read…[intervenes].     And then the last paragraph – the second last paragraph, about van der Walt’s relationship with Mr Montana, what does he say about it, according to the Rapport?     Yes, and then it says the full report appears in Rapport and City Press.     Yes, now you confront – well perhaps I should – you raise the issue with Mr Montana, is that correct, after this article or after the Rapport article?     Sorry with Mr van der Walt.     So just taking up the theme, is it because you wanted it to be – you wanted there to be something in writing so there’s no dispute about what the real facts are or did he ask you for more time or did you say, give us time to prepare a proper enquiry to you?     Okay so let me put…[intervenes].     Once again I cannot recall but I’m pretty sure that we – I cannot recall who raised whether it should be in writing or not, I cannot recall but I assume…[intervenes].     Mr Loubser why I asked that is, you are three partners and it would be unusual where you have a partnership of lawyers, for one partner to say, put it in writing or another partner to say, I will put it in writing.  It looks like there were concerns about what the real facts are or am I wrong, am I just speculating?     Yes okay, anyway that meeting is held on the 12 t h and then on the 14 t h you send…[intervenes].     12 October 2015 Chairperson and one finds that in the first line of – in NJL3, Chairperson.     Page 119.     Yes, now under the heading “van vergadering gehou op 12 Oktober.”     There isn’t an official, Mr Ollerman made …[intervenes].      Mr Ollermann provided an informal translation for us.     Clint Ollermann.     No, he hasn’t Chairperson.     No.     It’s not part of the record no.     Of this – of all four letters Mr Loubser.     So just on that theme, Mr Loubser, would you tell us, more or less what – well summarise the contents of NJL3.     That’s still page 119 Chairperson.     Yes, that’s the letter of the 14 t h of October Chairperson.     I think…[intervenes]     No, it’s the black writing above the red writing.     As you please, yes.     Has not been the best of days.     I’m sorry Chairperson.    Yes.  Now if you could please summarise Mr Loubser what this is?    Mr Myburgh.    Now that letter was written on the 14t h.    Did he respond to that letter?    Yes.    Yes.    I can make it …    Yes.    I just want to see if my hard copies are there Chairperson.    Chairperson can I do this?  I have a copy of Mr Van der Walt’s responses in English.    So I have got translations of his responses.  Can I hand those up?    I am sorry I left the other two.    In chambers.    So Mr Van Der Walt Ms Loubser responded on the 20 October, is that correct?    And his response appears from page 121?    Is that correct?  Now again very briefly could you just for the record indicate what his response was?    Yes.    Could you just read those names please?    Yes.    So in – attached or annexed to that lettr were a number of other documents.    Right.  I – I am more interested in some of them and Chairperson I do it purely in the interest of time not all of them concerned the matters raised in the Siyangena and I just want to concentrate on those matters that are there.    If there is something else it will come up on a – at a later stage.    Just in the interest of time I thought I would just deal with those matters that are of concern to us.    I also – I should also say that if I do not mention for example certain transactions involving these properties it is because they will be dealt with when the transactions as a whole are being dealt with.  The purpose of referring to these documents here is to indicate the – the importance of the documents to the matters that we are dealing with in the commission.    Yes.  So for example, Chairperson he deals – if you look at page 123.    That is the first annexure.    He deals with a property being sold by Mr Isaac Roy Mogojane to Precise Trade.  Now that is not a matter that has been mentioned in the Siyangena matter or a matter appearing to involve Mr Montana.    That is right.    That is correct Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.  So I just refer Mr Loubser to those.    And bring it to your attention.    Can I then ask you to look at page 138 which is an offer…    Oh sorry.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Loubser do you know who TMM is?    Talking about transfer of properties was at that time Loubser Van Der Walt Incorporated involved in any of the transfers of these properties?    Yes by Mr Van der Walt.    You do not believe so.    You were – oh okay.    You were the conveyancing.    Would you be able to identify those?  The properties.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is as you please Chairperson.    Dubek yes.    Yes.  So at page 122 Mr Loubser – are you there?    Okay remember we asked you to read the names of those people.    Now the one you have already mentioned Mr Ferreira.    Now he you say was associated with the TMM Group.    Which is a group of companies which included TMM Rental.    Now what other companies to your knowledge was Mr Ferreira associated with?    And Siyangena?    At that stage and now?    Who – when did you discover that?    And Mr Tom Dubek?    Yes we saw an affidavit yesterday and I am just checking this with you which he deposed to in which he described himself as the CFO of Siyangena.  Do you – does that ring a bell?    TMM yes.  The only two names that appear to ring a bell.    In …    So among the documents that Mr Van Der Walt handed to you and Mr Van Wyk together with his letter of the 18 October I would like you to look at page 138 please.      Now what is that document if you could just describe it?    Yes and the street address of that property you will see it at paragraph 1.2.    And that set out – sorry.    That is correct Chairperson.    And this is the one Chairperson you will recall that Mr Montana sold to Precise Trade.    Yes.    Mr Chairperson in an effort to save time because we are going to deal with these matters when we deal with each of the properties.    Oh sorry yes.    Yes.    Property yes.    No sure yes.    Yes.  And then can I ask you to look at the next document it appears at page 145 and what is that document?    So…    So this is an addendum we reading the two documents together to the Parkwood.    Yes.    The Parkwood property.    Now I just – I ask you this because it is a matter that intrigues me.  Mr Montana sells the – and I am not asking you to – to tell me what it means but tell me what your view is about this.  Mr Montana sells the property to Mr Van Der Walt for R6.8 million in May.  In June they sign this amendment and the amendment at paragraph 2.1 requires Montana – Mr Montana to effect certain improvements and installations into the property.  Would that – is that your reading of that?    Ja.  Does that sound usual to you?    Was six weeks later Chairperson.   Then the – sorry.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, no, no I understand.  Chairperson A sells to B something for R5million.    It is a property or whatever it is.    That is a binding contract.  B must take the property and pay a R5million.    And A willingly agrees to that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no I understand.    But what – or the point I am making Chairperson is it calls for an explanation.    Yes.    No sure.    No of course.    Yes.  The next document is an offer to purchase made by Precise Trade to Mr Kohler in respect 119 Empire place, Sandhurst, is that correct?  It appears at page 148.    Chairperson.    148.    And Chairperson can I just again for your own orientation.    The Sandhurst property yes.    The next document is an offer to purchase    Oh sorry page 154 Chairperson.    File 163.    163.    They all annexures to the same document Chairperson.    163 yes.    As you please Chairperson.  Then Mr Loubser can I ask you to look at page 164.    Now when you were explaining what Mr Van Der Walt said because he said that he had entered into contracts with certain people who provided funds for the property, is that right?    Yes.    Yes.    So this is one of the investors?    Mr Pimentel?    You will see Mr Loubser and I just want to correct something that this is an agreement between Mr Pimentel and Precise Trade.    And the reason it is important is I will show you a difference in a moment with a different contract.    And in terms of this contract if you look at paragraph 2.1 Mr Pimentel agrees to …    165 Chairperson.    Mr Pimentel undertakes to invest a maximum of R20 million in this joint venture.    Over a period of twelve months.  Sorry.  Is... is... is that?    Now the next document which appears at page 170... oh, sorry.  Can I just make one other point?  You do not need to go to it.  It is... this document is dated the 3rd of November.  Is that correct?    Oh, sorry.  2014 Chairperson.    If you look at page 169, you will see the date of... of...    3r d of November.    [laughs]  So it is your partner.    [laughs]    May I just ask you?  Who is Callitz?    At your firm?    Is she still there?    Ah, yes.    Yes, who signed as a witness.  Yes.    Yes.    Then the next document is a next contract between Mark Edward    And if you look at paragraph 2.1.  Mr Clancy undertakes to invest a maximum amount of R 2 500,00 in the joint venture over the period of 12-months.    Now if you look at page 175.  What is the date of this document?    Yes.  And who signs as a witness.    Yes.    If I... can I ask you to look at the next document which starts at page 180.  Um, what is this document uh, on the face it uh, Mr Loubser?    Yes.    Uh, just... just before that.  Uh, TMM Holdings, who represents TMM Holdings...[intervenes]     ... in respect of this contract?    And that is Mario Ferreira?    All right.  And this agreement, unlike the agreement uh, that Mr Clancy and Mr Pimentel signed is with Mr Van der Walt in his personal capacity.  Is that correct?    Yes.  And Ferreira and TMM Holdings are together referred to as TMM. If you... if you look...[intervenes]     Yes.  And under their names at page 180.    And you will see there that unlike Mr Clancy and Mr Pimentel the right that is given to... or... the... the... where they have to pay.  What this agreement does is, it allows Mr Ferreira... oh, sorry.  Mr Van der Walt to present any deals that come his way to TMM who have the right to first refusal to that deal.  Is that correct?    And then, if you look at paragraph 5.  You see that it is not only local.  Will you read paragraph 5 into the record Mr Loubser?    And if you look at page 185.  When was this agreement signed?    And Mr Van der Walt...[intervenes]     Do you recognise the signature of the witness?    Who is that?    Oh.    Unrelated to Mr Ferreira.    Ja.    Yes.  Then if you look at the next document Mr Loubser.  It is at page 186.  And can you describe that document?  Page 186.    Alright.  And what this agreement says... if I could just ask you to summarise page 187, paragraph 1 and 2?    Oh, sorry.  One, two and three.  Sorry.    Uh, not.  You... you are quite right Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes, because there is no reference to that agreement at all Chairperson.    Now this teams with three separate issues.  The Venice Village Development.  Do you know anything about that?    Yes.    Okay.  And his reward would be set out at paragraph 1.1.  What is that?    The...[intervenes]     Yes.    And then it records certain payments that were received uh...[intervenes]     Do you have any idea what that is about?    Now, do you know whether Mr Van der Walt accounted to the firm for these amounts that he lists here?    He did not?    Now, when you get these documents, I take it... you are not going to say were outraged but you were concerned that Mr Van der Walt is receiving this money that is not going into the business or did that not concern you?      Yes.     Thank you so much Mr Loubser.     The next witness is Mr Green Chair.     He is happy to continue Chairperson.     No, no.     There is another witness, and that is Ms Karen de Beer.   She came all the way from Cape Town so …[intervenes]     Chairperson the next two witnesses are, if I can call them, and I say this because of the support the Commission needs from ordinary people and these are two ordinary people going about their business and are here to assist the Commission in explaining the roles of different players.     What you will see when all the evidence is led Chairperson that Mr Montana was the person who goes and spots the properties, makes offers for the properties and then enters into contracts and eventually the property is transferred to the Versace Trade, because you have heard now that all the – except the holding property, so we have an estate agent, Mr Green and an owner, Ms De Beer, who will give evidence to that effect.  The evidence will be short but with respect Chairperson it is quite dramatic because they remember Mr Montana’s role in the transactions.     Yes.     That is so.     Yes.     Yes, Chairperson the evidence of Mr Loubser confirms what we already know, and the importance of Mr Loubser ’s evidence is he says the information that he communicated today was given to him by Mr van der Walt.  That information is to this effect, that Mr van der Walt acted as an attorney for TMM, acted as an attorney for Siyangena, acted as an attorney of ESS, all major companies in which Mr Mariel Ferreira has a major interest.    What we also know is that some of these properties, not necessarily all, but some were funded by money and Mr Loubser ’s evidence on – having regard to what Mr van der Walt told him on money supplied by TMM and Chairperson it is important when one looks at TMM is not TMM the company but TMM in the joint venture agreement that he – Mr van der Walt submitted to Mr Loubser and that Mr Loubser brought to court today. So when we talk about TMM we are not only talking about the company, we are talking about TMM and Mr Ferreira.     And these are not small sums of money Chairperson, you will recall the first amount is R5 000 000 and R1 800 000 paid on the same day, the very same day to commit to R5 000 000 is paid to settle Mr Montana’s debt – Mr Montana’s bond in a property he owns in Waterkloof.     As you please Chairman.  Mr Green ...[intervenes]      Mr Green what is your profession at the moment?     And in 2014?     And at that stage would Hootch Agency, a group where you attached to?     Does the name Mr Montana – Lucky Montana ring a bell with you?     And in what connection?     Yes, can I just ask you,  you’ve made an affidavit…[intervenes].     So, you say you sold?     Just for putting them in context, one is in Sandhurst and the other is in Hurlingham?     So those are the two deluxe properties.  Now…[intervenes].     You’ve made a statement in regard to these transactions is that correct?     And that statement was made on the 1 s t of October 2015, is that correct?     Chairperson, Mr Green’s statement appears at Bundle G, page 80 and 81.     Yes, that is so.     Page 80 and 81.     No SSO, I think I forgot Chairperson.     Yes.     As you please Chairperson.     Now, Mr Green I understand this took pace some time ago and I understand that you were not well for a period thereafter.  You may look at your affidavit, you may want to recast your affidavit.  I just want to deal with the first property that you are talking about, that you sold to Mr Montana.  Can you recall the details of how that happened?     Yes.     And did – what was his reaction after the show day at Sandhurst?     Did he make an offer?     So, Mr Montana made an offer and did the old man accept the offer?     Alright, now in regard to that sale, if I can call it that, was any deposit paid?     What was the amount of the deposit?     If I could just ask you, Mr Green, in that Bundle in front of you, would you look at page 85?       Chairperson I thought I’d just get rid of this document, this is the very document that Mr Loubser was shown.     I just thought I’d…[intervenes].     Now, when Mr Montana – sorry can you remember who the seller was, the name of the seller?     Mr Kholer?     And the deposit was paid, was then the property sold to Mr Montana?     Yes, now I just want to get to the point where, eventually, the property was transferred, not to Mr Montana but to a company called Precise Trade, is that correct.     How did that happen?      Now, it was eventually sold to Precise Trade, am I correct?     If I can ask you to look at page 92…[intervenes].     You appreciate, Mr Green, that Mr Montana signs an agreement to buy the property and then the property is then going to be sold to somebody else.  The question is, how did that change come about, having regard to the fact that a R5million deposit had already been paid?     Yes, so when we say at page 94, this is the agreement between Mr Kholer and Precise Trade?     Yes, so if I can just ask you when you’re saying, in – about how the change took place, can I ask you to please look at paragraph 5 of your affidavit.  I know it’s a long time and that’s why I thought you may want to refresh your memory, page 80 paragraph 5.  Do you want to read that into the record and…[intervenes]?     Yes, that may be…[intervenes].     Could you read the whole affidavit.     Read that and we can ask specific questions.     Sorry Mr Green and sorry Chairperson, I just want to place this on record, you – after you left Pam Golding were you able to receive any documents from them?     And I just place on record, Chairperson, that many of the documents that I refer to in the affidavit, are not in our possession and we couldn’t find the primary source because, as Mr Green says, these are all deleted thereafter.  So, I just place that on record, when you see the affidavit and Annexures there will be some Annexures that are missing.     Mr Green, can I just stop you there, that is now everything you say in this affidavit about the Sandhurst property.    Yes.    Yes.    Now Mr Green as I understand from my conversation with you earlier today you do not have an independent recollection of this but this – of these transactions but what you have set out here is what you – or you knew on the 1 October 2015, is that correct?    Now in respect of – you have – how long have you been an estate agent?    In respect of these two properties I mean I know one was the transfer was effected in the name of Precise Trade.    But as far as you were concerned to whom was that property sold, that is the Sandhurst property?    Yes.  After the transfer of the property did you have – according to your knowledge did you have communications with the purchaser?    And did you have communications with Mr Montana?    And – but you do not have an independent recollection of it?    Yes.    But subsequent to that did you then continue communicating with Mr Montana in respect of the part or can you not recall it?    Concluded.    Because my own thinking is that you would done have something to make sure that it was in order.    Absolutely.    Mr Green you might recall you mentioned a little earlier that there was an email from Mr Van Der Walt saying but you contracted.    Can I show you three emails we will just go through them and place them on record.  Chairperson these are going to be part of a different bundle.    No, no this is a different one.    Not, not in your set of documents at the moment.    They will be presented in a different set of bundles tomorrow Chairperson.    It is Bundle H Chairperson.    Page 185, 186 and 181 respectively. I am going to refer Mr Green to each of them.  Chairperson you will see it is marked SP12, SP13 and SP11 respectively. The first one Chairperson is at 18 – 185.    As you please Chairperson.  Mr Green have a look at the document of the 10 June. This is an email from you to Mr Van Der Walt and Mr Montana.  Do you see that?    Oh sorry 10 May.    Now this is….    Oh as you please Chairperson.    Yes.  Now this is an email you address to Mr Van Der Walt Mr Green.    And it deals with the pool cover and you are having found two further keys for the electric pool cover.    Right.  Is the response to you …    Oh as you please Chairperson.    Yes.    That is the next one.  That is about half an hour later, am I correct?  The email on the 10 May 2016 at    SP13 yes.    Sorry can I just make one other point?    That Mr Van Der Walt cc’s Mr Montana on this as well.    So sorry could you read into the record?    Can I ask you to look another document now and that Chairperson that is SP14 which is on page 187.    Yes.    Now…    About five minutes later Mr Green you send – and Chairperson this is at page 187 SP14 you send an email to Mr Van Der Walt but you do not cc Mr Montana and what do you say in that email?    So that email now is the 10 May 2016, am I correct?    Yes.  Can I ask you to turn to the other document by…    Yes.    I have given you another document it is called SP11.  Chairperson it appears at page 181.  Have you got it?  That is an email dated the 23 June Mr – June – 23 June 2016 Mr Green have you got that in front of you?    Now could you – could you say that – do you accept that this email was sent by you?    And it was sent to Mr Montana and a Ms Kossakane at PRASA.    And it was sent on the 23 June 2016.    And what does the text of the email read?    Oh sorry.    Now this is a month and a half after you apologise to Mr Van Der Walt for cc-ing Mr Montana.    So Mr Green none of this makes sense now because you are told not to communicate but you now exclude Mr Van Der Walt.    But you not only talk to Mr Montana but to his PA as well. MR    Of the 21 April.    But that was before the 10 May.  I am only trying to point out.    But... but more intruding is the fact that it concerns the very same issue that you addressed to Mr Van der Walt and did not get a response from.    Okay.  But... but it is still about the pool cover for his house...[intervenes]     I am just trying to...[intervenes]     It does not make sense at all.    But. but clearly... we are... all we are trying to establish is.  We have a series of communications.  We are just trying to say, you would not have communicated with... with Mr Montana without a good reason.  Would... would that be fair to say?    Yes.  So what you cannot recall now is why you communicated with Montana instead of... but there must have been a reason why you did.    And left Mr Van der Walt out.    I mean, that seems strange.  You go to the old owner that knew about the new one.    You know, I also looked at... at that and I thought it is 2016.    Yes, I am just...[intervenes]     Yes.  The agreement with Precise Trade is the 26t h of November 2014 Chairperson.    So this is ...[intervenes]     ...a month later.    It is between the two.    Yes.    Yes.    No, I... I would like to.    Yes.    Uh, Mr Green, this is a property that is purchases for nearly R 14 million, correct?      Mr Montana comes to the show house.  He buys the property.  He finds a deposit is paid by somebody who is saying he is paying money on behalf of Mr Montana  MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION    Then there is a change in... and you are told “please change the name of the purchaser”.  Then after, you communicate.  Even after the change, you communicated with Mr Montana.    Until you are told “why are you dealing with Mr Montana?”  Now, it... it appears strange that a person who was... had interest in this and who was not... uh, the uh, Mr Van der Walt was not at an arm’s length with Mr Montana.  He is the one who paid the deposit.  That R 5 million deposit.  It is paid by Mr Van der Walt.  It is paid by Precise Trade.     Yes.    Yes.  Yes, but Mr Van der Walt’s trust account.    Ja.  And so, all we just want to...[intervenes]     Ja.    Yes.    And the deposit is made, if you look at uh, page 89 of those documents.  The beneficiary reference number is said to be Montana.  Although the deposit is paid by Mr Van der Walt’s firm, it... it is in regards to uh, Mr Montana’s purchase.    And then suddenly you are told but why are you talking to Mr Montana?  Does that not sound strange?  And I told you last year.    Right.    So on our version, this is not something that...[intervenes]     It may not be unusual.  I am asking in all the circumstances, did it not strike you as strange?    Yes.    Let me go back to something else about that    Why did you think that?    The interaction with...[intervenes]     Yes.  You say the interactions were... were you in their presence when the two of them were together?    When you say interactions, what are you talking about?    But you thought Montana was still involved?    Ja.  Now Mr Green, when I talked to you earlier, raised all these matters with you.  You might remember.  I showed you all these emails.    It is not a question of questioning you.  It is trying to make sense.    Of what does not appear to...[intervenes]     ...to... So I would like you to...[intervenes]     But anyway.  Can I get back to your affidavit?  What you said in your affidavit...[intervenes]     Oh, sorry.    Uh, Mr Green, I just want to ask.  In respect of your recollection of this, what you set out in your... in your affidavit...[intervenes]     ...is you recollection at the time and soon after all these things happened?    Chair, I have no further questions.    Yes.    Yes, Chair.    Chairperson, the difficulty is that Mr Green’s recollection of this does not go beyond the... what he said in his...      Oh.      Now there was a stage just before you moved out that Montana walked through the house with you, is that correct?      And you deal with that at paragraph 6 of your affidavit Ms de Beer?      And you can start, it is at paragraph 6, and you can start with the sentence that reads, the second sentence, the first meeting.      This is after he declined your offer to repaint the house.      The inside, sorry.      And then can I ask you to please turn to pages 7 ...[intervenes]       Yes.      No Chair, can I ask you please Ms de Beer to look at page 76 and page 77 and these are letters you wrote after you left.     Is that correct?   What are these letters, just in general before you read them?      I want it read in ja.      So the email is dated the 27 t h of November and it is addressed to a particular email address and the subject matter is Rose Avenue Security, is that your ...[intervenes]       Will you read then – well to whom is that email addressed?      Yes.      And you sign off as ...[intervenes]       Ms Karen de Beer and ...[intervenes]

ADV BOTES SC:  Francois Weideman Botes.    No I do not.    Yes I do.    Yes I do, so help me God.    I told her on Saturday and I called her again last night.    Thank you very much Chairperson.  Thank you very much Advocate Soni. Yes I provided the commission with one affidavit that is the affidavit that appears on Annexure SS17 on page 57 58, 59 and at the top of page 60 that is my signature which appears on that affidavit.   That is the so called – I see it is marked the second affidavit and the report that – the second or the first affidavit is the affidavit that the commission – Mr Commissioner will find SS17 that is the first page, page 303 up until 06 and that is my signature which appears right on the middle of the page and the whole purpose of these affidavits were to introduce the response to the complaint that was lodged by the Honourable Justice Makhubele against me and that response Chairperson will find from FWB08 right until the end and that will be page 24 and right at the end of the document I have signed it on the 17 May 2019.    Chairperson I have studied at the University of Pretoria obtained the degrees BLC and LLB. I joined the Pretoria Society of Advocates in 1996. I did pupillage, past pupillage and I commenced practice in 1997, the 1 December 1997.  Sorry I did pupillage in 1997, past pupillage then commenced practice on the 1 December 197.  I remained a member of the Pretoria Society of Advocates. I am still a member of the Pretoria Society of Advocates.  I was elected to the Bar Counsel in 2005. I was elected as the Deputy Chairperson of the Bar Counsel during this period which is relevant for purposes of this commission.  I served as the Chairman of the Pretoria Bar Counsel two years ago and I received – I was recommended for senior status in 13 and the President, the former President Zuma signed my letters patent in September 2014.    Chairperson I know Judge Makhubele very well.  I know her since I have commenced my practice in 1997.  We were members of the Bar Counsel for many years and allow me we have developed a very, very good relationship.  A very cordial relationship.   I always encouraged her jokingly and seriously that she is ready to be appointed.  She is ready to grace the bench and whenever I saw her, I said to her, but come on, come on you must do it now, the time is right.  And we – we really, really established a very, very good relationship based on integrity, based on trust. We were never opponents in matters.   We were never involved in – in litigation and – but we really, really got along very, very well.  And I knew that she was about to – about to be interviewed by the Judicial Services Commission.  I also knew then that in October – early October 2017 that the commission sat, Judicial Services Commission and I also knew because in our society when one of our members receives news the day, on the day, the evening or the day thereafter that they have been recommended it spreads like a veld fire in our society and we also proud of it.   We pride ourselves to make our members available to – to do Judicial service and I was very pleased.  I did unfortunately not phone her at the time I was little bit busy with – with other issues and when I received her call early in November I was in my vehicle travelling from or to a destination. I had her cell phone number on my cellular telephone and when the phone rang and it said Nana Makhubele my first reaction was to congratulate her.  I said, Nana this is now a very pleasant call congratulations upon your appointment.   My submission was it was overdue but I wish you a very pleasant, a very prosperous career on the bench and my words were still hopefully we will see you in higher echelons and maybe an appointment in the SCA. And Judge Makhubele was extremely friendly like she always is.  She is a friendly person.  I have never experienced any animosity between us and yes so that is how the conversation started.  I was totally unaware of her being appointed as the Chairperson of the interim Board of PRASA.  It was never brought to my attention.  I was simply totally unaware of it and when she informed me that she was appointed as the Chairperson of the interim Board it did not come as a shock it just came as a surprise.   I said, oh well that is – that is good, good to hear.  I did not know what the purpose of the interim Board was, I do not know how long her tenure would have been.  I do not know what the background was, that was the first time that I have learnt about her appointment.   I thought that well now that she is appointed in that position maybe the purpose of the phone call is to engage my services in some manner or another and I ask her, how can I be of assistance Judge Makhubele and she said to me that she was appointed as the Chairperson of the interim Board by the former President who deployed her there and I ask her but for what reason and she said to me unequivocally and in no uncertain terms to sort out the mess at PRASA and to clean up.  Those were her words.   She then mentioned to me that it came to her knowledge that I am involved in pending litigation where Siyaya Consulting Engineers is or was the plaintiff.  I said to her, yes but before you go any further PRASA is represented by senior counsel Advocate Kennedy Tsatswane who is the current Chairperson of Johannesburg Bar Counsel who I know very well and who I have a very, very, very good relationship with and this matters there were five matters.  These matters have a history.   It is not something that just came about.  We are literally Chairperson engaged in high, high profile litigation.  If I just can go back – back one step.  I got involved in the five matters during 2017 and that was when all these matters were set down for hearing in – on the same day in Pretoria High Court and at the call of the roll before the Deputy Judge President is Judge Ledwaba that was on the 30 May 17.   The liquidators for Siyaya and PRASA’s team of attorneys led by Advocate Kennedy Tsatswane SC decided, let us consolidate all five of the matters and refer it for arbitration.  Because the issues Chairperson were crisp.  There was one – there were two primarily issues.   1. Did Siyaya do the work that are reflected and contained    Yes, Chair.    [laughs]  I am not going to.. [laughs]    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.  No, Chairperson I do not want to delve into... into matters which are irrelevant.  The long and the short is.  I have provided her with the documents    Correct.    Correct.    Correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.  That is the letter...[intervenes]     ...dated 8 March 2018.  Yes.    That is how I also understand it Chairperson.    No, that is the report of the Commissioner.    Yes.    He had to report to the master of the high court.  What the uh, status of the inquiry was because the inquiry was then postponed sine die on the last day.    Uh, Chairperson, the reason why this was provided to Judge Makhubele on that very first meeting, you will see that if you turn to Annexure B, if you turn the page and you see there is a two.  That is my handwriting.  That is my... I paginated the whole bundle.    And it started on page 1 and this was the first document in this bundle of... of... of um, documents which I provided Judge Makhubele with when I saw her for the first time at PRASA’s office, and attached to this, was the um, pleadings in the various matters which were pending.    The relevance of this document was to demonstrate that all communication between Judge Makhubele and I were open, were transparent and there was no suggestion by either her or myself that we are communicating within a privileged space. In other words, we should not disclose our communications to any third parties, especially not bring it into the open public domain because it is between two counsel who communicate and attend, and may I add, a very, very serious attempt to settle all these matters. And I took it upon myself from the first day that we have communicated with each other, to share Chairperson, each and every WhatsApp, each and every email, each and every SMS to Mr Mathopo, to Mr Crouse and also to those um, who then formed of our team. Nothing was swept under the carpet.  Nothing was um, was... was kept in secrecy.  Everything was properly um, and transparently disclosed to those concerned.    It is page 45 Chairperson, SS17.    Page 45.    That is “see”.  Ja, that was... that is only to see to my response...[intervenes]     ...to the bar council.    That is where Judge Makhubele said to    Yes.    The WhatsApp Chair.    The WhatsApp Chairperson.    Mr Mogashoa.    Chairperson, quite correctly.  If you just turn the page to Annexure D on page 46?    That is the... the... the letter that was despatched to Mr Mogashoa by the Group Company Secretary of PRASA at the time.  Um, Chairperson, you will find that at the foot of page 48.  It was signed by Lindikaya Zide, Group Company Secretary on the 15t h of December 2017. I was copied in this document.  That is how I got hold of it.  And this is also the document that form part of when we had the four unopposed motions um, set down on the 9t h of March 2018 before uh, the Honourable Justice Holland-Muter. I took... I had this document in my possession and I     Chairperson, I got this – sorry, page 46, Chairperson, page 46.     Yes.  This document I have received electronically via email from Judge Makhubele.      Chairperson, it was either 15 December 17, it was either the same day or the day thereafter.  Just be mindful, the 16 t h was a public holiday.  I have every reason to believe I received it on the 15 t h.     Quite correct, Chairperson.     This was – these documents and my response were the only documents that I have provided the Bar Council with, quite correct, Chairperson.     Just before that, how our internal Bar affairs work, once there is a complaint, especially if it is a complaint from a judge or minister that is referred to, the Professional Ethical Committee, Chairperson, if it is a complaint against the senior member, what we normally do is we constitute a committee comprising of more than one senior member to investigate and to have regard to all the evidence, so to speak.  In this specific instance there was more than one silk who investigated it, I do not know who comprised of the entire committee but I was informed subsequently that the decision of that committee was unanimous in to make recommendation to the Bar Council because the subcommittee only make a recommendation to the Bar Council and the Bar Council can still decide whether it accepts that recommendation or not because the same papers serves before the Bar Council and that is what emanated in the letter of the 22 May 2020 that I was exonerated by the committee and by the Bar Council.     That is the last letter in this bundle, quite correct, that is page 62.     That is quite correct, Chairperson.     Correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, to put Mr Soni’s statement to me in perspective, that is what one of the complaints were that Judge Makhubele laid and that was the allegation.  May I just direct your attention to page 11 of the bundle and that is paragraph 10 of my response in which I verbatim clarified what Judge Makhubele said in paragraph 9.1, Chairperson, of her statement.  That was     Of course it will.     Common sense and logic dictate that.     Correct, Chairperson, as I have alluded to earlier, I was surprised that she was deployed as intern or Chairperson of PRASA’s interim board and I specifically asked her whether – what the reason was for that deployment because it is not ordinarily done in that fashion and she then confirmed to me that she was deployed by the former President so as to clean up the mess and to sort the mess out and what I understood, Chairperson, and she also said to me there was numerous litigation and matters that were outstanding and I got the impression she wanted to wrap all of it up and see which of the matters can she dispose of, which there is really no real disputes or there is no aspects which should go to trial. And the others, to streamline it so to make them trial ready or not.  That is the impression that I got.  But we have not discussed that.     Chairperson, you can accept it irrevocably and unconditionally, yes, that is how it transpired.     Right.     No, she used the words – I remember, recall the words, I was deployed by the President.     First of all, Mr Commissioner, I did not read Judge Makhubele’s affidavit, I confirmed unconditionally that she informed me that she was deployed or appointed as PRASA’s – as the Chairperson of PRASA’s interim board by the President, not by the minister.     That is what appears in paragraph 11 of my response to the Bar Council, yes.     Yes, I can, it was shortly before Christmas.  Mr Johan Crouse, who was one of the attorneys together with Mr Tshepo Mathopo.  They were also involved in a separate dispute, Chairperson, where Siyangena featured.  Senior counsel deals with that matter, I have got no idea what that matter consist of.  Judge Makhubele is hundred percent correct, during one of our conversations I mentioned to her that I spoke to Johan Crouse and he mentioned to me that the Siyangena matter – apparently, Mr Chairperson, I have not seen the papers or the documents, I think the quantum exceeds R1 billion.  They asked me – and in the light of the effective manner that we were able to settle Siyaya, I mean it was in the open public domain that this – there was not one shot fired and we settled it very, very easy, so to speak.   And Mr Johan Crouse did approach me and he said to me that the manner in which this matter with Siyaya was settled reached the ears of other litigants who have matters against PRASA.  It seems that you and Judge Makhubele is on the same – you are on the same line and you are singing from the same hymn book, what will your attitude or your response be if we engage you, Botes, in that other matter as well?  Surely it will also assist the parties to come to a settlement. And yes, I did mention it to her.  I said to her, Nana, I believe that there is also pending litigation between PRASA and Siyangena, what is happening there because I did not know what has happened there and her response was, that is a matter which is much more complicated than what we are dealing with, there is – that quantum is something else and we simply did not pursue it.     No, Chairperson, I did not send any letters, I saw that that was something that was mentioned.  If I did communicate, and that is my style, I communicate very often on WhatsApp and SMS for one reason, Chairperson, you have a paper trail.   And secondly, yes, I did communicate with Mr Mogashoa via email.  There was a lot of emails that was exchanged between us.  All explained – and the one email there and the reason being, Chairperson, one of the – there was a postponement of the arbitration and then a dispute ensued, who is liable for the costs occasioned by the postponement?  And Judge Brand did not want to hear submissions on it.   My proposal was that it should be cost in the arbitration. Mr Mogashoa’s client insisted that the liquidated company should pay the cost and that is actually where the correspondence ensued. I then sent Mr Mogashoa a very harsh-worded email and I said to him Madimpe but that is not what transpired, these are the facts and this is what transpired because he started communicating with me directly via email and all of that culminated and they filed heads, we filed heads of argument.  At the end Judge Brand said he could not – he cannot determine who is at fault and I think costs were – the award was each party to pay its own costs. So to answer your – the statement or what you put to me, Mr Soni, no, I did not initiate, I did not write letters it is not my function, my authority or my – I do not have locus standi to write letters.  Letters were exchanged between Mr Mathopo and there are various letters and also Mr Crouse.  I did not write letters, no.      Thank you very much, Chairperson. 
MR LOUBSER:   Nicholas Johannes Loubser.     No.     Yes.     So help me God.     Yes.     Yes.     Presently just two.     Sorry Chairperson, there’s currently – there’s only two Directors in the firm, myself and Mr van Wyk.     Sorry Chairperson, presently it’s only myself and Mr Robert van Wyk as Directors of the firm.     No, it’s not – following Mr van der Walt’s resignation and the sale of his shares, we changed the name to Loubser van Wyk as it is presently.     Mr van der Walt and I started a firm in 00 and about three years later Mr van Wyk joined us, first as an article clerk, then professional assistant and later became a Director.     Let me repeat that then.     Myself and…[intervenes].     We started a firm in 2000…[intervenes].     Myself and Mr van Der Walt started a firm, we were the only two Directors and about three/four years later Mr van Wyk joined us, first as a candidate attorney, then as a professional assistant and later on became a Director in the firm.     Sorry?     He left in June/July 2019.       That’s correct.     We – myself and Mr van Wyk became aware of newspaper reports that mentioned Mr van der Walt and his company, Precise Trade and Invest. There were certain allegations made against Precise Trade and Invest, never really, it involved the firm, the law firm and then in – I think it was in September/October 2015 there appeared certain newspaper articles which, once again, makes reference to the company Precise Trade and Invest and then mentions the – and his law firm. Mr van der Walt, Precise Trade and Invest and his law firm.  At that stage, Mr van der Walt at all times maintained that Precise Trade and Invest is his company it’s got nothing to do with anybody else but we were concerned that the law firm, even though the name was not mentioned specifically, but Mr van der Walt and his law firm by association our name is being tarnished and we were placed in a difficult situation.  At that stage we decided to call a meeting with – there was speculation, allegations in the newspapers and stuff which we don’t have personal knowledge of and we decided to have a meeting and explain to us exactly who is Precise Trade and Invest what properties they bought, he bought.  So, it was the first meeting we had and we addressed a letter to him, in writing, following that meeting which he responded to.     That’s correct.     Yes.     Yes.     He explained certain things to us and we said – we agreed that  we will pose these questions in writing to him to explain which we then drafted the letter which we addressed to him by myself and Mr van Wyk and asking to confirm in writing what he’d told us in a meeting or provide more clarification.     That’s correct, they didn’t mention the firm by name but…[intervenes].     Yes.     There appeared to be – he always maintained that Precise Trade and Invest, is the sole Director – ja sole shareholder and Director of the firm and he bought properties and we heard that he’s previously also involved in other property transactions but there was some allegation about his law firm and we wanted to know is there any truth in certain allegations made, explain to us who is Precise Trade and Invest and which properties did you acquire…[intervenes].     Yes, there was mention made of money paid by his law firm to somebody.     It was by association, we didn’t know anything specifically but because the law firm is mentioned  and there was mention made of monies paid by his law firm, we were concerned about, was there money involved through the firm.     Chairperson we were more concerned about monies that was paid through the law firm, because the rest was allegations in the newspaper with – we didn’t deal with that aspect we were more concerned about monies that was, somehow, through our law firm and it was not – the meeting was not a confrontational meeting it was, explain to us this, where – who’s Precise Trade and Invest, did these transactions flow through our firm, that was our concern.  Not the allegations that he had some wrong doing we were more concerned about the firm.     Yes we were – there was mention made of money that was paid by or from or from our law firm which we were not aware of, myself and Mr van Wyk were not aware of.     I see it as page 119.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Yes.     Yes we couldn’t find the original article it appeared, I think it was in the Rapport and City Press, we couldn’t find the article anywhere on the internet but we managed to find – Mr Ollerman asked me if I can refer to the article and this was – this seems to be a synopsis of what was said in the newspapers.     That’s correct.     Yes. ADV SONI     It says “Lawyer forks out R25million for Montana’s mansions”.     Yes, under the headline, “Lawyer forks out R25million for Montanan’s mansion”, it says News24.     “A lawyer of close ties to a company that  won large tenders from Passenger Rail Agency South Africa, when Lucky Montana was at its helm bought Montana two upscale properties worth almost R25million and paid for it in cash”.     Yes, it’s mentioned on the second page.     “The lawyer, Riaan van der Walt, from  Pretoria, strongly denies that his shelf company acted as a proxy for Montana”.      “Van der Walt’s law firm has in the past represented a company featured in a Public Protector ’s Madonsela’s recent report on PRASA following an irregular tender worth billions of Rands”.     Ja then it gets to a paragraph that starts – it says, “Vander Walt’s law firm paid a deposit of R5million towards the Sandhurst transaction and confirmed in a letter that the house new owner was Montana.  The purchase agreements for both properties were ultimately altered to reflect Precise Trade and Invest 02 as the legal owner, whilst Montana himself took possession of the property keys.  Montana said he wished not to comment, van der Walt maintained that his shelf company was, in no way, related to Montana or any other third party”.     My apologies, “Van der Walt’s shelf company, Precise Trade and Invest 02 paid R13.9million for a house in Sandhurst Johannesburg and R11million for a house in Waterkloof Pretoria, November 14 and February this year respectively.  Both properties were paid for in cash, however, early 2013 Montana himself signed a contract of sale to buy the house in Waterkloof.    In October 2014 he signed an offer to purchase the house in Sandhurst”.     “Van der Walt maintained his shelf  company was in no way related to Montana or any other third parties”.     Yes, “And a full report, Rapport and City Press”, It’s a bit – some of the page is a bit cut-off.     No, we did not raise the issue with Mr Montana…[intervenes].     Van Der Walt yes, we raised the issue with Mr van der Walt regarding this shelf company, Precise Trade and Invest…[intervenes].     We raised the question of the company Precise Trade and Invest, we wanted to know more details of that.     Just enquiring, who’s this Precise Trade and Invest because it was not known to us.     I can honestly not recall the exact nature but it was brief and it was agreed that we will – base our concerns in writing and give him an opportunity to respond.     Sorry I don’t understand your question.     Yes, that’s right.     Yes, that’s right Chairperson.     No there was not concerns about the real facts we just wanted to – we were – at that stage we were three Directors and there was two other attorneys involved in it and we all run our own departments and each of us had a couple of hundred piles that we deal with and I don’t really know what Mr van der Wyk deals with or one of my PA’s deals with or what Mr van der Walt deals with.  So, it was not a thing of accusations we wanted to – who is Precise Trade and Invest and exactly how – it was more an enquiry than saying there was something untoward.     No that’s fine I’m happy…[intervenes].     Yes, obviously I will just want insight into to confirm whether it is a correct reflection of the record.     Ja.     In the first paragraph we refer to the meeting…[intervenes].    The first paragraph referred to a meeting and just introductions or requests.  Second paragraph is physically asked him to confirm which immovable properties are currently registered in the company Precise Trade and Invest.  And then ask him if there is any properties registered in her name, provide us with exact details of the property.  Copies of the purchase agreements and how and when the purchase price was paid for the properties so acquired.   We continued to ask him whether the – if there was money paid by Precise Trade and Invest was that money that it flow through our trust account and if the money was through our trust account specify who paid money into the trust account and to whom those monies was paid because they are going to ask him to confirm who the current shareholders were in Precise Trade an Invest.  And then on page 120 there was a general question about a statement from I think it was a Mr – from the reporter.    Myburgh.    I do not know if should I repeat that – the statement which was made by the reporter.  The reporter – maybe just – reporter basically stated that Mr Van Der Walt visited Mr Mario Ferreira at the offices of TMM Holdings frequently through 2014 sometimes twice a week.  These    That is correct.    He responded to that.    And on page 121.    That is correct.    That is correct.    He personally indicated he listed paragraph 1 and paragraphs 1.1 to 1.5 of the letter he listed the properties that was currently registered in the company Precise Trade and Invest.   He then attached copies of the purchase agreements which we requested him to do so and he attached a bank account – a bank statement reflecting the monies received.  Well it is bank account statement from Precise Trade and Invest indicating which monies was paid into that account and also paid.  That is at paragraph 3.  At paragraph 4 he say that that money paid into Precise Trade and Invest account was paid by three entities.  One entity namely TMM and then two other persons, America Pimentel and Mark Clancy.   Then to that he attached certain agreements between himself personally and TMM himself personally and Pimentel self personally and Mark Clancy.  He attached those agreements to that to explain why the money was paid into Precise Trade an Invests account.   Then in the second paragraph he confirmed that he is the sole director and shareholder in Precise Trade and Invest.  The following paragraph he confirmed that over a period of eight years at various occasions and at various times sometimes as early as six o’clock in the morning and after hours he consulted together with advocates, with TMM, ESS, TMM Rental and Siyangena Technologies.    Then – ja he continues he mentions a number of names of persons that he consulted with.    Okay, right I will do so.  He mentions then Ronel Wardalg, Karel Sanchez, Ray Ferreira, Mario Ferreira, Sheila Dos Santos, Tom Dubek, Alwin Wilsnach, Mannie Marx, Martino Marx, Anton Verster, Jacques Verster, Jacques Van Jaarsveld etcetera. On different occasions over a period of eight years consulted by Loubser Van Der Walt. Due to the fact that Loubser Van Der Walt through Tanya Kruger and Dina Boshoff were responsible for various conveyancing transactions for TMM Rental.  They were the conveyancers of – for TMM Rental.  Further various allegation matters were dealt with by Loubser Van Der Walt and documentations was delivered to TMM Group or delivered to them through the offices.    It seems to be because of the requests is also all together it formalised that my request is in writing and your responded in writing as per habit almost you draft a legal document which you do and provide it exact clarity.    I do not – I do not know what he…    What he perceived.    Perceived my request were meant to be.    That is correct.    Yes they were a client of ours which we have – is a – is a – I think it is TMM group and which I understood Mr Mario Ferreira to have been the head of that TMM group and existed.  He had – Mr Ferreira had different entities but we did work for all of them.  Any – any – the contact person where he worked was always a Mr Mario Ferreira.  We had a relationship with Mr Van Der Walt so any work that Mr Ferreira had either personally or through one of his entities Mr Van Der Walt was the attorney that dealt with all those transactions.  So I do not know all these entities.  The only one I knew is TMM Rentals because we – there is some of the properties that they sold we were responsible for the transfer of those properties and also collect rentals, arrear rentals if they had tenants which did not pay.    All these properties mentioned?    I – I am not sure but I am – I believe so.    No I believe so.    I was not personally involved in it but from what later came to hand it appears that we were in some of them we were the conveyancers.    We were the conveyancers yes.    Yes I am.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I – I do not know.  There is TMM Rental and I do not know exactly how the TMM Group was structured who was all.  I will – yes – I know – what I know is a company ESS I know Engineering Systems Solutions we did work for them as well and I know Mr Ferreira was also – I do not know if he was the head of that but I know he has an involvement in a company called ESS or I know the company SAU that knew them.      Siyangena I did not know at that stage personally I did not know who Siyangena was or how they were involved with Mario Ferreira.  I did not know that at that stage so…    Subsequently it appears that he was also involved somehow as a director or a shareholder of Siyangena.    I cannot say for certain.  Through the media and through time I cannot put a specific date on that.  It is difficult to know.  I still do not know hundred percent sure whether Mr Ferreira was involved in that company Siyangena but through reports it just came to my attention but I know company docket or documents or anything can confirm that but I assume through what I have heard read that he was involved in – somehow involved in that company Siyangena and …    Mr Tom Dubek I also knew him as the – was the – I think he was the accountant for the – for TMM.  That is how I know – I have met him, Tom Dubek and I – I was made to know that he was involved with TMM.  I think he was the accountant, general accountant.    I did not know – I knew him as the – as the – he could have been the CFO of TMM but I did not know that he was CFO of Siyangena.  I – all I knew that he was the CFO or accountant for TMM.    He said that he consulted with them over a period of eight years due to the fact that Loubser Van Der Walt through Tanya Kruger she was a conveyancer [indistinct    Yes.    It is an offer to purchase entered into by Mr Montana and Precise Trade Invest for the purchase of a property described as Erf 359 Portion 0 Township Parkwood for a purchase price of R6.8 million.    10 Newport Road, Parkwood, Johannesburg.    I am just going to refer to the documents so that we can identify Mr Van Der Walt as the source of the documents, what they mean and their role in the picture we are trying to paint will be presented when those transactions are dealt with.    It is headed Addendum to Offer to Purchase entered into between Sipho Lucky Montana and Precise Trade Invest and on the second page it continues.    It is an addendum to an offer to purchase.    I just want to refer back to the previous one because in the addendum it says addendum to an offer to purchase the 5 May and if I refer back to the previous document it seems to be an amendment to the Parkwood sale – property.    Yes it is an addendum to the real one.    But that is what it says.    I cannot comment on that I do not know why they – there was a subsequent addendum.  I was not a party to the agreement and I do know how – why they put it in that way.    It was in May 2014.    The addendum.    June – the addendum is June.    Ja May almost six weeks later yes.    No.    The effect of the amendment is to say that before I take the property, I am going to reduce the amount I am going to give you because this – these are the improvements you are going to make.    At page 148.  That purports to be yes.    That is correct.    This is the Sandhurst property.    That is correct.    Yes it appears so.    This is the Waterkloof property Chairperson.    Yes I do have it in front of me.    Yes in his response he said he – Precise Trade Invest was funded by certain investors.    He mentioned GMM, Pimentel and Clancy.    Yes.    Pimentel yes.    That is correct.    Okay.    I see that, yes.    Can I...    The 3r d of...    Ja, the handwriting is...    So, let... let us assume.    November ...[indistinct] fourteen.    Okay.      Uh, the secretary.  Ja.    At our firm, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    3 November 2014.    Uh, Carlitz.  It seems to be Carlitz.    I think that... that is... she is actually a receptionist, Vivienne Carlitz in our firm.     Yes.    It appears to be a memorandum of agreement entered into between TMM Holdings.  Mr Mario Ferreira and Mr Jan Adriaan van der Walt.      Um, term of agreement uh...[intervenes]     Uh...[intervenes]     Yes.  From here, it is a... it is entered by MJA Ferreira.      Uh, yes.  Mario Ferreira.    Yes, it is an agreement between three parties, TMM, Ferreira and Van der Walt personally.    It provides in page... paragraph 1.1 of the agreement.    Yes.    That is what it appears from the agreement, yes.    “The parties agreed that this agreement will be applicable for all local and international investments”.    It is signed by TMM on the 14t h of March by Mr Ferreira.  Also, on a form... uh, ja, the 14 t h of March.  The handwriting is not clear.  The 14t h of March 2012 it appears.    Ja, all... all of them it appears.    Uh, yes.    That is also a secretary at our firm.    Oh, a previous... a previous secretary.  Sorry.  Connie Steiger.    Connie... I think it is... Connie Ferreira Steiger.    Unrelated.    She is no longer with the firm.    It appears to be an addendum to a previous agreement.  It does not specify which ...[intervenes]     Oh, it appears to be an addendum to the previous agreement.  It does not really specify which agreement but it seems to be an addendum to a previous agreement.    Uh...[intervenes]     No uh...[intervenes]     In... either those...[intervenes]     It is... it is starting ...[intervenes]     It appears so.    Uh, I know there was a development with Mr Van der Walt with involved in his personal capacity with uh, Mr Ferreira.  I do not know if he was a shareholder or how he was involved but I knew about a development that... that appears with that.  I knew they... they were somehow involved.  How...    Also, a director of this Venice Village or... I do not know.  But I knew... I have heard in the passing mentioned that Venice Village.    Uh, the parties specifically agree that Van der Walt will be entitled to receive 5% referral commission on each and every unit sold of this development to third parties.    The second part.  It is a heading, Ponton(?)    The parties agree that on date of repayment and fulfilment of the loan agreement of Ponton, Van der Walt will receive a referral commission of 17%.  And the third one relates to... its heading, Wetlands Country Retreat.   The parties agree that Van der Walt facilitated the purchase of the shares through Triple Trade and Invest and Van der Walt will be entitled to refer.... receive a referral commission.   Uh, it sets out sale of game.  He is entitled 30% of the nett profit.  He is also entitled to 10% or... that is after the business plan is been approved, the parties will agree to either convert the referral commission received by Van der Walt into 10% shares into Triple Trade and Invest.    Yes.    Uh, it reports payment that is being received by Van der Walt in terms of the... I assume the agreement which he lists dates and amounts which totals R 4 50 402,69.      No, he did not.    No.    He... uh, Mr Van der Walt um, has always been an investor in different companies.    He was always uh... always uh... it was not strange because he entered into agreements with various parties, friends and to develop properties.   But when he showed me this um, he explained it, this is work which he had done early in the mornings, after hours, over weekends, something... an agreement he entered on its own with uh, with ...[indistinct]  MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION    Indeed he did.    He did on his own...[intervenes]     Yes.    He was not... he never specifically disclosed it to me but I did not take issue with it, the fact that he earned money which I knew.  He was working late at night ...[intervenes]     ...with other people involved.     Yes.  So, Mr Chairperson, my assumptions were mine, I accept that.     “You made certain notes on the bank  statement, TMM loan and TMM agreement.  Kindly distinguish between the two.”     He says …[intervenes]     What I understood from his explanation is TMM loan, so loan that he received from TMM, personal loan or a loan between Precise Trade and TMM.  It is loan that he received from – money from and the TMM agreement, I assumed was the agreement where TMM had to pay certain commissions or work he had done personally.     Yes, I asked if he is aware of any investigation by SAPD or any other instance which – ja.     He said -  I translate    At paragraph 19, page 201.     In response to my question if he is aware any investigation by SAPD or any other instances, he responded, he said he is not aware of any investigation of whatever nature by any instance against him personally or against Precise Trade and Invest.     It is the second 10.     The second 10.     Then I asked whether Mr Montana is in any – enigsins, any – involved to the entity.     Ja, maybe to rephrase, I asked whether Mr Montana is in any way involved to the entity Precise Trade and Invest and if so, the nature of his involvement.  And also asked him were there were at any stage payments made to him out of that Precise Trade and Invest account except for the purchase of the property and he responded to that.       Yes, I am the sole – I am hundred percent shareholder in Precise Trade and Invest and the sole director.  No final agreement could be finalized between Precise Trade and Invest and Mr Montana due to various reasons but specifically the way how to deal with property transactions and investments as well as Montana’s shortage of funds. There was negotiations with – regarding a possible joint venture in various properties but the parties decided not to proceed with the joint venture.  I confirm that all five the properties belong to Precise Trade and Invest. And then, as the second part of my question, whether any payments was made by Precise Trade and Invest to Montana other than the purchase price, he says a loan of R1.3 million was granted to Mr Montana which are clearly set out in a loan agreement.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Sorry, you are looking at page?     191 deals with November – sorry, 191, my apologies.  There he says …[intervenes]     Yes, I see that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Erf 359, Parkwood.     I can – I do not – I am not here at all to try and explain what Mr van der Walt did [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     But all I can point out is, in his answer at page 202 he said a loan was granted to Montana on the 20 February 2015 which is clearly set out in a loan agreement.  Unfortunately, loan agreement was not annexed to it but a reading of that does not necessarily mean the R1.3 million was paid on the 20 February, it could have been the agreement was made – done on the 20 February 2015 but to be paid in March of April.  I am not saying that.     Is there is – there appears to be …[intervenes]     No, not at all.     Not at all, I more than willing to answer any questions, if I understand the question …[intervenes].     No, fine.     No, no, definitely no …[intervenes]     I mean, if for clarity sake Mr Soni can put the question to me again, I might…     Yes.     I agree, it does not appear, thanks.     That is correct.     Yes.     No, I do not.     What he answered.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Not at all, no.     No.     Yes.     Yes.     No.  In his response he just said that that was part of the purchase price.     He says that R2.250 000, it is part of the purchase price.     We never held it in our trust account.     We did the whole …[intervenes]     I do not know the exact dates but I do not – we…     There was never an amount of R5 million deposited into the firm’s trust account.     By …[intervenes]     Not in the firm’s trust account.     No.     Let me …[intervenes]     It is a letter from Loubser Van der Walt Incorporated to Pam Golding Property.     With a heading T L Montana transaction. “Referring to our conversation…” It is dated the 8 November 2014, wherein the signatory, Mr     I am not aware of R5 million that was paid into our firm’s trust account, but it refers here to investment – Investec account.     It says    There would not have been a – no, I cannot say for sure, but I can check whether we received an amount from whoever into our trust account.     So this letter is dated the 6 t h or the 8 November.     Next week.     By next week Friday at the latest.     Yes, Mr Soni just exactly what the …[intervenes]     That could be, that is why I looked at the dates.  But as Mr van der Walt previously indicated all these amounts was paid into Precise Trade and Invest directly, not through Loubser Van der Walt’s trust account.     Been deposited directly.  So it could be that he meant – no, I do not want to speculate what he meant.     He received R5 million in Precise Trade and Invest.     But that money was – R5 million was never paid into our normal trust account.     It says that it is held in our trust investment account.  But that trust investment account is the one of Precise Trade and Invest.     Yes.     Yes, the …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     No, those accounts were – actually were property transactions where the purchaser bought the property and he did not require a guarantee …[intervenes]     Yes.     I do not know.     No.     Yes.     8 November.     It is very…     Illegible, it could be either a 6 or 8, it is a zero …[intervenes]     Yes.     You can just phrase it like that and I will do a supplementary affidavit. 
NICHOLAS JOHANNES LOUBSER:  (d.s.s.) 
ADV SONIC SC:   Yes. 
 MR LOUBSER:  Investors.     There was – ja because that was in the media report, there was still also mention of a R5 million but there was never money in our trust account, Loubser Van der Walt, the firm’s trust account of R5 million. 
MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION:  [00
MR SONI SC:   So can I then come back to page 197 and the last three questions you asked there and your question at paragraph 9 seems to suggest that you are right that the handwritten inscription would have been entered into before it was given to you because you then ask what does TMM loan and TMM agreement mean, is that correct?     And then you ask him about other payments and then you ask him a question about Mr Montana.  I would like to deal with each of those matters please.  So your question at paragraph 9 on page 197 is what?     And what is his answer?       It appears at page 201, paragraph 18, Chairperson.     Right and then paragraph 10 you ask him if he was aware of the investigation.     And what was his answer?     Page 201, Chairperson, the answer.     Yes.     At paragraph 10, yes.     And what was his answer?     And then paragraph 10 at page 197, what was the question?     Sorry, the second 10, yes.     Yes.     That is at page 202, paragraph 20, out paragraph 10.2, is that correct?     So I just want to go back to that last issue, Mr Loubser, did you understand that to mean that the loan had been made through the Precise Trade account?     Can I then ask you to look at the account – the bank account of Precise Trade which, as we have already indicated, starts at page 90 and goes up to page 193.     So perhaps I should just deal with the last point because it is fresh in everybody’s mind.  He says that a loan was made to Mr Montana of R1,3 million on the 20 February 2015.     Okay.  May I just ask, if one looks at the bank account itself, I have looked for it but I have not seen such an amount being debited to the account.  So if you look at page 194.     That is the February transactions.     Can you see – and I am asking because I have looked for it, to tally.     Page 194.  Sorry, 191.       If you look from the bottom you will see the last entry is made on the 28 February.     And if you went up you will see there is an entry on the 20 February but that is for R2 million.     But there is no indication that on 20 February R1,3 million was given to Mr Montana.     And you will see it is in relation to – if you look at page 191, the account reflects that that was in respect of the Parkwood property.     Yes.  Mr Loubser, it is not my intention to suggest that there is something wrong here, I am just saying there is a bit of a disjuncture between what Mr van der Walt said in his response and that the bank account reflects.  I am just trying to point that out through you.     No, no, I am not asking, I am just pointing it out.     Chairperson, all I have a duty to do is, the witness is presented documents to say in respect of the documents that he is presenting – and I know [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     So, Mr Loubser, this is my difficulty, we are trying to work out where the monies reflected in the bank account went to and tally it with the explanation given to Mr van der Walt – I mean, by Mr van der Walt to you.  Now he says, when you ask him specifically about Mr Montana, he says we gave – I gave must Montana a loan of R1,3 million.     Now I am – and I would have expected that there would be an entry that reflects a debit of R1,3 million around that period.  Now I was I just pointing out it does not appear to be so.     So that is…     And there is no reflection of a payment to Montana during that period – can I just point this out again and again so that we have it on record, he makes, for example, on the 18 July at page 190 – you will see he talks about the Montana payment.  On the 18 July again, he talks about another Montana payment and then on 24 July he talks about TLM and that I understand is Tshepo Lucky Montana.  That is Mr Montana. So those three I could relate to Mr Montana and that was the only purpose of my question.     No, not TMM, Chairperson.     On the 24  – at page 190, on the 24 July 14 there is an amount – a payment of R400 000 and you will see in the bank statement it is said the reference is TLM.     That is right.     TLM.     So I am merely pointing out that where there appears to be a reference to Mr Montana it coincides with what Mr van der Walt gives in his breakdown. Now can I just ask you, Mr Loubser, because if you are not aware of this, all we can ask you to do is to confirm that all these documents were given to you with these handwritten inscriptions there and knowing Mr van der Walt’s handwriting you say that that handwriting is his handwriting.     I just – if I could ask one final question because it is quite relevant to this.  If you look at the very first entry in the bank account or the transaction history we were given, it is on the 18 June 2014, am I correct?     And that is a deposit of R1,85 million, is that correct?     The second entry is on the same date, the 18 June 2014 and there is a deposit of R400 million – sorry, R4 million.     Right.  And to that Mr van der Walt says is the TMM loan, as he describes it.     Then immediately after that there is a payment on the very same day of R2,25 million.     And that is said to be in regard to Precise.     To Precise as reflected in …[intervenes]     No, no, no.  Next to – under the date 18/06/2014 it says withdrawal and in the line immediately under that the bank write Precise Riaan(?) loan.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     Oh, yes.  No, no, you are quite right, Chairperson.  I was not looking – because that is next to the figure 2,25 million.     Yes.     It has significance, Chairperson, because this is the first payment made in respect of Parkwood property.     Sorry, it is the first payment made in respect of Parkwood property.     Van der Walt.     What I understand, when one looks at the whole picture, the Parkwood agreement between Mr Montana and Precise Trade is to this effect that there will be a payment, a down payment of R2,5 million and they also say that that can be paid in respect of the bond outstanding on Mr Montana’s property that he is occupying in Waterkloof at that time.   So just – the inference is that that was the payment made to finalize that bond.     Chairperson, may I – I just want to complete the picture because this was not only conjecture.  If I can ask you to look at page 198, with respect, Chairperson?     Page 198.     Chairperson, you will see at the middle of the page is the start of paragraph 2.2 talking about the purchase price of R6,8 million.     This is his dealing with the answer to this Parkwood Property and you will see on the 18 June that is the payment.     That is made in respect of …[intervenes]     And I put – because I have read the terms of the agreement, the purchase of the Parkwood property by Mr van der Walt, the clause reads in terms of a deposit of R2,5 million will be paid and he says but this can be paid in respect of the bond on Mr Montana’s property in Waterkloof.     Yes.     You will recall, Chairperson, yesterday when Ms Ngoye was giving evidence she talked about the R900 million guarantee.     That they were required to pay.     And that which they saw for the first time.     When the interdict applications were done.      No, Siyangena.     Yes.     Mr Chairperson, in view of the fact that Mr Loubser does not know any more about these, it would be unfair to ask him to speculate and one is just going to get the correct answers, well, I cannot tell, this is what was said to me.  And it may just be better to confirm that all of this is what was said to him and then for us to draw our own inferences when one puts the whole picture together.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, sure.     Yes, 5 million, yes.     Yes, I …[intervenes]     Yes.  I know we made a point of it in …[intervenes]     Yes.  Chairperson, this is a document that appears somewhere in another file.     Can I show it to Mr Loubser?     And then I will address you on where we will find it.     And when it will come for you.     Yes.     Yes.     No, I …[intervenes]     Yes, yes, we will make another copy, Chairperson.     Yes.     Can I, Chairperson, because it may well be an important issue, if one looks at page 193 – is it 191?  Sorry.     Of the papers and that is the – sorry, page 190 of the papers, the date of that is the 6 November, the date of the letter where Mr van der Walt confirms that that is the amount.  If one looks at page 190 and looks at the entry in the bank statement on the 6 November 2014 you will see a deposit of R5 million from Mr Pimentel.       190.     6 November 2014.    And you will see that that is a deposit of R5 million.     Mr Loubser?     The 6 t h.  It is dated the 6 t h, Chairperson.     The 6 November.     Yes.     No.     May I, while you are there, Chairperson, refer you to the very next entry on the bank account.  The 6 November is a deposit from Mr. Pimentel of R5 million and then on the 7 November in the bank account the very next entry is a payment of R5 million to Pam Golding 199 Empire Place, which is the Sandhurst Property, which is what that letter refers to.     No, no, Sandhurst.     Yes.     Because that is the letter addressed to Pam Golding who sold the Sandhurst property.     That is right.     The bank account doesn’t but Mr van der Walt’s inscription says it was by Mr Plimenthal, you will see the name Plimenthal next to that five million.     I am.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Green.     Yes.     Thank you very much.     I will just leave this here.     Chairperson, our next witness is going to be Ms Karin de Beer.       No.  No.     No, she just needs …[intervenes]     As you please, Chairperson.  Ms de Beer, firstly, let me thank you for coming all the way from Cape Town.  I know you do live in Pretoria but you shortened your trip in Cape Town and we are very, very grateful to you.  Ms de Beer, you have a statement in front of you that starts at page 49 of bundle G and ends at page 50, is that correct?     Now you have read this statement.     Recently as well.     Do you confirm that what is contained in this statement is true and correct?     As you please, Chairperson.      Now to the extent that you want to refer to your statement please feel free to do so but in my short conversation with you, as I understand it, you have quite a good recollection of what happened during this period.     Yes.     On our version it would be the Waterkloof property.     Sorry, can I just stop you and just, Chairperson, because there are documents that are available.  Can I ask you to look at page 52 to page 59?     As you please.     Yes, Chair, but we have the full picture.     And I just want to fill in the documents.     Ms de Beer, can I ask you, if you turn to page 52, up to page 59.     This is an offer – a deed of members – a sale of members’ interest.  Is this the first agreement that you entered into with Mr Montana?     And if you look at page 59 you will see that it is dated the 10 February 2013.     That is when you signed.     And then if you look at the purchase price, purchase price was R10,5 million.     Yes.     Then if you turn to page 65.     You will see that that is the agreement you concluded with Mr Johan Smith as a trustee of the Minor(?) Property Trust, page 65.     Do you see that is the Memorandum of Agreement yourself …[intervenes]     Yes.     Just to put it in perspective, at page 70 will see that the agreement with Mr Smith was signed on the 25 August 2014, if you look at page 70.     70, yes, the handwritten 70.     But what eventually happened and that is what the Chairperson was pointing out, that if you look at page 71, this is the Deed of Transfer, the property was in fact transferred to – from Amani Guesthouse CC to Precise Trade and Invest CC.     So that is what the Chairperson has been saying.     So we had three sets of owners, if I can put that way.     Ms de Beer, you said something as you started this part of your evidence, you said there was a controversy among them.     Who is the them?     Eventually the property was transferred to Precise Trade as you had agreed.     And the price was 11 million – at the price of R11 million.     Well, if you look at page 73 at the bottom.     You will see and the purchase price to be the sum of R11 million.  The very last two lines of …[intervenes]     And you were not going to give [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes.  Now we have the – and I am just trying to understand because you said something quite significant at the end of your affidavit, that Montana coming and saying on several occasions I want to buy this property.     But then he says, as you say, there is a controversy in whose name should the property be registered.     No, no, I understand.     But there …[intervenes]     But just in regard to the point because this obviously was a matter of some significance to you.   In your affidavit, which you made in September 15, on the 21 September 2015, if you look at page 50, you make a point about who the purchaser really was and can I ask you to please read what you say at paragraph 8 of that affidavit into the record?     Page 50, Chairperson.     Yes.     Paragraph that starts despite …[intervenes]     Now when you handed the keys over, to whom did you hand the keys over?     This is the day after or a day or two after you left the property?     And you are a developer, was it a major – I mean, was it a major renovation that he effected?     Then if you look at the next page, page 77, you will see that is a further email from yourself, but this is addressed to Karen Mitchell.     Oh sorry, page 77 Chair I think, it is the very next page.      It is identical.      But what you say in your affidavit, and I am just asking if that is now your recollection as well, you want to make it public that you want them to embrace Mr Montana?       Never, never.       Yes Mr Montana I met several times.       On the last contract, on the first contract never.       And to your knowledge did Mr van der Walt ever visit the house, in the way that Mr Montana said don’t worry about painting and ...[intervenes]        And Mr Johan Smit?       So Mr Montana is the only one that you spoke to amongst the different ...[intervenes]       Chairperson I have no further questions.     Thank you again from us Ms de Beer. 
MR GREEN:   It does not appear.     Louis Green.     No I don’t.     Yes, I do.     So help me God.     At the moment I am a practicing Estate Agent.    In 2014 I was an Estate Agent as well.      I was with Pam Golding in the Hyde Park office.     Yes it does.     I sold two properties to Mr Montana.     I sold two properties to Mr Montana.     That’s correct.     I’m going to have to refer…[intervenes].     It was during 2014/2015 …[intervenes].     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Yes I was on show and Mr Montana came to the show day, this was – I’m recalling the first time I met Mr Montana, he came to the show day, it was just before the closing of the show day and he asked if he could just run through the house quickly …[intervenes].     This was the…[intervenes].     No, this was the Hurlingham house.     That’s where I first met him.     He ran through the house and said that he was interested in the property, he was looking to develop and it would be of interest to him.  I had another property in Sandhurst which was in Empire Place, which is the first property that he purchased, that property I invited him to come and view the property at one of my show days which he came to visit.     He certainly showed interest in the property and said that he would like to proceed with the purchase of the property, it was a very good deal as well and he recognised that.     Yes, he did make an offer.     That property, prior to me getting the mandate, I think was at around R18million with the previous agency.  I sold the property, I think it was R13.9million.     To Mr Montana.     That’s correct.     I think it was around about the R15million.     And the circumstances around the sale were that the owner had already purchased and renovated a new house for his family.     So, you know, there was definite opportunity.      Ja he needed – you know we managed to put a deal together.     Yes, I don’t recall if it was that Mr Montana offered R13million and the owner came back with R15million, you know whether it was – the bottom line is, it was settled at R13.9million.  So I don’t recall the exact circumstance as to how we arrived at the R13.9million.     Yes, there was a deposit paid.     The deposit was R5million.     Yes.     Yes, the offer was made by him.     No, it was by him.     Yes, it was Kholer.     Yes.     Yes, the deposit would only have been paid once the sale agreement was agreed. So the offer to purchase, once it’s signed by all parties, becomes the sale agreement. Once the sale agreement is ready, the deposit will be paid.     That’s correct.     R5million.     That’s the deposit that was paid.     That’s correct yes.     Ja I don’t recall the exact events, other than, I was asked to please speak to the seller to see if they could change – so in effect, cancel the first agreement and substitute that agreement with a new agreement with Precise.     So, it wasn’t an issue where the property was transferred or that any of the process had already started, the only thing that had happened was the deposit had been paid and in this substitute agreement – so I would never allow an agreement to be cancelled, the agreement would need to be substituted.  So, there would need to be a new agreement and once that agreement is received then the other agreement is cancelled and I make reference in the – on page 94 that the deposit in 2.1 was received on the 7 t h of November 2014.  So, the deposit had already been received on the fist sale agreement.     That is correct, this is the final sale agreement.     Should I read that?     I must read the whole affidavit?     “I the undersigned, Louis Green, ID number 5905125119086…[intervenes].     Okay, “On or about mid 2014, I was instructed by Mr Kholer to market and sell a property known as portion 18 of Erf 1 Sandhurst Gauteng, situated at 119 Empire Place, Sandhurst, Johannesburg.  As a result, thereof I placed the property on show a number of times and on or about the 26 t h of October a gentleman, now known to me as Mr Lucky Montana, visited the show day and expressed interest in buying the property.  Either that day or the next day, I cannot now remember, Montana signed an offer to purchase for the property in the amount of R13.9million.  I cannot now recall where the offer was signed as I do many offers, it may have been signed on the show day.  The offer was accepted by the seller on the 28 t h of October 2014.  I was subsequently contacted by a certain Mr Adriaan Riaan van der Walt by email on 24/11/05, the email contained a letter…[intervenes]?.     Yes 2014, “From Loubser van der Walt Incorporated Attorneys confirming that they had R5million in a Trust account with Investec Bank.  A true copy of the email, the attorney’s letter and the offer to purchase signed by Montana is attached hereto, marked as Annexure LG1…[intervenes].     No all of the – I was completely locked out of everything, so all my email was deleted, all my diary was deleted and I have no access to any documentation.     But these documents were a part of the affidavit at the time of signing the affidavit which was done at the Werksmans offices in Sandton.   “On the 7 t h of October 2014 I received an email from an der Walt with proof of payment in the amount of R5million into Pam Golding’s Trust account for and on behalf of Lucky Montana, I attach a true copy of that email as Annexure LGG.  On the 25 t h of November I received a further facsimile from van der Walt with a letter attached, marked as urgent, the effect of the letter, as will be seen, was to change the buyer from Lucky Montana to a company called Precise Trade and Invest 02 Pty Ltd.  I then sent a fresh offer to purchase to van der Walt in the name of Precise Trade and Invest Pty Ltd which was immediately signed by van der Walt and returned to me.  Note that at clause 1.5 I wrote the expression, the deposit 2.1 was received on 7 t h November 2014.  The effect of this is that the deposit paid for Lucky Montana was not being held – was now being – sorry was not being held, I think that should be now, for Precise Trade and Invest Ltd.  A true copy of the relevant emails and new offer to purchase is attached hereto, marked Annexure LG3.  The conveyancing was carried out by Snyman’s Incorporated; the Fourways office and the property was transferred on the 6 t h of August 15. Within a few days of transfer, I went to the property and met with Riaan van der Walt, he was on his own and to the best of my memory this was the first time that I had seen him I walked him through the property and handed him the keys.  There is one more document I want to attach from my file, I do not know when I got it but it is a copy of the bank guarantee for the payment of the remaining R8.9million from Invested.  I attach a true copy of this as Annexure LG4”.      This is all relating to Sandhurst yes.  Coincidentally I was also the selling agent on another property that was purchased by Lucky Montana, this is the property located in Hurlingham on 12 Montrose Road, and known as the remaining extent of Erf 70 Hurlingham.  The Seller was Mrs Gavisser and Montana bought it from her with myself as the agent.  The conveyancing was done by Janine Bredekamp in Parkview.  I distinctly recall Janine Bredekamp calling me one day and saying that Mr Montana had contacted her and requested her to change the buyer from himself to another entity.  I do not now recall what that entity was but she refused to go along with it as she wanted to finalise the transaction.  That transfer went through on the 28 t h of July 2015.  I attach a copy of the Title Deeds hereto as Annexure LG5 and as far as the seller of that property is still in occupation and paying occupational rent.  Prior to me signing this statement, I have carefully read through it and am satisfied that the facts are correctly and accurately recorded, the following questions were put to me, in person by the Commissioner of Oath and I entered the answers in my own handwriting.    Do you know and understand the contents?  Yes.  Do you have any other documents?    Thank you.    Yes and it was on documents that were presented to me.    The initial investigation was done by I think Paul O’Sullivan.    Sorry?    By Paul O’Sullivan the investigator.    Ja and – so that was we initially made contact with and provided me with documentation and you know the documentation never came from me but it was provided to me by O’Sullivan.    I have been an estate agent I think for 15/16/17 years.    Yes.    Well the first sale as the documents reflect was to Lucky Montana and the property eventually transferred to the company not to Lucky.    Yes I did.    I think I did yes.    Well I – I did see a document where after the transfer I had spoken – I had sent out an email where I have copied – it was in respect to the pool cover.    Where I have copied Montana in on the email that I sent to Van Der Walt, to Precise and he was quite irate and upset at the fact that I have copied Montana in on the email.  So yes I had.   I do not think I – I – there would have been no reason to continue.  I mean my communication going forward and this was up until 2017 was all with Van Der Walt.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja there was a deal.  The deposit was paid.    Correct.    No I do not – I do not recall I do not believe so.    Because Mr Van Der Walt was in my mind the attorney.  So if you look you will see that it was the attorney’s letter that I received.    Saying that the deposit – he is holding the deposit in trust.    And you know the fact that the attorney was also – I did not even know who the directors of Precise Trading were.    At that point in time it was you know.    Ja.    I might very well have.    But I cannot…    With conviction and any recollection.    Or accuracy.    Make a statement that …    You know I do not recall.    But I honestly cannot without any recollection make a statement like that.    Well it is not something I can do unilaterally.    Yes.    Secured himself.    I would agree with you 100%.    Perhaps I can say that it – I definitely would have confirmed that.    But I do not know if it was me confirming or before it happening me receiving a phone call.    To say this is what is going to happen.    But 100% it would have been done.    There would have been something.    I would never do it.    Well I think my obligation knowing that I am holding in our trust account R5 million which at this point in time belongs to Mr Montana.  I would need the confirmation from him.  There might very well have been a written confirmation as well. I just do not have access to the documentation.    Never, no.    I – it would be against practice.    You know it is not something – I cannot just sign Mr Montana’s deposit to someone else.    Without…    Yes.    I think it is the 10 May.    Yes I do see it.    That is correct.    That is correct.     “Hi Riaan hope you are well.  I received a call from the Kohlers that they have found an extra two sets of keys for the electric pool cover.  The keys are in my possession.  When would you be able to meet or should I keep them until you are around the area?”    Yes I did.      I think this is after.    It is after the transfer of the property.    You know they have – he has already got occupation.    Yes.    If I have mentioned this.    No I have – I have no idea why I copied him but he has certainly been copied and I spoke of the follow up email that I received asking me why I had copied Montana.    Hi Louis, so this is an email from Riaan Van Der Walt sent to myself copying Lucky Montana on the 10    Okay yes yes.    That is what …    Precise.    Well how could I possibly know that even before he bought it that Mr Montana had nothing to do with it.  Mr Montana was my purchaser.    Ja I think I would not read too much into it being that Afrikaans in his home tongue and you know he is speaking English here just very badly.    But – but.    If I read the contents.    I absolutely agree with you    Absolutely.     “Apologies.”    That is correct and it is at 12   Well.    I can say that I was wrong in copying Montana because it was Precise’s properties that I was dealing with not Montana.  So I – I should – I should not have copied Montana in on the email.    And I just apologised for doing it.    Ja it was not a conscious – it was – there was no – it was not a conscious to copy him or eliminate him you know it – I cannot give a reason why I copied him.    I can tell you that I did copy him    But I cannot tell you why.    I doubt it because if I had – I do not know how much correspondence there actually was after the – the purchase agreement was changed.  I do not recall and I do not have the – the information to provide you.    So I can maybe say no there was no other correspondence up until this.    No I am – I definite – if I am dealing with a legal entity, I am obligated to ensure that I am dealing with the right person.    And that there is that person.    Is enabled.    Is authorised to deal on behalf of the entity as well.    So I would have done all of that stuff.    And to the best of recollection he was the sole director.    Not Precise.    Van Der Walt.    Yes.    Yes.    From – yes.    Yes I do.    Yes I do.    That is correct.    Correct.    The subject matter is 119 Empire Place which is the Sandhurst property.    Yes.     “Hi Tumi please see below the email sent on 21 April 2015.  Braam called as he did not receive any response and really needs to sort the cover at 119 Empire Place, Sandhurst.  Please make contact with Braam to make the necessary arrangements. Best Regards.”    I think Tumi is or was Montana’s PA.    I think.    And communicate.    April ja which….    No, no I – I cannot answer I do not know why or – for what reason I would be sending this to her and to Mr Montana.     No problem.     Thank you. 
REGISTGRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth, if so please raise your right hand and say so help me God. 
MR LOUIS GREEN:   [d.s.s.] 
GREEN: How much correspondence there was thereafter but had I corresponded and copied Montana in I am sure I would have received the same response from Van Der Walt saying you – why you copying Montana in on our – on my business.   Ja I cannot – I cannot recall the circumstances here.  And I do not have the other email – because I refer to another email here. 
MR DE BEER:  Ja, this... this is uh, for the servicing... it is the servicing of the pool cover.  The... the other one... the other email was about spare keys.    Yes, yes.  Sandton.     Yes.  No, it is ...[intervenes]     No uh, it does not.  I cannot... I cannot um... I cannot... I cannot say why.  I do not know.      Yes, I would... I would say so.    Absolutely.  And especially, you know, having been enlightened to the fact that I must not communicate with Montana on 119 Empire but here, clearly uh, I have communicated with him.    Ja.    Oh, hold on.  Uh, sorry.  I can... I can tell you why.  Because this is 2015 and this is 2016.  That is why.  This MP11 is 2015.  The 23 rd of June 2015 and this is 2016.    No, you can see it.    It is like I have explained...[intervenes]     And you can see, it says I refer to the email of April 2015.    No, this... this.. this was the servicing of the pool cover.    In 2016, they have found an extra set of keys.    For the cover.    And that is when I... in 2016, I spoke to Van der Walt.    And he says, “why are you talking to me?”  But it is clear here that this email is 2015.  You can see in the body of the email I say, “please see below the email sent on 21 April 2015”.  So this email is 2015.    Yes.    Uh, no.  I think that... that had already happened.  That.    Well, can I... can I see the... the... the date of the agreement?  What date...?    No, no.  I... I am in the same ...[intervenes]     No, I...[intervenes]     ...I appreciate it and...[intervenes]     ...to assist you.    Um...      I am just looking at what date the agreement...    Ja, what... what date...    So there was an email about the um...    Ja.    Yes, it is after.    Yes, but if you... if you look at this one which was in between the two emails, I never even referred to um, uh, Van der Walt here.    Where...[intervenes]     Yes.    [No audible reply]     Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    No, I understand.    And... you know, I...[intervenes]     ...at this point in my life, I was very ill.    Um, I was on... I was heavily medicated.    And I cannot tell you...[intervenes]     ...why... why I did this.    There is no, you know...    It... it is what it is.    The facts are here.      It is in writing.  It is in black-and-white.    And I cannot tell you why.    Because it should not have been.    [No audible reply]     Correct.    I do not know who paid it.  The money came from that account, yes.     The trust account.    Yes.    It was not unusual.    No, no.  I do not... I have no idea who paid the deposit...[intervenes]     ...other than that the deposit came on Mr Van der Walt’s trust account to our trust account.    Yes.    Because I received the...[intervenes]     ...the uh, the email.    Yes.    Yes, because Mr Montana was the purchaser. ADV SONI    Yes.    Ja.  Well, I never... I mean, I never uh... I did not understand the mechanics of the entities and, you know, the arrangements between the parties.  It is... it is not um,    Um, so...    It is not unusual.    Well, when it struck me as strange was when I got the... the mail from um, Van der Walt, saying, “why are... why did you copy Montana in, in this communication?”  For me that was strange.      You know, I did not even... it did not even enter my mind to divorce the two.  There was no... I never had formal notification that this is how it is.  So, I did not know.    I do not recall.  I cannot... I cannot say I recall him telling me...[intervenes]     The email says...[intervenes]     ...”I explained to you last year”.    You know, maybe that was uh, his telling me   I do not recall uh... I never received an official notification saying that this is what the structure is and... you know, I... I had always thought that they were uh, partners in development.    That is just what... just from their interaction and...     Uh, Montana and um, Van der Walt.    Ja, that they had entered into a partnership in this particular development.    Um, which is not unusual.    Well...[intervenes]     It has not been... it was a house.    But it had not been developed.  I mean, they... uh, it has not been developed where the Hurlingham’s number 1 has been... the development work has started on that property but uh, um Sandhurst...[intervenes]     Well, I... I thought the... the intention was to develop the Sandhurst property, to do something else.  You know, and that is why I thought um, they were partners.    I beg your pardon?    No, no one.  It... it is just their interaction that gave me the impression.  It was not uh... there was no formal “this is what we do and here is our uh, development plan or document”.      It is just from what... what was said that I derived um, my thoughts.  You know, in my mind how I thought it was structured.    I have never been with the two of them together ever.    Ja, just the... the... when you know, when I met with Van der Walt and when I met with Montana, I thought that um, they had moved it from Montana into a development company to a property company to do something with the property.    Yes.  Uh, I did not know that this has been separate or, you know, I had no idea of any of this stuff that uh, I am sitting here being questioned.    Yes.    No, no.  I...[intervenes]     Absolutely.    And there are unfortunately big gaps.  I mean, I would have had piles of papers of uh, every transaction.  There was paperwork.  There is... and correspondence.   There is never... I never uh, delve into uh, um, a situation like this without paperwork where I can tell you exactly automatically what happened.  I do not have that.  Uh...    Yes.    Mr Montana.    Ja.    No, I... I mean, my natural is to just... okay, sorry.  I had it all wrong.  Uh...[intervenes]     Uh...[intervenes]     Is that not?    Ja, I mean, my... my reaction was   H’m.    Oh, you know, my response is what is here.    I cannot [laughs]... I cannot change my response.  That was my response.    Though, you know, be it right or wrong.  That was the response.  And I... I cannot say to you uh, I did not have type up an email or...[intervenes]     ...to phone him or... My response was apologies.  Like, sorry.  Uh, carry on.    You know it was...    It... it... my job was done.  I was finished.      There was no... I did not have to do any of this uh, remote keys and uh, pool fence, maintenance.    That was... my job was done.  The minute the property transferred, I am finished.    So I had no obligation to Van Der Walt to um, look after anything.    Ja, I... I did receive um, a mandate from him in 2017...    ...to sell the property for him.    And then my obligations were to him.    And I was now in a situation where I was answerable to him.    Yes.    Yes.    The keys of the property.    Ja, uh... you know um, unfortunately, Van der Walt says, as I explained to you last year.  So I cannot say, well, he did not explain to me last year, that he is... you know, it is quite possible that he did.    So I... and he put in his letter here that he explained to me last year.    So at the time of um, my... my responding to this...[intervenes]     ...and just saying apologies...[intervenes]     ...uh, it is possible that he had explained to me the year or uh, a couple of months prior to this.    Um...[intervenes]     Uh...[intervenes]     Uh ...[intervenes]     Uh, if... if I can say that when I ...[intervenes]     Well, when I first showed Montana the house...[intervenes]     ...I... it was my understanding then that he would occupy the house.    That he would move in and live in this house.    That was my understanding.    Um, the circumstances changed.    Because Precise Trading became the legal entity that owned that property.    Um, or let me ask why did Montana not occupy the house once Precise got occupation fo the property?  Why did not Precise do a... a rental deal to Montana?  Because they were trying to rent the property out.  I think they did rent the property out.    So why did not Montana rent the property from Precise.    All right.  So...[intervenes]     If you are asking me, did I believe he was the real owner of the property?  The answer is no.    If I thought that he was the ...[intervenes]     ...that uh, Van der Walt was a proxy or...?    Uh...    Then yes, I would...    I would agree with you.    Ja.    Correct. 
BEER: ...I am trying to the best of my ability...[intervenes]  
MS DE BEER:   No…     Just G, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, I did.     Absolutely.     That is correct.     Yes, yes, very well.     You know, I did not meet – you know, I had my property on the market, it was a guesthouse and …[intervenes]     225 Rose Street, Waterkloof.     Waterkloof.     Yes.     Yes, I owned.     It was a guesthouse.  I am a property developer and I did two developments, you know, guesthouses just before the World Cup and …[intervenes]     Yes, 2010.  So I purchased the property 05, 2006 and then I did two projects and – so after the World Cup I basically decided to sell the property, so in 13 I put it on the market.  And Mr Lucky Montana lived five houses away from me in the same street. So when the boards went up I – on the first time that the house was sold in 2013, the 10 March, two of my agents Daniel de Lange and Antoinette Geldenhuys at that time was the people selling the property and the boards went up and the first weekend that they showed the house, the one agent, Daniel, is very into cars.  You know, he likes nice cars.   So he came and he brought me a contract and for exactly the price – and, you know, I am used to, because I am in property development, you know, people when it is a house at that price they are always trying to bargain with you.  So I said but …[intervenes]     I eventually sold it for 10.5 million.     10.5 million.     11 million.     At the first contract, was sold for 11 million.     The first transaction we did.     And there was no offering for a lower price, etcetera, so I said to my agent, I said listen, when people buying this kind of properties, he did not make an offer?  And he says no.  I said then I do not trust this transaction, you know?  And he says no, no, no, this is …[intervenes]     Lucky Montana.     So they came to me and they said to me ja, but Lucky Montana, he is the CEO of PRASA and his cars – because he came there two or three times and every time with a different very, very smart expensive car.  So he said to me no, no, no, no, there will not be a problem, he will be able to afford because he said to us the loan is a formality because one of his friends worked at ABSA.  But what he did not know, I was also an ABSA client.   And so three weeks later, I got an email to say that they only got value for 7.5 million.  So I was so angry because I knew, because I was an ABSA client, my bond was more than that at that stage and they knew that.  So, I mean, I knew it was not correct.  So …[intervenes]     I am sorry.     Not at all.       Yes not at all.     I only found that out after we met on the second transaction.     That he was living there.     No, it was – I got a letter from Mr Lucky Montana.     That he received a valuation from ABSA and they only found 7.5 million value which I knew was not true because, I mean, I had a bond, you know, on the property because I bought for a lot less but I did, as I say, a development there.     And I did a guesthouse.  So I really spent a lot of money there.  And …[intervenes]     Ja?     The valuation was not true.     Ja, no, no, no, I – you see, he said to my agent the bond will be a formality.     That we will get the bond within no time because he has got a friend in ABSA that is going to assist him.  So three weeks later I got a letter from him stating that they only found value for R7.5 million.  Okay?   So I said to my agent, okay, do you want – oh he said ja, but Lucky would like to meet with me to discuss this.  So I said no, I am not in – I am not going to start with an auction, I am withdrawing the property from the market.  Which I did and …[intervenes]     Okay.  So 18 months later I decided to put the house back on the market and when the first board went up, Lucky stopped there and he went to – at that stage it was Liesl Theunissen and Daniel, the agent that was also involved on the first transaction, they were showing the house and that is how I found out that Lucky lived five houses from me because as they put the boards up, he stopped there and he said to the agent, okay, I want to make an offer, I have to have this house.  And so the agent said to him, listen, my boss will not sell to you because of the previous experience, there is no way that I can take an offer to her.  So he said okay, go and speak to her and come back to me and tell her this time I am buying cash.   So the agent came to me and I said to him …[intervenes]     I had it in the – it was 11 million and he made an offer for 10.5 million.     Okay.  So I said to the agent, okay, cash.  You know, last time it was a formality, now it is cash.  No, if he does not put down at least 3.5 million non-refundable deposit I am not going to enter into an agreement with him.  So this must – discuss it with him first, let us not waste one another’s time and then from there I will enter into an agreement, so – which we did and he did pay the R3.5 million non-refundable deposit into his lawyer’s trust account which I think paid it over – I cannot recall, but to my lawyer’s trust account and the balance they paid later.   They were supposed to pay it 30 days after the deposit and they went over longer but I gave them leeway to sort of like get all their ducks in a row because at that time they came back to my lawyer and said but they want to buy the property through a Mr Johan Smith from Cape Town.   And I was very angry about it.  I said no, no, no, no, you know, this is now just dragging this whole transaction, I am not going to allow this.   And so my lawyer my actually said, okay, I will discuss it with them, etcetera, it will not take longer than normal, it is just changing the contract.  Okay.  And then after that - how I know it was Mr Lucky Montana, I did not meet him on the first contract, on the second contract he insisted meeting me.   But my staff, everybody, they were in awe with him and the one lady that has been working for me for many years said to me she cannot believe that a man that works in an overall can afford a house like this because he sometimes visited the house to come and do measurements, etcetera, in his PRASA overall.  Okay.  So that is one of the reasons why we knew it was Mr Lucky Montana.   But I met with him twice, the last time to hand over the keys of my house and discuss, you know, technicalities about, you know, when he would like to move in, etcetera. But I sent a letter and that is the other thing, to prove that it was Mr Lucky Montana, I sent a letter to all my neighbours, because I had a very good relationship with them, and I introduced my new buyer to the whole community and I said please, I would like you guys to make Mr Lucky Montana feel welcome, etcetera, he is the CEO of PRASA and I have sent that out and I do not know whether that was the reason why the next moment Mr Paul O’Sullivan contacted me and it was the Rapport and the Sunday Times and everybody was like a ton of bricks, you know, sort of to get information, which I did not want to give in the beginning because I did not know what was going on and I did not want Mr Lucky Montana – he was a very, very sweet man and a very nice guy, so I did not want trouble for him and I did not know about all the dealings, etcetera, so I refused in the beginning until this Paul O’Sullivan told me if you do not give me the contracts and stuff, I will subpoena you to come to court.  So that is basically how I got involved in this whole investigation.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes because the reason for the 10,5, I went because I wanted at that stage to sell the house very quickly.     So I said to my agents even though he never sort of like agreed on, you know, sort of making an offer, I said to him let us tell him – because he said it was a formality, tell him I …[intervenes]     I am terribly sorry about that.  Okay, so I said to my agent, when he came to me and he said to me ja, it is going to be a quick deal, it is a formality, I said to him to make it more sweet, I said let us – go to your guy and say to him that I will sell the property to him if it is so quick at R10.5 million.  Okay?   So that is the reason why it was sold for 10.5.  He never made an offer for 10.5, I offered.  Okay?     Yes.     Ja.     This one was replaced with the one that was signed by Lucky Montana.  This contract – the original one was signed by Lucky Montana in this contract and then they say okay, they are going to exchange …[intervenes]     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Page 70?     Ja, ja, that is correct.     Yes.     Ja.     That is correct, there was a big controversy all of them about which entity to use and that is, like I say, that is the reason why I was very angry because I was thinking, you know, this whole thing – and I was threatening that if they do not come to a point now of making a decision, they are going to forfeit their deposit, you know, I need this to be registered.   And so that is why – and I must be honest with you, that I did not really – I am not a very good administrator, I left that for my lawyers, but eventually, you know, I just said to my lawyer just deal with it, whatever – whatever they want to use.   I mean, my buyer was Lucky Montana, whichever entity he decides to use, I do not really care, I just want to get this registered and move on.  So for that reason, as I say, it was different entities that was used.     Ja.     I did not really speak to any of the people but I mean I was told – I was phoned by my lawyer to say Johan Smith in Cape Town and they are not sure.   Now who they were, I do not really – I cannot really tell you who all was involved.  Like I say, I did not get into the nitty gritty.   All I know is that Lucky was my buyer and him and Johan Smith and all of them were sort of like arguing of which CC or company or whatever to use and I just referred them back to Mr P J Viviers who was my lawyer at the time and Mr van der Walt did the negotiations with my lawyer.     So my – I do not – I cannot recall but I do not think my lawyer had any dealings with Johan Smith or I think they had done that dealings through the lawyer of Mr Lucky Montana which was Van der Walt.     That is correct.     I think was 10.5.     Ja?     Oh, oh, yes, I see.  Okay.  Yes, as I say, that is why I know and maybe – I do not know, maybe I was – I cannot remember - like if I cannot recall, maybe I was angry and they offered 11 million after the 10.5 originally 18 months ago.     Definitely not.     Yes.     He never discussed that with me, never.     Ja, okay.     Yes, yes.     Yes, that is correct.     The whole issue around whose – which entity is to be used was done through his lawyer, Van der Walt, and I was just notified by my lawyer that this what is busy happening and I was fighting with my lawyer and I said they had better now get to a point of what they want to do because otherwise they are out of time, I am going to get them to forfeit their deposit.     Yes.  [Laughter]     Absolutely, absolutely.     Okay.     You are talking about…     Okay. “Despite the fact that there are corporate entities involved there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the house in question was sold by me through my CC to Lucky Montana.  First to him directly, then to a trust run by Johan Smith and eventually through his attorneys, corporate Precise Trade and Invest.  The various contracting entities, such as John Smith, Minor Property Trust and Fredees(?) Trade and Invest Unlimited are merely this alter ego of Montana.” Which is correct.     I handed the keys over to Mr Lucky Montana myself.     Yes.  Oh, another very important thing is that I believe that if you leave a property for somebody else, make sure that it looks better than what he saw it.  So I actually phoned his secretary and I asked her at a time to meet with Mr Montana …[intervenes]     Yes.     And I phoned and I said I would like to meet with him because I am going to repaint the house.  That was not part of the deal but when I moved my stuff out, out of the house, all the marks where your furniture was, was – you know, there was ugly marks, etcetera, and I looked at it and I thought, you know, with all my furniture and everything, this is not the picture that he saw and I would not like to leave it like this.   So I phoned her and said to her please could you ask Lucky I would like to meet with him and then he can tell me what colour he would like to have the house from the inside.  He did not offer the outside but I mean the inside of the house.   And then she said to me okay, she will come back to me and I think a day or two later she said to me Mr Montana said thank you for the offer, but, I mean, do not worry about it, he is going to redo and rebuild the inside so you are going to just waste money. So there was also part of the fact that me and Lucky discussed that and that happened because, I mean, after I moved out, he almost rebuilt the whole house.  I was very upset because I thought it was very beautiful.  [Laughter]     Yes, yes.     He said to me it is no need to do that, I mean, he going to break down the place anyway.     I never, I must be honest with you I never had contact with him afterwards, but I drove past that house, I had a lot of sentimental values there, you understand so I drove a lot past it to see what is happening, but you know when I drove past there I mean I was so upset because there was just scaffolding, all the windows were broken out, there was new windows put in, in the whole house, and as I say it went on for months you know and up till today the scaffolding is still standing there. Nobody ever moved in, and it has been six years.      I think, I think, I think the State sort of didn’t allow because when Paula Sullivan got involved, I think they blocked any movement on the house, or something like that, because nobody has moved in, in six years.      That’s correct.         Ja.     The first meeting I had with Montana was in or about mid-November 2014.  Montana walked through the house at that stage as he wanted to check some things I moved out and the morning of the 26 t h 2013 I again met with Montana and handed him the keys for the property.      That is correct.     Yes.     For sure.     Absolutely, because I – when I walked through the house with Lucky when I handed him the keys I suggested to him, because being in property development and I had business rights because it was a guesthouse and you know the average rates and taxes at that time in Waterkloof was about R2 400 roundabout there, and I think at that time if I can remember well mine was about R11 000 to R12 000, and I asked him who is going to stay in this house and he said he was going to stay there, and I said to him I suggest that if you – I said are you going to run it as a guesthouse and he said to me no, he was going to live there.  And I said to him you know I would suggest that you deregister the business rights because otherwise you are going to pay R10 000 a month more for rates and taxes if you are not going to run it as a business, and so he said no, no it is not necessary he will keep it like that, maybe in future he would like to do something with it. So I mean I had those kind of discussions with him.     Okay.     That’s correct.      These letters, as you will see is the 27 t h of November, that was after I handed over my keys to Mr Montana and I just actually felt the community, my neighbours, because I had good relationships with my neighbours, and I just basically introduced Mr Lucky Montana to them, and you know sort of like telling them, you know make him welcome, make him feel – because he is a very smart man, and he is a very gentle man and I would like you people to sort of make him part of the community.  So this is the reason for the letter that I have written.      Yes, what actually happened I mean I was about a year or two years prior to that my husband was gun-pointed at our house coming from the gym and it was very, very traumatic and after that we had 24 hour security at our, you know with a gatehouse outside our gate.  So that is basically just ...[intervenes]       Yes, I think, I can’t remember well, you know at some stage some of the community also got involved with security and I can’t remember whether that was you know part of – you know because some of the community would get say ten houses would have a security patrolling and I can’t remember at this stage what really happening, all I know we had our own security, but we also sort of participated you know in the community as well you understand, so I think maybe that could be that, I can’t remember.      To who?        I would like, to all my neighbours, which one?   Ja, my neighbours it was the people across the road from me, the people – I had a corner stand, it was a corner house, now the people right opposite me, the people next to me on the left hand side and the people at the top of me.  It was only to basic three neighbours, ja.  The people that I was close to.     Okay. “To all my neighbours, I would like to inform you that I have sold my home to Mr Lucky Montana, the current CEO of PRASA.  He is a very nice gentleman and would take full responsibility of the property on the 1 s t December 14.  I would like to find out whether you would be interested to continue with our arrangement concerning the security, if not I would remove the guardhouse and continue with their service at my new residence. Thank you very much for your kind and faithful friendship over the past seven years and I hope you have a prosperous Christmas and a New Year.”        Karen de Beer ...[intervenes]         Karen de Beer and Family yes.  I remember now, sorry, I remember now, it was the ...[intervenes]      The email address, Vision Property, was the few neighbours just on either side, we were just about four or five, because of the gun pointing you know we basically decided to get somebody you know sort of to patrol.     I think maybe ...[intervenes]      It is identical.     I think what could have happened here, maybe one of my staff maybe had an oversight on one of the people and that we then basically forwarded to them.     Okay.     Yes, yes.  You know we had a very, very nice community and you know everybody was quite sensitive about what is going on around them after this gun point etcetera, and I wanted to let these people know that there is somebody moving in here, this is who it is and it is a very nice person and I would like him, because I also told him about the nice neighbours that I had, so I want to just make – actually them to get to know one another.     I told him about what nice neighbours I have and I told them about what a nice man has bought my house.     But Mr Montana you met?     Yes.     Yes, okay, alright.     No, because I don’t know what Mr van der Walt looks like, I have never met him, I don’t even know where his offices is.     Never, never.  I never spoke to any of them, I never spoke to them, I worked through my lawyer.     Yes, and his secretary?     And his secretary.     It is a pleasure.     Thank you. 
MS KAREN DE BEER:   (d.s.s.)
