CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Are we ready this morning?    Okay thank you.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    That would be fine.  What is your anticipation of what time we might be done with the other witnesses Ms Viljoen and Ms Loock.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  No that is fine.  If need be we can sit beyond four o’clock.    Again so that we try and finalise their evidence.    Okay.    Yes.  Mr Vaughan – where is he?  Okay you are excused from attendance today please come back tomorrow and be here at nine o’clock so that in case we decide to start at nine you are available.    Thank you very much.    Yes please administer the oath or affirmation?    Thank you.  You may proceed.   Yes.    Okay    Okay.    Yes.    Okay thank you.    Hm.    Okay thank you.    I am sorry.  I think you asked her if she confirms?    And she – I saw she nodded.    But I am not sure that she confirmed it.  So you will have to please just articulate your confirmation so that the microphone can …    Okay maybe let us – let us do this.  Let us do it this way.  The affidavit as it stands I think you have confirmed that it is correct, is that right?   But what you have just said suggest that you feel that there may be other facts that need to be added.    Which are not – which are not – which are not there.    Okay no that is fine then.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes it might occur again.   Ja no let us do it that way yes.    Yes.    No she is very – she is very passionate about wanting that one.    Let us leave it like that.    She promises it will not come apart again.    And that promise is under oath so…    Okay.    And tell us before you proceed who he was or he is?    What was that answer?   Okay.  Alright.    Yes.    I am sorry you would take funds from a business to deliver the – or cash from a business.    Yes and vice versa?    And vice versa?  So you would also take from a business to go and bank for them?    You did not do the collection from the business?    You only did one way?   Okay.    Ms Hofmeyr.    You said page 50 is better than I guess another page?    Yes.    Ja.    In due course we can – we can do what we can with this.    Make do with it.    Ja.    Ja.    Ys.    That is fine.   I am sorry did you say you going back to her affidavit?    Okay thank you.    I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Just before we proceed we know what business your entity was involved in.  From where did you operate?    From Springs?    And your clients would be around Springs only or you worked …    Beyond?  What was the scope?    The whole of Gauteng?    Okay, thank you.    And just the size of your operation.  About how manyemployees did you have for example?    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Okay, alright.  No, I just wanted to – so that we know exactly from …    Where you operated and what was the area in which your business was active.    Yes.   Yes.        who asked you?    The liquidators?    Did they speak to you directly or they spoke to your attorney and your attorney told you?    Ja.    Ja.    Oh, so your attorney was present when they spoke to you?    Okay, thank you.    Hm.  Do you have a recollection of what your impression was of what they asked for?  Is it that – is - at least your understanding is it - is that they wanted everything?    Ja.    Yes.  No, no I understand that but at least you – I think you – you gave everything because you probably that they wanted everything.    That was your understanding.  They – they might or might not have said so but you would have given them everything …    Ja.    Okay.    Do you know whether your attorney kept a record of what was handed over to the liquidators?    Ja.  Do you know whether your attorney kept a list of what was given to the liquidators or not?    Well no you can answer because you either know oryou do not know.    Okay.    Did you give instructions that the – those books be given to the liquidators of your close corporation at any stage?    Yes.  It is just that you – as I understand yourevidence you say before the liquidators of the SME …    Before the liquidators of the Namibian Bank approached you for those books or documents you say those books or documents should have gone to your liquidators.    Did I understand you correctly?    Why do you say they should have gone?   Who – how – how is it that they should have gone there if you do – you had not given instructions that they be taken there?  You were the owner of the business as I understand.    Yes.    Had they been asked for already?  Had the – had your liquidators asked for …?    Yes.  Okay but what is it that makes you say they should have gone there already?    That is your liquidators?    Your bookkeeper told you so?    Oh but it is not the – your liquidators who said that to you?    But did you say to your bookkeepers okay in that event you must take the books to the liquidators?   Ja.  Well – okay.  English is not my first language.  I do not know if it is yours Ms Viljoen but it may be that the problem is the use of the word “should”.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Hm, hm.    Well just – just so that we clarify whether they ever reached your liquidators is that something you know or is that something you do not know?    Oh, it did not go to them?    Okay.  No that is fine thank you.   Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  No it is fine.   Your – your – your lose definition is too loose.    Hm.    I am – I am …   I am allowed to pay my daughter for her to do a favour for me.    Yes.    And just to tie one loose end.  What – what is the position that you held at Rustic Stone?    Yes.  No I saw that is what you say in the affidavit but I want the job title.  Were you a manager something?  Were you consultant or something?    Oh.  Okay, alright.         So you would satisfy yourself at the commencement of the business relationship that…(intervention).         That they were legitimate – they were a legitimate business and everything seemed to be in order and thereafter as long as you continued to have that feeling that they were fine you would then not do any further check.       Okay.       I’m sorry were your terms and conditions the same as those of your previous employer?        Okay so in other words…(intervention).       Okay, alright.        And who is they now?      I thought you said earlier on, they would say they need so much.         When they needed like 5million, did that mean they needed you to transfer 5million for them what did that mean?    Well I want to understand the need first, you were asked, what they would say to you…(intervention).              Now when they said that were they asking you to give them 5million rand.         What did that mean?         Ordering from whom?        You would have money and you would give it to them?      In your name?      The service provider being a bank?        Oh okay would the service provider always be SBV?         Okay, now I think you just said that – or something that I understood to be the client would provide money to you or did I misunderstand you.      The “they” is your client, initially…(intervention).      They phone you, is that your client.       They say they need money.           That’s your client still.        And then they, being your client, transfer money into your account.       That’s the part I don’t understand.       Yes.        Okay now I think that’s helpful, so they’ve got 5million but not in the form of cash.    And they want you to take whatever steps you need to take to provide them on that same day with cash to the value of 5million.       Okay, now I understand.      Business was good.       Ja just finish.          Was – were the requests always telephonic and not in writing or sometimes in writing?         By way of email?        Okay.      So – I’m sorry again, so would some of the requests be by way of SMS’s or WhatsApp, just for the sake of completeness?      Okay, no that’s fine.      So effectively when you were delivering cash to a client, to the value that the client had specified in their request in the morning, you were basically giving them …(intervention).       Their own money back.       Yes in cash form.       Ja and you retained what they had in effect, theydidn’t have cash but they did have 5million, they transferred that to you and you secure cash and give them the cash form of that amount.       Okay.    Yes let’s take the short adjournment for tea, we’ll resume at half past eleven, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    You may proceed.    You thought you were certain?    Okay.    Yes.  Please explain to me why any client would feel that they needed your services because I take it that is if SBV was…    Hang on, hang on, hang on.  If SBV was an entity owned by the four banks, big banks I guess you mean and they were there to deliver cash to clients I assume why did the clients not who needed your service – or felt they – who contacted you why did they not contact SBV or the banks directly and say, you know I have got money, I have got an account with, I have got money, I need cash and then the banks would contact SBV and SBV would deliver?    No, no I was not suggesting that they should collect the money themselves but I was – I was talking about why they would not…   Get rid of you or not make use of your services go direct to the banks and if the banks say use SBV because that is the entity we have created, they phone SBV and say can you confirm with my bank it is one of the four – the big four, I have got the money but I need cash.  And then SBV can liaise with the bank, get whatever confirmation if they need to but then take the money and deliver it to the client.  You have said that some of the clients maybe all the clients that came to you did not want a marked vehicle from SBV coming to their premises because then …    Criminals would know that they were bringing money.    But why would SBV provide unmarked vehicles?    No, no, no.    You – from what you have explained to me the need to use your services arose from the fact that SBV’s vehicles were marked?    And clients did not want to have SBV vehicles seen arriving in their premises because then criminals would see that money was brought there. So – and I would imagine SBV and the banks whichcreated SBV knew about that concern and I wondering why SBV did not decide to provide unmarked vehicles because then…    Yes.  Okay alright.    Sorry they would charge how much?    A full percent?    Hm.    Did you always have the – in your records the addressed of each client – the address of each client where cash was to be delivered?    Okay.    If your – I am sorry if your client was a legal entity like a company or a CC I see here your client was a person.    Ja you vetted the person you considered to be in charge of the entity?    Yes. Only or also the entity?    Just the person?    Okay.    I am sorry.  Are you referring to the code – to the number below company stamp?    So that number that you would write there would represent what?    A certain client?   And you would use the same code throughout?    Okay you would put in that if there was no stamp?    You would put the code if there was no company stamp or you would put the code even if there was?    All the time?   And you say the purpose for the code was what?    Ja I am not sure if I understand that.  If you put the number – the code if there was no company stamp then I would understand that to mean that you want to know which client this slip belongs to.  But you say even if there was a company stamp you would put the code?    And you say the code represented a client?    The code was for your own purposes only?   And would the client know the code?    Yes.  And you said it represented that there was money given to them?    You created the code, your closed corporation not the client?    Yes.  And you used the code whether you – the name of the company was there in the document or was not there?    Yes.  But somebody from outside who did not know what the code represented would not be able to make use of it?    Yes.  Okay maybe it is not important.    Yes.    Ja I think that might be helpful.  But why did you I mean a code is meant to conceal something from somebody.  Now the purpose of the code was to identify the client and the address where    Now if anybody who had – I would have thought that where you have the heard – a document that has the code should not also have the name of the client and the address, the two should not be found together and that what should happen is that …    Your – your…    Before you do that.    Just listen.  No just listen.  I would have thought that your drivers would have a document that gives them the names of clients and the addresses separate from the code and that either they – if they did not know the code to which address or client it related to they would have a document somewhere where they could go and check so from your point of you you just say I need you to make a delivery to. Then if they know what 1010 represented or which client it represented and the address then they do not have to check.  They say okay we will pick the cash and we deliver it to 1010.  If they did not know then they have a document where they could go and check that, that is what I would expect but I see here you have got the address, the name of the client and the address of the client – is the address there or no you do not have the address but you have got the name of the client, you have got the cell number of the client and then you have got the code and of course you have got the amounts.  Yes you can now explain?    Okay thank you.    Okay.      Well Ms Hofmeyr.    What happened to Ms Viljoen’s bundle has happened to mine.  So but for now I can – I can continue.  Maybe during the lunch break.    You can swop ja.    Ja.  Yes.    I think – ja – it should be a lever arch file ja.  Okay alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay yes.    Your microphone.    Is that the correct pronunciation?   Yes okay.    Did you – I am sorry.    Once you knew about ITH didyou think that was a replacement – replacement of the other name, a change of name or did you understand that both names referred to the same business?    Okay.    And that is her affidavit before the Commission?    Ja.        You – you must answer the questions not ask the questions.    If you know you know if you do not know you do know.  Okay.    What is the answer?    No but the – the point that is being made is the invoices reflect a different address not the Whittaker address.    Yes and you did not vet that address?    No, no, no.  The question is did you vet that address?    And why not?    You said earlier on that when your driver had delivered the cash they would come back and give you – I think – a note?    Which would be proof that delivery of the cash had taken place.  Is that right?   And that note – whatever you call it – would have the address at which the delivery took place?    So you – you are saying – are you saying that there were no deliveries made by your drivers to Mr Markides at any address other than the Whittaker address?    Yes but you were not doing the deliveries yourself.  Were you?    So therefore you cannot know that for sure – for sure.  Can you?    No, no.  If you went – if you did not do the deliveries or you were not there when the deliveries were effected at the address you cannot know that.  You would have to depend on reports on somebody.  Is it not?    Yes but they could decide not to listen to you.   No, no, no you do not know for sure whether they went there if you were not there when they delivered.    Yes therefore you cannot know.  All you can say is my drivers told me that they went to the address to which I said they should go and I trusted that they were telling the truth.    But whether or not in fact they were telling the truth Ido not know.    It has to be like that.    Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr.    But – I am sorry.  When your driver came back frommaking a delivery they would give you a document which showed or which was supposed to show where the delivery took place and who the client was.  Is that right?    What did you call that document?    Delivery note, ja.  Okay, alright.  I just wanted to make sure we are on the same page.  Would you look – would you examine each delivery note when each driver came back to see whether  what was written there was in accordance with your expectation interms of whether the money was delivered to the right client and at the right address?    Yes but was there anything or how did you ascertain where the deliver took place?  In other words whether it took place at the correct address.  How did you ascertain that?  How did you find out that?    Sorry?    Well the client could have had – could have given you the Whittaker address but could have arranged – could he not – that the delivery be effected at a different address?    Yes.    Their address …    But a different address from the one recorded in your books.    Huh-uh.    No.  I am saying in terms of the address of - for example - Mr Markides your records reflected that his address - as I understand the position – was the one for Whittaker Way.  Is that right?    That is the only address that you have in your – you had in your records for him or was there another address?    You had two addresses?    Now your instruction to the drivers was it …   That they should deliver at anyone of the two addresses or was your instruction that they should deliver at a particular address namely the Whittaker address?    But …    Yes.  Was there any particular importance as far as you were concerned of the address to which the cash was delivered …    In other words if – if cash was delivered into an address other than the one that you wanted them to deliver cash to would that have been something quite important to you or was the position that as long as the cash was given to the client it did not matter in which address it was delivered?    If – if the client was at an address that had not been supplied to you were your drivers permitted to deliver?    Yes, okay.    Well Ms Hofmeyr did tell you she thought it would happen again and …    She – she warned you about that.    Is it more convenient to change now …    To give her the – the lever arch file now.    Ja let us do that ja.  Let us do that.  No let us do that.  Forget about that one Ms Viljoen.  You will be given another one.  So we will not have this again.    Hm.    Ja.    Just remember to …    Give an answer rather than nodding.    No, I think you just nodded.    Okay.      I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr, let me just get this, when you spoke to Mr Markides’ PA, to ask for their copies of delivery notes, is the position that what you were asking for, was copies of what your drivers would have brought back to you, after they had delivered cash to them.      But what they gave you – what she gave you was delivery notes or was something different.     Okay.          Ms Viljoen just wait until she has finished the question and then answer, okay.      I’m sorry that last answer, why would they use a reference that would mean nothing to you when they deposit amounts into your account.  Isn’t the purpose of a reference so that when you see the amounts, you know what it’s for and where it’s coming from?      Yes but I would have thought that a reference was important to you.      Let me tell you why I would think it was importantbecause then you wouldn’t have to phone the client each time there was money put into the account, if you had a reference with a client to say in your dealings with me, your reference, when you deposit any money will have to be this, and if you saw that there was money under that reference then you wouldn’t have to phone the client, do you agree?      You didn’t have that arrangement with your clients?      And you did tell us that in a morning you could get up to a hundred requests?      And the fact that you didn’t have that arrangement must have meant you had to make many calls.      Ja.      I’m sorry let me just try and see if I can find it.      Will I find the reference to BK on the second column…(intervention).      Ja I see it.        And it’s September 2015, 2016?      All 2015, okay.     Sorry what page…(intervention).      Okay.    Thank you.     Yes let’s do that.      I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr did you say page 122?      Yes thank you.         Would you have read this yourself, the actual Act yourself?      In other words, where would you have gained information from?         Hang on Ms Viljoen just learn to wait until the question is completed, okay.       Where would you have got the information from as to what your obligations were under FICA?      He would have – did he send to you the whole Act, did he send to you relevant sections of the Act, did he send to you a memo or a note or a letter explaining what the obligations were?          Yes.         Okay but do you have a recollection that you did read the Act or you don’t have that recollection, the Act – when I say the Act not necessarily that you read the whole Act but at least you read what you considered was necessary to establish your obligations.           Okay and you did understand that the Act required you to establish the source of the funds or what was yourunderstanding?         That was your understanding?         Not that you had to ask the client, where did you get the funds from?        Okay, alright.       Yes let’s do that.      Okay we’ll take the lunch break an we’ll resume at five past two.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Okay let us proceed.    Thank you for that.    Ja.  Yes.    Yes I have got it.    Maybe I must just raise a question.    That I thought of when I was trying to understand what the need was for her business.      Ordinarily when you talk about the deposit of money you talking about depositing cash but sometimes you may be depositing a cheque.    And with – with technology there may be all kinds of ways.   So when I was asking her questions about what they do at some stage I also wanted to say well she was saying a client will request cash of a certain amount on the particular day but she will not make arrangements for the delivery of that cash to the client until the client has transferred money…    Into her account.    Now when you transfer electronically that mightdepend on if there is a definition of transfer and of money somewhere I guess it is not cash that moves.  It is information is moved.    And the bank will understand that from now on this money which belonged to A now belongs to B. So that the question would be whether when they – there is a transfer like that one can talk of about – of a deposit of money or not.    Of course I have not looked at various definitions so – but I am just raising it because it may arise in regard to this.    But also because I had wondered at the time.    But I thought well maybe it might not arise.  It might be my ignorance of technology.   Yes physically.    Ja, ja this is…    That is like SBV.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, yes.    But just to complete what my query on your understanding.  When there is a transfer from one account to another.    Of different.    People – entities no actual transfer of cash happens as such?    It is just – it is just..    It is credits ja credits and debits.    That is all.    But for all intents and purposes it is considered thatmoney has moved from one account into another.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Arrangements.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes but within the context of the definition of deposit must I approach this definition on the basis that in the context of Ms Viljoen’s business deposit includes transfer by her clients of money into her account?   And would you know whether that is based on the act or just on the practice and reality and everyone – everyone’s understanding who understands technology?    Ja.    Ja.    Yes okay.    But resistive.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    You said the diagram is at what page?    105.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ys.    Okay.    Thank you.    Well if that diagram correctly and accurately reflects the flow it looks like somebody at SA Express would cause SA Expressto well would cause money to go from SA Express to Koreneke various stops on the way and then he ultimately meets it somewhere later.    So…    So he causes it to ultimately go to his account but it is a long round about …    Route but ultimately it ends with him.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja and how they…    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja do that.    Yes.    Ys.    Hm.    Well if the business they run or the businesses that they conduct fall within the definition of the business of a bank.    That would mean the Banks Act applies.    And if the Banks Act applies I guess would mean that the regulatory bodies could – could move in and investigate?    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.   I am concerned that it may be that such regulatory bodies should consider looking into such businesses without having to wait for the…    Commission to finish its work because it may well be that there could be serious transactions that are illegal.    Where the – the money you know might not be traced after some time and – and the tax payer and other persons getprejudiced.    By businesses who conduct the business of a bank without being registered.    As a bank.    Yes.    The money you know might not be traced after some time and – and the tax payer and other persons get prejudiced.   By businesses who conduct the business of a bank without being registered.    As a bank.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ys.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja yes, yes.  No, no that is what I think that it will be necessary to alert them so that – because if there are regulatory bodies they entitled indeed they are under a duty if they become aware of information that suggest that somebody may be in breach or in contravention of the Banks Act to take the necessary steps.    Ja.  Okay.    Okay.  Thank you very much Ms Viljoen.    We leave it at that for now.  Should the need arise to ask you to come back you will be contacted but thank you very much and you are excused.    Thank you.    Yes we will take a five minutes break and we will resume at quarter to three.    We adjourn.    Good afternoon Ms September.    Are you ready?    Yes let us proceed.   Yes.    Okay.    The lever arch file containing the statement oraffidavit of Ms Estelle Loock and annexures will be marked EXHIBIT DD12.  Yes.    Thank you.  You may administer the oath or affirmation to the witness.    I do think the mic is close enough.  So you might not need to come closer to it.    Ja, just relax and then speak.    You might just have to raise your voice a little bit but without going to close to the mic okay alright.  Continue.        One second.  Thank you.  We may proceed.    Sorry.  Please continue.    I am sorry.  That emergency procedure 500 is that correct?  Emergency procedures 500 – that seems …    Sorry.    Yes.  It should be 500 000.   Okay, alright thank you.    Yes, I’m still just at that figure, that R500 499,999 do you think it’s another type that 500?    But also if you, I mean the 499 is it – do you read it as four million, what is it, is it four hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine rand.    But is that how you read it also Ms Loock?    But isn’t the difficulty with reading it that way, that it seems to start from a higher amount to a low amount, number one,number two, it makes a difference of what – one Rand.    As opposed to if you read it as 500 then it makes some sense up to a certain point, but it wouldn’t make much sense if you read it as R500 000 to R499 999?    Do you have some understanding of it Ms September?    Sorry?    That one makes sense. The first one is troublesome.    But there was also a reference earlier on to R500 which I drew Ms Loock’s attention to earlier and she thought it must be a mistake, but maybe – it might not be so important for our purposes, so you will know better in advance if it will – if it is really of any significance for our purposes.    Ja, okay.    You may have had too many on this, and confused her.  You want to find out whether it applied to ACSA airports only?    Ms September did you provide the spelling for that surname?    That is if you know it.    Okay.    If somebody is contracted to refuel or rather to defuel the proper person may also refuel.    Yes, yes, yes.  That kind of entity that would do that would be the entity that normally provides what I assume would be simply called fuelling, so I guess when an aircraft has landed and it doesn’t have enough fuel to go back but there is some fuel and fuel is put into it that’s fuelling.    As opposed to defueling and refuelling the refuelling is when fuel has been taken out and then you take it back, is that right?    Ja, that’s what I’m saying, you defuel when you takeit out, but when you take it back you are refuelling.    When you just put it in without taking out anything you are fuelling.    Yes, and that can be done by the same person, the same entity?      All of it all three, fuelling, defueling, refuelling can all be done by the same business, in other words a business that doesfuelling can also do defueling and refuelling, is that right?    Okay.    Just like in a garage.    Do you know Ms September why these emails are in reverse order?  You start with ones in May here and then you go – or do I misunderstand something?  Ja the ones in May are after the one in June?    Yes but an email trail is – an email is – in an email trail     The email that you should read first you should receive first is one that is in May and not one that is in June.  The one that is in June should come after the one in May.  Here at page 17 do you not have a May 2017, email and at page 16 you have a June 2017 email?    Ja do you know why that is so?    Yes but that means the email – May email should come first.  If the June email is – if the June – if the June email is inresponse to a May email we should come across the May email first, is it not?  And then because the person who sent the May email would have sent it in May and then the person who responded to it would have responded to it in June.    Which must have been mixed because I – there can be a string but you can separate them so that when one reads one…    Gets the picture as it evolved over a month or over weeks you do not read – you do not read a June email first and then come to a May email.  You first read the May email then you come to the June email.    That is what I am talking about.    Well I guess – you understand what I am talking about?    Yes.    One would have expected…    Yes one would have expected that the…    That the May emails would have come before in the sequence of documents.    And then the June emails come after.  So as – so that as you read and you go through the annexures you can follow how the events and the correspondence evolved in actual in reality.    It may be that somebody just did not …    Might not have paid attention but otherwise one can easily get confused.  Alright let us continue.  If you do find a sound explanation you would let me know if not if there is a chance of arranging them in terms of dates that accord with what would have happened in reality.  As I say if I sent you an email today and you respond tomorrow in the file I should not come across tomorrow’s email response before I come across the one to which you respond to.    That does not explain anything.    Okay let us continue.   Did you say 48?    This page at 48 is not very clear.    Ja the legal team must always try in advance of the hearing to check all copies that are not clear and try and obtain clearer copies so that once the hearing – the witness starts we do not have to be looking for clearer copies.    Yes.    Okay.   Alright.    Yes.      How much more time do we still need to…    Go in terms of your estimation?    Hm.    Well try and just focus on the important things.  We can go up to five let us see whether we cannot finish by five.  If wehave not finished by then we can reassess.  Ms Loock is that fine with you if we continue beyond four o’clock?    Is that fine?  Okay alright.    Yes.    You said 48?    Ja you can read if you are able to who says what to whom.   Just give the spelling for the surname?   Mochoele.    I am sorry.  Page 56 is that where you were talking about approval and the signatures?    Were you at page 56?    Where you were talking about approvals?    Which – which signatures – where you referring to on page 56?  There is one, two, three, four, five, six - the names are given on the left hand side.  Is that right?    But I see that in regard to Merriam Mochoele there is no indication if she was approving or declining.Says approved/declined and she did not cross out any.  Same with Mark Shelley and Mpho Selepe’s was simply – said proposedacquisition is budgeted. So that is what he or she was signing for I guess.  So the one who appears to have approved is Mr Victor Xaba - the CEO.  Was – was he the only one was supposed to approve?  Ms Loock was – was Mr Xaba the only one who was supposed to approve?  Was his approval sufficient - as far as you know?    Yes.    Did you – do you see what I am talking about Ms September?    I just want us to – to be sure who approved who did not approve.  From what I see here it looks like only Mr Xaba approved.  The other persons namely Ms Merriam Mochoele and Mr Mark Shelley were expected to either approve or disapprove or approve or decline and although they signed but they did not indicate whether they were approving or disapproving.    Yes.    Yes.  It may well be that – may well be that if they approved by way of the round robin that is – that might be good enough but it is just important to make sure that we do not say the documentshows that they approved if it does not show that they approved.  Definitely Mr Xaba it shows him to have approved.    Okay.    If you – it – it maybe – it maybe that it is not particular significant.  I just wanted to make sure that we are on the same page as to who approved in terms of that document and who did not.    Ja.    So you – you would say they approved but not because of this document?    Because of the round robin?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja, well the document made provision for each one of them to indicate whether they approve …    Or not approve and they did not make any indication except for Mr Xaba.    Mr Xaba crossed out disapproved or declined.  Soapproved remained.  That is clear.    They did not make that election and therefore it becomes unclear where they stood until you read it together with the round robin if you want to read it with that.  Okay, alright.  Let us take a short break for 10 minutes.    We will resumes at 20 to five.  We adjourn.    Okay, let’s see how far we are able to go.    Do you have any understanding of what the significance was at a practical level of the statement in the letter that the appointment was with effect from 1 July 2017 in circumstances where the letter itself was signed on the 5 t h of July 2017?  Ms Loock?    Why the appointment would have to be backdated?    No, what I’m asking is whether you have any understanding of why it was necessary to do that, to backdate it assuch seeing that it was saying that the appointment was subject to the conclusion of a contract, I take it that until the contract was concluded there was nothing at a practical level that the entity was going to be obliged to do     No what I’m saying is, is my understanding correct that the mere fact that this entity who would receive this letter would not mean that they should begin to provide any service until the contract has been conclude.    Therefore to the extent that this letter said their appointment, or if appointed the appointment of this entity was with effect from 1 July 2017 and was subject to the conclusion of a contractreally at a practical level didn’t mean anything, there was nothing they were supposed to do or there was no obligation for them to perform any service until the conclusion of the contract.    Yes so therefore as far as you are concerned the appointment may have been with effect from the date of the letter?    Because I take that the appointment itself doesn’t mean anything other than that, that is the appointment before the conclusion of the contract, the appointment without the contract meansnothing more than that as a bidder or as an entity you then know that you must enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a contract with S A Express, you must avail yourself for meetings for that purpose and the signing of the contract once agreement has been reached and t that you must kind of prepare yourself for performing in terms of the contract in case it is successfully concluded, is that correct?    Yes, so you must ready yourself so that when the contract has been signed and goes into operation you are ready to perform, but other than that really that you have been appointed doesn’t mean anything else.  Okay.    Did you say 63?    Five Six?    Okay proceed.    If any.    I’m sorry, what was the last point about not specific?    It includes OR Tambo?    Is that a concern because the Round Robin resolution did not include OR Tambo Ms Loock?    Are you concerned that the letter also talks about OR Tambo and not just Pilanesberg, because the resolution, Round Robin resolution, did not include OR Tambo and was confined to Pilanesberg, what’s the basis of your concern?    Yes but is your concern that if you say OR Tambo as opposed to saying Denel OR Tambo whatever, if you simply say at OR Tambo the same service could be provided by somebody else other than the one at Denel OR Tambo or is the position that no there wouldn’t be anyone else to provide such a service, only the one at Denel would be able to, it’s just that it’s not a proper or accurate description?   Yes.    So your point is not just a technical one, it’s a substantive one in the space that the letter makes it open for what should be obtained from Denel to be obtained from elsewhere?    And that’s part of your concern.    The second one is the amount of litres of fuel per year.    And from what you say at paragraph 8 you say that if you bear in mind that the flights would be like two times a week, is thatcorrect?    Yes, four flights, and you say in a year you have got 52 weeks based on that you say the amount of litres would be 442 000 litres per year, is that correct?    And your concern is that the letter from Dr Vilikazi says that the amount of litres and in regard to OR Tambo is 25million litres per year and in regard to Pilanesberg it says 8million per year,that’s your concern?    And in so far as Pilanesberg is concerned is the position that the correct amount of litres would have been 153 000 – no, no 8 500 litres – no that’s per week, what would have been the total per year for Pilanesberg?    Oh that is inclusive of everything?    Okay and for OR Tambo?    You don’t know where that came from.    Yes, but for Pilanesberg you say it’s 442 000?    Way below the 8million litres that the letter talks about?    Yes, okay, thank you.    Well we are at five.    I said we would look at the situation at five o’clock.  I understand that if we finish with Ms Loock this afternoon tomorrow wemight not use the whole day.    Now the – except if Ms Loock would have some difficulty with coming back tomorrow it might – there might not be much need for us to go on to much later today if tomorrow we will end up notbeing able to use the whole time.  Ms Loock what is your situation about the possibility of coming back tomorrow morning and we finish your evidence tomorrow before we start with the next witness, how is your situation?    You would be fine with that?    Yes, yes, no that’s fine, it’s just that I wouldn’t want to cause any inconvenience to any witness, but I think that if Ms Loockhasn’t got any problem as she says then we probably should stop now and and ask her to come back tomorrow morning because it’s not like tomorrow we are likely to run into any problems in terms of finishing the witness.  I take it that you might be left with maybe 30 minutes or 45 minutes to finish?    No let’s fine, let’s do that tomorrow.  We will stop at this stage Ms Loock and tomorrow we start at ten o’clock, please come back tomorrow at ten o’clock.  Is that alright?    Okay thank you.  We will then adjourn for today and tomorrow we start at ten.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.    We are indeed.    Chair I propose just before we commence with the first witness to just give a sense of where we are in the aviation evidence.    Because we have been running for about a week and we have got about a week and a bit left.    There have been some changes in some of the logistics so I thought it useful just to take a moment.    And take stock.  In relation to the four investigation areas what evidence we have heard and what is still to come.  So Chair with your leave I will commence of the first of those areas.  The first area of investigation dealt with the 15 billion capitalraising exercise that SAA embarked upon the 2015/2016.  We have heard the evidence of three witnesses so far in relation to that aspect of investigation.  They were Ms Stimpel, Mr Van Der Merwe and Ms Nhantsi.  We still have the evidence to receive from Mr Mahlangu, arrangements have been made and his evidence will be received later this week.  That will conclude for this phase of the evidence session the witnesses in relation to that aspect.  As I indicated at the opening of the aviation evidence there is an intention to have a second evidence session later in the year where the final strands of that investigation will be picked up.  Chair the second area of investigation is the North West ground handling transactions that we have been looking at over the last few days.  We have received the evidence of four witnesses in relation to those transactions between the North West Department of Transport, South African Express and then Koreneke amongst other management companies.  The evidence has come fromMr Ngwenya, Mr Phiri, Ms Phatudi and Ms Tlatsana.  Chair there are two remaining witnesses in relation to that area of the investigation.  The first of those is Mr Viljoen who will be giving evidence today and the second is from another company who received payments of some of the proceeds of those monies that came out of the North West Government through South African Express and into Koreneke.  And that will be completed by the end of this week.  The third area of investigation Chair is an area that looks at jet fuel procurement between SAA, SA Express on the one hand and an entity called EML Energy.  Chair that evidence will commence today.  It will commenceafter Ms Viljoen has concluded her evidence with the evidence of Ms Loock who is the airport’s coordinator for South African Express and that will be followed by the evidence of Mr Vaughan who is the head of fuel management at South African Airways.  Chair just a practical matter on our estimation for today’s proceedings it is unlikely that we will get to Mr Vaughan’s evidence.  We envisage that the day will be occupied by the evidence of Ms Viljoen and Ms Loock.  Mr Vaughan is here, he was summoned, he is in attendance.  In the light of the high unlikelihood that we will get to him today I wondered if we may request that he be excused to return first thing tomorrow for his evidence?    Chair we will be able to give you a better sense.   In the lunch break if you do not mind.  It really does depend how long Ms Viljoen takes.    Ms September will be presenting the evidence of Ms Loock.  She has indicated to me previously that she thinks she will need about three to four hours.      So it does depend on how swiftly we finish Ms Viljoen.   But the hope would be to finish Ms Loock today.    Whatever.    And – but we will give you sense if we may at lunch time.    About how much.    If at all past four we think we might need to sit.    Thank you Chair we are indebted.   Excellent.    So Mr Vaughan can be excused until tomorrow if he may?    Thank you Chair.  Chair just to complete that third area of investigation Mr Vaughan will give us after Ms Loock’s evidence the overview of the jet procurement space – jet fuel procurement space and that will become an important lead into the aspect of the evidence that deals with the IDC.  I had highlighted in the opening that there is an aspect of this procurement that involves the IDC because it was off the back of contracts that were obtained or were anticipated to be obtained from SAA and SA Express that a funding application was made to the IDC. So there will also be further evidence in that regard.  And then finally Chair the fourth area of investigation dealt with broad themes of governance and that investigation has focussed and the evidence will show the extent of board interference in procurement matters at South African Airways over a period of time which involved according to the evidence that will be heard numerousdemands made for the allocations of contracts to certain entities and also evidence from witnesses who endeavour to stand up to what they regarded as unlawful demands and then were summarily suspended. Chair that evidence will commence on Wednesday and it will run until Monday of next week with an interlude on Thursday to go back to some of the remaining witnesses.  But that Chair with your leave is our plan for the remainder of the aviation evidence.      Chair then without further ado if we could swear Ms Viljoen in?   Thank you Chair.  Chair we have – Chair we already entered…    Ms Viljoen’s bundle into the record as Exhibit DD9 we did that in the course of the evidence of Ms Tlatsana on the weekend.     So there will not be a need to so again.    But Ms Viljoen just to orientate you in front ofyou you have a sort of soft cover file which is – comprises your various affidavits and statements.  It will be referred to in the course of today as Exhibit DD9 that is necessary just for the purposes of the record.  And then you also have next to you a legislation bundle.  Chair we have prepared a legislation bundle that may become relevant in the course of today’s evidence. If I may beg leave to hand one up to you?    Ms Viljoen already has her copy there.  And then there is just also next to Ms Viljoen the bundle of Mr Ngwenya’s evidence.    There may be a point at which it is relevant to go there.    And that is Exhibit DD5.   Ms Viljoen if I may then just commence with some assistance in navigating your bundle because there are a number of affidavits that are to be found in the bundle that has been put together for your evidence and I would like to just get clarity in relation to some of them when they were deposed to and also to ask you whether are any corrections you would like to make in advance of your evidence to any of them?      So let us start with the first that appears atpage 1.  That is an affidavit as I have it that you provided to the commission and if you go to the end of the affidavit you will see at page 16 it was deposed to on the 23 May 2019, is that correct?    And are there any corrections you want to make to that affidavit?    The second affidavit which is actually an annexure to that affidavit which you provided to the commission is an affidavit that you did to the then FSB.  If you go to page 40, 40 of the bundle in front of you you will find – it is entitled ‘Response to summons issued under case number 2018/02/6680’ but it is an affidavit as I have it that you deposed to before a commission of oaths on the 26 February 2018.  You will pick that up at page 46, is that correct?    And are there any corrections you would like to make in that affidavit?    Thank you and then the final affidavit I am calling it an affidavit with hesitation because the document which is the affidavit does not appear to have been deposed to before a commissioner albeit that it was signed you will find that at page 91, 91 of that bundle, do you have that?    And you will see there it is an affidavit relatedto the Mafikeng case number 4908/2017 and if we go in that – I am going to call it an affidavit to page 93, can you confirm that that is your signature on that page?    And the date at the bottom is given but without a year it is 14 December, from my reading of this affidavit and placing it in context I take it to have been signed on the 14 December 2017, is that correct?    And again are there any corrections you would like to make to that?    Thank you.  You have confirmed the contents of this affidavit therefore under oath albeit that this was not commissioned at the time so just for the ease of reference in the course of theproceedings I will refer to it also as an affidavit.    Yes.    Oh yes.    So just for the record’s purposes you confirm that the contents of the affidavit that appears at page 91 of the bundle contains statements that are true and correct to the best of your knowledge?    Certainly.     Right.  Let us get a few of those details because they may well be important.    Thank you Chair.  I am indebted to you.  So there may be more background you would like to give and we will find that in the other affidavits but its contents are correct?   Thank you.  Chair I do note that Ms Viljoen is struggling with…    The manner in which the file has been put together.  I have asked my learned friend Ms Buthelezi if she would not maybe just take a spare copy of that file.    That we have and place it in a file.    Which then might not create the difficulty of pages coming apart.    My worry is that it might occur again.    So it may simply be easier to put it in a lever arch file.    Chair while that is being done.    Ms Viljoen you do not need to trouble yourself with those papers you will get a replacement file now that will be easier to…    To turn over.   It will not come apart again well we will have on standby just in case.    We will hold you to it.    Ms Viljoen you were about however to give ussome background to the genesis of that last affidavit.  You mentioned Mr Judeel.  Can you tell us the circumstances in which it came to be produced, this affidavit at page 91?    When was that?    December 2017?    Thank you.    And what did he say to you?    How did he obtain the documents that are attached to it?    So let me just get clear.   And that was at a face to face meeting in December 2017?    So you were contacted, did he make reference to a criminal case?    So when you signed the affidavit did you look at the first page which says Mafikeng CAS 4908.2017?    Right but you considered the contents and you were satisfied with their correctness and so you signed it, is that right?    And at some point either prior to that meeting or thereafter you gave Mr Judeel the documents which are then attached to that statement because those documents originate from you, correct?    Did you meet with him and a Ms Captain Mogotse?   Were you aware in the evidence over the weekend that Ms Tlatsana indicated that Mr Judeel had said to her that he attended with Captain Mogotse when he met with you?    So why – why did you agree to meet with him and depose to an affidavit then?    But you were under no compulsion to do so – you did not have a sense that it had anything to do with a criminal investigation.    Or any such thing.    We will return to that in due course in the evidence thank you.  Ms Viljoen I would like to begin at page 1 then of your affidavit to the commission and in paragraph 3 on that page you start to explain to us about an entity called Asset Movement Financial Services CC.  Chair we have previously in the evidence been referring to this entity as AMFS we may do that in the course of the evidence butthat will then be a reference to this CC which I understand you established to run the business of…    And tell us what exactly that business was and for that purpose I would like us to go to the company profile that you have provided in various of these affidavits.  There are a number of copies Chair in the papers.  The best copy I could find at page 48 so if we go to page 48.    You will see a 25 February 2015 companyprofile, can you confirm that that is your profile of the company Ms Viljoen?    And then if we go over to page 50, 50 you usefully give a description of your business there in the top paragraph.  For the purposes of today’s evidence can you just explain to us what that business was?    And what does that mean?    Thank you and can you just give us a sense…    Can we just have that again.  You said you did not really do collections.  Did you ever do collections?    Thank you. And then just in terms of the industry in which your business was operating how big is the market?  Did you have lots of competitors?    And did they all operate a similar business model to yours?    But your sense is it is a big market and thereare a number of competitors in it?    You know at least of one business that operated a similar business model do you not?  That was your previous employer, is that correct?    And what is the name of that employer?    Thank you.  We will come back to just a few more details about Rustic Stone in a moment but I would like tocontinue on page 50 because on that page you set out some further details about your business and its services.    Yes.    Yes it is hard to believe I know because 50 is not clear at all.    What we may seek to do Chair.    Is just get a better copy from Ms Viljoen in due course.    Yes.   With this indeed and given that it is her document.    Where it is relevant for us to know precisely    What is said on the page.    I will ask for Ms Viljoen’s assistance.    If we may proceed on that basis.  And Ms Viljoen that takes me to the next question which is mid-way down the page there is a heading there which I read to be company ownership/legal entity, is that a correct understanding of what is…    And then you say under that as I have it AMFS is registered as a CC and then it says all required certifications will be acquired and maintained at all times.  And then all legal compliance to legislation is and will continue to be maintained.  Is that an accurate reading of what is reflected there?    Let us just pause on that question of legal compliance.  I assume it was important for the operation of your business that you ensured that you complied with the applicable legislation, is that right?   If you can give an answer.  Thank you.  The record has to have your answer verbally.  Then I would like to just explore a bit what that legislation was.  Were you compliant with the Private Security Industry Regulation Act?    Can you just give us a sense of what that legislation regulates?    Okay.   Right.  And then legislation that is colloquially called FICA the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, were you compliant with that?    I FICA’d all my clients yes.    Well what does that mean?    So did you regard yourself as obligated under FICA to do so?    Okay that is certainly consistent with what yousay at page 5 of your affidavit.  If we go to page 5 Chair and Ms Viljoen you will see at the top paragraph on that page under 5.1.1 towards the    So as part of the statues that you needed to comply with in order to conduct your business was FICA, is that correct?   I would like for this purpose just to go to FICA for a moment because one of the chapters that is particularly pertinent to today’s proceedings is the chapter dealing with control measures for money laundering.  Chair you will find it in the legislation bundle and Ms Viljoen and the Financial Intelligence Centre Act which we will refer to as FICA is under Tab 5 and it commences at page 110.  And if you go to page 121 in that bundle you will see Chapter 3 two thirds of the way down the page which is headed ‘Control measures for money laundering and financing of terrorists and related activities.’  Chair we will return to the pertinent provisions in due course in Ms Viljoen’s evidence but I would like to just be clear on Ms Viljoen is were you concerned to ensure that all the necessary regulatory and legislative requirements were met by your company?    Were you concerned to ensure that you complied with all the requirements of FICA in the operation of your company?    And I assume that that would have included the measures that are put in place under FICA to guard against businesses being used for money laundering, is that correct?    And then in terms of your role or status under FICA which of the accountable institutions under FICA did yourecognise your business as?      Thank you.  And what is your understanding of money remitter?    And why is that?    Did you seek legal advice on that?    Amongst the governing documents in relation to FICA are also a series of guidance notes that the Financial Intelligence Centre issues from time to time, did you ensure that you kept up to date with those?    Do you know that you are legally obliged as anaccountable institution under FICA to do so?    I would like to just take us to one of those guidance notes which we have put in the bundle.  Chair you will find it and Ms Viljoen at page 159.1.  It is a guidance note issued on the 14 March 2008.  Ms Viljoen have you seen this before?    Apologies 159.    159.1.  And it is dated the 14 March 2008 andyou will see on that page in terms of its title it is Guidance Note 4 on Suspicious Transaction Reporting.  Have you seen this document before?    We will go to it at the appropriate time in the evidence.  But as I have it so far you accept that you are an accountable institution under FICA because you identify your company as a money remitter, correct?    But you have not kept track of amongst other things Guidance Note 4 in relation to suspicious transactions that require reporting?    Thank you.  I would then like to just move over to page 2 of your affidavit if we may?   Because there at paragraph 3.4…    To the affidavit indeed Chair at page 2 we will pick it up.    And on page 2 we are at paragraph 3.4 because Ms Viljoen as I read paragraph 3.4 you explain in that paragraph why at a point in time you had to hand over the books and records of your CC, is that correct?   Can you tell us about those circumstances and what happened?    A liquidation inquiry?    And …    Indeed.    Chair I do plan to go into that in more detail …    In due course …    But that is useful background for the purposes of understanding your handing over of your records.  So you were explaining Ms Viljoen that there was a liquidation inquiry into the Small and Medium Enterprise Bank Namibia.  Is that correct?    And in the course of that you were asked to hand over certain books and records.  Is that correct?    Can I just get clear on what books and records you handed over?    Of your entire business?    Even though the entire business would not have related to the Small and Medium Enterprises Bank Namibia?    How precisely did they ask for it and I am asking that Ms Viljoen in fairness to you because the powers of the Master under a liquidation inquiry is to demand by subpoena documents that may be relevant to the company in liquidation but the powers do not extend beyond that.  So are you quite sure that you did not get a request for the documents and books related to the company inliquidation?    Every single …?    Related beyond the Small and Medium Enterprise Bank …?    Did you take steps to recover all the documentsof your business thereafter?    Did they say thanks for these 37 files but we are only interested in two?    And to whom were they handed?    I would then like to just be clear about precisely what documents were given to them if we may …    And you will find at page 17 of your bundle the letter that you have provided to us which I understand is the covering letter when you handed over these documents and you will see under    That suggests to me that it was accounting records that you were handing over (intervenes).    Records of account?   But can – can I just – can we pause on the description there.  The full books and records of account you are saying that is not confined to accounting records?    Including others?    So let us just go through what those others would have been.  What else was handed over?    So …    So can I just go through a list that I havecompiled and you can tell me if that is what was handed over.  Invoices?    Your monthly reconciliations …    Of which there are some examples in the papers.  Delivery slips?    So every single delivery slip of your business was handed over to the liquidators?   Just let us pause there.  Should have been – did you satisfy yourself as to what was in the files when you handed them over?    Your – did you keep management accounts?    So that would have gone as well?    And financial statements?    Why not?    And anything else other than those that I have listed that you can recall?    Documents that you had compiled for the purposes of vetting your clients.  Would that have gone as well?    It seems to me Ms Viljoen - and I am askingthis in fairness to you so we can get clarity on it – the focus was - as I have suggested – the accounting records, the evidence of the deliveries etcetera.  It may not have extended though to documents that you compiled in the course of vetting clients and establishing who they were.  Is that right?    You did so under subpoena.  Did you not?    The language you use in your affidavit is that you were ordered to do so.  What – what did you mean when you said ordered at page 2 paragraph 3.4?    You were asked?    Thank you.  So it may not have been pursuant to an order from the Master?    And just to be clear they asked you for all the files of your entire business?    You are not sure?    You are not sure if they asked for that but you are sure that you gave everything?    Did you keep copies of what you gave over?    You did not have electronic versions of those?    But not others?    Do you know that under FICA as an accountable institution you have to keep all the records of yourbusiness for a minimum of five years?    Can you answer the first question?  Do you know that you have to by law keep the records of the …?    You did not?    But just so I have your evidence correct.  You were not aware that under FICA you are required to keep all the records for a minimum of five years.    Hm.    Okay.  We are dealing with a few liquidators here.  Let us deal first …    With your business.    Huh-uh.    So you had to get them back from the liquidators?    Your liquidators?    So let us just get that chronology right if we may.  When was your business liquidated?    So who at that point had all your records?    So when did you give them to the liquidators?    So after you gave all of them to the liquidators of the Small and Medium Enterprises Bank?    You gave all the records to the liquidators of the SME Bank Namibia …    In October 2018?    It was in October because that is when the letter that you have put up …   Went to the lawyers.    So I just want to understand did your liquidators have them then?    But if they went from the bookkeepers to the liquidators of SME Bank Namibia then they have never gone to yourliquidators.    To your knowledge?    Have they gone to the liquidators of AMFS?    Right.    So that is not why you do not – you did not retain the documents and records for five years.  Correct?    Namibian – indeed Namibian Bank we can maybe refer to.    It well be Chair.    For our purposes the most important aspect …    I would like to get clarity on.    It is first - and you will correct if my summary is incorrect Ms Viljoen.  You were not aware of your obligation as an accountable institution to keep your records for five years?    You did not know of that obligation underFICA?    When I probed with you why it was as a matter of fact irrespective of the legal obligation that you did not retain your records for five years I understood your answer to in some way relate to the liquidation of your business.  Correct?    But as a matter of fact you do not know whether the records of your close corporation ever ended up with the liquidators of that close corporation.  Correct?   Yes.    But not yours?    Thank you.  We will return to those provisions Chair.    Chair we will return to those provisions in relation to the records because in due course I – I am going to ask for Ms Viljoen’s comment on the extent of the obligation …    Under that section albeit that she has told us already she was not aware of it.    I will ask for her comment on it when we look at the section.    And then Ms Viljoen if we can go back to the series of questions that the Chair began asking you about the formation of your business.  I would like to get some detail background there and I have it commencing in your affidavit at page 2 under the heading “4. Background”.  Now you begin as I read your affidavit explaining your prior employment at a business called Rustic Stone. You will pick that up in paragraph 4.2.  Can you tell us about that employment and its duration?    And Ms Viljoen I had it from your evidence previously that they operated a similar business model to AMFS.  Can we take it that what they were doing at Rustic Stone you then replicated in AMFS in terms of the business approach?   We will explore that in quite a bit more detail in due course but I just wanted to be clear Rustic Stone operated in the same way as AMFS when you set it up.  Correct?    And then tell us about how from Rustic Stone your close corporation came to be formed?    Who was he?   Who was the client?    Andries who?    Thank you.    I pick that up at page 3 of your affidavit from paragraph 4.6.  That is where you reference being approached by Mr Greyvenstein who I understand was an existing client of Rustic Stone.  I understand there that he provided initial funding to establish the business.  Is that correct?    And any other role that he played in thebusiness?     So he was not a member of the CC?    And just tell us that timeline.  When was the CC established and when did Mr Greyvenstein leave as a member?    And from that point if I pick it up at paragraph 4.8 who were the members in the business?    So you had 100 percent member’s interest?    You go on in that paragraph 4.8 to say that   Where did your business operate from?    Did it always operate from his premises at the back?   So when – when did that change occur?    So can I just get that correct then.  The business starts end of 2014 I have it in your affidavit that you purchased this shelf CC.  So we could maybe take it from end of 2014 to end of 2015 you operated from his premises.  Is that correct?    Then he sold out of the close corporation …    In early 2016 and do I have your evidence to be from that date onwards you no longer operated at his premises?    No it does but I would just like to get clarity.  Did the vehicles of the business continue to be parked there throughout the AMFS existence?  So what was the arrangement with Mr Greyvenstein that allowed you to continue to part your vehicles there?   So he did continue to have some involvement in the business but it is confined I understand your evidence to allowing your vehicles to park on his premises?    There was no other role that he played in the business?    And then if we move down to paragraph 4.9 on that page you talk about the profitability of the business.  Can you please assist us with information about how much money was moving through the business at its peak?    Over what period?    So at its peak half a billion Rand was moving through the business.  Correct?    When did the peak start and when did it end?    Well let us just go through – just an order of magnitude.  As I have it your business operated from early 2015 till March 2018.  Is that correct?   Oh, right the liquidation happened in March …    2018?    Okay.  So let us just get the timeline right beginning 2015 to let us call it October 2017.  Are you comfortable with that?    So that is about two years and 10 months?    Okay.  I am just trying to get a sense – of those two years and 10 months how much of it could be described as the peak?    Okay.  So would it be fair to say that there was about half a billion Rand moving through your business for at least a year of its existence?    Thank you.  Ms Viljoen I would next like to move to the process you used to vet clients and we can pick that up atpage 4 of your affidavit under a heading “Client Vetting and the Delivery Process”.  Before we get into its details though I would just like to get a sense from you about the importance you placed on client vetting. Did – did you regard it as an important aspect of your business?    And were you aware of the ways in which accountable institutions under FICA are required to vet their clients?    We can go to those provisions in due course.  I also just want to know we looked at Chapter 3 which is a series of control measures under FICA to try and prevent the use of businesses for money laundering.  Do you know what money laundering is?    So can I take it that it would be part of the reason for vetting clients that you equip yourself as a business to guard against money laundering.  Is that fair?    And can I also just for preparatory purposes get an understanding that whether you agree that there can be a link between money laundering and corrupt activities.  Do you accept that there is a link between those two?    And just to explore that a bit further.  It seemsto me that the link lies in the fact that corruption is about paying people off for favours that they give you.  Do you accept that very basis explanation?    And one of the ways that that can …    To loose.    I am happy to employ the – the legislative …    Definition.    Easy Chair.  I should have added a favour that it is not legally permissible to be made.  Indeed Chair.  I am indebted to you.  We can actually pick it up in the Prevention of Organised Crime Act and also PRECCA has a useful definition of corruption but maybe for present purposes I think the refinement was critical.  It – it is …    It is paying a benefit to receive a benefit yourself to which you are not legally entitled.  Are you comfortable with that definition?    And then just in terms of the link betweenmoney laundering and corruption money laundering – and correct me if you have a different interpretation – is about disguising or concealing the true nature, source, location or movement of unlawful proceeds.  Do you accept that?    So the one way in which corruption can be facilitated is if you render money in a way that it is true source is not clear in order for those who must be repaid for the illicit favour you have received then getting money.  Do you accept that?    Thank you.  Let us go then to your process for vetting clients because it begins at page 4 of your affidavit but it really gets into its detail over the page at page 5.  Do you see that?    And we commence at paragraph 5.1.1 because as I read that paragraph you draw a distinction between new and existing clients.  Can you explain that difference to us?    And just so I can get clear about your difference in approach on vetting between new and existing clients.  I understand from what happens later in your affidavit that relates towhether they were required to sign standard terms and conditions.  Is that correct?    Is that the only difference?    So even if it was an existing client that you knew at Rustic Stone you would still go through a vetting process.  Is that correct?    And tell us what that vetting process comprised please?    And if we go on page 5 to paragraph 5.1.2.3 that is where you move from the description you have just given of the various documents you sought and inquiries that you made and you go     And did you keep records of that information?    So you weren’t aware under, FICA, that you were required to keep a record of that?      And then you go on and you say,“And if all added up and you were confident that a requestcame from a legitimate business”,Just help us there, what would equip you to know if it added up?     And let me just be clear about this, would you meet them always at their businesses, when you had this discussion with them?     So you always met them at the business?         And you had a bit of a discussion and then you got a feeling about whether it was a legitimate business and on that basis you’d continue to conduct business with them?        And are you aware, under FICA, of your obligations to establish the source of funds of any business that you enter into a business transaction with?       Not aware of that?         I take it – your affidavit description talks about this one initial engagement where, if you’re satisfied then you regard it as acceptable to continue in business with that entity or individual, is that correct?        Did you do any follow-ups in relation to the businesses?         I take it then you aren’t aware that under FICA you were required to regular due diligences of the business with which you transacted?         To continue to check the source of funds of the businesses with which you transacted.     Then let’s move to the terms and conditions, I understand your evidence to be, sometimes they were signed sometimes they weren’t, can you just take us through how that happened?         You talk about – at the bottom of page 5 paragraph 5.1.3, you say there,“Insofar as existing clients were concerned AMFS would followall of the above steps but as there was no obligation on it tohave written terms and conditions in place with it’s clients, as Iknew the client already and they were familiar with our termsand conditions of business I would not insist that our termsand conditions be signed”, Do you see that?         No indeed, we’ll get to the specific client that’s relevant to these proceedings, at this stage I’m just talking generally in terms of your business.  I understand you to be saying here, that you wouldn’t require terms and conditions to be signed with existing clients, is that correct?         How then would you be satisfied as to your legal rights and obligations in relation to those customers?         And in relation to new clients.       So the written text differed, is that right?        But the upshot of what you were doing – well the business of Rustic Stone and what it’s clients could assume would happen in the business, what your obligations were and what their obligations were was the same when you moved into AMFS, is that correct?         The I would like – so we’ve done the processes you had developed it for vetting, if you go over the page to page 6 you then tell us how the cash delivery process would work from AMFS and I’d like us to please go through that.  You set it out in some detail there and the detail is important, so if you could take us through each of the steps, for how you would process a delivery of cash.         Can we just stop there, how would theycontact you?         Thank you.         Okay, if I may, I’d like to unpack that a little bit further.         So it starts with a telephone call from a client.         What does the client say to you on the call?      Right, then what would happen.         In detail.         So let’s go through a day in the life of AMFS right because I understand these transactions happened within a day, is that correct?         Right, so you get a call, I assume in the morning.        Lt’s use a hypothetical example.         You get a call, your client says I need 5million rand in cash today, what is the next event that happens?       To come in, so sorry.     So they deposit, if I take your language atparagraph 5.1.4.1, they deposit 5million rand into the AMFS bank account, is that correct?            What happens then…(intervention).      Indeed Chair, if I may be of assistance.       When they say they need 5million, am I correct in understanding they are saying they need 5million in cash?           Right so they have 5million in their account because otherwise this transaction is not going to take place.      Your client phones you in the morning they’ve got 5million in their account, they say we want this 5million in cashtoday, correct?      They then transfer the 5million into your bank account, AMFS’s bank account.            Because they want, within the day, that 5million rand that comes to you in a EFT to be converted to cash to be delivered to them, correct?       Right, let’s just go…(intervention).     Right so we’re at the point at which – because the sequence is very important, that’s why I’m wanting to break it down, you get your call, your client says 5million rand is going to come into your account today, I need that cash you – what then happens?         Okay just, if we can stop there just for a moment, so you got a call in the morning, now are you watching your bank account?            And how many calls are you getting on an average morning?         Okay, let’s just get it right, you’regetting…(intervention).         In your peak of half a billion rand a month.         Right so you get a call in the morning from about a hundred people who say – this is on average – they need cash in various amounts, correct?         Then you watch your bank account for when those funds come in, correct?         Now if there are a hundred that are coming in, in the course of a morning, how do you work out which of those payments relate to which client?        Can I just – sorry, just there, so it wasn’t a requirement of your terms and conditions with your clients that they use a particular reference number?         So sometimes you’d be lucky enough to recognise a reference number that would relate to a particular client.        Would you then regard that as satisfactory indication to you that the cash should be delivered to them?       But sometimes you’d get other references, correct?           Like BK.         And then what would you do when you saw BK come in with 5million rand for example?     Give us a sense of the order of magnitude, how many were telephonic and how many were email, just in aproportion.       Well that’s certainly consistent with what you say at paragraph 5.1.4 because there you only speak about being contacted telephonically by a representative.  So the majority of these requests are coming in on phone correct?       Chair I see we are at the usual time for the tea break, if it’s convenient to adjourn now.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Viljoen we had concluded your evidence at the bottom of page of the affidavit just before the break that is where you were telling us that where you were not sure of the reference you would make telephonic contact back with the clientand check with them whether the money you had received was from them, is that correct?    And then if we go over the page to page 7 you say at paragraph 5.1.4.5. “If the amount and the reference given added up to the amount that was deposited and the reference shown in my bank statement I would certain that the funds belonged to that client and would then be in a position to deliver the funds to the client.”Do you see that?    I just want to explore your statement there that you could be certain of the origin of the funds having adopted this method.  Okay.  How could you be certain as to the origin of the funds by using this method?    But you had asked for no evidence of the bank account from which the funds were paid?    Did you?    But then your system allowed a situation todevelop as we will see it did in some occasions.    Where your client would phone and say, I need R5 million in cash but would then not be the person or entity that in fact deposited money in your account, correct?    So when you say you could be certain that the funds belonged to the client that is not correct, is it?    Well let us explore that.  If the client simplysaid to you telephonically I need R5 million in cash and then subsequently a payment came in in that amount other than phoning the client back for their verbal confirmation you had no other way of checking that this was not proceeds from some other entity, correct?    So you could not be certain that it was that client’s money, could you?    And then what happens next in the sequence?  You can pick that up at 5.1.4.6.   Let us just spend a bit of time on the service provider.  Who was the service provider?    And what is SBV?    And what is it?    So are they like a cash warehouse?    So you are on your understanding of your business a cash in transit business and you receive funds through a deposit into your business’ bank account, correct?    You then take a fee off that amount, correct?    And that fee as I have it from your affidavit was in general .3%, is that correct?   Then you would pay over the nett proceeds to another cash in transit business, correct?    And then that business would pack the funds, the money.    And your drivers would go and collect it, is that correct?    And then what would happen to the funds?    And – apologies Chair.    Because then there would be no need for their client – for the bank’s clients to spend money to pay to you or services like yours.    Ms Viljoen do you as a fact that SBV has no unmarked vehicles?    Thank you.  Let us just get clear.  So you charged a fee of .3%.    Just to follow up on the Chair’s questions.  If this was a transaction just between the client and the bank do you know whether the bank would charge a .3%?    For a cash withdrawal.   So it seems that there are two reasons.  You were charging less and you had unmarked vehicles but to your knowledge you do not know whether SBV did not have unmarked vehicles?    Thank you.    Do you know whether that could be arranged with the banks?    And then I – as I have it your driver would go and collect from SBV and then would deliver to the client?    Where would they deliver to the client?    And which premises would those be?    And would that be the premises that you had vetted in your site visit originally?   Was that always the case?    Given that the questions come up Chair maybe we can just go to the check list that Ms Viljoen used to complete.  I have that at page 29 of the papers.  This is in Exhibit DD9.  Ms Viljoen is this the check list you would complete with your clients in the vetting process?    And if you see there you have got the name ofthis particular client.  You have got an ID number, you have an income tax number, this is what you went through with us in your previous evidence.  And then you have an address there as well, do you see that?    So is that the address that you vetted for the purposes of this client?      I think you say that later in your affidavit.  So this is your record associated with this client insofar as your vettingwas concerned, is that right?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  We will return to that a littlebit later when we get into the details of that particular client.  But let us just understand.  Now in the sequence we have got your unmarked armed vehicles going to deliver to the address which is reflected on your check list for any client, correct?    And then what would happen when they reached the premises?    Can I just ask above that I forgot.  At 5.1.4.8    How was that possible?    But you would be able through the bag at least to see the…   The packs?    But it would be more or less…    Because of course if there was an error in putting together one pack you would not know that?    Would your drivers do a general check?    For the amounts that were being delivered.    And then the funds are handed over as I have the evidence and there is some delivery slip that is signed.    What happens to those slips?    Well…    And let us just look at one of those slips if we may?  You have it at page – it is – you will find it at 24 in Exhibit DD9.    Is that your standard delivery slip?    Is this the same one you used throughout the business of AMFS?    Let us just look at the bottom one.  That is a delivery slip dated the 12 April 2016, is that correct?    And how much in cash was delivered to that client on that day?    R15 million in cash and the client is – what isthe client there?  Or who is the client?    And what is that notation under company stamp?    Chair it actually it.  With respect so if I may just follow up there?    I understand you to say that you needed to use a code because of concerns about security related to where the monies were being delivered, is that correct?    Because it could not be the identity of the client because the client’s identity is here.    Right?     I mean anyone who picks this up knows that R5 million has been delivered to Mr G Markides, correct?    So as I understand from your affidavit the code is to anonymise the delivery address?   Correct?  And can I be clear…    Right.     There would be speaking over the radio?    Of the actual location?    And address where it was going?    So let us just move into the world of cash in transit.  You have your people in the armoured vehicles and you say theR15 million it has to go to 1010 and then they would know what that means?    And if we go to your check list which is at page 29 can I assume 1010 is associated with the address that you take down.    With the check list which is 23 Whitakers Way.    So your drivers would know this is a 1010delivery and they would know to take it to 23 Whitakers Way because it is a delivery for Mr G Markides.    Is that a fair summary?    Ms Viljoen there are some other delivery slips that you provided as an annexure to your affidavit to the FSB you will find those commencing at page 54, 54.     Yes.    We will give you those.    Apologies Chair we will give you a lever arch which may be preferable.    If we just go to page 54 those as I have it from your FSB affidavit are some other delivery slips related to the particularinvestigation that they were conducting, is that correct?    The copies here Chair at page 54 are very bad.  You can barely make out what is said there.  So we contacted Ms Viljoen about it and she has kindly made available to us the originals of those delivery slips which I have in my hand at the moment.  I do appreciate that being provided to us.  What I just note here is these slips are slightly different to the previous ones.  In fairness to you there is a whole was so I am just going to suggest that we hand a few to Ms Viljoen and a few to yourself Chair so we can all be looking at asimilar type.  It is just about how these delivery slips change over.    It is just about how these delivery slips change over time if I may.  We will then make copies of these for the purposes of the record Chair so that they – we can have the better copies in the bundle.    The only point of distinction it seems to me Ms Viljoen and I would be interested in your comment on it is if we go back to the ones at page 24 just for comparison purposes you will see under delivery there you seem to have a stamped number under the line Dell.    And then under the section for company stamp is written in hand 1010 on both of the delivery slips that appear on page 24.  Is that correct?   If you look at the originals that we have circulated there is nothing under company stamp, is that correct?    But under Dell is written 1010?    Is there any significance to attach to that change?    I understand thank you.  That is helpful.  And can I just ask these delivery slips which you still have the originals of these did not form part of what went to the liquidators, did they?    So you made copies of some of the documents you handed to the liquidators and retained the originals but in other cases you did not retain the originals.    What guided that choice?    But you were happy to hand over all the rest in their original form?    Thank you.      If we return then to this process which we are about to complete it is back at page 8 of your affidavit.  You will see if you pick it up at paragraph 5.1.4.11 you talk about what happens after the delivery slip has been signed, can you take us through that?    And then in the last paragraph under that section of the affidavit you talk about how you would reconcile all of this at the end of the month, how would that work?    And if we go to page 26 I understand that to one example of the type of reconciliation you would do.    And what we see there is at various dates over the month of May 2015, is that correct?    You would have an amount deposited, an amount delivered, a service fee, excluding and including, what does that mean?    And then what does that last column read?    So what you took out of the proceeds is reflected as amounts including and excluding VAT in the third and fourth columns, is that correct?   And do you would that on a monthly basis as I understand your affidavits?    Just before we get into the detail of the three transactions that are pertinent for the investigation that the commission has embarked upon can I just check in relation to the delivery slips to Mr Markides that are the subject matter I understand your evidence to be you did not – you do not have those delivery slips, why was that?    Right but you still managed to do a reconciliation I assume?    What did you rely on then?    Thank you.  I would then like to move at page 8 of the affidavit to the section beginning paragraph 6 because this is where you start to deal with your business relationship with Mr Markides …   And if we can pick it up at paragraph 6.2 you    And you say   Can I just get clarity?  Who was your client – Dedrego or …?    George the - the person?    George the person was your client and when you say there that it traded under one of two business …    So the client was Markides.  Let me say in fairness to you that is consistent with the checklist because it is George Markides who is the client.  It is his ID number.  It is his income tax number and it is the address that you vetted for him.  Correct?    And then you say   I just would like to go to your FSB affidavit - if we may - at page 44.    If we look at paragraph 5.20.2 on that page you    Is ITH the only trading name that you are awareof or is it both Dedrego and ITH?    What signature was that?    But then it is not correct to say at paragraph 5.20.2 that the business is known to you only as ITH.    And at the time that you did the FSB affidavit they were known to you only as ITH.  Is that correct?    So it is not correct to say that they were only known to you as ITH?    Thank you; but …    Did - did you make inquiries to confirm that?    So you might have now been dealing with a different business.  Might you not?    So you must continue to invoice Dedrego?    Despite the fact that you notice a name changeor some other different business that you dealing with?    And you were satisfied to continue to invoice in the old name albeit that that is not what is appearing on the communications?    but you made no inquiries as to the nature …    Of that business?    And that is why I have your evidence to be the client was Mr Markides.  Correct?    Thank you.  If we then go over to page 9 of the affidavit.    The Commission – indeed Chair.  Apologies we – there are three.  So it is useful to be a bit more specific.    It is the affidavit to the Commission which you will find in EXHIBIT DD9 at page 9.  You begin at paragraph 6.3 there talking about your interactions with Mr Markides and the processes you followed for taking him on as a client and vetting him.  That we do needto spend a bit of time on because it is Mr Markides’ transactions or purported transactions in the amount of R9 million that this Commission is concerned with.  So if I may you start at paragraph 6.3.1 and you    What does it mean when you say there I was lead to believe that his business was a trading house?    No certainly but who led you to believe that?    So is that when you were making inquiries as to his business …?    Why was his business relevant if he was client?   But you were not then vetting the business?  You were vetting Mr Markides.  Is that correct?    So this was just part of the conversation?    What does he do in the week and …    He told you he had a trading house buying goods in South Africa and exporting them but it was not of concern to you to vet that business.  Was it?    Unfortunately …    Right.    I think the answer is no.    You did not vet the business?    And if we go down you say I also confirm this is    But you continued to engage in business with him?    And then at 6.3.3 you say that   Is that the only premises that you visited in relation to Mr Markides?    And what business did you see been conducted there?    Are you sure about that?    At that address?    Do you know that your deliveries were not to 23 Whittakers Way according to your delivery – your invoices?   But your invoices indicate that the deliveries were to another address?    So – so let me just get clear here.  You – you know that they have two premises …    But you only vet one of them?    But none of your invoices reflect the 23 Whittaker’s Way address as the delivery?    Then I do not understand why your invoice would reflect a delivery address which is not the address to which the deliveries were made?    Let us go to your invoices for this client.    We will find one of them at page 25.  This is an invoice arising from your business relationship with Mr Markides.  Is that correct?    Am I correct in saying that this page makes no reference to Mr Markides anyone?    It refers to what seems to be an entity calledDedrego.  Correct?    Not that a business that you ever vetted?    No but Ms Viljoen I spent some time being very clear about who your client was …    And who you were concerned to vet …    And that is Mr Markides as I have your evidence.    His income tax number, his cellphone, his address?    Right and this invoice indicates that you are delivering for Dedrego to 56 Watt Street.  Correct?  There is no reference to this on 23 Whittaker’s Way.  Correct?    Why would you allow invoices to be prepared for a customer who incorrectly reflected who the customer was and where the proceeds in millions of Rands were being delivered?    Yes.  So why do the invoices for Mr Markides who was your client not reflect that as the delivery?    Ms Viljoen the difficult that invoices that reflect the wrong facts create is that in a situation where you are an accountable institution under FICA precisely what you do to vet your clients is extremely important.  Do you accept that?    And particular because businesses that move half a billion Rand a month need to be on the lookout for amongst other things whether they are involved in facilitating money laundering.  Correct?    Do you then accept that in a business where the relationship is with a natural person and an address of that natural person has been vetted but invoices are prepared in relation to the trading name through which he is conducting business and another delivery address you are creating a false impression of the nature of the business relationship.    Thank you.  If we …    Thank you Chair.  Ms Viljoen when you went to Whittaker’s Way were they operating from a house?    Because Whittaker’s Way is a residential street?    But at that stage your client was Mr Markides. Correct?    So it was relevant to vet the address he gave you.  Correct?    And as I have your evidence previously you made no inquiries whatever about the source of the funds that Mr Markides was depositing into your account?    We will go to …    Well Ms Viljoen I FICA’d him is something that I am going to have some difficulty with.  What – what does that mean?    That is fine.    And then there is a promise I think that it would not but I certainly will not hold that against Ms Viljoen.    Indeed.    Hm.   I think we should possibly do that Chair just for convenience.    Ms Viljoen just to be clear we have used another file we had on hand.  Please do not look at the spine because it relates to another witness but it is just for convenience purposes …    That we will give it to you in this form.    Well …   Let us put the other one there in case.    I – I said I wanted to pick up on your statement that you FICA’d the client because we will go to the section shortly but amongst the legal obligations you had as an accountable institution was to establish the source of funds of any of your clients and I have your evidence to be you did not do so.    Ms Viljoen calling them and confirming with them that a payment has been made is different to establishing from them where they sourced the funds that they are going to transact with you on.  Do you see that difference?    And you made no inquiries as to the source of the millions of Rands that Mr Markides was asking you to deliver in cash (intervenes) business relationship?    Who is them?    No, you have explained it Ms Viljoen but there is a difficulty with that answer because your onerous obligations underFICA require you to know where funds are coming from when you transact with a business as an accountable institution.  Do you accept that?    We will come to the legal obligations in duecourse.  For present purposes you did not check funds.  You understand Mr Markides was your client and you did not vet his businesses.  Correct?    And in terms of the amounts associated with Mr Markides you indicate in your affidavit that they compromise less than one percent of the business of AMFS.  Is that correct?    But that is still millions of Rands.  Is it not?    I did a quick tally of the delivery slips that were relevant to the FSB affidavit.  It seemed to be in the order of an excess of 20 million.  Is that a fair computation on my part?    Possibly 30.   And then at least nine million in relation to the transactions that we are interested in?    Thank you and if we …    Oh yes.  The answer there was yes.    Let us then please move to your interactions with the Hawks and you will find those in the affidavit to the Commission in EXHIBIT DD9 at page 11.    That is the file that you are in.    And it is at page 11.  You begin at paragraph    Please say yes.    And the next paragraph you say   Ms Viljoen you did know though in March 2018 about Koreneka.  Did you not?    Oh.  Well when Mr Judeel engaged you in December 2018 had the other issues around Mr Markides arisen yet?    So you had an interaction with a private investigator for whom you prepared an affidavit detailing and providing all your records of your delivery slips with Mr Markides and its association with Koreneka but when you were contacted in March 2018you had forgotten the reference to Koreneka.  Is that your evidence?    Thank you and then you go on in that – on that page to explain the extent of your interactions with the Hawks and steps that you took in relation to the particular transactions that they were interested in.  Can you tell us what those were?    Yes.  In …         Ms Viljoen, as I understand your evidence there’s something that you do between the call from captain Mogosi? and then meeting up with her and her colleague at the restaurant at Bedfordview and that involves an interaction with Ms Lisa Zogby is that correct?          Who is Lisa Zogby?         So what did you do in relation to her?         Okay let’s just go back in the evidence, I understand you didn’t have copies of the delivery slips yourself because of that heist.         Is that your evidence?         And then when you got contacted by Captain Mogosi, you then took steps to try and get the client’s counter copy of the other copy, is that correct?         And then you made contact with Ms Zogby for that purpose.         And just tell us precisely what happened then? MS KALANDRA        Did she send it or did you collect it?         And then what happened with those slips?        At that meeting?         Okay I just want to go to the question of your retention of the deliver notes and for that purposed I’d like to go to your affidavit of December 2017 which you find commencing at page 91 of the Exhibit DD9 and if you go down at page 92, it’s the second page of that affidavit to paragraph 7 you say there,“According to my delivery notes, the funds were delivered asfollows”,And then you detail what happened on the 8 t h of May and what happened on the 16 t h of September, I’m just not sure I understand what delivery notes you were looking at there?      Ms Viljoen you did give evidence that you didn’t write it but you did give evidence that you read it before you signed it, correct?         So this is an error in it’s recordal?         You didn’t have delivery notes?      So you engage Ms Zogby because you want tosee if she has copies.          And did you satisfy yourself as to the delivery notes and their authenticity before you handed them over to the Hawks?         What period of time lapse between you collecting them and you meeting with the…(intervention).         And can we go to those documents that you say were in the brown envelope.         You’ll find them at page 64 are those – and they comprise three pages as I have your evidence, it’s 64, 65 and 66 correct.         Are these accurate copies of what you sawin the brown envelope?         And are these your delivery notes?         Do you have any other knowledge about these documents?         You say in your affidavit that you think…(intervention).      As I have your evidence, Ms Viljoen you speculate at paragraph- if we return in your affidavit to page 12 you say at paragraph 4. – sorry 6.4.3.13 on that page,“I confirm having now considered these slips and once againreiterate that the slips are not my documents and I’m unable tocomment on same, further than to state that I believe that theymay well be evidence of the on-delivery of funds once AMFShad delivered same”,Do you see that?           What is the basis for your comment there?         I’m asking why you said what you said in this paragraph, why do you surmise that they have to do with on-delivery?        Were those facts that were established in the SME bank of Namibia case?         So he transacted with you but then he made those funds available to a third party?         So it’s on that basis that you regard these as evidence of the onward movement of the cash.         If we then move over to page 13 we are finally, Chair, going to arrive at the transactions that are relevant to theinvestigation, the background, I submit has been important though to understand the manner in which the business was operating.  As I have it Ms Viljoen there were three transactions related to matters involving Koroneka a close company, is that correct?        I’d like to suggest that we just go to the bank statements to pick up where those payments were received by AMFS, the first of those you’ll find at page 70, is this your CC’s bank statement?        And you were banking at that point with Nedbank correct?      If you go to the fourth line on that page, you’ll see a date 08/05/2015 and then you’ll see a next column that is headed, description or narrative, do you see that?         What is reflected as the description or narrative for that…(intervention).         Koroneka…(intervention).        Under description or narrative, please read out to us what is reflected there.         Just to get that 06/05/2015 correct.         And if we move across to credits, what is the amount that comes into your bank account?         Okay so let’s stop there.  You’ve told us a lot about how you would check payments that came in to verify who wassending you the amounts, so when Koroneka and a date two days prior to this date came into your account, that didn’t cause you concern, that it might have been from a source other than Mr Markides?         Why not?         Right and then the second one on that page, you’ll find…(intervention).        If we look on that page 70 for the second relevant transaction for our purposes, Ms Viljoen and Chair you’ll find it just beyond midway down that page there’s another entry on the 11 t h of May 2015 that reads Koroneka, do you see that Ms Viljoen?        And what was the amount deposited on the11 t h of May?           And then if we go over to page 74 – apologies not 74, 84 you’ll see again, just below halfway down that page there’s an entry for the date 16 September and the description is BK, do you see that?         Do you confirm – well what is the amount of that…(intervention).         Apologies, it’s very difficult to find it Chair if you…(intervention).       Yes in the description column, Chair if youtrack the description column down just below halfway you’ll see a BK.      And the amount there Ms Viljoen?           5million and these three amounts reflecting Koroneka on the 8 t h of May, Koroneka on the 11 t h of May and BK on the 16 t h of September, have you satisfied yourself, all relate to payments from Koroneka?         And not from Mr Markides?        All 2015 Chair.         Chair we’re going to look, in a moment in Ms Viljoen’s evidence at the flow of funds diagram because those dates become relevant when we look back at the evidence that’s been given previously about when precisely funds came in to Koroneka and when this total of 9million came out but we’ll get to that at an appropriate point, with your leave, and Ms Viljoen I’d then like to take you, if we may, to page 14, the next page of your affidavit.         And pick it up at 3.- sorry at 7.3.7 because here you pick up the point about yourself not being in possession of the delivery slips, page 14 Chair.       Page 14.       And we are at paragraph 7.3.7.      You say there,“Although I’m not in possession of the delivery slips relating tothe three deliveries, I confirm that the funds were delivered toMarkides at his place of business and Lisa Zogby confirmedthis by sending their version of the receipts”,Do you see that Ms Viljoen?            When you say at his place of business there, what place do you mean?         You know that for certain?         But following on from the Chair’s line of questioning earlier you don’t know that as a fact do you?        Despite what was reflected on the invoices?         Ms Viljoen I then want to move to paragraph 7.3.9 and 7.3.10 on that page because you make some – what I want to suggest are concluding remarks there after your affidavit has  detailed the facts of your engagemnts with Mr Markides and your processes.  At paragraph 7.3.9 you state,“I wish to record that I took all steps necessary to establishMarkides’ identity and confirmed same by obtaining a copy ofhis identity document, I obtained his income tax number andpersonally inspected his business premises, and then the nextparagraph, I never received any cash at all from Markides andI further confirm that the transactions in question were run ofthe mill for cash in transit business and did not seemsuspicious at all”,Do you stand by those statements?         I then – I kept promising in the course of your evidence that we would finally go to FICA and look at the various obligations that you had as an accountable institution.  Chair with your leave I’d like to go there.         You’ll find the relevant provisions in the legislation bundle under tab 5 which contains the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001 and where I’d like to suggest we start, is at page 122 of – within that Act.  Ms Viljoen, we’ve already established in your evidence the importance placed on…(intervention).        122 in the top right pagination, do you have that Chair?       We’ve already covered in your evidence the responsibility that accountable institutions have to take steps to guard against money laundering, you accept that?      And you had taken legal advice that you were an accountable institution under FICA in the form of a money remitter,correct?            So we start with what the FICA requirements are on that page at section 21, you have to among other things – I’m going to summarise, just for the purposes of the efficiency of the evidence, what section 21 is concerned with is your need to establish and verify the identity of the client, that’s under 21 (1) A, do you see that?         And then if you go down to 21A you’re also required to understand and obtain information on the business relationship, do you see that, and what you have there is the following,“When an accountable institution engages with a prospectiveclient to establish a business relationship as contemplated inSection 21, the institution must, in addition to the stepsrequired under 21, and in accordance with it’s riskmanagement compliance programme, obtain information toreasonably enable the accountable institution to determinewhether future transactions that will be performed in thecourse of the business relationship concerned,  are consistentwith the institutions knowledge of that prospective clientincluding information describing a) the nature of the businessrelationship concerned, b) the intended purpose of thebusiness relationship concerned, c) the course of the fundswhich the prospective client expects to use in concludingtransactions in the course of the business relationshipconcerned”,Do you see that?         And I have it as your prior evidence that you did not at any point, establish the source of funds as you were required to do under section 21A (C) is that correct?        The source of funds that the prospective client expects to use in concluding the transaction, let’s break it down in fairness.         Your client is transacting with you, is it not by depositing an amount in your account.        So what this section – if we read that section in plain terms it’s saying you must establish where the source of funds for that transaction with you is coming from, do you see that?         Did you receive legal advice to that effect?         Just to go back to the language of 21 A (C) you’ll see that it says that what you need to establish is the source of the funds which that prospective client expects to use in concluding transactions in the course of the business relationship.  So source of funds are where they got, what they are going to use in transacting withyou, do you see that reading?         You didn’t see that reading at any point previously?         If we go over the page to page 123 the next relevant obligation is at 21 (C) right at the bottom of the page, it’s a requirement to do ongoing due diligence, were you aware of that obligation?      And you’ll see, we’ve had this reference before, there’s a constant reference in this section to a risk management and compliance programme that each accountable institution has to develop, had you developed one of those?            If you look at section 21 (C) it begins,“An accountable institution must, in accordance with it’s riskmanagement and compliance programme”,And then it goes on to talk about the various steps you take to do a due diligence.  What I’m interested in, we’ve had that reference to the risk management and compliance programme in the previous section we were looking at, and I’m just asking, did you develop a risk management and compliance programme in your business?         Are you aware that, that’s anotherrequirement of accountable institutions under FICA?         Please give the answer now?         Thank you, if we speak at the same time, the record can’t pick it up.        And then 21 (E) is fairly important for the conducting of your business Ms Viljoen because what 21 (E) provides is that if an accountable institution is unable to do certain things, and I’llgo into it in detail, it may not establish a business relationship with any client and let’s look at what you have to have in terms of this section before you can conduct business.  You have to establish and verify the identity of the client or other relevant person, that’s a) under b) you have to obtain the information contemplated in 21 (A) you’ll recall that’s the section dealing with source of funds and you have to conduct an ongoing due diligence as contemplated in 21 (C) which we’ve just been looking at and if you fail to do any of those three things under (i) you may not establish a business relationship or conclude a single transaction with a client, do you see that?        Ms Viljoen your evidence has been that you did not take those steps, correct?           So this section means you were prohibitedfrom establishing any business relationship or concluding any transaction with any of the clients in respect of whom you did not take those steps, do you see that?         Thank you, if we go over the page to section 125, those are the sections there dealing with the duty to keep records.  I indicated to you earlier in the evidence that we’d go back to those sections.  In summary form, and I’m happy to go to the actual text if you want to, but what sections 22 and 22 (A) indicate is that you must keep records of the due diligences that are done and you mustalso keep transaction records, were you aware of that obligation?         And then at section 23 it makes clear that those records have to be kept for a period of at least five years under sub (a), do you see that?         I take it you were not aware of that obligation either?         And then Ms Viljoen if we go over to page 129 – Chair I see we are at 1 o’clock there are one or two aspects just to complete on FICA, with your leave I suggest we do that and then take the break.       So at page 129 there’s a section dealing withsuspicious and unusual transactions, that’s section 29, do you see that?        Chair this section is one of the sections of FICA that actually is not confined to accountable institutions, most of the sections of the Act place obligations on accountable institutions and that’s why we’ve been engaging with Ms Viljoen because she understood herself to be an accountable institution.  Section 29 is actually much broader, it applies to any person who carries on a business or is in charge of or manages a business or who is employedby a business and who knows or ought reasonably to have known or suspected certain things.  I only preface the question   with that so that we understand this is an obligation that accountable institutions and others have under FICA and what you’re required to do , Ms Viljoen  as any person who carries on a business is to make a report to the Financial Intelligence Centre if in the course of your business you come across what are called suspicious and unusual transactions,  were you aware of this provision of the Act and the obligations it placed on you?         But I had your evidence earlier that you didn’t look at the guidance notes ever that were published by FICA is that right?         Did you ever make a suspicious or unusual transaction report to the FIC in the course of your business       But you were aware of the obligation to do so?          You’ll see that one of the examples of a suspicious or unusual transaction which you’re required to report on, under (B) is a transactional series of transactions to which the business is a party (i) facilitated or is likely to facilitate the transfer of the proceeds of unlawful activities or property which is connected to an offence relating to the financing of terrorist or related activities and (b)it’s a transaction that has no apparent business or lawful purpose, do you see that?         And then under (c) there one of the other suspicious or unusual transactions are transactions where the business has been used or is about to be used for money laundering purposes, do you see that?         So if you had been alerted to the fact that your business was being used for any of these purposes, you did know that you had an obligation to report it, correct?         Chair just to conclude this point the guidance note which is of relevance is the one that appears at 159.1 of this bundle and the relevant page you’ll find at 159.14 and you’ll see onthat page, Ms Viljoen there’s a heading, Unusual Business, do you see that?        Just to give you the benefit of this part of the notice, what the FIC is doing in this guidance note it, it’s trying to provide financial – well accountable institutions and others with guidance as to what they should be on the lookout for, for suspicious and unusual transactions and you’ll see under that heading, Unusual Business, there’s a  list bulleted of the types of unusual businesses that you should be on the lookout for and it’s the first one that I’minterested in,  deposits of funds with the request for the immediate transfer elsewhere. Ms Viljoen that’s a description of your business, isn’t it?          Thank you, Chair there will be a few questions to follow up on after the break I don’t imagine that they will take long, but if it’s convenient we can take the lunch break now.    Thank you Chair.  Chair we took the liberty over the break of replacing your and Ms Viljoen’s soft cover files into a lever arch file which should make.   The remainder of the afternoon’s proceedings a little bit easier.    Chair I want to pick up if I may with that point about unusual business practices that we ended before the break with Ms Viljoen but before doing that Ms Viljoen in fairness to you the transactions that this commission is concerned about took place in 15, is that correct?    Those were the two in May and the one in September, correct?    We have been through a number of provisions of FICA as we calling it colloquially and in fairness to you I must place on record that some of those obligations arose pursuant to an amendment in the Act in 2017 which was after the transactions that are relevant to the work of the commission.  I do want to state that.  What is clear though is that the ones that operated at the time required adequate steps to be taken to identify and verify the identity of your clients and I take it to be your evidence that you are now satisfied that the steps you took were not adequate, is that correct?    But you had no way of knowing that another entity was in fact transacting with you, right?   Yes.  So you did not know that it was not Mr Markides depositing R2 million into your account on the 6 May 2015, correct?    The obligations to keep the records was present at the time and I understand you to say you did not know of that obligation at the time?    Oh.    Well that may be relevant to the commission’s further investigation but we will be in touch with you in due course.  I would then like to pick up this point that we ended on where we were looking at the guidelines of the financial intelligence centre about suspicious and unusual transactions and we looked at page 159.14 of the legislation bundle and the question I asked just before the break was the first unusual business that is described by FICA as requiring the possible reporting obligation under Section 29 to arise is deposits of funds with a request for their immediate transfer elsewhere, you will recall that?    And just for absolute clarity that Section 29 obligation to report suspicious and unusual transactions operated in15 and you were aware of it as I have your evidence?    And we said is that not a description of your business and after a little bit of a pause I had your evidence to be yes it was.    I would like to probe that just a bit further because I want to suggest to you that despite your description of your business as a cash in transit service it may well not have been that and let me do so in the following way and I would like your comment on howI am describing a run of the mill cash in transit business.  Okay so it seems to me cash in transit works when for example retailers who have a need for cash in order to conduct their businesses need to deposit cash at the end of the day with their banks and so they need somebody to transport all of that cash that they have on site to the bank so that their funds – those funds can be credited to their account, does that sound like part of what cash in transit businesses traditionally do?    So end of a day of retail they take the money from the retailer to its bank so that its bank account can be credited, correct?    It seems to me those retailers may also need funds maybe at the start of a week or a day because they need so many R5 coins and so many R10 notes and so they engage with their bankand they to the bank I need this much to be withdrawn from the account in these denominations and then the bank procures somebody to bring it to them, does that sound accurate to you?    Are you aware that the Financial Intelligence Centres Guidance Notes on money remitters only identify banks and entities engaged in foreign exchange as potential money remitters under the Act?    You see cash in transit businesses do not enterinto transactions the traditional ones.  Do you accept that?    On the description I have given there is no transaction that it is involved in because all it does is literally move money from the retailer to the bank where it is going to be credited against its account or from the bank where it has been withdrawn to the retailer, do you understand that?    The reason why this is important is because any entities that receive deposits of money from the general public and then have an agreement to repay those funds over time to the clients from whom they receive them are actually operating the business of a bank, are you aware of that?      Okay let us just go in fairness to thosesections of the Banks Act because what they tell us is what the business of a bank and what a deposit means and you will find that under the last tab of the legislation bundle.  And it commences Chair at page 221.      And the relevant section I would like to look at first is at page 234.  And that is where we find the definition of a business of a bank and under A it means the acceptance of deposits from the general public including persons in the employ of the person so accepting deposits as a regular feature of the business in question. Ms Viljoen is that not a description of your business?      Let us look at the definition of deposit.  You will find that at page 227.      You will see – apologies. You will see midway    Ja.  Do you see that?   Is that what your business was doing?    Um…    Yes.    Indeed.    Correct.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Yes.    Certainly not Chair with respect.  If I may just respond in the following way.  What is peculiar about the traditional cash in transit business that I was debating with Ms Viljoen is that there is no deposit into an account of the cash in transit business.  It goes and it literally moves money between a client and its bank.  The bank…    Physically.    It takes that – those hard notes and coins ifthey are ever interested in coins and it takes it from location A to location B or the reverse.    That is like SBV indeed.    Indeed.  And Chair with respect that is an important analogy because the arrangement of Ms VIljoen’s business that we have been discussing today puts her in no different position to the four big banks.    Because the banks can receive deposits by EFT and they can give cash to their client using SBV.    As I understand AMFS’s business model it sits in exactly the same position.   It receives deposits.    There is a transaction.    Which enables it.    Electronically in the main as I understand it.    To receive the money.   And then it gets the cash from SBV but uses its own vehicles to then deliver those.    It is not I want to submit and have your comment Ms Viljoen in the position of the traditional cash in transit business with whom no deposits are being made and no transactions are being entered to, do you accept that?    Ms Viljoen the…    Yes.    Yes.   No not necessarily.    It is credits and debits against accounts.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.  And Chair if I may in that respect there are transactions.    But what I must be clear on is they would not constitute deposits.    In the sense that the Banks Act is concerned.    Unless…    The relationship is as and I will describe it now in simplified terms if I may?  Entity A or person A only engages in a deposit with Entity B.  If there is a transfer of funds and there is an agreement between those two entities that that amount will be repaidback.    To person A.    Pursuant to certain aspects of the agreement.    Maybe interest, maybe not.    Maybe over time but just transactions of EFT nature between businesses are not deposits.   They are deposits when you are acting like a bank.    You are holding the money of someone.    And pursuant to arrangements you make giving that back to them as when they require it.    And it is that feature of AMFS that I have suggested to Ms Viljoen constitutes the business of a bank.    Indeed.  Exactly.    Chair certainly deposit as we read it there.    Means an amount of money paid by one person to another.    The Act does not specify the method ofpayment.    Historically it may have been cheques, earlier than that cash or even earlier than that some other matters.    But – indeed – indeed, but…    The essence of the arrangement I would submit is that one person pays to another person through whatever means an amount of money that is going to be repaid back to them.    On certain conditions and terms.  Ms Viljoen the consequence of that is that if indeed AMFS was conducting the business of the bank it would have to be registered as a bank, are you aware of that?   Okay well the Banks Act we do not need to go into the provisions but it requires any entity doing that receiving deposits and ensuring that they are repaid subject to whatever terms are agreed between the entities have to be registered.  But I take it you were not aware of that until now?    Right.  And the Act goes further and makes it clear that conducting the business of a bank without registration is a criminal offence.  It also provides that conducting the business of abank without registration may result in all of the proceeds that were obtained in the course of that business being required to be repaid, were you aware of those provisions?    Ms Viljoen I would then like to move just to what we can make of your evidence in relation to the monies from Koreneke.  As I have it and I am putting this to you for your comment if there is any part of my summary that you disagree with.  Your evidence as I have it is that you were misled by Ms Markides that an amount of R9 million that was paid to you came from him, is that correct?    And you have subsequently established that they did not come from him, correct?    And they came from a business calledKoreneke Trading and Project CC, is that correct?    Chair I would just like to go at this point to the diagram that I mentioned earlier.    Ms Viljoen this is not a diagram that you have prepared it has been prepared by the commission and it simply is a flow of funds to represent graphically how the money arrived in Koreneke and ended up in you and if there is any aspect of it that you disagree with you must please let us know.  You will find it in your bundle rightat the end at page 105 and it will also be reflected on the screens for everyone’s benefit.  I reiterate again this is not information of which you have personal knowledge it is our ability just to track this story together so that it makes sense in the context of the previous that has been received.    At 105.    Of DD9.  Ms Viljoen you will…    You will identify AMFS beneath Koreneke.    In the middle right?  That is the only part of this that you could speak to and I will take you to in a moment.  But Chair this is just a further extension of the diagram we looked on onSaturday because on Saturday we got up to AMFS in the evidence of Ms Tlatsana.    And so what we have done is we have added a few further lines.    As the evidence is progressed.    We felt it appropriate only to stop at the point of Ms Tlatsana’s evidence on Saturday.   And now having the benefit of Ms Viljoen’s evidence we continue with those lines further down.    So just to orientate you Ms Viljoen you have got a diagram on the top left representing the North West Government.  And you have got represented by red lines on that page the monies that come out of the North West Government, do you see that?    And you will see that sometimes the money out of the North West goes to South African Express which is in the top right hand corner.    And from South African Express it goes into Koreneke, you see that amount of R31 million.   Or it goes directly from the North West Government into Koreneke and that is the line representing 2.606335 million, do you see that?    That is all evidence that we have received previously in the commission.  At then sits in Koreneke about 51 million in total and from Koreneke it is distributed to various entities.  If I work from the left of the page there is a payment to an entity called Elskakol then a payment for what is described as management consulting.  Thena payment to an individual referred as Mr Papitas and then we have the payment of R9 million to AMFS, do you see that?    And your evidence has confirmed that those funds were received by Koreneke.    And then this is the part that you can speak to is the line in green going down from that.  That is a payment on 9 million as you understood it being made to Mr Markides, correct?    Well to be absolutely accurate it is an amount slightly less than 9 million because you took off a fee.    It is a small bit less than that and then the question is where does it go from there and all that you have been ableto offer in that regard are those delivery slips that you receive from Ms Zogby is that correct?    Thank you.  We will continue Chair with the Neosolutions lines after the evidence on Thursday.      But that just assists to graphically track the flow of funds in this case.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    Correct.    Chair that is the force of some of the questions I put to Ms Viljoen at the commencement of today.    Because rendering unlawfully obtained proceeds into cash really does stop the trail often because then you do not have transactions in bank accounts that can be tracked.  And it iswhy I suggested to Ms Viljoen that any businesses involved in cash should be on high alert for their possible involvement in the facilitation of money laundering.      Because you change – you engage in a series of transactions to hide in a sense the origination of the funds.    And their ultimate end point.    Indeed.   Ms Viljoen just to return to you we established from your evidence that you have subsequently learnt that those funds were deposited to you by an entity called Koreneke, correct?    And your evidence also is that you never vetted Koreneke as a client, correct?    And the consequence of that is that there was a business transaction between AMFS and Koreneke without any vetting been done of that client, correct?    And your evidence is that you did nonetheless deliver R9 million in cash less your fee to what you understood to be Mr Markides’ appointed premises, correct?   And you also – the only knowledge you have after that point are the delivery slips provided by Ms Zogby is that correct?    Thank you.  Ms Viljoen those are the essence of the submissions that – at least the questions that I wanted to ask of you today.  Chair there are or two concluding submissions I propose to make just to in relation to the upshot of Ms Viljoen’s evidence and it is a look down the line to the possible types of recommendations.   That the commission may consider making.    And if I may just take a moment on that?    And Ms Viljoen of course if there is any aspect of what I say that you want to offer comment on afterwards you will be given an opportunity to do that.  Chair the concern arising I submit from the nature of the AMFS business is that it really was acting as a bank in the pursuit of its work.  But a bank that was not regulated by the Banks Act at the time and if there are others operating in a similar way it will be our recommendation in due course that one of the recommendations that this commission considers making is that the entities responsible for regulation of the Banks Act that being the Reserve Bank and the Registrar of banks or indeed the FICA Act, theFinancial Intelligence Centre be mandated to investigate these type of businesses in closer detail. Because what we have established through this evidence is that there was an operation carrying at its peak more than half a billion rands of funds.  And if this commission is to have some chance of establishing where some of the public funds that we know were unlawfully obtained ended up it may well be that these types of entities need to be investigated further.  If there is a way to check where public funds pursuant to state capture corruption and fraud went it may well be it will be our recommendation that these oversight bodies need to look into these types of entities.   Chair it was for that reason that we asked Ms Viljoen at the outset whether she knew of other businesses that were engaged in a similar type of business model.    Her answer in fairness to her was she knows that the industry of cash in transit is quite big but through the questions today it is my submission that we have established that the business was not a traditional cash in transit business.    But at least Rustin Stone we have as her evidence operated in a similar manner.  Ms Viljoen are you aware whether Rustic Stone continues to operate?    And are you aware of any others in the industrythat operate on the same business model as matters stand currently?    Right and you sold that out at the end of 2017, is that correct?    So that business actually does continue to operate does it?    But it was a sale of business transaction so we could investigate that further?    Thank you.      Indeed.    Indeed they have extensive powers.    Because the whole point about bank regulation.    Is that it is done pursuant to extremely.    Rigorous processes.    You cannot operate the business of a bank lawfully in this country.    Without being registered.    With the Reserve Bank.   And we know as a matter of fact that there are very few entities who are in fact registered.    And Chair I will not take you through all the provisions now but the Banks Act has detailed investigative procedures.    For inspectors.    Whenever there is a suspicion that a business is operating as a bank without being registered as such they can do the investigation, they can take further steps including requiring refunds to those who have deposited with the institutions and then in the background of all of that there are the criminal processes.    Associated with that conduct.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    In that regard my submission is that there have been ongoing engagements between this commission and both the Reserve Bank.    And the Financial Intelligence… MEETING ADJOURNS   Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    In that regard my submission is that there have been ongoing engagements between this commission and both the Reserve Bank.    And the Financial Intelligence Centre.   They have certainly always been available.    In the course of the investigations to assist.    As they must.    As organs of state the regulations require them to do so.    So that may be a profitable route.    to raise with them even in the interim.    It is as you point out Chair with respect.   Firmly within their mandate.    Indeed.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Viljoen were there anycomments you wanted to make in response?    Thank you Chair.    Chair if I may suggest we have a new witness and there is a bit of a change over that needs to take place would it be appropriate to take a five minute break for that purpose?    Thank you 
MR MARK VAUGHAN:  Thank you Chair I will do that.

MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Kalandra Viljoen.    I do not.    I do.    So help me God.    Okay.    Yes.    No.    Yes.   No Chair.    I do Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    No Chair.    Okay Chair.    I will do that Chair.   Can I add details to this because I did not write this affidavit or this statement?    Someone wrote it for me, Mr Jan Judeel wrote that he asked me to sign it.    Okay sorry my bundle has now fallen apart.    Yes Chair.    Which is covered in my second.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    I have got 14 pages to fix.    Done.    I am done.  It is going in, it is going in and then I am done and it is fixed and I will make sure it does not come undone.    That is fine.    It looks pretty.    Mr Judeel called me and asked for a meeting.    It would have been more or less around this time.    Yes.   And …    He presented himself as a private investigator.    In all honesty I forgot about this until you sent me this statement.  But it was a quick meeting at a Mugg and Bean and he asked me about the transactions.  I went and I looked at this transactions. He took notes.  He wrote the affidavit, he emailed it to me and then I just signed it.    I sent it to him.    I – sorry I might have given it to him but ja I gave it to him.    If memory serves me right yes.    I will have to lie if I answered that I cannot remember.  It was December we had family coming over from overseas so I have to – it was a brief meeting and I cannot remember if he madereference to it or not.    I did see it yes but that does not really mean anything to me.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    No Chair.    I saw it and no he was not with Captain Mogotse    He asked very nicely?    He asked very nicely.  Can you please meet me?    No.    No.    That is correct Chair.    Yes it is Chair.    It was a cash in transit business.    It means that if a business would need money we would deliver the funds for them.    We will pick up the funds from a bank andthen deliver it to clients that might need funds.    Like a G4S.  Yes.    We did not – we did not really do collections.    No.    Yes.    Not to my recollection.    I would say it is big.  G4S, Fidelity, Coin, SBV it is a big industry.    I cannot comment if their business model was the same as mine.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Rustic Stone.    That is correct Chair.    I would say so Chair.    Yes Chair.    I was yes.    I will have to check I cannot remember.    But we had to be part of PSIRA register the company under PSIRA and register all the people that was working under PSIRA and we were.    I would obtain copies of their ID’s, their income tax numbers, all the details required by FICA I would get that from the clients?    Yes.    I do Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Sorry can you just say that?   Yes I tried my best Chair.    Yes Chair.    A money remitter.    A cash in transit business.    Because we remit money.    I did yes Chair.    I did not Chair no.    I do now.  Thank you Chair.    No I have not.  Sorry which page?    151 oh 9.    I have not, no Chair.    That is correct yes Chair.    No Chair.    That is correct yes.    It was a case with Small and Medium Business Bank Namibia and they opened up an inquiry and they …    Yes they did and they then asked for us to hand over our documentation.    From Springs.    Yes Chair.   No Chair.    Gauteng.    Gauteng – yes Chair.    thank you Chair.    We were a small team.    There were four – four drivers.    So it was a small team …    But we were busy.    That is correct Chair yes.    That is correct Chair yes.   I handed over all books and all records.    Yes that is correct.    They have asked for it and I handed it all over.    I do not recall getting a summons.  We were at the Commission of Inquiry and they asked for it and we handed it over.    Everything.    Yes that is correct.  That is correct.    Not yet no.    No they did not.    To the liquidators.  They came and they collected it from my lawyer’s office.    Okay.    I do yes Chair.    It was everything.    It was everything.    It has got the accounting records as well.    Yes.    Well it is all just the accounting records.    So it would have been the bank statements. It would have been receipts.  It would have been – it would have been everything.  Invoicing – it would have been everything.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    It - it should have been in the files.  Yes     I – I literally just took the files.  Actually it was with my bookkeepers in their – in their storage units.  So I went and I just took everything that was with my bookkeepers and I dropped it off at my lawyers and then they collected it.  So everything should have been in those files.    Yes Chair.    That would have been in there yes.    No that would not have been in there no.   I had a separate file for financials Chair.    No I cannot remember but it would have been everything.    It might have been.  I – I cannot confirm.    It – it could have been.  I – I cannot remember what was in that clear folder.  I cannot recall what was in there.  So I – I cannot remember but I gave everything over.    Again you have asked me and I do not think I was subpoenaed to hand over the documents.    Well I was not ordered.  I was asked.   Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    The liquidators.    Yes Chair.   They spoke to both of us …    And they asked us for the files …    And then afterwards they would have spoken to my attorney.    That is correct Chair.    I would have to lie to answer if they askedme that.    Yes.    I gave everything yes Chair.    It might have come across like that Chair.   I am – I am not sure but I do not want to say it came across like that and then it did not and so …    They can have everything.    I just gave everything for in case they might wanted to come back and ask for more.    So I gave them everything.    Yes Chair.   I did not know Chair.    For somethings I did have electronic thing – copies.    No not – not for everything – not nearly everything.    By then the company was liquidated and …    I did not know.    No Chair.    My – my attorney?    I am – I am sure he might have.  I cannot answer.  I am not sure.    I do not know Chair.    Can I – can I answer that in a two point?    So when the business is liquidated liquidators that liquidate the business then take all the files over andthen they are legally apparently not my files anymore.  That is how it was explained to me.  So the business was liquidated and then the files were to go to the people who liquidated the business but then just after that the liquidators of SME asked for those documents.    Sorry.    Yes.  So as it was explained to me that when you liquidate your business then the liquidators of that business takes possession of all your files.    That is how it was explained to me and then afterwards SME liquidators requested for the files and so we handed the files over to them.   We still had to take them to the liquidators.  They were still with my bookkeepers and we still had to take them to the liquidators.    Yes.    It was in the start of 2018.   My bookkeeper still had all my records.    I think it was end of 2018.    Can you repeat that - sorry?    Yes.    I cannot confirm if it was in October but it was end of …    Okay, yes.    That is when we did it, yes.    No they were still with the bookkeepers for some reason.  I do not know why but they were still with the bookkeepers for some reason.    They should have apparently gone.    To my knowledge yes.    No, not to my knowledge.    No.    That is correct Chair.    I do not recall giving instruction.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Hm.    I – I cannot recall if my bookkeeper had to finish things or why it never went.  I – I cannot recall and I do not want to say now that it is for this reason …    Or for that reason but I cannot recall.    They had not asked for it Chair no.    That is how they explained it to me that allmy books will then have to go to them.    That was my bookkeepers.    That is how they explained it to me yes.    No, no they did not say that.    I do not recall saying that.    No Chair.    No Chair.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.  It ended up with the SME liquidators.    Yes.    No.    I – I know it did not reach it Chair.    Yes Chair.    They were a cash in transit business and I – I started with them around 2012 and I finished up – I want to say it was October 2014 I left to start AMFS.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct yes.    One of the clients from Rustic Stone approached me and suggested that I start my own entity.    Hm.    Andries.    Greyvenstein.    And he – he then said he will help with the funding and yes that is how AMFS was started.    That is correct yes.    No role.    He was a member of the CC until I paid back the initial loan and then he – he went off as a member of the CC.    It – it was established around 2015 – January 2015 – and he either left the CC at the end of 2015 or the start of 2016.   Just myself.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    From his premises at the back.    No, no, no.  Eventually I started working from home.    More or less the same time that the business was handed over.    That is correct yes.   That is correct.    It was still registered there and the vehicles would sometimes be parked there but I no longer had my little office there.  If that makes sense.    Right to the end.  Sometimes the vehicles would be parked there yes.  That is correct.    He had premises right next door and he was not using it and he said we can use that to – if we needed to use it we can use it for the parking of the vehicles.    That is correct yes Chair.    No Chair.   About 500 million.    Per month.    That is correct yes.    Oh no I cannot recall that Chair.    Until I sold the business in October 2017 and the final handover was done in November 2017.    And then …    And then yes.    That is fine, ja.   Three years, ja.    2016 was a good year and – and so was 17 as well.  2015 because we had the robbery aand we had to outsource it was profitable but not as much as maybe August 2016 going into 2017.    We can say that yes Chair.    I did Chair.    I did know yes Chair.   I do Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    I do Chair.    I understand and I am comfortable with that yes.    I do yes Chair.    I do Chair.   I do Chair.    New clients would be people who I did not have prior workings with at Rustic Stone where existing clients were clients who came from Rustic Stone to Asset Movement & Financial Services.    It started off where I was doing the administration and then eventually it involved where I was ordering thefunds and I was much more involved in the day to day running and not just …    They never gave me a job title.    That is correct Chair yes.    That would have been the only difference.    I would yes Chair.    I would get their ID number, income tax number, address.  I would go visit the address and make sure that they are who they are.  I normally like to visit the address as well to see if it was a security risk for my – my men to go and do the deliveries.  Iwould get their telephone numbers and that is it.    I would ask them, what do they do, so I didn’t find different sources to verify it but I did sit with them and find out from them if it was a good business, what they do…(intervention).      I never took notes no I was just – it was just a discussion.      No I wasn’t Chair.      If they seemed like a real business, if they seemed – that feeling you get inside of you, that everything’s okay.      Yes because I wanted to do the site visits and see if it was safe.      I would say yes Chair.      That’s right Chair.      No Chair.      No Chair.          That’s correct Chair.      No Chair.      What due diligence would that be Chair?      No Chair.    Everything was in order.        No Chair.      Where are we now?     So in this case, with this specific client Idid send them the terms and conditions but they never sent it back to me signed.      That’s correct yes.      I was just satisfied, I was happy, I was satisfied, they understood the process, I understood the process, I was satisfied Chair.      They signed the terms and conditions.     No Chair.      So let me maybe explain this, the terms and conditions were the same but the contract was not the same.     Just to clarify.       That’s correct yes.     The gist of it was the same correct.      Okay, my client would contact me saying they need a certain amount of funds…(intervention).      With a phone.      I would then compile all of that and send it to the service provider and then they would pack the funds into clear bags and made sure that it’s been counted and then my drivers would go and pick it up and do the deliveries afterwards.      Okay.     That’s correct.      We need a certain amount of funds.    Do you want it now…(intervention).      In detail, okay.      Yes it’s fast.      That’s correct.       It is in the morning.      I wait for the funds to come in…(intervention).     Into the bank account.      That’s correct.      The client.      Yes so they would say to me – they would call and say they need 5million and then they would transfer the 5million into the account – into my bank account.      No, no I’m going to explain the whole situation…(intervention).     They would like to have 5million, they are ordering 5million Chair.      No Chair.      It means that they ordering 5million.     From me.       No Chair, I would then go on and order it from the service provider.      Yes Chair.      It’s SBV and the four banks own SBV.      Yes Chair.      Yes so they would order the funds from meand then they would transfer the funds into my account and then I would transfer it into SBV’s account and then they would pack it and make sure that it is the right quantities as we need it.      Excuse me.      Yes Chair.      Yes Chair.      Yes Chair.      That’s right Chair.     Oh that’s correct yes.      Yes it can’t SBV...(intervention).      Correct yes.      That’s correct yes.     That’s correct yes.         That’s correct, yes Chair.      That’s correct Chair.     So if the funds come into the bank account I will call the client and confirm that it’s their funds and then…(intervention).     I do and I’ve got -  I had the text message alert that comes through as well but I am watching my bank account.      So by then end of 2017 I would get up to a hundred phone calls a day, my phone never stopped.      This was 2017 yes.     It was busy.     That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct yes.      Some of the reference numbers I would recognise but the ones I didn’t I would call the clients and say, money has been deposited in my account, can you confirm the reference and then…(intervention).      No.      Yes.     That’s correct yes.     That’s correct yes.      That’s correct yes.      So the client that would have called saying that they want 5million, I would call them and then confirm whether it’s their funds, what’s the reference they used…(intervention).      That’s all Chair.      No Chair some of them were in writing Chair.      That’s correct Chair.     I cannot answer that, I would say most of them were probably on phone.     That’s correct Chair. ADV KATE     I can’t recall if people SMS’ed it was majority phone calls.     Yes Chair.     Their own money back.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.    That is correct yes.    Yes I do Chair.    A strange person that did not do the payment would not know the amount nor the reference.    No I did not.    I was satisfied that once they confirmed verbally that the funds were indeed theirs.    Yes.    This came to light afterwards so yes.    At that point it was.    That is correct yes.    Now looking at the bigger picture yes I was not certain but at that point when the client confirmed the name and the amount I was certain.    I thought I was certain.    Yes I would subtract my fee and I would then consolidate the whole cash order and send it to my service provider and of course I would pay the funds over to them and they would do the packing and the counting and then my drivers would go pick it up once it has been ready – once it is ready.    SBV.    Again as I explained to the Chair SBV isowned by the four banks.    They do distribution of funds for the banks.    They are – they are a cash in transit business and they are what I can yes assume is a cash warehouse.  But they do cash in transit as well.    Yes.  Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct yes.  They would be delivered to the various clients.    Our vehicles were unmarked.    That is a good question.  SBV has gotmarked vehicles and most of the clients do not like when a big truck with lots of money stops in front of their premises and people can then see that they are receiving funds.  So our vehicles were unmarked and then at that point we offered a same day delivery where some of the cash in transit business did not offer same day delivery.  For – as for the clients not going to the bank physically sometimes it is not safe for them to go to the bank to collect funds from a bank.    We had the unmarked…    It becomes a security…    That is correct yes.    No, no the unmarked vehicles were ourvehicles.    Okay.    Yes that is correct.    I cannot answer for SBV.    Yes, no I hear what you saying but I cannot answer for SBV why they do not have unmarked vehicles.    No I do not know that as a fact.    That is correct yes.   The bank would charge a full percent if they had to go to a branch and…    A full percent.    Yes.    That is correct.    And then if they went with SBV because I originally got a quote from SBV before they became a service provider they would have charged a little bit more than what I charged.    That is correct.    And also we offered same day delivery.    I am sure it could.  I do not want to confirmor deny but I am sure maybe it could.    That is correct.    At their premises.    Their place of business.    That is correct Chair.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    That is correct yes.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct yes.    I vetted the person.    That is correct yes.    No just the person.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    So the client would – some clients would check to make sure everything was in order because it was packed in clear bags and then they would sign a delivery slip and my driverswould be their way again.    Yes.    So you can count it 10, 20, 30 you can count it.  Sometimes there were money missing like a R1 000,00 but then I would just contact SBV with the seal number and I will say to them there is money missing can you maybe just check what happened there?        More or less    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes correct.    Yes they would   Yes they would.    That is correct yes.    Those slips would come back to me.    The client would keep a slip and then the carbon copy would then come back to me.    Yes.    That is correct yes.   Throughout that is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    R15 million.    G Markides.    I would use codes for the clients so if a slip either went missing or they lost a slip it does not have the actual company details on there where people might then know there is – there is cash on the premises.  So we use codes for our clients.    Yes.    That would represent a certain client.    That is correct yes Chair.    For the same client that is correct yes Chair.    Excuse me Chair?    No we would the code down all the time.    That is correct yes Chair.    If this slip had to go missing and someone picked it up and a company stamp was there or the company details were there they would see that there is funds going to those premises and it might become a security risk.    Always the code.    A certain client yes.    For my purposes and the drivers.    Some of the clients would know their codes yes.    It just represents their code.    That is correct yes Chair.   We always used the codes.    They would not know where to go and look for the company yes.    That is correct yes.   The client signs.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    Can I just add in also when you are talking on a radio we would give the code out again so that people do not know.    Yes.    No names.    That is correct yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes correct.    That is correct.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    That is correct yes.    Can I…   Can I maybe explain…    The delivery slip.    So on my delivery slips my drivers write this out and I will let them know they need to take a certain amount to 1010 and so they would write the slip out before hand and then when they get to the client the client just signs for it.  So yes some clients might write their names out like this one and some might just like sign for it. But this code was written by our drivers so that they can identify when they do the delivery that is going to that certain client.    So ja I did not write out this slips this was written out by my drivers and that is how they would write it out to know what to do with – with the funds.    I have to say Chair mine is holding on tight.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No you will have contact Minute Man and ask them why they changed it.  Because these books were ordered fromMinute Man and if you look on the originals there is a stamped number right next to seal number in red.  So I can assume maybe they changed the way that they printed the books.    They do have copies of this but my lawyer kept the originals ja.  But they do have copies of these.    That is correct yes.    Because they were busy investigating this my lawyer kept this on file for us in case we needed the originals.   Yes.    Yes it will be returned to me and then I willmake sure that everything was delivered and I would then normally file it.    I would – I had a book where I wrote all the deliveries in.  I would take the bank statements and I would take the slips then I would do a reconciliation for every client so that they can get a transaction sheet and an invoice at the end of the month.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.   Excluding VAT, including VAT.    Including and for some reason I do not know why I put the column in there but I never used it but it is there.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes Chair.    We just had a robbery or attempted robbery – I should say.  One of my men was killed.  The other one was in hospital.  He had seven ricocheted bullets in his leg and our vehicle - the one vehicle was written off and I can only speculate that the books were in that vehicle when it went in for recovery.  That is the only thing I can think of why we would not have had these slips.   I did yes.    My bank statement and again the book that I wrote in.    That is correct.    We had the inquiry with the FSB.  Then the SME liquidators and then of course this inquiry with the Hawks. Everything we have – we have been dealing with.    That is correct yes.   George was my client.    Yes.    That is Mr – Is it Markides?    Markides that is correct Chair.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    I do Chair.    44.  Okay.   Yes Chair.    So what happened was they were known as Dedrego.  It was Rustic Stone and then when they moved over they stayed Dedrego and then eventually I saw in their signature they would refer to themselves as ITH.    So if Lisa emailed me then in her signature it would be and if I phoned they would answer ITH.  So it – in my mind I thought maybe a name change or what not but …    So when the FSB did this I went to think    Well again they were known as Dedrego but I eventually called them ITH.    It is not correct yes.    No I did not.    Same person – might have been different business yes.  I did however ask who I can invoice and they said to me I must invoice Dedrego.    Yes.    Yes.    It was just like I say the email address.  So it might have been her personal email address I do not know but they got to know or I got to know them also as ITH and not just Dedrego.    No.   No.  The person stayed the same.    That is correct yes.    I do.    Well with all the inquiries we have had so far clearly that is not the case.    They did.  George did.    Yes I asked him what do you guys do as a business and I was then led to believe that.    I was just asking general questions.  What do you guys do?  Oh, how long have you been doing it?  Normal conversation.    Yes.    That is right.    That is right.   Can I ask a question?  How would I vet that?    Sorry but how would I vet that?    No.    Yes.   Yes, no is the answer and yes to Chair.    That is correct.    We never received it back.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    That is the only premises yes.   Well it was offices.  So they had the reception desk and it was a normal office, boardroom.    Yes I am.    At 23 – yes I am.    They had two addresses.  I do know that.  They had two premises but I went to Whittaker.  I vetted Whittaker and that is where we did the deliveries.    As per their request.  They …    That is correct.    Because the delivery would have only gone to the one premises.    No.   As – as I said they have the two addresses and they were working out of Whittaker.  It was their offices where they would always be present for they delivery and that is where we went.  That is where George was and that is where we went.    That was the address that they asked me toput on the invoicing.    It was also the same address that came from Rustic Stone.  So it all stayed the same.    I did not go to that address no.    Because as I said my deliveries were to go to Bedfordview as per their request.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    So Dedrego’s deliveries always went to Whittaker because that is where George – that is where he sat every day.  That is where his offices were.    It would have been the Whittaker addressyes.    No.    No, no.  It would have gone to where George is.    No I would tell them where to go so they would go there.    No, no, no.  No, no they went where they were supposed to go.    I was not there.    That is correct.    We can say it like that yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Page.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct but George is Dedrego though.    Yes.    Alright, ja.   That is correct yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    As I said Dedrego is at Watt but also they have got premises in Whittaker and Mr Markides was always atWhittaker.    Because as I think that Dedrego is actually registered at this address.    I do.   Correct.    I can see how it can – how it can look like that yes.    That is correct.    Delivery notes.    As we said earlier the address is not on the delivery slip for security purposes Chair.  So I would – I would check the amounts and I would then of course confirm that the client received the funds but the actual address is not on the delivery note.    Well if it was not at the address then the client would not have signed for it.    If – if it was not – if it was not the right address then the client would not have signed for it and we only wentto where the client said this is our address.  This is where you please must deliver the funds.    It would have been their address.    (Intervenes) own place.    Ja.   So it could have gone to – to Watt Street.    Is that what you are saying Chair?    That is correct?    I – I have two addresses for him.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    I – I have to say I could have told them to go to both addresses but my memory of maybe our later deliveries was definitely we always went to Whittaker but yes in the earlier days they might have gone there but as …    I said my memory with our later 2017/2016is we normally went to Whittaker.    Just where the person would be to sign for it.    It – how to explain?  As long as the client was there at the address that they supplied us with …    No, no, no.  They had to go to the offices.   Yes.  It looked like a house which they converted into offices.    That is correct yes, yes.  They converted it all into offices.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    I said I - I vetted him.  I FICA’d him and of course I confirmed with his PA that it is their funds.    I got all the necessary documents from him. Sorry my bundle unravelled again.    Let us twist this now.    I have now – I have now twisted it into little swirlies.  So I am thinking maybe it might hold.    Thank you.    Except for calling them and confirm with them.   I see yes.    So my understanding was it comes from them.    Mr Markides - his entities.  It comes from him – his company.  It – it comes from them.  How do I explain this?    Sorry.  I was under the impression or my impression was that if it is an electric transfer that it is the bank’s responsibility to source where the funds come from where if it was cash then it was my responsibility to see where the funds were coming from but if I am wrong in my understanding then I do apologise but that was my understanding.    Correct.    That is correct yes.    Yes.    I – I think it was a bit more.    I am not sure but it was a bit more yes.    Correct.    No, no, no I said correct.  Maybe I did not say it loud enough.   Okay.    DD9?    Ja, ja.    (No audible reply).    Yes – sorry.    That is correct.    As I said earlier I completely forgot about Mr Judeel when I met him in the December.  I – I remembered when you sent me this statement a week ago.    Yes, okay.    No not yet.    Yes that is correct.    What steps I took?      I just gave them all the details, we met at a restaurant and we weren’t there long, I opened my water and I don’teven think I finished my water and I just explained the business, I gave them all the invoices, I think, and some slips and they said they’ll contact us because I might need to be a witness but it wasn’t a very long interaction.      That’s correct yes.      She is George Markides’ PA – personal assistant.      When I couldn’t find our delivery receipts Icontacted her and asked her maybe for her copy and then she sent me a brown envelope, she said it’s fine she’ll send proof that the funds were delivered and she sent me a brown envelope with receipts in there.      Yes.      Yes.     That’s correct.      That’s correct.      Um ja, my old driver went to collect it from her premises and he dropped it off.      I gave it over to the Hawks.      At that meeting yes.      As I said earlier, I didn’t write this and I did not have delivery notes so I think what it should say is maybe my transaction sheets because I did not have any slips.      Ja.      Yes.      I did not have delivery notes.      Yes maybe she might have copies and I just didn’t get it or – I can’t understand why I didn’t have the copies, that’s why I said maybe we did not write anything out but ja I contacted her to see maybe if she’s got receipts.      No and when we had this discussion I went and I thought about it, my driver delivered them and I went to putthem in my car and then I went to pick up my daughter and I never checked them up until when the Hawks opened up the brown envelope and it had my name on it and when they opened it that was the first time I saw it.      It’s probably a day or two.      Yes.      That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct yes Chair.      They are not, no Chair.      Just when I gave them to the Hawks I said to them, these are not my delivery slips.      Yes that’s correct Chair.      That’s correct, yes Chair.      I do see that.      Can you elaborate please?      Well that is clearly what has been happening with Mr Markides’ cases, if I just look at the SME case so I can make that assumption that the funds actually never went for his business and it went on to someone else.      Yes that’s correct.      That’s correct yes.      Yes.      That’s correct yes.      Yes it is Chair.     That’s correct Chair.      Yes Chair.      Koroneka and the date.      Koroneka and the date.      Okay Chair.     Koroneka and the date.      That’s correct.      The 2million.      No.     Like I said I confirmed with them that it is their funds and my assumption is they using Koroneka for their own referencing purposes.      Chair I had this discussion with MsHofmeyr when we met the first time and you’ll see on my second bank statement there’s clients using AMFS as their reference and so I had to call clients and confirm that, that was their money so the reference means nothing to me but it is important for the client of course.  So I did not find that to be funny.    No, no the referencing is not important to me.    I do agree yes.    I did not have that arrangement though no.    Near the end yes.    No when it was later in the business, when Igot all those phone calls, they did start using references identifying themselves better but when it all started, I did not have that agreement or anything like that with the client.      I do.      2million.      I do Chair.      It’s 5million.      That’s correct yes.      Yes.      Okay.     I do.      Whittaker.      We did most deliveries to – actually no I don’t ever recall us doing deliveries to their Springs address so I want to say yes, we did the deliveries all to Whittaker.    I don’t know it as a fact but my instructions to my drivers were Whittaker.      Yes.     I do yes.     I do.      Correct.      I see that yes.      I do.      To me, establishing where the funds came from was to contact and confirm with the client that it is their funds.      Okay.       Yes that’s correct.      Again I would read it as, they are the source and I confirmed they are the source from them.      Not that I can recall.      I can’t remember Chair.       I did ask my attorney…(intervention).      Sorry Chair.      My attorney sent it to me and I probably would have read it on all the information sent to me.      I cannot remember in which format it wassent.      I can’t remember.      I do remember reading some yes.      My understanding was I can confirm with the client that it is their funds and that would of course then be the source of the funds.      Yes Chair.      No Chair.      I see that now yes.     I don’t recall doing that no.      No Chair.     Can you repeat that please?      I did not no.      No.      No.      Okay.      I see that.      Correct.      I see that yes.      No I was not.      I do.      As I said earlier no.      I was yes.      That’s right yes.      No.      Yes.      I see it yes.      I see that yes.      That’s correct yes.      I see that yes.      Yes.    That is correct yes.   That is correct yes.    I would still say I think they were adequate.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    I was informed that we are getting the records back.   Yes.    I do yes.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    It sounds like part of it yes Chair.    Correct.    Correct yes.    No.    With you saying it yes.    I do yes.    No.    Would deposits be EFT deposits or cash deposits?    227.      On any terms yes.    I do yes.    Yes.    I do yes.    No.    Until three seconds ago.    No.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    In the middle.    I see it yes Chair.    Corner got it.     I do yes.    I see that yes.    I see that yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    Yes I would have taken off my fee yes.    That is correct yes.    Correct yes.    That is correct yes.    Also without my knowledge but yes correct.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    No they closed down.    The person that bought the business from me.    That is correct yes.    I do not know if it operates the same way I did.   Yes.    Yes.    No thank you.   Thank you Chair.    Thank you for your time Chair. 
HOFMEYR:Okay so now we’re at the point…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRAVILJOEN:  Both names referred to the same business. 
VILJOEN:She sent me a brown envelope…(intervention). 
MS KIALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Good afternoon Chair.    Yes we are Chair.    Chair if I may begin the evidence that is to be led through this witness deals with a different focus within this particular aviation stream.  In particular it is the evidence of a – an employee of South African Express.  Her evidence deals with particularly the procurement of Jet A1 Fuel by South African Express which was borne out of the operational need of South African Express and in particular the Pilanesberg Airport. Through this evidence Chair certain questions will be raised.  The first question is whether or not any proper procurement processes were in fact followed for the supply of jet fuel to Pilanesberg Airport and forgive me Chair I am – it is Jet A1 Fuel for the record but I may just interchangeably use it as jet fuel. The next question which is a bit more of a broader one is whether or not proper procurement processes were observed when South African Express concluded contractual arrangements with aparticular entity called EML Engineers and Construction trading as EML Energy and certain IDC funding that was related to that transaction and lastly Chair the other main question that would be placed before this Commission is whether or not there were any fraudulent or corrupt activities in relation to these particular procurement processes. Having said that Chair the bundle before you is marked DD12 and with your leave if I could just give some clarity to what exactly is contained in this bundle.    Under – there are three tabs to thebundle.  Under the first tab Chair we will find the affidavit for this witness.  Under the second tab Chair are two documents in particular which relate to this witness’ bundle but it is just more comprehensive to what was actually included in their and under the third bundle is an affidavit by a Mr Gavin Fourie who will not be called to give evidence today but we submit that his affidavit which includes some annexures be tendered and placed before this – this Commission as evidence. During the evidence of this witness the affidavit of Mr Gavin Fourie will certainly be looked to – to corroborate or to support certain allegations and a version that is tendered by this witness.    Unless Chair has anything else for me to address I then request that the oath be administered.    As it pleases.    Ms Loock – if I may – could I ask you to turn to page 1 of the bundle before you please?  Do you recognise this document?    And can I ask you to turn to page 14 – 1-4?  Whose signature appears where deponent is marked?    And so it is correct then that you deposed to this affidavit on 22 May 2019 before a Commissioner of Oaths?    Can I ask you to turn to page 98 please?  Is it correct that this particular page was not included as part of your affidavit when you deposed to it but that you have since had an opportunity to have a look at it?    Thank you.  Is it true that you arecurrently employed by South African Express?    And what position do you hold?    When did you first join SA Express Ms Loock?    And what position did you hold when you joined the organisation?    When were you appointed to the positon of Airport’s Coordinator?    And the evidence that you presenttoday is it correct that those – that your evidence concerns events that took place during 2017?    Well predominantly during 2017?    And during that year or during the time period of 2017 who were you reporting to as your immediate report?    How would you describe your working relationship with Mr Allenby?    Would you say that he trusted your professional abilities?    And how long did you report to him?    Okay and is he still with SA Express?    When was that?    Yes you are welcome.  It is actuallyat paragraph 3 on page 1 you do inform that Mr Allenby retired around September 2018.    Thank you.  So by the time of the year 2017 how long approximately were you in the role of Airport’s Coordinator?    Yes, okay.  Before we get into what exactly your role entailed during our consultation Chair she gave some really useful background to set context for her position which isnecessary to explore.  Ms Loock there are different user departments within SA Express as I understand.  Is that correct?    And so can you please explain to the Chair the different user departments within SA Express?    Please if you may.    Please.    Thank you.  So just to summarise then there are essentially eight user departments.  One of which is the Operations Department and is that – sorry – is that the user departmentin which you work?    And is that the user department to which Dave Allenby is the General Manager?    You also made mention that there are certain divisions within operations such being Cabin Services, Airport Operations, Flight Operations, Operations Control Centre and Ramp.  How does your role as Airport’s Coordinator integrate or deal with the divisions as just mentioned each of which I understand is led by a Divisional Manager?    We will – I think let us – let us …    Deal with it.  Is that all that you wish to state on that point?    And on your cue we will do exactlythat.  So paragraph 4 on page 1 of your – of the bundle …    Deals with your functions as Airport’s Coordinator.  Can you give a high level overview of what exactly your role and responsibilities were in the position of Airport’s Coordinator particularly during the year of 2017 and even 2018 for that matter?    Thank you.  So generally if – if I understand your testimony correct you had a full view of exactly what was happening at any particular station and just for the record would – what exactly is a station?    And so that would specifically then be the airport within that particular …?    Location.    Okay.    But certainly within the role that you had you were in a position to have a full appreciation for the overall function and operations of a particular station?    For purposes of the evidence today it is important to look at – at least two aspects of your role in greaterdetail.  You made mention of the fact that you are involved in procurement at stations.  Is that right?    And so can I then ask you to turn to page 58 which is under Tab seven?  Do you recognise this document Ms Loock?    Please identify it?    And it is to be noted that on page 58 the effective date of this policy is 1 April 2017 with the review date of 31 March 2018.  Is that right?    Is it true that this is actually the policy that regulated or ought to have regulated procurement during this period under scrutiny of your evidence in 2017?    If I can then ask you to turn to page 62 please?  Chair at - at the preamble on paragraph 1 it sets the tone    And what were the Human Resources or the capacity requirements of the Procurement Division during 16/2017?   And why was that?    Okay and how did that impact on the procurement of goods and services within SA Express at the time?    And so did that outcome impact on your role at all?   How?    Thank you Chair.  So the lack of resources in the Procurement Department impacted on your role?    Okay.  If you look at page 65 of the bundle you will note that under one of the bullet points of the sub    Can I then ask you to turn to page 69 please and if you look at paragraph 10 which regulates acquisition management 10.1 in particular which talks to the methods of acquisition and threshold values for procurement of goods and services.  The table below that identifies procurement mechanisms.  The first column on the left hand side identifies the mechanism. The middle column identifies threshold and the last column identifies delegated authority.  Do you see that Ms Loock?    Can I ask you to please list then or rather read into the record that which has – which applies or rather if I    Okay and who would be the delegated …    Thank you.  Who would be thedelegated authority for an RFP/RFI according to the table?    And for the record what does BAC stand for?    And CE?    If you then look three lines down which starts with deviations can you please do the same in respect of deviations for the record please?    And is it correct that or rather what is the threshold in relation to deviations for such delegated authority?   Thank you.  Can I now ask you to turn to page 79 please?    Thank you Chair.    Page 7-9 – 79.  Paragraph 17 deals with the Regulation of Emergency Bids and Deviations.  For the record can I ask you to read the first three paragraphs of the section because it is quite key to your evidence which continues on page 80?    Thank you.  And you will see then that the table below identifies on the one hand cases of emergency and alongside it requirement to satisfy support, which is preceded by a sentence which reads the criteria reflected in the table below may be used by the S A Express bid adjudication committee during the assessment process.  For the record can I ask you to identify what is written under cases of emergency please?    And alongside where it identifies the requirement to satisfy support?    Thank you, and just lastly the S A – sorry, paragraph 28, on the same page talks specifically to aircraft on ground emergency procurement procedures but it’s within a threshold or within a range, a monetary range of what appears to be 500 to R1.5million, is that correct?    And then lastly on page 81 I just wishto highlight to you Chair that there are certain provisions as well which regulates unsolicited bids at paragraph 31 and at paragraph 32 it talks to the sole supplier or single source.     I’m not at liberty to say Chair but could be.     That’s how I read it Chair, R499 999.    Chair if may ...(intervention)     I must admit I was a big boggled when I saw the 500.   Yes.    In fact I’m happy to identify that whilst reference is made within some correspondence to aircraft on ground which is abbreviated to AOG certainly the thresholds do notapply and it’s for that purpose that I’ve really just identified this particular paragraph.    And then lastly on page 83 paragraph    Can I then ask you to go back to page 2 of your affidavit, and in particular paragraph 4.4 mention is made in this particular sub-paragraph of ground handling services at different stations, is it correct that your role as airports coordinator was it limited to ground handling services or did it extend beyond that?    So it is understood that there is an important distinction between airports that are owned by ACSA and airports that are not owned by ACSA, is that right?    Looking at the listing of stations, or airports as I would commonly know them to be can I ask you to identify in the list which stations or airports are in fact ACSA airports please?   And why is the distinction between ACSA airports and non-ACSA owned airports so important, for purposes of your evidence today, sorry.    Okay so if I understand you correctly are you then, is it your evidence that the SAA, S A Express Jet A1 fuel contract only applies to ACSA owned airports?   Yes.    Thank you.  So how would jet fuel or jet A1 fuel then be supplied at the airports which are not ACSA owned or non-ACSA airports?    So the distinction then in summary is that at ACSA owned airports an airline would contract for the supply of jet fuel at those airports or rather S A Express sorry would contract for the supply of jet fuel at those airports on the basis of the SAA/SA Express Jet Fuel Contract, is that right?    And then at the airports which are not ACSA owned S A Express would need to contract with the fuel supply service provider that has been identified and nominated by the owner of that airport?   Sun City or Pilanesberg station and Mafeking station is it correct that those two stations are not ACSA owned?    Now your role as airports coordinator did it extend to all of these stations at the time?    And when were they, approximately when were the Pilanesberg or Mafeking, or Sun City station and Mafeking set up, do you remember?    According to our investigations it was set up during the year of 2015.   Having said that you now mentioned that you were removed from the setting up of these two particular airports, which for record purposes we will refer to as Pilanesberg and Mafeking airports, who removed you and why?    Please do.    And who was the divisional manager at the time.    And would that have been the divisional manager of operations?    So who exactly according to your knowledge was involved in the setting up of the Mafeking and the Pilanesberg Airports.   Did they explain to you why Ms Loock you were excluded from the set up of these two stations.    And is Ms Tshesane still working at S A Express?    Why not, or do you know the reasons why she’s no longer working there?    Okay.  Were you ever involved in the supply ...(intervention)     No I did not but with Ms Loock’s assistance it will be much appreciated if she could, if you could just place on record the spelling of Ms Stompie Tshesane please.    Thank you.  Were you involved in anyprocurement of jet fuel at any of the stations?    Okay, and this situation that you speak of is this the requirement for jet fuel at Pilanesberg Airport?    Can you please explain to the Chair how – when firstly, and how an operational requirement for the supply of jet fuel arose at the Pilanesberg Airport, and now we’re on paragraph, we’re starting on paragraph 5 of the affidavit which is onpage 2.       What does user friendly mean?      Who was the fuel service provider atPilanesberg at the time?    So it’s now understood that RSI Fuel as a fuel service provider in Pilanesberg was not your solution to getting the supply of fuel at Pilanesberg Airport?    More particularly Ms Loock why did you need operationally fuel to be provided to your aircraft in Pilanesberg?    So the reason for obtaining or rather the reason for the need for fuel was to refuel on the route from Cape Town to Pilanesberg.    What then happened when you learnt of the difficulty in relation to RSI Fuel which was the fuel service provider at the time at Pilanesberg?    Yes please, we are.  So your General Manager being Mr Dave Allenby?    So he instructed you to explore?    As solution.    Just for clarity for those of us who may need clarity in the aviation terminology context, what exactly is defueling and refuelling for purposes of the requirements of S A Express Technical?    Okay.    Most likely that is what would happen, the same entity would ...(intervention)     Thank you Chair.  Ms Loock before we close off the fuelling and defueling concept what is a bowser?    So you were explaining Ms Loock that you were asked by Mr Allenby to look into the requirement of the supply of fuel at Pilanesberg Airport and that you were directed to technical.  Who in S A Express Technical did you approach?    Did it concern any particular aircraft that you were aware of?    So November, can we just do this again, November Mike November and November?    Please clarify?    And so you’re referring to two particular aircraft that S A Express Technical was looking into in relation to the defueling and refuelling of.    Thank you.  Is it correct that this all took place around May of 2017?    So you approached Mr Corver and you provides you a business card for EML, what do you then do withthis particular information?    And the solution then if I understand your correctly was to transport Jet A1 fuel from Johannesburg to Pilanesberg in order to meet the operational requirement for the flight route from Cape Town to Pilanesberg?   Can I then ask you to turn to page 16 please, 16.  In fact if we could start on page 17, oops sorry, page 18, sorry about that.  In fact it begins on the preceding page which is – it is listed as an email that is sent from yourself on Tuesday the 16 t h of May    Thank you, and if I can ask you to read then your email on page 18 into the record, which is addressed to him.    You can continue to inform of the flight, what’s written below that.    Now this email was sent off the backof an instruction that you received from your general manager, Mr Dave Allenby, is that right?    What exactly was the instruction in the context of what you were asking a quotation to be provided on?    And if it’s understood then, if I’m understanding your evidence correctly it was a turnkey solution if we could call it that, in that it was not just the transportation of fuel but it may have even included the supply of fuel, is that right or am I misunderstanding?    If we can then turn to page 17, the previous page, the senders details is actually on page 16 and its from   But is it correct that this is in fact an email which requests you to receive a response quite urgently on – on request for a quotation?    Your name is however highlighted there as a particular statement for your attention?    Please read that part into the record?    It states   And just below that signature Mr Mothlake is identified as the Managing Director of EML?    If you then turn to page 16.  Thereappears an email of response from yourself and it is sent on the 9 June    My understanding is that it is an email trail.  So instead of the individual emails having been printed itis…    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    My understanding is that the June email is in response to the May email which is in response to …    Chair I fully agree with you.  In this instance though it appears that instead of them printing the individual emails they printed a string of emails which consequently …    Okay.   Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes you know I certainly hear you Chair.    That the order is almost…    In reverse.   Is in reverse.    Yes Chair.    I will be pleased to get instructions from the investigators as to why it was printed off in this fashion.   As opposed to that.    Chair I have been informed that as I have already alluded those that it is an email trail with the most recent email being on top and so const…    As it pleases Chair.    The most recent email then on page 16 is sent from yourself to Eric of EML Energy PTY LTD on which Mr Dave Allenby is copied and the subject title is Jet Fuel to Sun City Airport.  Can you please read your email into the record?    And so in light of your earlier evidence Ms Loock your response which was in line with the request for quotation that you sent Mr Eric Motlhake is to dovetail with any engagements that SA Express Technical was having with EML?    Did you know whether or not SA Express Technical was engaged in a procurement process with EML at the time?    Did you do any independentinvestigations on your side to establish whether there was in fact a procurement process in play between SA Express Technical and EML?    Thank you.    Can I then ask you to turn to the next annexure to our affidavit and that is on page 21 of the bundle.  This is   And so based on the subject title it really deals with two primary requirements.  One being Sun City or rather fuel at Sun City and the other being Denel Technical, is that right?    Just for the record this particular email is one which is sent from Mr Allanby to Mr Vilakazi which informs them about the alternate fuel supply for Pilanesberg that have been “unearthed” is that right?   And is it also correct that Eric Motlhake is identified as the CEO of EML Energy in this email?    And then below contact number can you please read the last two sentences into the record please?    Yes.    And what is NTY?    So when reference is made to a fuel bowser is it reasonable to assume that it would have included then the supply of jet A1 fuel?    And so that would then accord with your understanding of what the instruction was to obtain a quotation from EML?    Paragraph 10 of your affidavit on page 3 talks about economies of scale and in particular on the last sentence you talk to Mr Corver informing you about economies of scale. Can you please explain to the Chair what exactly is meant in that last line of this paragraph?    And so is that to be understood based on the two requirements that were needed such being jet fueland Pilanesberg and the requirements for refuelling and defueling or sorry defueling and refuelling at Denel ORTIA?    So you request the quotation, you are requested to provide quantities that are needed of fuel in Pilanesberg what do you do when you receive this request for quantities?  Are you in a position to provide such information?    Did you approach Mr Gavin Fourie to do so?   Chair according to the affidavit that has been submitted Mr Gavin Fourie has been – he was appointed as the Aircraft Performance Engineer employed by SA Express.  How would you explain the working relationship between yourself and Mr Gavin Fourie?    And so how did his role and responsibilities inform or collaborate with your role and responsibilities?   Were you – were you and Mr Gavin Fourie based at the same location?    So you had quite a close working relationship?    In support of each other’s functions?   Is it also correct that after you communicated the litre requirements – the quantity requirements of jet fuel to Mr Motlhake you had also informed Mr Allanby about it.  Or rather was Mr Allanby fully aware of exactly what those quantities were?    And that is certainly evident from the email that you read into the record on the 9 June 2017?    So once you receive the quantities needed and you communicate that how long do you remain to be part of the process to solve this operational need?    And so your knowledge as to what happened thereafter is by and large informed by documents that you have been provided by the commission’s investigators?    Thank you.  If I can ask you to turn to page 25.  Is it correct that this document is the aviation fuel service agreement between South African Airways and South African ExpressAirways PTY LTD?    Thank you.  And this is in fact the agreement which regulates the provi – the pro – the supply of fuel to SA Express Aircrafts at ACSA owned airports?    Thank you.  And if I can then just ask you quickly to turn to page 46 of the bundle.  Is it correct that this agreement was concluded on the 31 August 2011?    And is this agreement still in place?    Thank you.  Once you were – once you did what you needed to do in obtaining the literage, passing it onto Mr Motlhake who took over the responsibility of dealing with the Pilanesberg jet fuel requirement?    Based on your knowledge of what had transpired up to this point were proper procurement processes followed?    Yes.    And that was not done?    After you then made the request for the quotation provided the quantities did you ever see a copy of the quotation from EML at any point in time?    The next part of your affidavit talks to different processes that were followed in the context of this transaction.  If I can – we are on page 4 and from paragraphs 15 to 17you talk about a Whatsapp round robin approval.  Are you aware of when a round robin approval is used within SA Express?    Thank you.  And now can I ask you to turn to page 48 which is an exchange of Whatsapp communications between members of the bid adjudication committee as you have been informed.  Just for the record who is…    48.    I have asked the investigators to provide a clearer copy and unfortunately we do not have one yet but assoon as one becomes available it will be made available.    As it pleases Chair I had hoped to receive a clearer copy or even a bigger copy by now.    But unfortunately…    There was nothing forthcoming.    Chair I note that it is I am not sure if my watch is right but it is nearly quarter past four.    Or it is just after…    I will need some time.    I will certainly need some time.  Probably an hour and a half?    Probably an hour and a half or so.    I will certainly do my best.    Within that timeframe.  Ms Loock are you aware of this round robin resolution at all?    Did you become aware of it at somelater stage if reference is made to paragraph 15 of your affidavit?    Which was when?    And that was certainly long after the approval was granted on the 1 July 2017?    Chair having studied this in a – as best as possible may I proceed to just read the relevant sections of this Whatsapp record into the – into the record?    Page 48 Chair.    Chair the first communication is by Mr Sam Vilakazi and that is on the 1 July 2017 at 11.22 which reads BAC members please check your emails and assist with round robin approval needed urgently in respect of or iro NME.  Ms Loock NME is that the registration identification code of one of your aircraft?    Thank you.  At the time how many aircraft were there as part of the SA Express fleet?    Thank you.  The next line is by Mr Dave Allanby sent on the same date of 1 July 2017 two minutes after    And what role did she play in the bid adjudication committee at the time?    Thank you.  And her…    No problem Chair.  It is also referenced at paragraph 16.3 on page 5 of the affidavit and it is spelt slightly different to what is reflected here and Ms Loock you will correct me if it is Merriam and the surname is Mochoele?    Mochoele.    Thank you.  The message from Ms    Mochoele apologies informs at 11   And this message was sent then at    And you – is it correct that the supply chain management policy deals specifically with Aircraft on Ground but within the thresholds of R500 unless it was a typographical error and R1.5 million.    If one looks a bit further down on thesame page of 49 there is an – a response from Mr Mark Shelley.  Spelt M-A-R-K, Shelley S-H-E-L-L-E-Y.  Who is Mr Mark Shelly Ms Loock?    Thank you and his message at 11   It is responded to in the next line by Ms Merriam Mochoele.    Apologies Chair.    Mochoele.    For getting the surname wrong -    And then if we turn to page 51 at the top there is a message from Mr Dave Allenby on the same date of    The messages continues to read   Does it extend to any other airports?    So it is only two locations?    Thank you.  Now if we can turn to page 6 of your affidavit.  You now address from paragraph 18 to paragraph 24 a motivation for deviation from the bid process.  Do youhave any personal knowledge of the motivation to deviate Ms Loock?    And is that the ordinary process that ought to have been followed?    And how did you find out about this deviation Ms Loock?    Can I ask you then to turn to page 53 please?  Is this in fact the memorandum which motivates the deviation from bid process in relation to services to be contracted with EML?    This memorandum is – for the record – dated 5 July 2017 and the purpose of the memorandum is outlined in    And the first background talks specifically to the fuel supply requirement at Pilanesberg Airport outlined from paragraphs 2.1 to 2.9.  Is that correct?   In particular at paragraph 2.9 on    Thank you and so the scenario two which is outlined from paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 deals with the technical requirement of defueling and refuelling?    Paragraph 4 which talks to financial    Can you have …?    Can you have a contract before an approval?    And then on page 55 paragraph 5 which talks to the rationale for deviation from bid process.  Once againin paragraph 3 limited to two airports.  It is paragraph 5.3.    On page 55.  Which two airports are those?    Thank you.    And then paragraph 7 outlines the approval that is requested and having studied the document it certainly aligns with the purpose of the document.  When one talks – when one looks at page 56 is it correct that all those persons who had been included in the WhatsApp communication been Dave Allenby, Sam Vilakazi, Mark Shelly, Merriam Mochoele and Victor Xaba in fact signedin approval of the motivation to deviate?    The only additional person there is Mpho Selepe?    But as the DM of Finance recorded on this page similarly Mpho Selepe approved this – this memorandum?    If one can then turn to page 8 of your – of the bundle.  At paragraph …   Excuse me Chair - apologies.    Yes.    Yes, yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  I am indebted to you for that clarity.    Yes Chair.   Certainly that appears on the face of the document.  All but one being Mpho Selepe were involved in the round robin approval who had approved that particular approval at the time notwithstanding the fact that I certainly take your point Chair that it is unclear from here other than Victor Xaba who expressed he approves it.    Yes Chair.  I am indebted to you for that.    Correction and clarity.    I certainly agree that on the face of it – it is exactly as you say Chair.    Do you have any further clarity in relation to that Ms Loock outside of what you have already informed theChair about?    Thank you.    As it pleases.    Thank you Chair.  Page 8 Ms Loock of the bundle addresses two letters, the first letter is an appointment letter to EML Energy and the second letter is a “to whom it may concern” letter.  If you can quickly first deal with the appointment letter to EML Energy, do you have, is it correct that this letter was given to you by the Commission’s investigators?    Is it correct that the second letter was similarly given to you by the Commission’s investigators?    And so do you have any personal knowledge of these letters?    If I can ask you to turn to page 93 please.  Chair for the record this letter is a letter on an S A Express letterhead, it is sent by Mr Samuel Vilikazi, the Chief Procurement Officer, dated 5 July 2017 and it’s titled “Award for supply of fuel to S A Express”.  It is for the address of EML Energy based in Kempton Park    Thank you Chair.  This letter is dated the 5 t h of July 2017, can I ask you to turn to back to page 56 please.  This is the signature page of the motivation for deviation, on what datedoes Mr Dave Allenby, the General Manager of Operations submit this document?    56.    Five Six.    On what date does Mr Dave Allenby sign this document which appears to be the date on which he submits?    And that’s the same date of the date of the letter of award, signed off by Mr Samuel Vilikazi?    Can I now ask you to turn to Annexure 10 which appears at page 96.  This letter is dated about two days later, on the 7 t h of July 2017, is that correct?    And this letter for the record reads   At paragraph 28 on page 8 of your affidavit you remind of the quantities that were required specifically to Pilanesberg Airport.  For the record can you just remind exactly of what those litres were per week required and how it translates into a per annum requirement.    So you had or rather did your requirement at all include any airport other than Pilanesberg?   So to summarise your concerns the one was the duration of the appointment purported in the letter at page 96, the other was the number of litres of jet fuel to be provided on a weekly basis when even translated into a per annum quantity still far exceeded that which is indicated in the letter and the third is that it’s not specific to only Pilanesberg Airport, is that right?    Thank you Chair.  Is it then correct Ms Loock that up and until this stage the only operational requirements that Pilanesberg was one for the supply of fuel and the transportation of such fuel from Johannesburg to Pilanesberg twice a week.    And the quantities that were required was 8 500 litres per week, which translated to 442 000 litres per annum on a 52 week basis?    That was the total sum of requirement for Pilanesberg Airport.    And then from an operational point as well up and until this stage the only operational need at OR Tambo International Airport related to defueling and refuelling on an ad hoc basis of aircraft through S A Express Technical?     And so it did not include the supply of fuel generally as was needed in Pilanesberg Airport?   But now we have letters which talks to a different scope of service, is that correct?    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair, another 30 minutes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Estelle Loock.    No.   Yes.    So help me God.    (duly sworn, states)    Yes this is my affidavit.    That is my signature.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct yes Chair.    Yes I am Chair.    Airport’s Coordinator for SA Express.    I joined on 8 November 2000.    I started off as a cabin crew member.    It was around 2009 – apologies – around 08/2009 that I was appointed yes.    That is correct Chair.    2017 - that is correct.    My immediate report was the General Manager for Operations which was Mr Dave Allenby.   I had a good relationship with Mr Allenby.    Yes I can.    If my memory is correct I reported to him about three to four years.    No.  He has gone on pension.    The end of last year around – I think it is September – if I can refer to my affidavit.    That is correct – September 2018 yes, ja.    Around about eight years.    That is correct Chair.    Alright.  If I can explain we have main units and then – sorry – apologies Chair.  We had main units and then there were sub – sub …    Need to come forward.    Okay.  So we have main sections in our industry and then there are subsections underneath those and if you want me to I can explain those to you.   Alright.  We have an Operations Department which contain Flight Operations.  That is the flight deck and the cabin crew.  We have an Airport Operations Section which is – contains mostly the stations.  The OCC Department – it stands for Operations Control Centre. That is more for the aircraft movements and deployment of flights and the Ramp Services also fell under Operations and then therewas a Training and Planning Section under the Operations Department.  We had a Finance Section.  The Finance Section contained the Procurement Section which was the sourcing of the service providers, Asset Management which assisted with disposal through moveable assets Chair. Then we have the Fuelling Section underneath.  The Treasury - the Treasury Section was for foreign payments for the cash flow section.  Then IT and the Internal Auditors.  That fell all under the Finance Department.  We had a commercial – Commercial Department, Legal, Technical.  If I can go into detail on the Technical Section.    The Technical had a Heavy Maintenance and a Line Maintenance Section.  Heavy Maintenance refers to your major maintenance on your aircraft which is like A Checks or C Checks and I can explain that if - if you would like to Chair – and then there is theLine Maintenance Section was the day to day to maintenance on the aircraft, night services planning and the stores. We had a Human Capital Department.  We have a quality control and safety department which ensures the audits and compliance to the regulatory bodies.  Then we also have a Security Department where all security incidence were reported to.  We have the CEO Office, the Boards and then the Shareholders.    That is correct Chair.    Yes that is correct Chair.    My role is more of a supporting and an administrative role to the Divisional Managers of the sectors and then I report directly to the General Manager Chair.  So I supported these sections.  I did administration work for the sections and thenspecifically focused on the stations coordinating the stations.  There are several services that go with the stations.  If you would like me to explain that Chair.    Ja.    Yes because if we go into detail of exactly what all my roles are then we can.    Yes.    Alright.  (Clearing throat) - excuse me.  I had several different roles being an Airport’s Coordinator which one of them was a – a financial type of role where I verified invoices according to gazetted rates, according to contracts.  Once I verify it goes to the General Manager for authorisation.  Then it goes for payment.  I also review budgets with the Divisional Manager of Airports, monitoring the – the expenses at the stations, implement cost saving initiatives to see where we can cut costs. Also work a lot with the payments with the service providerensuring that certain service providers are paid Chair.  On a procurement level I was a lot involved in drawing up documentation like the RFQs which was the Request for Quotations, the Request for Proposals which led to a tender process, deviations.  (Clearing throat) - excuse me. As a function I drew up these documents.  However it – it went to either the Divisional Manager of the Sector or the General Manager to sign off before submission to procurement.  Also assisting stations with their requirement procurement wise – do they need stationery, do they need equipment?  (Clearing throat) - excuse me. Contracts wise I normally work with Procurement to finalise agreements. I review agreements with the Divisional Manager of that section to see if the contract contains what our requirements are.  Also assist Divisional Managers with the SLAs that are implemented with the service providers to ensure that the service providers do exactly what is in the contract.  On a compliance side I assisted stations with having updated manuals especially for audit purposes for (IOSA) IATA audits. I also distribute documents that compliance is required for and also updating of manuals for auditing purposes.  This is not flight auditing purposes.  On the distribution side I assisted with giving stations or giving stations what they need, sending stations what they need like baggage tags and boarding passes, ramp – assisting with ramp equipment, reflective jackets all for daily operations what people needed and then reporting wise I also did monthly reports for theGeneral Manager or Divisional Manager what they required Chair and at a stage I was also involved in setting up stations. Certain divisions of the airline is required to sit down and see exactly what is required for a new station and every department had its role in setting up the stations.    A station is a destination that we fly to.  SoBloemfontein, Kimberley that is a station – George.    That is correct ja.    Airport.    That is correct Chair yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes I do Chair.    It is the Supply Chain Management Policy of SA Express.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    In the Procurement Section under Finance Chair.    The Procurement Section was not fully manned – if I can make that statement Chair.    It – changeover of staff, limited staff members.    Obviously it has led to things not been done or things not been finalised – if I can state that.    Yes it did ja.    In 2017 I had to get more involved in sorting out agreements with service providers.  So …    Yes I became more involved in producing documentation that went to procurement to try and source service providers Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes I do Chair.    The RFP Chair stands for Request for Proposal.  So that would have been a tender process that if it is an amount higher than 500 000 we have to go out on a tender process.    According to the table it would be the BAC, the CE and the Board.    Bid Adjudication Committee.    Chief Executive, yes.    The delegated authority would be the General Manager, the CE, the BAC and the Board.    That would be above 500 000.    Sir I would believe that would be a typing error.    That would be a typing error.  I believe it is 500 and more.    Yes.    Apologies – the page number?           “Actions where emergency is pleaded.”     It reads    That is correct Chair.      Yes Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     I was a bit boggled when I too first saw the 500 but if you look at the two sub-paragraphs there the first paragraphs talks to a threshold of 500 to 499 999, the second sub-paragraph has another threshold which is from 500 000 to R1.5million.     That is correct Chair.     The services extended beyond ground handling ja.     That is correct Chair.     Johannesburg, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Kimberley and George.     In the context of my affidavit it relates to the SAA Fuel Contract which links to the ACSA airports.     According to the quantum ...(intervention)      That is correct, it applies to ACSA owned airports yes Chair.     You would have to either use the service provider that has been contracted by the Airports Company that – with a privately owned airport, they would have their own fuelling companies, supplying fuel at the station, so you would have to then contract with a single sole service provider Chair, that is with recommended or told by the Airports Company that you may use Chair.       That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     At the time of this no, I was prior to that I was removed from the set up of the Sun City and the Mafeking stations.     I’m talking under correction, it’s either in 2016.     Oh, correct yes, that is correct ja, Chair.     The Divisional Manager at the time removed me and if I can explain how it works.    And you would have a better understanding of it.  Certain sections in the airline have certain responsibilities in settingup the station, like I explained earlier, and me under Airport Operations we had certain things that we were responsible in setting up and for example providing radio services, providing ramp equipment and so on.  In this instance I was totally not actively involved, I was removed by the Divisional Manager as this was a commercial department venture into Sun City and Mafeking.    That was Stompie Tshesane.    Airport operations yes.    It would have been the Commercial Section.    I cannot remember the details Chair.    No she’s not Chair.    I do believe she was suspended but you mayconfirm that with our Human Capital Department.    Right, can I ...(intervention)     Yes I do.      Stompie which is S-t-o-m-p-i-e and T-s-h-e-s-a-n-e.    Other than which resulted in the situation in my affidavit no.    That is correct Chair.    The jet A1 fuel problem came in due to the service provider at Pilanesberg we found that the fuel was not user friendly, if I can place it that way.    For example contaminated, so it was not safe to use it on our aircraft.  We resulted in doing a fuel audit so I did go to our Quality Department and requested that a fuel audit be done on the current supplier at Pilanesberg just to ensure that the fuel is safe, the report did come back, a report was then discussed with the flight operations department as well as the General Manager of Operations, Dave Allenby, and confirmed that the fuel cannot be uplifted, which means we cannot take fuel in Sun City due to the contamination of the fuel.    RSI Fuel.    That is correct Chair.    S A Express had a flight from Cape Town toPilanesberg, the distance is too long for that aircraft to turn around and go back to Cape Town so the requirement was to uplift fuel in Sun City to ensure that that aircraft can fly back to Cape Town.    That is correct Chair.    The difficult was that we could not use that supplier at the station, the flight was too long, fuel was needed in Sun City so there must be an alternative to get fuel to Sun City and that was the main reason, I was then instructed by my General Manager, if we move on with the affidavit.   That is correct yes.    Yes.    What happened there was that he indicated to me and because of the requirement especially from the flight operation side the necessity of getting fuel in Sun City was quite urgent and important.  The general manager instructed me to contact technical andin this context I am going to refer to the Technical Department was busy with a company called EML reviewing the process with them for the defueling and the refuelling of an aircraft.    The defueling of an aircraft is when you remove all the fuel from the fuel tank of the aircraft, that will be applicable when you have heavy maintenance on an aircraft, so when an aircraft is pulled into a hanger and we call it a C-check which I explained earlier is a major service on the aircraft.  It is needed to remove the fuel from the tanks to ensure that the fuel tank can be investigated for any damage or to ensure that the fuel tank is still fine.  The refuelling is obviously placing fuel back into that aircraft so that it can beoperational. ADV VERUSCHKA    No I don’t.    That is correct Chair.   I would believe the same entity would provide the fuel yes, it would make the job easier, that’s correct yes.    That’s fuelling.    Defueling is removing all the fuel, refuelling is putting fuel into the aircraft, it’s fuelling.    That is correct Chair yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes the fuel supplier.    That is correct.     My understanding a bowser is a (indistinct) that goes from the fuelling truck to the aircraft to enable fuel to be pumped from a vehicle through to the aircraft.    That’s correct Chair.    I was referred to Peter Corver in Technical asthey were already in communication with EML for the defueling and refuelling of aircraft at O R Tambo International Airport.    As far as I’m aware it consisted of November Mike Echo and November Mike November, but I stand to be corrected.    Mike Echo, that is aviation lingo, alphabet actually where ...(intervention)    Ja, November, Mike, Echo is a registration of an aircraft Chair, ja. ADV VERUSCHKA    That’s correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.    As instructed by my general manager the instruction was clear just to find out whether EML can provide a fuel truck to travel to Sun City to fuel our aircraft according to the schedule of Sun City, which was twice a week, that’s four flights, two on Monday and two on Friday Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I believe Eric Motlake is the CEO of EML, CEO meaning owner of EML.     “Good day Eric, I received your details from Peter Corver from our TechnicalDepartment.  S A Express would like to find out whether your company can transport jet fuel to Sun City as per our flight schedule and what the cost would be.”    Alright; “Flight schedule OR Tambo Airport to Sun City Monday and Friday and Cape Town to Sun City Monday and Friday. Regards Estelle”    That is correct Chair.    In this context it’s obviously to obtain a truck that can transport jet A1 fuel to Sun City Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I have never met Tshenolo Chair.    That is correct.  So I believed that Tshenolothen worked for EML or was part of EML.    That is correct.    Apologies yes Managing Director ja Chair.    The email states   That is correct Chair.    I was under the  understanding from my instruction from my general manager that Technical was already in discussions with EML at the time.    I can just recall a conversation with Mr Peter Corver stating that they were already discussing things with EML but no I did not check up on whether they were busy with the procurement process.    Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Below the contact number?     “He says he can send a fuel bowser to Pilanesbergfor us and can also assist in fuelling our aircraft at Denel where he is based.  Please follow through with him as fuel at NTY is a major issue necessitating that our NTY Cape Town flight has to route through Johannesburg for a fuel uplift.”    That is the abbreviation for Sun City.    I would say so yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.   When you refer to economies of scale you refer to the more you order the better price you get if I can put it in short Chair.    That is correct yes Chair.    Quantities I cannot work out.  SA Express at the time had a staff member which is Gavin Fourie which also made an affidavit which was the fuel specialist that worked out the relevant requirements, distance travelled versus fuel to be used Chair.  I would approach – I would have approached Gavin to give me the quantities to make sure that it is the correct number Chair.    Yes I did Chair.    We had a very good working relationship Chair.    On certain elements of our works – in our working space we assisted one another.  For him I needed assistance with – he would normally work out which countries we would fly over to another destination which then came back to me verifying invoices for certain ATMS’s overflight charges and things like that and I assisted him on the other hand with relevant documentation for procurement if he need sourcing regarding planning or requirements relating to his work Chair.    Me and Gavin shared an office Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    As the norm him being my General Manager I would copy him in on everything that I have done especially if he has instructed me to do something I would copy him in so that he could see that I have done it Chair.   That is correct Chair.    After I notified I copy Dave Allanby in I was basically totally out of this process completely Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   It is my understanding that it is Chair.    It was handed over to Doctor Samuel Vilakazi which was the CPO, Chief Procurement Officer of SA Express at the time.    Up to the point of where we are now?    In my affidavit.  I believe no because sourcingshould have been done through a procurement process.    No that was not done Chair.    No I did not Chair.    It is my understanding that it is when there is an emergency situation.  Aircraft on ground for example where a service is so urgently required that it cannot take a long process to get the type of service.  That is my understanding of it Chair.    Yes that is fine with me thank you Chair yes.    No I am not Chair.    That is correct that is according to an email that I read ja.    On the 18 October 2017.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct that is November Mike Echo it is a CRJ 200 aircraft.    I speak under correction but at the time it wasschedule of around fourteen aircraft.    Merriam was the GM for Legal Chair.    She was the chairperson of the BAC Chair.    That is correct the I needs to be replaced by an e.  Merriam Mochoele.    Mochoele.    Mochoele ja.    She was the general manager of Human Capital.    That is Aircraft on Ground Chair.    That is correct.  There is reference to that in the policy Chair.    He was the Chief Financial Officer at the time.    Reading it in the contents of the WhatsApp I would say yes Chair.    Mochoele.   Mochoele yes.    I would – according to what is discussed here the reference is heavy maintenance side and Sun City.  Meaning it would be a requirement for Denel which is the defueling and refuelling and also then the fuel Jet A1 Fuel supply to Pilanesberg Sun City.    That is – that is correct Chair.    That is correct according to the WhatsApp round robin.  I can see that it is for the Denel side and also for thePilanesberg side.    No.  We did not have a requirement for other airports Chair.    That is correct yes.  That is my understanding as well.  It was only for the two sections Chair.    The deviation done in respect of – of this process was not done by myself.  It was done by my General Manager – Dave Allenby - Chair.    What normally happened was that I drew up a document – a deviation document and submit it for signatures.  In this instance my General Manager drew up the deviation himself Chair.    I normally had meetings with my General Managers to verify and authorise expenses – invoices – and on one occasion he did mention that there is a deviation and I did see it in his office Chair.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes because the paragraph refers to already aproposal Chair.    That is correct Chair.    If – if a deviation would have been done for example by myself I would understand that there should have been a better financial summary indicating expenses to be incurred by SA Express.  Here it just states ad hoc as per negotiated contract which I feel is not sufficient for this process …   Chair.    My understanding is that when you implement a deviation the deviation must be fully authorised and goes – it goes through a process.  Once it is fully authorised then only can the Legal Department actually start negotiating an agreement Chair.    5.3.    NTY which is Pilanesberg Sun City and JNB which is Johannesburg OR Tambo on the Denel premises – it states here …    Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Sir on a deviation yes but with my experience with doing deviations each section has provision to say approved or and they normally mark the section if they do approve it or disapprove it.   In this instance I – I would believe that the Acting CEO would have override it or but I would expect every single person to accept or decline yes.  That is the normal process.    When I look at the deviation like this and the signatures are placed on it and especially with these people authorising the WhatsApp’s I would believe that they approved it because they signed the document irrespective of marking it approved or disapproved but that would be my personal opinion on this document Chair.    Not because of …   Yes.    In relation to the round robin that everyone approved and putting down their signatures on the document …    My personal opinion sir would be that they have approved.    Yes.    I agree Chair.    That is …    That is correct (microphone off).    That is correct Chair.    No I don’t Chair.   This letter is very broad, and it’s got no specification on the Pilanesberg or the fuelling requirements at Technical.  It states award for supply of fuel to S A Express, which is extremely broad Chair. ADV VERUSCHKA    No sir I have no knowledge, this took place without my knowledge of it Chair.    I would understand so yes sir Chair.    So then they would obviously ensure that the services that was taking place already then runs from the 1 s t of July that is line with then the contract that they signed Chair.    That is correct Chair yes.    I would agree to that yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    The 1 s t of the 7 t h 2017.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I first observed the period of three years I also observe the litres, 25million litres and also 8million litres per annum which is a bit exorbitant in my view chair.    The requirement, I just want to refer back to my paragraph, which was 8 500 litres per week which resulted in a total of approximately 442 litres per annum if we use a 52 week Chair.      No it didn’t Chair.    That is correct Chair. ADV VERUSCHKA    It’s not only confined to Pilanesberg Airport.    Yes Chair.    Apologies Chair, just repeat?    The specifications should have been Denel, because that’s where the heavy maintenance took place, so that would be Denel at OR Tambo, it is based at OR Tambo International, but if you place OR Tambo International it can mean anywhere at OR TamboInternational, so a specification like Denel or for heavy maintenance at Denel Technical Denel and Pilanesberg Operations would have been in my view better.    We had an ongoing contract with SAA to supply, to assist with the fuel at OR Tambo for our normal operations.    That is the concern.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair yes.    Two times a week, that would be four flights, that would be two on a Monday and two on a Friday.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    442 000 litres per annum.    That’s per annum for Pilanesberg only Chair.    I cannot comment on OR Tambo because I do not ...(intervention)     I don’t know the requirements of technical how many litres they actually negotiated yes Chair.   Yes that’s correct.    That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct, from an operational point yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair. ADV VERUSCHKA    My situation is fine Chair.    I will be fine, I’m also okay with going on, it’s not a problem Chair.    That’s correct, thank you Chair, that’s fine.
SEPTEMBER:And so just for a better understanding when someone is contracted to do refuelling, sorry, defueling and then refuelling would it ordinarily include the supply of Jet A1 fuel?  Do you know?  And so those are unique identification registrations on each aircraft?  Thank you.Two days ...(intervention)  Chair just for the record ...(intervention)  If I can ask you now to ...(intervention)  
LOOCK:  Denel is where the technical heavy maintenance took place on our aircraft Chair.
