CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody, good morning Doctor Ngubane.    Yes.    Thank you.  Okay.   Good morning.    Thank you very much.    Thank you.    Yes.    Thank you.  We have admitted this?    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Oh yes.    Yes.   Okay, alright, thank you.    Yes.    Please administer the oath or affirmation?    Thank you.    That refers to the red numbers at the top.    On the right hand corner.    Should he start from the beginning if he was not audible?    I think.    Ja maybe if you could start from the beginning.    Yes.  Where is the CV that he supplied – in his statement does say CV’s here.    No the attorney is shaking his head.    Is his CV here because his statement does say my CV is supplied.    Yes, no that is not…    Have you got it there – have you got it with you outside of the bundle maybe?    Yes that is the one – he was reading from the one …    No, no I am sorry I think he was reading from – were you not reading from 63?    Ja let us try and see if he can…    Ja you see he was reading from page 63.  You say there is something here at pag 63.    Well his statement does say – it says   That is supposed to be …    Is it not attached to the statement because it should be?    Where – what page?    Have a look at page 16 Doctor Ngubane and see whether that is what you are looking for?    That is the one you were looking for?    Okay alright.   I think read from that one rather then.    Ja okay.    It seems to omit two aspects which are relevant to – at least one of them which relevant for present purposes.  Chairperson of the board of the SABC?   I thought that was an important …    Thank you.    No that is alright.    You are not the only one.    A lot like looking at the evidence leaders ja.    Ja no that is fine.    Cost cutting measures.    Hm.    Yes okay.    Hm.    Hm.   Do - do you know whether he left at the time when Dr Ngubane was still Chairperson?    Oh it was after?    Okay.    May - may - maybe - maybe Ms Norman …   Before you proceed.    Dr Ngubane do you have a recollection of more or less how many managers had their contracts not renewed pursuant to that policy that you decided upon.  Namely if a manager is on a fixed term contract and that contract comes to an end we will not renew it as part of cost cutting measures. Do you have a recollection of about how many you - might have gone based on that decision?   Probably 10?    Yes.  I guess that what you would do is not just to say well if and when a contract ends we will not renew it what you would have done is look at the - at the work that that person does …    At the position.  Obviously if the position - if the work - the responsibilities that are attached to that position are quite important or essential …    Then - then you would not have a situation where there is nobody performing those duties and it would be a question whether you renew or extend the contract of the existing person or you do not renew that contract but you get somebody else.  Of course if youget somebody else then it is not cost cutting measures.    Is that right?    So in each case you would have looked at …    How important the function is?    And the performance?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    Did you …?   So there was a written agreement?    Hm, hm.   Yes, yes.    No that is fine.    Did you get to know how SABC had lost these Sports Rights before your time?  How it had come about that they lost those rights or is that something you never got to under - you know?    Okay.    The retention bonuses.  Just explain to me what that -that is so that I - I understand.  What is the - I know a bonus even though Judges do not get a bonus but is that money that an executive gets paid to giving an incentive to stay in the institution and not leave?    Hm.    Yes.    It - it has got nothing to do with performance?    Yes.    Just gets it; and - and would there be a separate bonus for performance or there would only be the retention bonus which is supposed to take into account performance?    Hm.    Hm.    Of the targets?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well it is - it is kind of surprises me. You know.  I do not know you know.  From what you say I do not think it would have been limited to what might call people with rare skills.  That you would not want to - you would not want to leave your organisation because getting people with those skills would be quite difficult and might take you long and in the process the institution might be suffering. It was not based on that - this retainer.  It was paid to a lot of other - a lot of people whose skills might not be said to be rare.    Yes.    Did you have a recollection of more or less maybe what percentage of a - a person’s remuneration it would be in terms of how it would be calculated?  Would it be like 10 percent of your annual salary or some - anything like that or is this - is that a detail that you cannot remember?    Yes.    It was there?    Yes, okay.    Thank you.    Well let me just make sure I have not missed anything.  I know that at a certain stage I asked you how many managers you were able to - not to renew their contracts and you said maybe around 10.    Of course 10 out of 1 000 that may have been desired is quite a long way but are there other categories that you were able to - I do not want to say get rid of - but that you were able to allow or retrench or - or terminate at managerial level because I think the Minister said leave the unionised staff alone. Look at the management.  Are there others that you were able to allow to go?   And - and would that have ended up being quite a significant - significant number in terms of the targets …    Of 1 000 …    Or not really?    Yes.    Yes.    And your own assessment as - as you sit here and I know that you might not recall a lot of details - as you sit here would you estimate that maybe you went up to - you reached 100 or 200 or 500?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Hm.    Yes.   Okay, okay.    Okay.  So - so in the end I - I guess that the - the number of people left either because of natural attrition or because of the findings of the Auditor-General exceeded 500?    No, no, no.    Oh, okay.    No that is fine.  Thank you.    Of course if somebody leaves whether it is retirement or they leave because of findings if you do not replace them logic dictates that maybe you did not need somebody doing what they were doing.    Yes.   And did you get to know how this had come about to have maybe a - a significant number of people that really were not really needed in the organisation?  Did you get to know how this had come about?    So - so people were being employed whose services the institution did not really require?    Ja.  Hm.  Thank you.    I think just tell him.    What was the term of the Government guarantee?    How long were you supposed to …?   And you paid it off within one and a half years.    One and a half years?    Okay.  Thank you.    So in other words you are not attractive to them if you have low ratings?   Audience ratings?  Ja.    The - the higher your rate - ratings are the more attractive you are to them?    Well you - you could - you could be irrelevant if somebody was looking doing business lawfully but you could berelevant if they wanted to do it unlawfully.  You say to them I do not have power to do that.  They say no come on you are the Chairperson of the Board.    You are very powerful in SABC.  Talk to so and so.  Did nobody ever say anything along those lines?  We want - we want to increase this.  We want to get that.    Ja, but I am now talking more beyond just - just the breakfast shows.  I am talking just in general.    You know that they were - while - while you were Chairperson.  There were no business people or any people who made any attempts to get you to influence people to give them business at SABC?    That did not happen?    Okay.    Did you at any stage become close to the Gupta family or anybody in the Gupta family and when I say close I appreciate that it might be difficult to say when - when is close, close but you - you might be able on your own understanding to say well the following over time we did become close or we never became close.  I went to one or two social events and that was it.    Yes.    Yes.    And the - the editor at that stage was itMr (indistinct)?    Williams?    Oh, okay.  No I was thinking of the witness.    I am sorry.  TNA - that is the New Age?    Ja.  The editor of the New Age …   That is the one you are talking about?    Oh.  I was thinking of the witness    Who came to give evidence …    But he was for the television.    No.  Is that ANN7?    Okay, okay.    No that is alright.  So that is the person that youconsider yourself to have been close at some stage?    Yes, okay.    So the price which the SABC would charge for airtime or advertising would be influenced by, one, the level of the ratings, audience ratings at the particular time of the advert and I think yousaid the type of people who would be watching around that time, I think you mentioned something like that.  So that if the SABC knows that business A wants one minute at that time but there are many others who would like that one minute at that time, they could say we want more for this one minute because if you don’t take it then somebody else will take it and therefore the businesses would be prepared to pay more as well because there is prime, I don’t know if that is the term used, it’s the best time, one of the best times to advertise?     Well it’s just interesting to me to say weekends the prices are low because I would have thought that weekends is when a lot of people would be watching television because a lot of people would not be working, unlike during the weekdays and therefore the audience would be higher, is that just ignorance on my part?     And most of them go to church only in the mornings.     Okay.     What page?     Are you able to see folder or divider 21 the green one?     Yes paragraph 26.     Page 7 at the top right hand corner and paragraph 26 at the bottom of the page.     Page 7 in your statement, have you found your statement, we are back to your statement.    26 at the bottom of page 7.     And that was the position until you left?     Yes okay.     Oh yes let’s take the tea adjournment it’s quarter past eleven, we’ll take the tea adjournment and we’ll resume at halfpast eleven, we adjourn.    Yes let us proceed.    If you can just press – there is a button there ja.    1995?    Yes.    Would that – would the position have been called Stakeholder Relations Manager or something like that?    Okay.   Mr Motsoeneng I am…   Yes.    Hm.    EXCO would be GCEO, CFO and COO?    Some senior managers as well?    Okay alright.    When he was appointed Stakeholders Relations Manager I think that is the position you mentioned.    I guess as the first position that he held at SABC head office after being brought in from the Free State, is that right?    Yes.  Who – had there been someone else who had held that position before namely Stakeholder Relations Manager?    There was none for the board?    Yes.    So does that mean that there were therefore two Stakeholder Relations Managers one who had always been there who was doing this job on behalf of – or for the management and then now another one doing it for the board?    He combined the two?    Okay what happened to the person who had done it – had been doing it before him?   Or the management?    Yes.    Oh.  So when he brought Mr Motsoeneng the other person did not continue doing this job?    He might have – he or she might have gone – been given other responsibilities or whatever?    Yes, yes, yes.    Yes but when Mr Motsoeneng was doing this job was your understanding that he was at that stage doing it for the board but there was nobody else to talk to outsiders about the same issues?    Yes.  Now I am wondering why the board needed somebody to do that for them simply because my understanding would have been that the – that would relate to operational matters that one would expect to go under the management and that it would not be something that the board would be involved in relations with unions andso on and so on.  Am I mistaken in that regard? DR BALDWIN SIPHO    That is between the board and the management?    Yes.    Okay.  So – so there was an appreciation that normally this is not what the board would be involved in but the board considered that the circumstances in which the SABC was were such that the board had to get involved in these issues?    Yes.    Yes.  I remember ja Doctor Casaburri ja.    I am sorry.    The interviews for filling in the position of COO would they normally be conducted by the board or would they be conducted bythe GCEO or a panel appointed by the board or a panel appointed by the GCEO?  Who would conduct those interviews?    Oh so – so the panel would be a panel that isapproved by the board?    And then that panel would make recommendations to the board?    And then the board would then – the board would not have appointing powers but it would have recommending powers?  It would recommend to the Minister or what would be the position?    Okay yes.    Oh.    Okay yes.    Oh okay.  So the appointment was to be made by the board but the board for the appointment to be effective.    They needed the concurrence of the Minister?    And the Minister would take the name to the cabinet.    And then come back.    Okay alright.  And now in regard to I think you said Mr Mbembe is that right?    He was interviewed by a panel that had been approved by the board?    And – and the panel recommended that he be appointed?    And the board approved that he be appointed?    And then the board communicated with the Minister to say here is the candidate that has been recommended by theinterviewing panel we are happy with him.  We are appointing him but we are asking you to concur?    Yes and then the Minister took long to come back?    Or maybe never came back?    You cannot remember?  You cannot remember.  But for a long time she was not coming back to the board.    And as Chairperson I would have expected that you would at some stage have approached her and say is there a problem and if you did what did she say?    Oh that was before you time?    Oh I am sorry I thought it was…    During your time.  So this is – this had happened before you came in?    Yes in this position?    You cannot remember how long the position had remained vacant more or less?    That is quite a long time.    And in terms of the – in terms of the records of the board you do not remember that you found anything or correspondence that had come from the Minister to tell the previous board what theproblem was?    Yes.    Yes.  But when you – when your board came in was Doctor Matsepe-Casaburri who was – to whom you referred earlier was she still the Minister or was it General Nyanda who was Minister when your board came in?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay thank you.    I guess somewhere we have got those papers.    Of that in order.    Yes.    When he was put in the office of the Group Chief Executive Officer do you remember exactly what his tile or position was at the time in that office?    Oh this position of Stakeholder Relations manager which he held – which was the first position he held when he came tohead office?    Was located in the office of the Group Chief Executive Officer?    Okay.    Wait I am sorry.    Maybe before that on the face of it it does look strange that the board on which the GCEO, the Group Chief Executive Officer would be serving – would not be happy with how their decisions are communicated to the staff.  Maybe let us leave aside the unions for the time being.  Because the Group Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Officer.  He or she is in charge of the whole staff and one expects thathe is best positioned to communicate to the whole staff whatever decisions the board has taken.  I do not know if you want to say anything about that – to make any comment?  It does sound strange.  It sounds like a vote in no confidence in the GCEO. DR BALDWIN SIPHO    Yes.  Was that still Mr Mokwetle or was it somebody else?    Mr Mokwetle ja.    So that was the one who – with whom the board had lack of trust and he ended up leaving?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    So it would be fair to say and probably this is what you have said but I just want to make sure I have got it right.  Probably it would be fair to say that the board’s decision to shift theresponsibility of communication to Mr Motsoeneng even to the staff.    Was a result at least in part of the board no longer having full trust in the CGEO.  Would it be correct to put it that way?    It would be correct okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry I think Ms Norman.    Interrupted your earlier on I think you were wanting to get into how he came to be asked to attend board meetings.    And he might or might not have – Doctore Ngubane might or might not have answered that.   But I did not understand that.    And then maybe that is because I asked some question.    Can you get back to that?  How did he come to be invited to attend board meetings Mr Motsoeneng?    So – so – so it was   But also you did not want him to be an observer as such you wanted him to be able to participate in discussions but not indecision making?    Yes.  Okay.    And maybe just to confirm I think the answer you have - you gave me about the role - Mr Motsoeneng’s role at the board    But not vote.    So - so that would be take - participating.  So there was some participation allowed to him except voting?    Okay.    I am sorry.    But let me - let me go back to that Dr Ngubane.  Under what circumstances would he be allowed to take part in thediscussions?  Would it be if there was something that the board wanted to be explained by him or clarified by him or was the situation such that he took part in all discussions normally like everybody who was there but just did not vote?    Okay.  The reason why I was thinking about it is towhat extent it may have been acceptable in terms of good governance to have somebody taking part in discussions all discussions even if he does not vote who is not a board member.  That - that is why I was asking that question. Is that - is that an issue that you may have applied your mind to in one way or another?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm; and he was - you considered that he was the person who could give that - that …   That information?    Yes, okay.    Huh-uh. ADV THANDI NORMAN    When you say you had not dealt with the issue for some time are you talking about not dealing with it for some timedespite knowing of its existence or are you talking about a situation where you did not know that it existed as a problem and that is why you did not deal with it?    So that - that was the problem?    Because I am - I am just wondering why there would be any problems of witnesses in terms of people who were said to be doing business with the SABC because I mean the paper trail should be there and if they are linked to certain companies if they were members of close corporations or directors of companies that information is obtainable - is easily obtainable. So - so - but you say there was a problem of the lack of will on the part of senior manager - managers to deal with the situation?    Hm.   Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.  Okay, thank you.    Now in - in regard to the years when you wereChairperson of the Board do you have a recollection of how the Auditor-General’s reports looked like in terms of SABC.  Where they quite okay?  Where there still serious challenges that the AG was pointing out or is that something you might not be able to remember?    Okay, but still not - not satisfactory.  There is still serious challenges?    Yes, okay.    Thank you.    Well the position that he occupied as stake - stakeholders - Stakeholder Relations Manager you have said it was a position that did exist before although the person occupying that position would not have been representing the board would have been representing the management as I understand the position. Now one would have expected that if Mr Motsoeneng came from wherever he came to occupy that position or was appointed to that position he would earn what is the rate for somebody occupying that position.  When you talk about an adjustment the way you talk it creates the impression in my mind and I just want to give you a chanceto clear that if that is not correct. It creates the impression that it was something special that was done.  Whereas I expect that there would be nothing special done.  Somebody comes from a certain position, goes to (interference with mic) responsibilities that are attached to a certain position.  That position exists.  They get paid what anybody occupying that position would be paid. Of course you did say that before Mr Motsoeneng whoever was occupying this position of Stakeholder Relations Manager was speaking only for the management not for the board but I am not sure whether just adding that part of speaking for the board would necessarily have required the addition of any money. So when he came to this position or was appointed did he not immediately and whatever was supposed to be the rate for this position?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Okay.  So - so you see that - that language might create the impression that it was something special for him.    Whereas from what you are saying if the position was simply that at the Free State he was occupying a position that was for argument’s sake at Grade 5 but as Stakeholder Relations Manager that position is at Grade 7 - Grade 7.    Obviously he must earn the rate that is applicable at Grade 7 …    And it has got nothing to do with him as a person.  It is simply that anybody occupying that position must earn that salary.  You - you understand?    Ja.    That the use of the language could …    Give a wrong impression.    Yes.    Yes, but whatever - what you call adjustment wasnothing more than that he was from a certain time to be paid at - at a rate that was for somebody occupying the position he was occupying?    Yes, but before that was done did he for some time when he was already at the Head Office - did he for some time continue to - to be paid at the rate of the position he occupied in the Free State?    As you recall.    Hm.    Yes, okay.    You might not recall but to you know how far apart the two positions were?  The one that Mr Motsoeneng held in the Free State and the one that he held at the Head Office as Stakeholder Relations Manager.  Do - do you know how many grades higher the -the last one was?    Or is it something that you might not recall because I am trying to think …    That maybe some of the confusion and maybe some of the things that may have been said might relate to the fact that even though he might be earning a salary that is appropriate for somebody occupying the position of Stakeholder Relations Manager maybe he has jumped quite a number of ranks and therefore that is what may attractattention.  Is that something you do not remember?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    To explain everything?    Thank you.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    From what you have said it seems that this was how he got to occupy this position of Stakeholder Relations Manager.  It seems that he was just - he was just identified by the Group Chief Executive Officer as the right person to come and occupy this positionat Head Office without any advertisements being made even internally to look for people who would apply for this position and be interviewed. Am I correct in understanding that - that there was no advertisement internally of the position and other people were not allowed to apply?  He was just identified by the Group Chief Executive Officer and he checked with either the Chairperson of the Board or the board that it would be fine if he brought that person and he brought the person.    Is my understanding correct?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  As you understood the position this was quite allowed by the policies of the SABC for - for somebody to be identified like that and then to be taken to a particular position without any competition even from internally.    Yes, yes because it does strike me - I mean while onthe one hand I - I can understand that sometimes there is somebody that appears to have certain skills and maybe qualifications and maybe special talents that you identify for a certain position and it might look like really you know everybody else within the organisation. You do not think there is anybody who matches the skills or qualifications or experience of that particular person while on the one hand one can understand that that can happen but what I am thinking is if that person is so good.  If that person has such skills what will you lose by advertising internally? Let him be one of the candidates because if he is so good heis going to beat all of them and still be the one who gets appointed.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, because it - it does or it can leave room for abuse of power.  Not that it always will be abused.  It could be genuine and so on and so on …    But it does leave room that if I am in charge and I know there is a certain position and I would like to do you a favour.  I could say no, no, no.  Dr Ngubane has - is good for this position.  I will say he must just come - come here and yet if I did not do things that way - I said look he has got good skills but let us - let us allow other people to apply and I think he will emerge victorious anyway. Then it eliminates room for - for abuse.  Of course it may well be that there may have been good grounds of urgency to - to appoint and not to follow certain procedures.  I am not sure but I am just sharing with you what is going on in my mind as - as you give theevidence.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  No thank you.     The question would be whether, at the time that the advertisement for the position was made or published, whether you were still Chairperson for the position of COO?     You were still Chairperson ja okay thank you.     Yes I’m sorry let’s see if we can find it, if it in…[intervenes].     There’s a problem with page numbers?     Well if you - there might be a problem like that, if  you are able to  read what the contents of the advert or the relevant parts and show the advert to Dr Ngubane even if there’s a problem withthe page just so that he sees it, that would be fine.     Maybe before you do that, let me ask this question, as I understand it, when it came to the Group Chief Executive Officer, the CFO and the COO I think you said that those appointments would come to the Board.  So you did say that in regard to the COO you would need – the Board would need the concurrence of the Minister and the Minister would take the name to the Board.  I take it that, that would be the same process for all the three positions?     So since those three positions would be filled by the Board, I take it that it would be the Board that would decide on what the requirements would be for any one of those positions whenever they were vacant.  In other words, they would say, okay if we are going to advertise for the position of Group Chief Executive Officer, what arewe going to look for, what are the essential requirements, what are the recommended – I’m not sure if it’s correct to say recommended requirements but what skills or qualifications would we regard as ones that would be good but are not essential for the person that we’ll appoint to have, am I correct that, that – it would be the Board that would look at that?     So that when the advert goes out it must have been approved by the Board to say it reflects what we are looking for?     That’s correct, okay thank you.     Okay, alright.     Okay.     Yes he may as well maybe read all the key accountabilities because I think those are the key responsibilities and then the requirements.     Mr Motsoeneng.     Look at the evidenced leader and listen to her,you’re busy showing him but he’s looking elsewhere.     Well shouldn’t you first tell us the divider, what divider number?     Divider number five?     Okay that’s a pink one.    Let him find it first, I don’t know if he has found it.     Is it part of the report of the portfolio committee- ad hoc committee?     On the SABC Board, okay.     That’s the cover page for the report of the ad hoccommittee on the SABC Board of inquiry can you find that page on 141?     Yes okay and she would like you to go to page 162, yes on the red numbers at the right-hand corner at the top.     Did the Public Protector, before issuing her report ever ask you or afford you an opportunity to say something about whatever allegation she might have been told that you were responsiblefor the alteration of an advert?     Did she raise this with you?     This was never put to you that there was an allegation that you altered the advert – the requirements for the position in the advert?     So she never raised that with you?     And…[intervenes].     As far as you can remember?    The altered advert ja, and you never instructed anybody to alter the requirements in the advert or anything like that?     Mr Mbembe?     Yes that was in the discussion?     At a Board meeting or outside of the Board meeting?     Yes governance committee.     Maybe just so that one can understand that suggestion, was that discussion, did that take place before the advert that we talked about earlier, the one that we have seen as far as yourecall or was it after, that discussion that you are talking about, do you know whether it happened before this advert was issued, the one that we have?     It happened before the advert?     Yes, yes but in regard to the advert to which Mr Mbembe had responded by applying for the job do you know whether the requirements that were in that advert and the key responsibilitieswere basically the same as the ones in the advert that we do have?     You don’t know.     Yes but what you had said before this advert was issued was that in order to advertise this position they must simply use the one that had been used before to which Mr Mbembe had responded.     Whether they did that or not, you don’t know?     You just know that this is the advert that went out and you didn’t have a problem with it?     Yes thank you.    Ja that’s fine yes do that ja.     I’m sorry Miss Norman I’m sorry I’m interrupting you, before we move away from the exchange between Dr Ngubane and Mr Wagener, yes I’m also particular about not pronouncing people’s namescorrectly, before we move away from that discussion between the two of them, are we done with it, was the issue left where it is?     Oh okay.     Oh okay that’s fine.     It’s a green folder.     Has he found – have you found it Dr Ngubane?     And the Public Protector’s report at page 244, the next page you have found it after the divider?     Public Protector’s report after the divider.     Okay.     290.     Have you found page 290 at the top?     Yes okay she will ask a question on that page.     And do you have – now at the time that Mr Mbembewas interviewed your Board was not in place yet, is that correct?     So you didn’t interview or it wasn’t your panel that interviewed him but do you know what – you don’t know what qualifications may have been required for candidates who applied for that position at the same time as he did, you don’t know that or do you?     Yes, yes, so you might not have known what requirements were there but you assumed that those would have been the requirements that would have been approved by the Board and therefore they should be fine.     Okay now this part where, in the report of the PublicProtector she says you indicated to her that she was not allowed to change the requirements of the advertisement and that it had to go out exactly as the one in 2008, if I stop there, it might be close to what you said earlier on but you must just tell me if it’s not close.  You had said that you said in the discussions that took place at the governance committee meeting in a governance committee meeting you said but an appointment – there is a candidate who had already been approved by the Board and you were referring to Mr Mbembe.  There was an advert that would have gone out for – to which he responded, that is the advert that should be used but I understood it, you are putting that as asuggestion, as an idea in the discussion is that right?     Now what she says here to the extent that, that’s the advert that was used in 2008, to that extent she might be close to saying something that reflected your attitude, just that part that I read, do you want me to read that part so you can just see whether it correctly reflects what your attitude was.     She says, the Public Protector says the following about what Miss Mokhobo said to her at paragraph 6.1.3.5 page 291 and its paginated bundle and it’s at page 48 of the report of the Public Protector, she says,“During my meeting with Miss Mokhobo on 11 March 2013,Miss Mokhobo indicated that the Chairperson of the Boardindicated to her that she was not allowed to change therequirements for the advertisement and that it had to go outexactly as the one in 2008”,Now the Public Protector says Miss Mokhobo said you said to her you’re not allowed to change it, that’s the part where I say, maybe what she says is close to what you may have said but you can indicate whether that was your attitude, that it should not be allowed or whether you simply said, why not use the same advert that was used in 2008, without saying you are not allowed?     Yes so you might have – you might have said she mustn’t change the advert because you wanted the same advert that had been used previously should be used again?     Yes, yes so that part might be correct.  Miss Mokhobo indicated that the Chairperson was adamant that he did not want to see any qualifications reflected in the advertisement, what do you say about that part?     So you never said that?     Yes, okay, Miss Norman.    Okay let’s take the lunch adjournment then we will resume at five past two, we adjourn.    Okay let us proceed.    Did you put a question to…    Let us – let us go back and you can indicate what you know and what you do not know.      When you did tell me already that the idea of bring Mr Motsoeneng into the head office of SABC was that of the then Group Chief Executive Officer Mr Mokwetle I think that is the person who came with this idea to you.    Yes and you said okay that is fine as I understand the position after he gave some motivation which was that the station – radio station where he was in the Free State was making money while a lot of other SABC radio stations were losing money.  Is that right?    Now the power to appoint somebody to that positiondid it lie with the Group Chief Executive Officer and not with the board or Stakeholder Relations Manager or did it lie with the board?    Yes.    Yes.  And that is – that if for the three positions that we mentioned earlier or is it four?  Chief – Group Chief Executive, CFO, COO was there a fourth one?   Yes.    So it was three?    Yes.  Okay.  And those three the board has the power to appoint subject to the Minister concurring and so on?    Ja.  But for the Stakeholder Relations Manager that was the – within the power of the Group Chief Executive Officer?    Now I asked earlier on whether you knew what the gap was between the position that Mr Motsoeneng held at the radio station in the Free State and the position of Stakeholder Relations Manager and I think you did say he jumped quite a few ranks.  But I donot know if you said three or you are not sure whether it was three or not but you know he jumped quite a few ranks.    Yes.  And in terms of what the difference in salary between the two positions namely the one in the Free State and the one of Stakeholder Relations Manager do you have any recollection of how much difference there was between the two?    More or less.   Figures.    Yes.    It was a significant difference?    Yes.   Yes.  Did you know at that time when Mr Motsoeneng was – when the Group CEO at the time wanted to appoint him to this position did you know what the requirements were for somebody to occupy that position of Stakeholder Relations Manager or is that something you did not know?    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  That is all you knew?    About the position.    And in terms of what his qualifications were at whatstage did you get to know that – was that before he came to the head office or was that after?    Yes.    This is now people who employed him in the Free Stare?    Yes okay.    So at that time when you sought an understanding from those who had employed him was he still Stakeholder Relations Manager as you recall or had he become acting COO?    Okay.  And at the time he was appointed acting COO I would have imagined that okay let me just start by this.  The appointment of an acting COO I would imagine that is – that falls within the power of the board, is that correct or …?    Ja.  So he would have been appointed by the board?   As acting COO.    I would have expected that the board before appointing him as acting COO it would have sought to satisfy itself that whatever qualifications or requirements there may have been for that position that he complied them is satisfied then, is that right?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay when he was appointed as acting COO the position he still held was that of Stakeholder Relations Manager?    Ja but holding what position?    Stakeholder Relations Manager?    But what was still manager and nothing else.    Yes.    Oh okay.  So he had moved from being Stakeholder Relations Manager and had gone higher up.    Is that right?    And the ranking of the position of Stakeholder Relations Manager and that of Group Stakeholder – Stakeholder Executive was the Group Stakeholder Executive immediately above theposition of Stakeholder Relations manager?    Or there was any jumping there?    There was a significant difference?    Okay and the one for Stakeholder Relations Executive had it always been there before?    Okay, okay.  So – but not a position as such?  In other words when you say it was a function I get the impression that what you mean is somebody did that function but that person might not necessarily have been given this title but it might have been one of his or her responsibilities together with other responsibilities?    Regional Manager?    Yes.    That is what it was.    The category?    Okay that is what it was before – before MrMotsoeneng occupied the position.    Okay.  So – so but you say there is a significant difference between that level and the level of Stakeholder Relations Manager?    Yes.    Stakeholder?    Yes.    CEO’s office.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes, yes.   Yes.  Yes, yes.  Okay what I want to understand is before he gets appointed as Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations.    You said that before that the function he did – he performed in that position used to be done within the office of the Group Chief Executive Office.    And then I said that gives me the impression that it might not have been a position on its own but it might have been a taskor a responsibility that was done by somebody who may have held a different position so that is where we were.  Is my understanding correct?    ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay, okay.    So – but the Stakeholder Manager that one Iunderstand.    Because I think you explained earlier on that before Mr Motsoeneng was appointed to that position of manager there was somebody else but that person who was performing that function in relation to the management not the board but that after Mr Motsoeneng came in I do not know if you said you do not know what happened to the other person but there was only one person and that was Motsoeneng?    Yes.  Now at that level I understand what happened.  Now I am now going to the level of Group Executive Stakeholder.    Now Mr Motsoeneng was promoted from Stakeholder Relations Manager to Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations.    And you have said that that was a big jump.  So the question I was asking was whether before his appointment – before he was appointed Groups Executive for Stakeholder was there such a position?  Your answer was some – well your answer was that function was being performed within the office of the Group Chief Executive Oficer.    And my question is whether as far as you know and you might not know – as far as you know whether there was somebodywho held a position that had a certain title or was it somebody who had another title that had nothing to do with Stakeholder Relations but whose responsibilities included performing what Motsoeneng later performed as Group Executive Stakeholder.  I hope – I hope I am clarifying myself?    Yes.    Oh but you – are you able to say whether when Mr Motsoeneng got appointed as Group Chief – Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations this was a new position that was created it did not exist before but the job he was going to do under this new position had been done by somebody else under a different position, is that something you are able to say or not really?    The jump from Stakeholder Relations Manager to Group Executive Stakeholder Relations are you also able to indicate whether it was a jump of two, three, four rankings as you are able to indicate earlier on or is that something – the detail that you are not able to remember?    You just remember it was significant.   Yes.    Oh okay, okay.  Thank you.  Ms Norman.    Are you moving to another aspect?    Aspect ja.  Okay no let me then finish maybe on this one.    Now the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng as Manager Stakeholder Relations that was done by the Group Chief Executive Officer.  Now his appointment as Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations was that done by the board or the Chief – Group Chief Executive?    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  And at that time it was still Mr Mokwetle as you recall?  The Group Chief Executive Officer.    Yes, yes.   I wonder whether the board – obviously the board would not be I would imagine rubber stamping what the Group Chief Executives are – Chief Executive Officer recommends.    It would apply its mind.    To the question, would this be a proper appointment.    Now on the understanding that the board would do that one is bound to then ask the question how did your board justify this significant jump in the promotion of Mr Motsoeneng from Stakeholder Manager to – to Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations at the salary difference that you have indicated.  What was the justification?   That is quite important.  I would think that if I am running my own private company and here I have in mind a small company because the moment it is a big company and there are unions and so on sometimes you cannot run it the way you want.  If I am running a small company of mine – a private company you know if Iidentify that hey this person is doing a very good job.  I need somebody to do this at a higher level.  I do not need to advertise outside I can see somebody inside I can say okay this person I will put at the higher position.  But now here one is dealing with a massive organisation and it is a state owned entity. 1. Why would that position not be open to – why would the board not see it as necessary to let there be competition for filling this position of Group Executive Stakeholder Relations even if it thought it is likely that Mr Motsoeneng is going to be – to emerge victorious as it were.  Why would it have thought it is not the right thing to say let us advertise?  You have this position let people be interviewed and then let us take it from there?    But of course the difficulty there is that you are looking – you get satisfied that the person has prior experience that you consider adequate because you are looking at a particular person.    You are not going to think about that if you are about people that you are not looking at.  But if you opened the competition how do you know that you would not actually find somebody who surprises you and you might think Motsoeneng is so exceptional and then somebody says look at my track record, look where I was before Icame here?  It is just that here at SABC I have been – I was appointed for this position I have never been given a chance in this area actually in the companies where I have been I have been exposed to this.  Look at the wonders that I have done there.  I can do this much better than anybody.  How do you know that you will not get somebody who says that if you open it up to competition?    That – in principle that I understand.    In principle that I understand but I would think that tothe extent that you may have been dealing with a burning SABC appointing somebody even if it was Mr Motsoeneng as an act – in an acting capacity for that position of Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations would take care of making sure that somebody would be doing this job while the fires are burning but when you look at appointing permanently you would have time to advertise and he would be one of the candidates and then whatever decision you make would be a decision that could not easily be challenged because you would be seen to have been fair.  What do you say to that?    Hm.    Yes.  You mean for the position – permanent position of Group Executive Stakeholders Relations?    Yes yes.  Okay.  So it is the acting appointment that was not advertised but the permanent appointment for that position was advertised?    Okay thank you.    Well my…    My 299 does not have those paragraph numbers.    Yes –     Hang on maybe I am not.    No, no, no I think I am at a wrong bundle.    Doctor Ngubane I suspect you and I were on a wrong page.    Are you on the right page now?   The bundle that has got the Public Protectors Report ja.    I was also on the same.    Ja it will be a different bundle.   Have you ever seen the application for employment to which they refer that Mr Motsoeneng apparently submitted to the SABC I guess when he was applying for employment for the first time because they seem to - to suggest that in that application for employment he misrepresented the position. I - as I understand it he must have said - if they are correct - he must have said he has Matric.  If they are correct in saying he misrepresented.  Have you ever seen that - that application for employment?   Hm.    It - it said he was doing Matric?    At a certain time?    But it did not list Matric as …    As a - as an educational level he had …    Passed?    Yes, okay.   Have you got it here?    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Well paragraph 6.1.3.45 which is at page 3-0-1 reflects …   The following   You might have been looking for that one.    Hm.    2-0-9?    Yes.    Okay.    2-9-0.    I am sorry.    Did you not say we must go to page …    2-9-0?    2-9-6?    Oh.    I am sorry.    This might help while you are looking.   This might help.  What you are looking for is it where you say somebody put up an affidavit?    And the affidavit was to the effect that they knew that he did not have Matric and they appointed him for whatever reason.    He had no Matric, yes.    They appointed him …    Despite knowing that?    That - that is what you were looking for?    That is what you are looking for now?    Yes, okay.    Hm.    Hm.  I think the - maybe one should look …    At it from this angle because I think the public or part of the public might also be looking at it in this way.  Namely was possession of Matric not required - was it not a requirement for the position of Stakeholder Relations Manager that - that might be one position but the board did not make that decision but once the board had to make a decision it - one would have expected that it would start by saying what are the requirements for this position. Does he meet those requirements?  So I think that one mustsay - ask the question for the position of Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations was possession of Matric not a requirement and was possession of Matric not a requirement for appointment as Acting CEO - COO.  So I think that - that is where you might wish to focus.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.  Would - would your answer therefore be that you knew that he did not have Matric but you knew that possession of Matric - Matric Certificate was a requirement for both of these positions but for certain reasons you decided that it was fine or - or is the position that the board did not know whether Matric was a requirement for these positions?    Would you then be in a position to say whether appointing somebody to a position where he or she did not meet one of the requirements …    Was a breach of whether it was policy or whatever governance rules and regulations.  You - you - that you knew that it was a breach but you considered that having regard to everything else you considered - the board considered itself justified or what - whatwould you say?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.  Okay, alright.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Hm, hm.    Well the - well I do not know about the facts you - you might know much more because you were Chairperson of the Board there.  I can - but I can understand a situation where there is a new dispensation that comes and comes in and it comes in when there was another dispensation before.  That other dispensation may have done things in a certain way …    And the new dispensation wants to do things differently …   But it is considered that maybe it would be unfair to then say people who had been appointed to a certain position under the previous dispensation should now be dismissed because the new dispensation has different requirements for those positions.  I - I can understand a situation where a decision is taken look when they came in they met the requirements that were required then. We want different requirements because maybe we have a different level to which we want to take this institution but then what might happen is as I see it you say well if those people stay where they are you leave them alone but if they want to go up …    Then you will - you will want them to meet the requirements that are required at the time when they want to go up.    That - that I can understand.  Is - is it that kind of situation that you - you are talking about in terms of the HR or could it be a situation similar to Motsoeneng because as I understand - I may be wrong - as I understand the position Mr Motsoeneng seems to have come into the SABC at the Free State after 1994 which I would consider to be a new dispensation. The other people - the other situations where there were people who did not have Matric do you know whether they would have been from the old - the dispensation or not really or is it something you would not know?  You just know that there were other people who didnot have Matric.    Would have, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  No I - I think that - I think that is important.  I mean there - there are many people who might not have Matric.  Who might not even have lower educational standards or grades than Matric who nevertheless are very good at what they are doing and who do a very good job and one must never create the impression that if you donot have Matric you are nothing. You know.  If you do not have a Degree you are nothing.  There are many people who make very important contributions in society without those formal qualifications but nevertheless I think what is important and you might wish to comment here is that it is important that the policies of an organisation that are put in place be followed …    And if the policies or regulations say for this position Matric is required …    That you stick to that.  Of course if you think that at a particular stage this policy does not serve the institution properly or these regulations do not serve the institution properly.  It maybe be that there is a reason to put - there is a case to put forward to say let us change it …    Because it prevents us for example from giving - from appointing somebody who might not have a piece of paper written Matric …    But has a lot of experience that would be good for the organisation but then you say to do it the proper way you say well if there are generally more situations like that probably not to do it for an individual.    Then you change it and then when you - when you invite applications if that is the kind of situation you are dealing with everybody knows what the rules are.    They know that if you do not have Matric but you have this prior experience and it is relevant you could be allowed.  You - you can apply …    And then you appoint somebody who does not have Matric in that situation you can justify it because you are not in breachof your policy or regulations.  That - that I think that - that is where the difference might be.  I do not know if you want to say anything.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So - so there was concurrence from the Minister and …    The board thought then …   It should be fine?    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Of course the - the responsibility might be that before the board sends anything to the Minister - before it makes its decision it must satisfy itself.    That if we do - if we make this decision.  These decisions will - this decision will be in line with the regulations and the policies …    And if it will not be they must not even send it to the Minister.  They must satisfy themselves.  Is it in accordance with the policies?  Is it in accordance with the regulations and the law?    That kind of thing because maybe when the Minister - when it comes to the Minister the Minister might also say oh the board has no problem.  I will defer to the board.  I think it must be fine.  So then everybody is - is not checking.  Everybody thinks the other one has checked.  It should - must be fine.    You understand where I - I am coming from?   Yes.  Thank you.    Well there is one that has got his statement.  There is one that has got the Public Protector’s …    Report and there is one that has got the transcript of the Parliamentary Committee …    But the best way to tell us what is - what is written on the spine.    There are - there are too many of these bundles now.    Okay.  SABC Reference Bundle.    Got it.    On page 2-1-9 …    The red number.    Not the - not the …    Not the handwritten one.    The one typed to the right.    Yes, okay.    Okay.    Yes but I think she made a mistake only in regard to that last line of the first of that paragraph.  Earlier on in the paragraph she does refer to Acting Chief …    Operations Officer.    Ja.    Maybe while you are looking for …    The minutes I just ask another question.  Acting appointments at Group Executive level were they throughout your time always made on the basis of simply identifying the individual and appointing that individual to act or was there a different process thatwas followed at - at some stage or in regard to other positions other than those of COO or Group Executive Stakeholder Relations?    Yes, but what I’m asking is whether the process, whether there was a particular process that was followed which was different from simply the appointing authority identifying who the person is that will be appointed to act, in other words whether sometimes what would be done is to say let’s look at different names or invite some people who are prepared to be considered and then onewould be appointed or whether for acting appointments it was always the position that there was no particular process, the Board just appointed somebody to act in a particular position that it considered was suitable.    The vacant position.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Oh, so insofar as acting is concerned it was theGroup CEO who made the appointment.    And then he would just inform the Board also.    Oh apart from the three positions.    For acting appointments in regard to the three positions it will be the Board that would make the decision.    Yes, but in that case too there was no particular process, would the Board simply look at whoever they decide should they thought would be right then they would appoint the person, without circulating any notice or invitation internally to say we will be appointing an acting person, those who think they want to be considered should send their names or CV’s, there would be nothing like that for acting appointments.    Okay, thank you.    Are we on the same bundle?    Page 39.    Yes.    You must start earlier otherwise we don’t know what the was agreeing with ...(intervention)     Stakeholder manager.    Yes.    Who were entitled to ...(intervention)    He was for all intents and purposes an acting member of the Board.    Yes, okay and therefore he could participate fully?    Ja.    Have you reached your statement, are you at your statement?    Okay ...(intervention)     Then page 13.    In other words to compete with them?   Ja.    And that was still General Nyanda, the Minister ...(intervention)      Bule, okay.    It was still MultiChoice?    Was that after the signing of some document that you talked about before?    Ja.    You had already signed.    Yes, okay.    So when you left there was an MOU or contract that had been signed but there were discussions that had not been finalised.    Okay.    Maybe because you said you were rounding off a point maybe let me say this and then Dr Ngubane you can just indicate if you – my understanding is correct.  My understanding now is that your – my understanding is that you are saying the appointment of MrMotsoeneng to the position of Acting COO, maybe starting with Acting Corporate Executive for Stakeholder Relations and his appointment as Acting COO may have been or was in breach of the requirements because he did not have matric, that we accept, but we acted in good faith, we thought that the circumstances which prevailed justified that we appointment him nevertheless, is my understanding correct of what ...(intervention)     Okay, alright.    You can’t get your mandate from somebody below you.    Thank you.  I think I would like us to go back to Mr Motsoeneng.  You did say that the SABC had had certain people do certain jobs and they had failed and that is people who may have had matric and above, and Mr Motsoeneng seemed to be able to be effective you know without those qualifications.  Now in this regard I take it that you were talking about the position the job he had to do as stakeholder relations manager, and as Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations, is that right?    Yes, now you did say that the jump from stakeholderrelations manager to Group Executive Stakeholder Relations was quite a significant jump, and your – for the acting appointment no other people were asked to make themselves available because that’s how acting appointments were made.    Ja, but you did say for the permanent appointment to that position the position was advertised, is that right, for the position of Group Executive for stakeholder relations, that position was advertised for permanent appointment.    Yes, and do you remember what requirements were put for the advert for that position, do you require – do you remember in terms of requirements for educational qualifications or is that something you can’t remember.    I think that one was for COO, I may be mistaken, I thought it was for Acting COO.    Yes.    Yes.  But I am now talking about not permanent for COO, I’m talking for permanent Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations, because I understood you earlier on, and you can just tell me me if I misunderstood, I understood you to say the Board appointedMr Motsoeneng as Acting Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations, but that later on there was an advert for a permanent position into – for that – a permanent appointment for that position, did I misunderstand?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.   Yes.    Okay.  I thought that he went through four stages, or three stages while you were there, I think the fourth stage namely a permanent appointment as COO happened when you were no longer there.   I thought that you said while you were there, there were three positions to which he was appointed.    One was where he was appointed by the Group Chief Executive Officer as Manager for Stakeholder Relations.    And the second was where he was appointed as initially Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations.    And that later he was appointed as Acting COO.    So I thought those were the three positions, but now I am talking about the middle one, and when I say middle it doesn’t necessarily it’s below another one, I am talking about the GroupExecutive for Stakeholder Relations.    I thought that your evidence was that initially he was appointed in an acting capacity to that position.    But that later on that position was advertised for permanent appointment.    Am I right in that – understanding that?    You were not involved in that?    Oh, for Group Executive?    Okay, but it – there was an advertisement for that post for permanent appointment as far as you know.    Yes, okay, okay but you were not involved in that.    The Board was not involved?    Okay, I thought that all Group Executive appointments were made by the Board.    Oh.    Oh, okay, okay, so to the extent that he may have been appointed as permanently as Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations.    That appointment would not have been made by the Board.    It would have been made by the Group CEO.    Oh okay, alright.  It’s only at the level of Acting COO that the Board got involved with regard to him?    And informed the Minister, just for Acting.    But when it came to the permanent appointment his permanent appointment to that position you had left?    Yes okay.  Okay so – so  1. In terms of the board appointing him as an acting COO insofar as you did not consider other people you – your position was that for acting appointment as a practice to any of those positionsadvertisements were not made for acting appointments?    Even internally?    So the board would just have a look at people and identify a person that it thought was suitable and as long as that person was already employed at the same level.    Then is could appoint?    Yes.  Okay.  So – so the one for Group Executive was it at the same level as COO?    COO is higher?    Okay.  So – so – so where you seek an acting appointment for COO does this require – did this requirement that the person must be on the same level apply or did it not apply?  You indicated earlier on that when you are going to appoint somebody as an act – in an acting capacity.    Although you do not advertise.    But the person you appoint must be on the same level?   Must be at the Group level.    But Group level is not everybody on the same level?  There are different levels to the Group level.    So he was at Group level even though not at COO level?    And you were then entitled to – he was one of thepeople you were entitled to look at?    Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  And then of course you – you accept that for that position that position required qualifications that he did not have but you say that you took the view as the board that having regard to what had happened before and having regard to what – to his performance in the previous positions you thought that you should appoint him?    Yes and the difference I think you did say I am just refreshing my memory.  The difference between the level at Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations and COO was also significant?    Yes, yes.  And again coming back to his skills.  You said earlier on what he had was people’s skills or people skills,people’s skills which I have – I understand to be he was good with dealing with people, is that right?  Is there anything else?    Yes.  During your time?    But was there anything else that you thought he was he stood out – was outstanding about him in terms of the performance of the job other than being good with people?    Okay and of course as far as the permanent appointment is concerned you were not there so therefore you cannot say anything – you cannot answer for when he was appointed permanently?    You do not know who else was available and so on?    Yes.  Okay thank you.    Anything arising?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    No thank you very much Doctor Ngubane.  It may be that we might ask you to come back.   So I have no doubt you will come back if we ask you to come back.  But thank you very much for coming to give evidence and to share your knowledge of what happened at SABC with the commission.    Thank you very much.    Yes, yes he can have it – he can have it.  There should be no problem at all.  He will talk to the legal team.  There should be no problem.    Thank you very much you are excused.      Thank you.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Five minutes or ten?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh you say you – the next witness should take how long in terms of the evidence?    He is long.   Yes.    Well maybe we should then – but you say he is not available after four or you are…    The team is not available.    Oh you have a witness to…    Okay maybe we should adjourn now.    Then and not start four and then…    And then do it for ten minutes and then break.    And – and if we start tomorrow is how long do you think he might – the whole day or…    Maybe two and half hours.    I am trying to see whether there is a need to start early tomorrow or not. We do not need to start early if we will be fine.    We should be fine.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.  Alright we will adjourn for the day and then we will start at ten o’clock tomorrow.    We adjourn.

Chair the – I have just been advised that you are not really audible.  Doctor Ngubane could you just pull the microphone closer to you?    Thank you.   Thank you.    Yes, yes maybe you could just tell – yes.    The Chair from the beginning.    Yes.    Maybe it is your attorney – because the commission got it from [indistinct] statement.    He is shaking his head.    I just want to check whether Mr Mkhabela does have a copy of his CV.    No this is the one.  Doctor Ngubane the one that you say is not yours is that what appears at page 16?    From this one and he says this is not the one.    Okay.    Oh no, no, no that is – no that is not what you were supposed to be reading from.    This is the media bundle.  I said page 16.    Yes.    Yes, yes, yes.    It is Chair.    It is at page 16.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.    Yes thank you.    Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.    Thank you.  Is it also correct that the matters that you deal with here in your statement are matters that relate to the period when you were the Chairperson of the SABC board?    No, no I mean in your statement Doctor Nbugane.  In your statement you deal with matters that relate to your chairmanship of the SABC board?    Yes thank you.  When you were appointedto the Chairperson of the SABC board?    And you served until when?    Who appointed you to the board?    Yes.  And the – who was the responsible Minister for Communications at that time?    And who was the Minister of Finance?    Yes.  Then during your time then to the board of – as the Chairperson of the board of the SABC you deal with that and you say the first thing that you deal with you deal with the financial position of the SABC at the time when you were appointed as Chairperson of the board.    Yes.  Could you please just tell the Chairperson then as to what was the situation when you were appointed?    Yes.    Sorry Doctor Ngubane the one thing I forgot to mention to you was that please look at the Chairperson when you answer.    Sorry and – yes – sorry.    Thank you.    So how did you then do that?    The Bold and the Beautiful.    Yes.    And those are the conditions you got from the Minister of Finance?    No the conditions that you are mentioning.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh sorry yes.    Sorry let me – if you could just finish thatpart?    Are you finished?    Yes. Alright.  Thank you.  Can we just deal with the one aspect that you have already mentioned that there was a plan that then the board decided to deal with the senior management?      In cutting costs.   Could you just tell the Chairperson other than not renewing contracts that had come to an end.    What other measures related to those cost cutting measures insofar as the employment of those persons were concerned?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  I would like to just deal with the matter that relates to these measures insofar as one of the employees of the SABC’s concern.  I would like to hear your comments on it.  I seeyou make reference – there is a document that you have attached BSN 002 and it has his name.  It was prepared – it is a presentation to SCOPA and it has the name of Mr Tiaan Olivier.  And the Chief Financial Officer.  Do you – you knew Mr Olivier?    At the time when you were the Chairperson of the board?    Yes.    Financial Officer.    Yes.    Yes.      Yes.  But what I would like us to talk about.  Looking at the plan to make sure that contracts that have come to an end do not get renewed.  In that plan that the board had did youenvisage a situation where a person would still have 5 years to go in the contract but it would be terminated?    Yes.    Yes.  And you would not push the personto leave before that expiry of that period of two months?    Yes.    And what would you say because – I know you deal with the purging.  You say during your time there was never any purging of officials.  But I would like you to look at this scenario that I am going to put to you.  According to the evidence of Ms Thekiso who is the Chief Executive Officer dealing with Human Resources.  He has mentioned Mr Tiaan Olivier’s case and we had tendered that evidence before the Chairperson showing that he had to leave and still had five years to go in terms of his contract and had to be paid huge sums of monies in order to make it possible for him to leave.    Yes.  So that would - if - if one looks at it and says that was purging you would agree with that situation.  Am I correct?    Yes.        Yes and from what you have told the Chairperson if he was an excellent person even if he had to leave I am sure there would have had to be a person replacing him because that position of a Chief Financial Officer cannot be left vacant.  Would you agree?    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.   No, no.  No Chair.    No it was after.  After he left.    Yes.    When you - could you just confirm that Dr Ngubane?   When Mr Olivier left you - you had already left the SABC?    Yes, thank you.  Now - then as the Chairperson of the Board you have just told the Chairperson that you were asked to - to put up these austerity measures as the board to make sure that the SABC stops bleeding and you deal with those aspects in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11. You have already mentioned to the Chairperson how you dealt with international buy - buying of films.    Yes and you have dealt with the reduction of staff.  Now could you just …    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair and all those 10 cases would have been brought to the board for the board to approve the exit - exit agreements with those persons?    Yes.  Now - then in paragraph 11 you deal with the Sports and Film Rights.  I am not sure whether you had listened to the evidence that has been tendered where the GCEO and the - the Chairperson of the current Board had - had mentioned this issue of cost rights being quite costly for the SA - SABC. During your time as the Chairperson of the Board and as you deal with it in paragraph 11 what was happening insofar as Sports Rights are concerned?    Yes.    And the agreement then with the PSL that you say Mr Hlaudi reached with PSL - sorry.  Was that agreement in writing?    So there would have been a gentleman’s agreement to deal with that aspect?    Yes.    Formalised, yes.    Thank you.    Thank you.  In - insofar as the reduction of staff you - you alluded to the fact that the Minister of Communications then had indicated that he also wanted a head count strategy and - andthen you deal with that in paragraphs 12 and 13 but in paragraph 13 what I would like us to talk about is that the - the head count strategy had not been finalised but do I get a sense that even though it had not been finalised you started embarking on the decision to let go of those managers whose contracts were not going to be renewed?    Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  So then you - you say that was then some - one of the primary focus that you had to try and meet the 1 000 target that the Minister had set insofar in reduction of staff is concerned?    Huh-uh.   Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Chair; and - and then - so in other words the - the board would - would - was responsible in the sense that it would ensure that whoever left in terms of the plan thatyou had which you were carrying out left under proper and legitimate circumstances?    Yes.    Thank you.  Is - is that the - thank youChair - is that the figure that you deal with in paragraph 13 where you deal with the growth and staff numbers?  If you go back to your statement doctor - Dr Ngubane page 4 of your statement.    The figure that you have just mentioned to the Chairperson in response to his question.  Is that …?    Is that the one that you have mentioned?    In paragraph 13?   Yes and no, no, no I think you did not follow my question.  When you answered about the staff numbers and people being employed and you deal with that aspect in paragraph 13    “The grown and staff …”    Yes.    Alright, thank you.  Then in paragraph 15 you mention that whilst you were working on these plans trying to turnaround the SABC you had meetings with the Minister and you deal with the frequency of those meetings.  Could you just testify to what you have got in that paragraph and the …?    Could you just testify to what you saying about the Minister - having meetings with the Minister on the progress?  Sorry are you on the statement Dr Ngubane?    I am sorry.  Just to direct.  Page 4 on top.    And then paragraph 15 - 1.5.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Could you just testify to that paragraph because you make an important statement and I would like to ask why you make that statement that there was no political pressure applied to you and I would like you to talk to that?    Yes.  I just want to understand the relevance of that part in your statement.  That there was no political pressure applied on you.  I just want to know how - how did it come about that you felt that when you dealing with the meetings that you were having with the Minister …    To deal with the progress …    You felt that it was necessary for you to put in that sentence.   Yes.    Yes.    Alright.  Okay.  Thank you.  Then you say you managed to pay off the Government guarantee - you have already testified - in one and a half years.    Is that correct?  Alright.    Yes.    And you deal with your support and in    You - you also make in that sentence that   Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Chair and then you moved    Yes.  Were - were you just as the start of the New Age Newspaper were you involved at all?  Did you assist with the negotiations of the New Age deal and TNA Breakfast?   Yes.  Ms Mokhobo who was the GCEO had testified that when she was appointed to that position she was taken to be introduced to the Gupta family.  Did that happen to you?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Thank you Chair and you say you had also visited their home socially.  You did visit them socially?   Yes.  Who exactly invited you to these social gatherings?    Yes and I mean among the Gupta family members who exactly invited you to attend these social gatherings?  There would be a person who would be in charge of that particular event.   Oh.  You - you thinking about TNA.    Yes.    Yes Chair - ANN7.    About …    Mr Sundaram.    ANN7.  That is correct.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you; and then in the next paragraph you tell the Chairperson about the - the breakfast shows and what brought this about and how did this relationship between the SABC and the - the - and TNA develop insofar as these breakfast shows were concerned?     And were you in terms of that agreement expected to bill TIA for sending out your broadcast vans?     Yes how did that then assist with the ailing financial situation of the SABC?     Thank you, thank you Chair, so you say inparagraph 23 you found that these were value adding, these breakfast shows?     And weren’t you at some point at all, concerned that now the SABC had established this relationship with this particular company which was going to – according to theagreement to last for three years and did you at all,  get concerns that maybe it might be seen that you had – the SABC had preferred a particular company over others or that the relationship itself was so close that it might have a way of interfering  with what is expected within the editorial policy, that you shouldn’t  have – SABC shouldn’t have partners so as to keep it’s objectivity and independence?     Then, I’m not sure how familiar you were with the agreement, I’m sure it would have been brought to the Board because these shows were going to be twice a month, if I may just check, just make reference to it, it’s in the same bundle – yes it’s in the same bundle with your leave Chair can I just ask that the witness be assisted to page through to Ms Mokhobo’s statement that said – that is where the TNA agreement is.    I’ll give you now Chair, that’s from page– it’s folder, the divider 21 and the agreement starts from page 10.     Thank you Chair, if I may just – that is the agreement that was identified by Ms Mokhobo as having signed that agreement with TNA but I’d like to take you – yes if you could please turn to page 15 of that very document and I would like to direct your attention to [indistinct] paragraph 5.6.  It reads,“It is specifically recorded that the SABC shall broadcast twoevents per month and the SABC shall at all times have finaleditorial control”.     Yes were you also aware that this was the arrangement, this was the agreement that these breakfast shows would be two per month?     Alright so even when these numbers escalated you would have known as the Board?     Yes thank you, then you say in paragraph 26 because 24 and 25 you refer to one thing, that you never asked for a further bail outs from Treasury, can you just tell he Chairperson about that?     Oh you back, I beg your pardon, you go back to your statement now, yes thank you, paragraph 26 is at page 7.     26.     Yes and would you say then the finances at this point had improved?     Yes.    Thank you and then the [indistinct] aspect  you’ve already mentioned, we started with it, you remember this is where you told the Chairperson about the plan not to renew contracts that had come to an end, so that’s what you deal with there in paragraphs 28 to 31.     Then the next topic we are going to deal with Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng – Chair I see the time is now quarter past eleven.    Yes.    Thank you Chair; and then if you move on to paragraph 41 at page 11 …    (Intervenes).    Thank you Chair.  Then in - at page 11 Dr Ngubane …    Could you just testify to that?    Yes.  Could you just testify to it?  So that it is on record.  Yes.  Meaning just talking to what you say there …   In paragraph 41, yes.    Yes, thank you and - and you say that he was taking instructions directing from the board and as well as from the GCEO at that time?    Yes; and then at paragraph 43 you deal with the Auditor-General’s findings.  You did mention slightly as to what the Auditor-General had found.  That the SABC employees wereactually doing business …    With the SABC and then this was a matter that was before SCOPA.  Could you just briefly tell the Chairperson as to what - what were the difficulties that at that point you had with SCOPA because Parliament - Auditor-General says there is 1 400 employees that are doing business with the SABC and then what action did you as a board take in order to make sure that when Parliament asked you to account as the board you were able to deal with that?    Yes.    Thank you Chair; and then that report according to you what state at page - paragraph 44 page 11.  It would mean that if this report the - the one that the - that Mr Olivier had prepared as it appears at page 17.  It is dated 20 November 2012.  At page 17.   Yes.  That is correct?    So it - it would mean that the board had not - had not satisfied SCOPA’s requests for at least for a period of about two years.  Am I correct?    Yes.  Then you dealt with the fact that Mr Motsoeneng and the task team then they worked to - to produce the report that you - you find at page 17.  So that report deals with wide ranging matters.  Am I correct?    From staff matters to procurement issues.  For instance if I may just direct your attention to page - page 32    Yes.    Yes and then an aspect that you havealready testified to about employees doing business with the SABC that we will find at page 35 Chair and as item number six. “Numerous employees were found to have interests in companies that could not be supported by a signed declaration of interest forms.  No centralised register to check and monitor whether all employees have declared their interests.  For employees new and comprehensive declaration forms were created; extensive communications.” That deals with failure to declare their interests but mostimportantly is what we find at page 36 item seven.    What amount is that?    Yes and you say that period to - predates your appointment?    It - it predates, yes.    Okay.  Thank you.  So then this report then was compiled I take it with all the matters that you have - that itdeals with.  Then it was submitted to SCOPA.  What was SCOPA’s attitude after the submission of this report?    Yes and by the time you left the SABC had there been proper compliance with the Auditor-General’s queries?    Yes.  Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you and - and then we deal with the    And - and by so doing then they would have - was this at the time when he was already appointed as COO or the parity happened when he was still Acting as COO?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes it is not …    Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman and then   Yes.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  I will take the witnessthrough that documentation.    Unfortunately there was just some problems with the numbering.    So I probably do so …    Once I am finished with the parliamentary records.  Thank you.  (Clearing throat) sorry - excuse me.  Then you say according to you he had jumped about three steps in salarycategories having come from a provincial scale to Group Executive scale.    Yes.    (Intervenes).    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.      Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you and then you - Dr Ngubane then you deal with in paragraph 49 with an announcement that you made announcing that Mr Motsoeneng was going to be Acting COO as from 15 November 2011.     Yes thank you and that process happened in the manner in which the Deputy Chief Justice has explained to you without any advertisement nothing same applies to that position?      And then in paragraph 15 filling of the post of Chief Operating Officer so then Mr Hlaudi had been actin in that position and then there was an advert published on 15 February 2011.  Could you just – I know that parliament asked you a lot about this advert and I’ll take you in due course to those relevant transcripts of parliament where you were asked at length about the appointment and the advert that related to the – ultimately to the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng, do you recall that evidence that you gave before the adhoc committee of parliament?     No I’m talking about the advert, the advert that – there’s the issue…[intervenes].     Thank you Chair.  Do you recall Dr Ngubane what were the requirements on that advert for a person who would qualify for the position of COO?     The only challenge is that the pages, if you are going to be able to follow.     The pagination it’s affects my notes because now I’ve asked…[intervenes].     Thank you if you could just bear with me.     That’s correct.     Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman may I beg leave to hand up the reference bundle which is marked Exhibit CC32, I’ve already opened the place where the advert is…[intervenes].     Yes thank you and I’ve asked that the witness be given a copy.     Thank you. Dr Ngubane is that the advert that was issued in relation of the position of the COO?     Yes, could you just put on record what the requirements were for that position, or maybe we start with the key accountabilities because that becomes…[intervenes].    Yes thank you Mr Chair.     Thank you, so at the time when this advert was published or even crafted by the SABC, they were aware of what is it that they wanted and as the Chairperson has asked you, they knew of particular skills that they required but most importantly they were aware that they needed someone who would qualify professionally and have a degree and diploma or an equivalent of those?    So having looked then, I’m sure at this advert you would have said it’s not going to be possible for Hlaudi to meet these requirements…[intervenes].     Sorry Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng, sorry.  Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng to meet those requirements because he didn’t have a degree, he didn’t have a diploma and at the time I think he did not have a matric as well.     Yes, so you would not have expected the SABC then, to appoint him permanently in that position?     Thank you and maybe just dealing with that issue, maybe I could just deal with what – you also dealt with that issue before parliament and may I just find out – because there is a point where parliament asked in relation to an advert and Chair I had placed next to the witness another bundle if I may beg your leave to look at Exhibit CC29.     Yes that’s correct.  Thank you Chair, I’ve asked the registrar to place it – it’s also there, it is here Chair I placed it on his desk I beg your pardon.  No, no it’s the one marked parliamentary transcripts.     Thank you Chair, may I refer Chair to page 162 in red, it’s page 162 right hand corner in red.     Oh I beg your pardon, oh yes you’re quite right Chair, it’s divider number five.     Yes.     Yes and then if you could just turn to page 162.     162 or maybe before just to identify just to put it in context, is it correct that, Dr Ngubane I think you’ve already mentioned…[intervenes].      Alright, 162, it’s in red.     162 yes.     That is correct Chair.     Yes thank you, is it correct that youtestified before the committee on the 13 t h of January 2017, Dr Ngubane?     I’m reading – if you look at the very first page of that, after the divider immediately the page following the divider five, that page will be marked 141.    Yes thank you, you are asked a question there Dr Ngubane at page 162 along – Mr Wagener asked you,“No I’m not disputing that you do not have sight but I want toput it to you, I’m telling you that the reason why you did notcare about that report, you didn’t bother to read the report isbecause you didn’t care about the damage you caused theSABC, what is your response to that”?And then your response – I’m so sorry I apologise Chair because the part about the advert is actually on the next page but maybe this is worth dealing with because it is in any event something that we are going to deal with and then Dr Ngubane,“I did not cause damage at SABC, I saved the SABC, it wasbankrupt when we came, the regulations were not observed,even the financial statements of the public service broadcasterand public commercial broadcaster were not finalised, it was ina mess.  We sat around trying to stop the haemorrhaging ofmoney out of the SABC there was a huge theft going on the AGfound that, if you read the AG’s report, so don’t accuse mefalsely of destroying the SABC”.And then he referred you then to the Public Protector’s report and he says, it speaks specifically to yourself it says,“The former Chairperson [indistinct] acted irregularly when heordered that the qualification requirement for the appointmentto the position of COO would be altered to remove academicqualifications as previously advertised which was purely aimedat tailor making the advert to suit Mr Motsoeneng’s circumstances.This constitutes improper conduct,maladministration and abuse of unjustifiable exercise of power,that is what she is saying”.And then your response was,“Could you produce that advert because there was no suchadvert that I altered, please produce it for me”,Could you tell the Chairperson whether you first of all you were ever asked about this advert and whether you had altered an advert prior to you being confronted with the question by Mr Wagener?     Yes but when, for the first time, did you get to know that there were allegations that you had actually altered an advert to suit Mr Motsoeneng’s qualifications?     Chair I’m going to have to – so that you don’t lose this point that we’re making about the advert and just direct the witness to what the Public Protector, in her report, says, with your leave may I just put it to the witness?     Dr Ngubane there is another bundle there maybe without looking at it we can…[intervenes].     No Chair it’s just because the advert issued then, becomes more prominent in the other bundle.     The other bundle yes which the findings of the Public Protector.     Thank you, that would be also Exhibit 27 Chair at page 290. You may close that one Dr Ngubane and open the one next to you, that one, sorry about that.     Folder number 10.     This is the Public Protector’s reportentitled when governance and ethics fail.      Divider number 10.     Could you turn to page 290?     290.     290.     Thank you Mr Chairman, this is the Public Protector’s report and this is what she says, “First of all maybe you should start with appointment as GroupExecutive stakeholder relations and regions of the SABC.6.1.2.1, Mr Motsoeneng was appointed as Executivestakeholder relations and regions SABC scale 115 and a totalpackage CTC of R1 461 539.  This fixed term contract was fora period of five years commencing on 1 April 2011 and wassigned by both Mr Nicholson and Mr Motsoeneng on 1 April11.  Mr Nicholson again, inexplicably omitted to insert theyear on the date while the handwriting is similar on thecontract where both signatures were appended, again,although this raises questions of authenticity the matter wasnot pursued during the investigation. 6.1.3 appointment asacting COO SABC, advertisement of COO’s position. 6.1.3.1according to a copy of the advertisement received fromSpencer Stuart the SABC’s recruitment agency, the agencyplaced an advertisement on behalf of the SABC in the Sunday Times and City Press on 9 July 2006 for the filling of thevacant position of COO which became vacant in 2005/2006. The advertisement indicated under the heading, qualificationsthat the applicant should have and appropriate academicbackground preferably post graduate qualification.  In 2008 aninternal advertisement was once again placed for theappointment of COO, the requirement for appropriate academicrequirement, preferable post graduate qualification as per theadvertisement in 2006 was removed and replaced by thefollowing. Commercially astute Executive with broad rangingoperational track record of success in broadcasting. 6.1.3.3,the same internal advertisement is mentioned in the paragraphabove was circulated on Thursday 28 January 2012 with theclosing date being 31 January 2012.  6.1.3.4, in reply to myquestions, Miss Mokhobo, on 12 June 2012 stated that theSABC committed an act of fraudery and uttering in changingthe advertisement for the position of the COO issued in April08 by removing the requirement for academic qualificationsso as to suit Mr Motsoeneng who is without qualification tomeet the criteria of the advertised position.  The advertisementwas an exact replica of previous advertisements dating as farback as 2006.  During my meeting with Miss Mokhobo on 11March 2013, Miss Mokhobo indicated that the Chairperson ofthe Board indicated to her that she was not allowed to changethe requirements of the advertisement and that it had to go exactly as the one in 2008.  Miss Mokhobo indicated that theChairperson was adamant that he did not want to see anyqualifications reflected in the advertisement.  This sentimentwas echoed by Advocate [indistinct] Maglate, former memberof the SABC Board. 6.1.3.6, this was disputed by Dr Ngubanewho indicated to me on 15 March 2013 that the advertisementhad not come before the Board for approval and it wassomething that was done by management”.I think then – I had to read that because the Chairperson had asked you about whether the Public Protector had asked you about thisissue of an advert.     Chair it’s now five past one.    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Could you go back Chair to the Exhibit 29?  The parliament transcript.  Doctor Ngubane may I just refer you to page 165 of that exhibit.  The   I am sorry – I am so sorry Doctor.  Doctor Ngubane this is what the Public Protector stated it is read – it was read out to you by Mr Wanaage [?] what is your response to that?    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So in other words what is stated then in that paragraph that I had read Doctor Ngubane that would correct at page 165?    Those figures are then correct?   Yes thank you.  Then the Public Protector raises another issue in her report about your response to the application form.    To another aspect yes Chair.    Oh alright okay.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  Doctor Ngubane the Public Protector raised another issue.    At page 299.   Of Exhibit 27    299 yes.        I think this would relate to the question that the Chairperson had asked you about.  At what point did you realise that Mr Motsoeneng did not hold a matric certificate.    You recall that question that theChairperson asked you?    Thank you.  So if you could go Doctor Ngubane to paragraph 6.1.3.36.    Page 299.    Yes are you…    Are you on the Public Protector’s Report Chair?    On top.   Yes.    Yes.  Sorry.  It is Exhibit 27.  On top it will say – it will have Report of the Public Protector.  Do you have it Doctor?    Oh.    Yes.    No.    Oh no you are on the transcript.  I beg your pardon.  No I would like you to go to the Public Protectors Report.    On the transcript.  Ja it will not be in that file Doctor Ngubane.    Thank you Chair.  At paragraph 6.1.3.36    Yes.    (Intervenes).    Hm.    Not - not on this batch - on - on this file Mr Chairman, but - but I - I could just refer you to where the Public Protector quotes what is stated in that application form.  That would be at page 302.  Sorry Chair.  Yes, two …    3-0-2 at paragraph 6.1.3.48.    “According to the panel whenMr Lesala wrote this on 27 June 2017 he was fully aware as he had been told by Mr Lopaka (?) in writing just five days earlier that the application for employment form did indeed exit and that it had been removed in 2003 because it gave the impression that Mr Motsoeneng passed Standard .  What makes Mr Lesala’s denial even more puzzling is that he even refer to having received Mr Lopaka inquiry.” But there is - the Public Protector actually records the symbols.  If I may just take you to that page Chair.  Can you just get that page?  Sorry.  They record the symbols as reflected on that form.  Sorry.  I will - just ahead just now.  If you will just bear with me Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you for that but the one I am looking for …    Is at page 296.    Two - 2-9-6 Chair.    2-9-6.   Thank you.    Two - 2-9-6 Dr Ngubane.  I beg your pardon.    296.    2-9-6.  The same - same bundle.  Have you found it - 2-9-6?     Have you found it Dr Ngubane?    You found it?    Oh, thank you.  Yes.  It is - it is paragraph    Chair.    2-9-6 Chair.    Yes, yes Chair.    2-9 - sorry.  Thank you.  Then 6.1.3.21   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  If for example Mr Motsoeneng as he has admitted to the Public Protector had actually put in symbols - let us say everybody knew that he did not have Matric.    So if he did not have Matric all that he needed to do on his application form was to say my qualifications Standard 8 but then when he - if he goes beyond and puts - and puts in symbols and subjects on an application form would you regard that as misrepresentation or would you feel that because he does not have theMatric it really does not matter that he had put in those symbols?    Yes.    Sorry.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.  No I - I understand that Dr Ngubane but my question is if he did not have Matric he would have said I do not have Matric when he is applying for the - for the position but if knowing that he does not have Matric but he puts up symbols and subjects would you regard that as misrepresentation?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So in other words as far as you are concerned then or now it really did not matter that he had put in those symbols on …    On the application form.   Yes.    Yes.    When you say the issue did not arise do you mean it did arise before the Public Protector or that issue did not arise at all at the SABC prior to his appointment?   Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just to deal with that point that Dr Ngubane has made in response to your question Chair.  May I ask the witness to turn to SABC EXHIBIT CC32?  That is …    No, it is - it is another bundle, yes.  You can close that one Dr Ngubane.    Thank you.    This is - I beg your pardon Chair.  Oh, I am told that this is your bundle.  I am sorry.  Could you just find whether there is a CC32 there?  Maybe …    Report.  No Chair CC …    Hm.    It is - it is written SABC Reference Bundle Chair.  It is the - the referenced bundle.   Yes Chair.  32 - I think it is underneath that one.  Oh, yes.  That one.    Thank you Chair.    Could you please turn to page 2-1-8 the red - there are two numbers there Chair?  Please ignore the one in ink and have a look at the one in red - 2-1-8.  Thank you.  This is a letterconfirming that Mr Hlaudi holds the title of Acting Chief Operations Officer and it is from Mr Thabiso Lesala dated 28 November 2011 but before that there is a page - page 2-1-9 precedes 2-1-8 but it follows in terms of the bundle.  The one dated 18 November 2011 is that your signature Dr Ngubane?    Yes 2-1-9.    It is a sub delegation of authority.    In 2-1-9?    In red.    No, no, no.  In red.  2-1-9 in red is a (indistinct).    Not the black one.    Yes.    Thank you.    So that - that is sub delegation of authority.  You - you were delegating that authority - am I right to Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng?    Is that correct?    Thank you and then if you turnover to page 220.  You will find a letter written 15 November 2011 to Minister Dina Pule where you were advising her of the resolution of the    Is that correct?  Then the next page at page 221 is this the letter that you are referring to when you were answering the Chairperson?  It - it is written to you from the Ministry    Is this the - the approval that you were referring to?    Yes.    Oh yes because the heading does say   “…Officer.”    But you are quite correct then in - in the body of the letter …   She makes reference to Chief Operations Officer.    Acting Chief.    Yes.   Yes Chair.  Thank you.  So - so that was the letter that you referred to.  Then before we move from that bundle I would like to just deal with some of the minutes - the board minutes that (intervenes).    They are in there yes.  Thank you.  I will - I will just like to take you to some of the minutes.    Yes.     Thank you Chair.  I just want us to deal with the role that Mr Hlaudi was playing in one of the Board meetings, just to link up with your evidence earlier and I would like to direct your attention please to page 39 of that same exhibit, CC32, that same bundle that is in front of you.     Page 39.     Yes.     The same bundle Chair yes thank you.     Three nine, yes that’s correct Chair. Sorry Chair.     Sorry Chair, that – those are the minutesof a special meeting, a Board meeting that was held on the 7 t h of February 2012 an that you were chairing Dr Ngubane, is that correct, according to that document?     Yes, and we Mr Motsoeneng was one of the persons that were in attendance, but I would just like to just raise something which is mentioned at page 11, I beg your pardon, at page 49, 49, I was looking at the document itself, page 49.     Page 49, same document but on page 49.     Yes, then Mr – this is Acting COO and I     Then the context, it becomes context correct Chair.  Could you start from the second paragraph, the first one actually because I think it’s the same person. “She said that there was a need for an innovative solution taking into consideration her rights.  Advocate Mhlase  informed the Board that the maximum payable under the CCMA’s twelve months.  She was of the view that it was easierto pursue that route and the proposal by Mr Mutsepe other than make a payment of R4million plus which was excessive.  Acting COO agreed with Advocate Mahlase but stated that keeping the employee would need to be budgeted for and that in turn around the interest of the company was paramount and the employees to be productive.  He stated that there was a need for radical and unpopular decisions to take the corporation forward.  He requested the Board to assist in placing Ms Mampane in government.” If one reads there without reading the full minute but the suggestion was that Ms Mampane could be placed on early retirement or transferred or redeployed to another government institution.  But what I wanted to raise with you Dr Ngubane I know that you had said Mr Hlaudi could participate but didn’t have voting rights, but would you say that he was doing more than just being of help, he isnow making suggestions about people being placed in government.     Yes.     He was entitled ...(intervention)      Yes.     Okay thank you, then my question then falls away, because I was under the impression that we are moving under the same part, but then these minutes as you will see Dr Ngubane that have been placed here they are the minutes of the Board, but they deal with various issues, and I would not take you through them, save that I would like you to comment on one aspect which youdeal with in your statement, the issue of encryption.     And just advise the Chair what was the attitude of the Board insofar as that encryption issue was concerned.     Yes, and if you – to go back to your statement now, if you could just close the file in front of you and we goback to EXHIBIT 24, we left off in the morning where at page 13 ...(intervention)      Yes, where you have your statement document on.     Page 13.     Sorry you will have to go back to divider number 22, if that is the ...(intervention)     Oh, oh.     Page 13, thank you.  You dealt there, you are dealing there MultiChoice agreement on 24 hour channel, could you just summarise your evidence in those paragraphs and what is it that you wanted to convey to the Chairperson there?     Yes, thank you.  Dr Ngubane just to – you would have noticed that the bundle the reference bundle contained several media clippings.     Yes that relates to you and I am sure you have read the criticism about Mr Motsoeneng’s acting position, just to conclude that point, you are aware of the media clippings at the time?     Yes. So I don’t – you don’t, or unless youwish me to take you through all or to some of them but generally the criticism generally is about the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng largely.     Thank you, and then lastly – or not lastly, sorry before we get to your general comments.     Thank you Chairman.  I am just going to read to you Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng has submitted a statement to the Commission, but I would like to read a paragraph that relates to you and ask for your comment, because when, by the time it comes to testify you will probably not be here, but it is paragraph – he says at     Yes, and who would have given – if there was a mandate who would have given a mandate to you, do you know?     Yes.     Thank you.  And then in paragraph, if you go back to your statement now, in paragraph 62 of your statement you make general comments, could you just make those comments, tell the Chairperson what you are saying in that paragraph?     That is 62, at page 14 of your statement.     Yes.     Yes thank you.  And then lastly Dr Ngubane at the time when you were the Chairperson of the SABC Board did you have any business interests, or companies that did business with the SABC and if so which companies and at what level?     And none of your family members did any business with SABC?     Yes, thank you very much Chair, that is the evidence.    It was for COO position.    Thank you Mr Chairman.    That is all Chair.      Appears at page 217.    Of Exhibit CC32.    Thank you Chair.    Yes thank you.    Thank you Chair may I have just a five minute adjournment just for change.  We are having another witness and also he has slides.    And some things to demonstrate.    Such as – yes.    No ten will also be good Chair.  The onlychallenge I have Chair today is that we – I was – I am not going to ask Chair to proceed beyond four o’clock.    The reason being that there is a witness that we have to meet with now we said he must come at four o’clock.    That is the challenge I have Chair.    But we are in your hands Chair.  If you feel that maybe we should adjourn for the day because it is already twenty to four and resume tomorrow morning.    He is long Chair.     Yes.    I am – the team is not available Chair.    We have a witness that we have arrangedto meet.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    And then leave it.    Yes Chair thank you.    No, no Chair he will not take the whole day.  Maybe two and half hours.    Yes.  Yes.   I think we will be fine Chair.    Yes because I have only – there was only witness for tomorrow.    And then if we start with him.    Because he has been here today.   Then we should finish both witnesses yes thank you.    Thank you Chair.

DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Baldwin Sipho Ngubane.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    It is correct.    15?    Oh okay.    Oh.    Yes.  Which part of the statement?    Okay.    That is not part of my statement.    Okay.  I have got it.    Yes, yes.    That is correct.    That is right.    Sorry?    Yes it is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Okay.    63.   Okay.    Should I read this out?    Okay.   “Baldwin Sipho [Ben] Doctor Ngubane started his career as a leader in the IFP where after I cross over to the ANC – where after I crossed over to the ANC.  He has served in the following positions. 1994 he was appointed Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in the Government of National Unity. In 1997 he was appointed as a Premier of KwaZuluNatal. In 1999 he was reappointed Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and technology. In 2004 he was appointed as an Ambassador to Japan.”    Okay.    Yes.    But this is not the CV I supplied.  Someone has written this CV.    You know they putting their own assumptions.   Well I would prefer that we go to my …   My original CV.    No, no, no.  This is not what I supplied.    No I cannot find the one I supplied unfortunately.   Okay.    That is correct.    This is the one – yes Chairperson.    That is right Chairperson.    Thank you.    Well… “Date of birth 1941 October 22.    Well I presume …    I presume any professional training whether it is law or medicine qualifies you to be Chairman of a board.    No this is just my CV.    Yes absolutely.  Absolutely.    January 2010.    March 2013.    Parliament through the President.    It was retired General Honourable Siphiwe Nyanda.   Honourable Pravin Gordhan.    Yes probably one can expand a bit on that.    Yes.  But I need to start a little back.    The SABC seized to be profitable orto make a profit in 2006.  From 2007, 2008, 2009 they were making huge losses.  For instance in the 2008/2009 annual report and audited statements they made a loss of more than R800 million.  They could not flight new content for television.  They could not pay the independent producers for television content.  In fact the independent producers lost about 17 000 jobs during that time.    Oh.   Okay.  I will do that.     I will do that indeed.    Oh.    Yes.    Ja.  The situation became so critical that the interim board chaired by Ms Irene Charnley had to ask for a government guarantee of about R1.64 billion in order to meet the solvency requirements of the SABC.  This was granted and we then – when we came in in 2010 we then had this money R1 billion – R1 billionterm load from Nedbank to settle the huge debts that were outstanding.  So we came in into an organisation that was technically insolvent.  In our first year 2009/2010 we had reduced the deficit of more than 800 to R465 million.  We had improved the content in our television by paying the independent producers of content material by making the programs more attractive, raising our audience ratings so we could again go back to charge the relevant and properly priced amounts for television advertisements.  A broadcaster makes money through advertisements.  However when the audience ratings are low no-one wants to pay money when they cannot reach a sufficient number of viewers.  So it was veryimportant to go back to produce content that was appealing to the public and therefore would attract investment revenue.    We did that by restricting content to only those movies or news item that would attract and retain viewers.  So we started to correct the financial situation.  We progressively did so to a point where in 2013 we paid R800 million back to Nedbank.  In other words saving about R45 million in interest which was being charged at the time.  And this was in line with the requirements of the conditions set up in the government guarantee.  So we found a dysfunctional organisation. The cause of the loss of profitability was widespread malpractice at the management level.  For instance sales would be made for advertising time but the people who managed putting that into content and television viewing did not follow the schedules.  So the advertisers refused to pay. Secondly there was widespreadcorruption in the buying and procurement of international film material.  People would go out to Hollywood, buy a bulk of material which was part of the bulk associated with crime content.  Let me just give an example.  If we bought the…    Ja the Bold and Beautiful thank you.    They would say here are other films you must buy them as a bundle.  You get the good one but you get a whole lot of useless ones.  There was an expression you buy the dogwith its ticks – with his fleas.  That was – became a popular expression.  Now the problem these fleas you could not flight them because no-one want to see them.  For instance if one took old cowboy films like Roy Rodgers or something no-one would be interested in viewing that.  So these products or films would stay at SABC unused until the licence expired.  However money had been paid of them.  No income from advertisements which are associated with the film material would be coming in so it was written off as impairment.  There were other ways in which management over-rode the credit controls in the sales division.  Ultimately almost all of them were expelled or charged.  So I am trying to show you that the SABC we came to was under serious financial stress but we also had the conditions of the government guarantee which were very onerous.  We had to produce a turnaround strategy and plan.  We had to reduce head count by almost 00 people.  We had to put in what should I say – measures thatreduced costs right across the board.    Yes.    The money?    Oh yes.      Ja that was to reduce costs acrossthe board.    Reduce headcount.  Reduce the benefits that were going to senior management and middle management.  And these costs us about R200 million just the issue of retention, bonuses, the issue of post-retirement benefits were hugely expensive but they applied to the senior and middle management.  When we said to the Minister that it was difficult to retrench people he pointed out that the cost element is in senior and middle management.  So deal with those.  Forget about unionised labour because they are not as expensive and that is when the policy of not renewing contracts that were ending.  The senior management and some middle management had five year contracts.  So the decision by the board was we will not renew contracts that are coming to an end.  So this way we managed to re-shape the finances of the SABC.  When I left in 2013 itwas on an even keel and there was money on top of whatever we had paid to the term loan.      The disclaimers that had been there in 2009 we had dealt with them.  The Auditor General had found lack of governance at SABC. We dealt with this in the report to SCOPA where SCOPA wanted to know – SCOPA the Standing Committee On Public Accounts – wanted to know what we were doing to implement action to correct – corrective action in response to the findings of the Auditor General.  We presented to SCOPA our plans, they were satisfied.  Sowe had started to shift the situation to a profitable SABC, the return of advertisers.   You know advertising time on TV costs a lot because that is the best form of advertising – of advertising.  It reaches a huge number of people across the country.  All categories.  For instance if you advertise on say for an example Metro FM the lowest cost for half a minute is R540.00 for half a minute.  But it can go on up to R1200.00 depending on the quality of your audience ratings.      Which make you very costly to the advertised.    So     Okay.    Okay, no, no that is fine.    I think I have said …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well we wanted to change from defined benefits to defined contributions because if a person leaves SABC retires and he is on defined benefits it means he will get that money throughout his life post retirement.  But if it is defined contribution then it goes along with a time span he spent at SABC.  So we were trying to change those practices.    But we were also merging some ofthe positions and consolidating them.  For instance there used to be Human Resources then there used to be a Chief People’s Officer.  The board looked at this, had a bit of research on it and discovered that it was actually two people doing the same job.  So that was merged.    And there were managers who were reporting to other managers at the same level in the organisation.  We eliminated that surplus expenditure.  And of course there was austerity in terms of travelling.  We decided to close the international news bureaus that were opened in London, New York etcetera where we paidpeople in terms of foreign currency.  You know Euros and Dollars that was eliminated.    We forced news section for instance to cut its budget of R900 million to R600 as part of the austerity measures.    The allowances on petrol cards were changed because petrol cards were absolutely abused.  People would go there, change their car engines, change their tyres, using petrol cards.  We eliminated that.  So there were a number of measures that fitted the austerity requirement that was in the government guarantee.    Yes.    Yes when Mr Robin Nicholson.    Became acting CEO Tiaan Olivierbecame acting Financial…    Officer.    He was excellent.  In fact he was one of the members of the task team that the board asked Mr Motsoeneng to set up to deal with the findings of the Auditor General.  They worked through December into the following year and produced a report that became acceptable to the SCOPA.    He was a very good worker.  I left the – at SABC so I do not know what happened afterwards.    No, no.  That was not the policy.  It was not the decision.  It was contracts that were coming to a close.    We would talk to the person who occupied the position, assess the performance in that position and explain to them that because of the policy your term is ending in two months or three months we will not renew it.    It might have happened once or so but that was not the policy as far as I remember.    Ja.    Well I think that was wrong becausethat was not what we had decided.    Well it - I did not participate in that.    So there might have been other reasons.  I do not know but …    As far as I am concerned if there were no other compelling reasons that was wrong because this should amount to fruit - fruitless and wasteful expenditure.    Oh no.  In terms of the Chief Financial Officer certainly …    But in terms of other positions as I said we - we tried to match positions in order to save money.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Probably - probably 10.    Yes.    Absolutely.    Yes.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Yes.    And the performance Chairperson.    Yes.   Absolutely.    SABC had lost its Sports Rights when we came.  They had even lost the PSL Sports Rights.  What wasbeing shown of - on - of rugby and PSL games was being bought from SuperSport and of course it was very costly.  Hlaudi went to see Mr Irvin Khoza to say please the way PSL was handled by the people before us was wrong. Can you please now start negotiating with us and give us back the Sports Rights.  So SABC resumed broadcasting PSL games through that process but otherwise it did not have Sports Rights.        The Sports Rights that we had for the Africa Cup of Nations was hugely expensive.  In fact we stopped that process.  Our lawyers went to Paris where SportsFive was headquartered.  They were going to charge us a penalty more than probably R2 million but our lawyers argued the case. It was even in court in Paris and we ended up paying about R27 million penalty for cancelling the Africa Cup of Nations sports but we subsequently got the right to record and broadcast Bafana games and that went on and I think it is still going on.    Well that was a board - a board matter - a board decision that we try and re - regain the PSL Sports Rights because it is one of the most popular shows on SABC 1.   No, no.  It was formalised.    I do not have the records but I know it was formalised.    Yes there should be.    You know I do not have it …    Chairperson.  Well from what - from the discussions with Mr Khoza the officials at SABC were absolutely rude towards them.  So any relationship broke down.    That is correct.  That is correct because I should - I should say that is the highest cost came from the retention bonuses from - and from the benefits for senior management and middle management.    Absolutely Chairperson.  It is paid I think on a three yearly basis.    On top of the normal bonuses …    But the - the cost becomes very high.  Well it should be based on performance …    But in practice everyone in a senior position (intervenes) getting that.   That will be separate because the annual bonus …    Based on performance …    Depended on them achieving about 60 percent …   Ja, of the target.    So that would be yearly.    The - this one was to - just to retain talent …    But in an organisation of course that is bloated …    With figures.    I mean with - with people.  You know.  The usefulness was not very clear.   That is correct Chairperson.  Itbecame a sort of established practice that certain people got retention bonuses.    Yes.    No I cannot remember the actual details …    But …    It was there.   Chairperson it was a feeble effort to meet the reduction in head count.    It did not go far at all but it was something that we had to do to try and meet the - the conditions.    Yes.  Well through natural attrition Chairperson, yes.    Ja.    Well …    No, no.  We - we just did not even come near …   To reaching the target.    Yes.    Well through natural attrition where we did not employ people …    In the positions that were being vacated I would say yes Chairperson but …    Some of the - of the people leftbecause of the findings …    Of the Auditor-General.    A lot of people - I mean the Auditor-General had found that 1 465 people …    Were actually doing business with the SABC.    Most of those people left.    Ja.    No, not exactly.    Probably 300 or so.    Yes.    That is correct Chairperson.    Well precisely Chairperson.    When managers’ report to managers and they are at the same level that is fruitless expenditure.    Well from 2007 the head count had just shot through the roof.  People were being employed you know and the - I think I read somewhere that the wage bill because of these new people being employed exceeded something like 300 million.    That is correct Chairperson.    Sorry.  Which figure is that?    Oh, ja.    Yes.    That is correct.  Oh, no.  I said 480 million here.  Yes.    Well …    I am - I am recalling it.    Yes.    Sorry.    Where to …    200.   Yes.    Yes, 15 yes.    Ja.    Well I was lucky in a way because I had been in Government before and I knew most - knew most of the players in Government.  So it was easy to discuss on a sort of level playing ground.  So I cannot say the Minister when we have discussed the issue then forced me to do something.   Yes.    Yes.    Well …    Because I mention that the Minister had said let us look at senior and middle management.    Some people could interpret that as political pressure.  I was just trying to clarify that.    Yes.    The …    Five years Chairperson.    Ja.    Yes.    Again because you know there was a lot of talk about outside influences on SABC decision making.  So I am just bringing that in to say it was market forces that guided our decisions not because someone put pressure for a decision.    Because the people who buy airtimethere are organisations that buy airtime for different companies.  Say Lever Brothers, Kellogg’s you know and many other consumer materials whether it is house cleaning, liquid.  They give it to a centralised buyer but the buyer is only interested in audience ratings because they want to have value for the money they are spending paying for the advert. So that is the pressure that any broadcaster faces.  That you must push up the audience ratings in order to get advertising revenue.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.  Particularly in an organisation where income - 85 percent of income comes from advertising.  It becomes a great pressure to raise your audience ratings.  Well there was this business partnership for morning breakfasts.  I attended those breakfasts.  Not all of them but quite a lot of them and I would sit with the people in the New Age editors, members of the Gupta family and on a few occasions I went to social events at their home and that is really the exposure I had to that family.    No.  This was an initiative through our news desk - our news editorial board and the officials of the news.  We only got involved where I had to go and probably make a speech at a - to introduce the Minister at a breakfast meeting and that sort of thing but we were not involved as a board in the actual negotiations.    No because I did not have any power in terms of appointing companies or people who supply services at SABC.  As Chairperson I did not have that power.  So I presume I was irrelevant as far as that was concerned.    Hm.    No Chairperson.  They did not need to actually because the news people dealt with them on those business issues you know.   No.    No.  That did not happen Chair.    No.    That is right.    Well invitations used to come through my PA.  So I would get a list of invites and I say okay you can take this one, not take this one and so on.    Well Nazeem Howa was in charge of TNA and I think it was him who did the invites.    Well the editor of New Age we - we got to be friends …    But not the rest of family.    No.    Moegsien Williams.    Yes.    That is the New Age.    That is right.    That is right.    That is correct.  Well the - our news people developed that relationship that there would be these breakfast shows. We would record them and broadcast them live.  There was even an agreement that was signed by members of the newsroom with the New Age/TNA which spelt out the modalities on how these shows will be arranged. The New Age would hire the hall, provide the breakfast, pay for flat screens, pay for projectors, pay for roving mics.  The SABC would send out its outside broadcast vans with the technicians and the presenters and that is how the roles were divided.     No, no, no, I mean our news section was always looking for new ways of attacking audiences of building up the audience ratings by new offerings so their approach to these breakfast was a new offering on the Morning Live slot.  Now Morning Live was a very popular, and I think still a very popular channelbecause people wake up, it’s like morning coffee, I say to myself, they wake up to Morning Live.  Morning Live deals with politics, with science and technology, with prominent personalities, with sport, with weather reports, with market related material.  So it sort of prepares people in the morning as to what the agenda for the day is going to be.  So it’s got that value in it, it’s the first kick-off as it were to the broadcast of the day so putting the breakfast in there was an addition in terms of the political side of Morning Live where Ministers are put before people, audiences, the audiences can question the Minister or the President on anything and the people outside can join in through telephonictelephones, social media and so on SMS’s to ask the Ministers, to hold the Ministers accountable.  So this was seen as an innovation that could only benefit the audience ratings of the news section, particularly morning live, so that’s how we perceived it as a content creating new content to the pubic and new opportunities.     Well as I said Chairperson let me take the cheapest which is a Metro FM R540 per half a second repeated many times between say seven and nine, that’s a lot of money.  So if Morning Live pushed up it’s audience ratings they could charge even R1000 per half a second.      You’re absolutely right Chairperson it depends on the time of day, it depends on the day in the week, forinstance weekends Sunday and Saturday the prices are quite low but during the week, peak hour, morning, evening, sports you know all those get good pricing for airtime.     Well weekends people go to church Chairperson.     And of course weekends is sports, sports is the winning number for weekends.     Yes Chairperson because our sales kept on improving so these programmes were therefore adding value because we could make money and we improved year by year in terms of improving the finances of the SABC.  So the value add there was that we could sell our airtime at higher prices and get better revenue.     Well you know, Chairperson, in broadcasting it’s probably different, you know if the SABC was creating a programme of it’s own running it, probably then it would need to go the – follow the supply chain requirement, advertising, calling for interviews but when someone comes with a programme and says, we think this can make you money then there’s no process of advertising that and this is what happened with the SABC New Age partnership.  The people in news thought this was a novel idea, it would work for us and then they signed an agreement on it.  So it wasn’t really preferring– if you say Business Day or Independent Newspapers came with such a proposal and it was appealing to people in news, I’m sure they’ll take it.  So it wasn’t really a case of preferring group of people.     Oh ja.     Yes.    No this was a management issue, so the Board didn’t really get involved in the terms, we were told, of course of how the expenditure is going to be but we were not participants.     As long as they didn’t exceed thedelegated authority of the people in news, as long as they were acting within that delegated authority, it was their matter.     Sorry can you just repeat the page again?     So paragraph 23 is it?     We never asked Treasury for bail out yes we didn’t.     Well yes the SABC was self sustaining.     That was the position, it was actually – we were improving all the time.     Right.    Okay thank you.    Well Hlaudi came from Bloemfontein to the SABC transferred there by the CEO SABC Mr Mokwetle.  All regional radio stations were losing money but the Bloemfontein station through Lesedi news was making a profit and Hlaudi was in charge of news if I remember correctly at Lesedi.  So the CEO Mokwetle said he wants to bring this young man into SABC – Hlaudi was employed at SABC 1995.    Yes.    And somehow we had got to know theSABC very well.  So we said we will bring him here so that he can use him to deal with the other problematic regional radio stations.  So I agreed with him.  I thought it was a good idea.  Because we had to fix this problem.  Our austerity measures were such that all these institutions had to be self-sustaining and self-funding.  So Hlaudi came into the CEO’s office as stakeholder relations regarding the regions.    That is right.    That is right.  And he started working on the regional stations.  He even took me to some others which were problematic like Mpumalanga and others. I cannot remember them in their order where we – I was giving pep talk to staff.  I mean he had prepared them of course of these reasons.  And we started getting people cooperating.  They used to complain that head office does not care for them even if they want to buy tea and milk and sugar they must apply to head office.  They are not given the authority.  So we sort of managed to polish through those issues.  And the morale was high and the stations started doing very well.  So when the people responsible for turnaround in the CEO’s office left because of money disputes – pay disputes the CEO appointed him on the turnaround position in the CEO’s office.  And of course from there then things started happening because Hlaudi was seen as a trouble-shooter.    Mr Motsoeneng oh sorry.    Sorry Chairperson.  Was seen as a trouble-shooter.  And he was very pro-active.  I mean with the labour unions you know with all issues that came up he would there hands on and so when ultimately he got to be elevated to Group to EXCO let us put it that way.    And that is when really he came to prominence.     COO and of course the senior managers.    Yes.    Well the board then decided – because you know when we came SABC management and labour unions were at real loggerheads mainly around salaries.  There was so much differential in salaries and so on.  So the unions were a problem for us particularly trying to deal with the turnaround and head count reduction and so on.  So Hlaudi was assigned to the board’s communicationperson.  He would deal with – and stakeholder manager on behalf of the board not just the GCEO.  And that is how he got to ultimately become an acting CEO.  Because now a lot of assignments were being given him to deal with.    Well the CEO.    Appointed him in his office but we needing active service in terms of communication in terms of dealingwith issues like the Auditor General’s findings and many other aspects that were very thorny at the time he was then appointed acting COO.    Well the skill was people’s skill.  You know Mr Alwyn who appointed him in 1995 said that initially he had been a stringer for sports.  But the way he wrote sports reports were very attractive to the listeners and so he brought him into other aspects of SABC like news because he had this ability to create a story.  So I would say in short the skills he had were people skills and that is what we needed at that time.     Yes.    Yes.    There was in the SABC however there was none for the board.   Yes.     But because of the pressure we were under to convince the unions to do all the types things of turnaround which impacted on people we felt that he would be able to handle that.    He combined it all Chairperson.    Yes.    Well…    For the CEO?    Well I presume the CEO had dismissed whoever had been there because he brought him from the Free State.    No.   Ja we did not discuss that Chairperson but I assume.    That should have been the situation.    Absolutely Chairperson.    And the management.    So there was a lot of communications that the board wanted to get across to general staff, labour unions andso on.    That is correct Chairperson.    Well there was an acting COO not – well probably I need to explain this a bit.    There had been an advertisement for the position of COO.    Mr Mbebe passed the interview was recommended to the Minister but the Minister did not take forward that recommendation to cabinet.  So he was not appointed to that position.      Ms Casaburri.  Ms Casaburri.    Or Doctor Casaburri.   So Mr Mbebe went to court to want to force the Minister to recognise his appointment.  Well that did not happen.  The court decided no-one could fill that position until the Minister and cabinet had approved the appointment of a COO.  So it necessitated having people to act in that position for quite some time.      Ms Mabane had acted for quite some time in that position.  Later on she was moved to editorial policy and other duties at SABC and then Hlaudi was appointed as acting COO.    The Group Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the COO are positions that can only be confirmed by the Minister through cabinet.  So there would be an interview team which would be appointed – the board would have to approve that interview team.  They would sit through as a panel and then make a recommendation to the board and the board would recommend to the Minister.      Yes.    That is right.    No at that stage later on it became what you are describing Sir.  At that stage the board would appoint.    And then refer to the Minister for concurrence?    And the Minister would refer tocabinet.    For final agreement.    Yes.    That is right.    That is correct.   That is right.    Mr Mbembe yes.    That is right.    That is right.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Actually [indistinct] you come back.    She did not take it to the cabinet sothere was no come back.    No that was before our time.      Yes.    No.    That is right.    That is right.   That is right.    I would say probably three years.    Quite a long time.    No we could not find any such.    It was just assumed that the Minister had not wanted to appoint him.    It was General Nyanda.    But there had already been a court decision    That the position cannot be filled.   Until cabinet had approved.    No hew was always acting while I was there.    What number is that?    Yes.  Oh ja elevation to the Group Management position?    That was in the office of the CEO that he got elevated.    No, no, no.    He was just a manager for Stakeholder Relations.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    Well this happened when we had difficulty with communications.  So the board decided that we needed a person who will do board communications.  Because board decisions were not being reported correctly to the staff, to generally to people in the SABC.  So we needed someone who will carry out exactly what we have said and go and convince people about it. That is how we createdthis position of Communications Person for the board.    It would have been the Group Chief Executives office to do that.    Well we did not have – the board feltthat whatever it decided was not being communicated properly to people at SABC and therefore you had this conflictual relationship particularly with the unions and the general staff.  That the board felt they needed direct access to the people.    Well Hlaudi Motsoeneng – Mr Motsoeneng was already in the CEO office dealing with Stakeholder Relations.  So it was a simple matter that he must also deal with Stakeholder matters for the board.    Yes.    It was Mr Mokwetle     Yes.    Yes the CEO unfortunately fell out offavour with the board.    And the board got rid of him.    Ja.    That is right.    Absolutely.      He…    He was – when I mean participation I mean being part of the decision making.    But he could give an input to boardmeeting – to the board meeting but he could not be part of the decision making like voting.    Because well in my view and I – this is the view I conveyed to the board.  That whoever is going to be communicating for us must know precisely what we are talking about.  That is how he came to be invited to be at board meetings.    Precisely Sir because you know in a situation like that you get a lot of false information floating around the organisation and exacerbating whatever problems.  So that was the motivation.    That is correct Chairperson.    Well I do not think the Company Secretary we had could have made any impression on the general workers on the unions at SABC.    Well probably but under the circumstances we needed a dedicated person.    Well let us put it this way.    In order to implement the turnaround it was important for the board to know where the leakages of money were.  Who was doing what in terms of syphoning money from the SABC?  It is a long story Chairperson.  It is to do with how the computers were manipulated between the sales – they used to call – have a landmark computer system which recorded the sales and put programs on TV and then the SAP which was the paying – paying component of SABC.  There was a lot of manipulation and overriding the controls in those – in those two sectors of administration.    So he knew who was doing what let us put it that way.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    Well it is a thin dividing line Chairperson because - well let us put it this way.  He could never introduce a resolution or a motion to the board but he could say that tender that is going on the so and so, so and so interfering or involved.  It was that sort of participation.    Certainly Chairperson but it said that the need may not justify the means.    However …    We were dealing with very critical issues …    Involving people’s lives.   Some people needing to be charged.    You know.    So it - it - we - we needed …    As much information as possible.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Yes.    Yes.  I am just describing one aspect of the work that he was doing.    Where?    Yes.  There was huge resistance to the turnaround because people felt threatened by the turnaround.  They did not know whether they were going to lose their jobs.  You know.  In any environment where there is restructuring it becomes a threat to the workers. So the workers had to be persuaded to see that all that we were trying to do was to secure the SABC and in fact secure their jobs because as long as the SABC improved its finances continued to worksome of the terms contained in the Government guarantee like drastic reduction in head count would not necessarily happen. In fact we used to tell them if we get it right and pay off the loan to Nedbank then we are free from those conditions.  So people had to cooperate.  So this is one of the sessions where these things were being discussed.    At the time the GCEO was still functioning.  Oh, no, no.  That time it was Mr Nicholson who was acting CEO.    That is right.    We had to segregate the categoriesthat the Auditor-General had discovered and of course allocate actions according to the gravity of the situation.  Some people needed to be disciplined.  Some people needed to be reported to the police.  Some people needed to be fired outright. Some people were already on leave - I mean - suspension but continued to earn a lot of money.  So there were many aspects to the Auditor-General’s finding.  We had failed for quite some time to deal with this issue until we appointed the task team that contained - comprised of people like Sully Motsweni, Tiaan Olivier and many others who were experts in different areas. That is how we ultimately managed to deal and categorise the people and the actions that needed to be taken.    We - there was a problem because there would be a disciplinary hearing but there would be no witnesses.  So when we go to SCOPA and SCOPA says what have been done we would not be able to give definite answers.  So we took - it was the reason why we now had to have a special team within SABC. People who knew each unit - each business unit to come and deal with the issues relating to that unit.  Probably Chairperson I couldsimply put it and say there was no real will among the managers to deal with the issues.    Yes.    That would have been an - an internal audit function …    But the internal audit just did not do its work.    That was the problem.    Yes.  That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    (No audible reply).    Most of those Chairperson had come from the period of 2007 to 2009.  Most of those that is what the Auditor-General had discovered …    And we were attempting to deal with that.    Yes.    22 120 - 22 120 000.    No, no, no it was before.  It was a historical …    Yes.    They were not completely satisfied but they thought it was a good effort.    Some might as well still outstanding but in terms of losing money that had stopped.    Well Chairperson the challenges remained because there was not real full cooperation between management and the board.  Although the SAU had come in.  There was an Auditor-General report.  People were aware that some action is being taken. Some people were identified with their schemes of siphoning money.  They were referred to the police.  So there was an awareness that some control is coming back.    No definitely not. Well there were many salaryadjustments happening at a senior level and Human Resources identified Mr Motsoeneng’s position in that context of adjusting salaries of adjusting salaries to create parity.    Well already in the Group Chief Executive’s Office there was some adjustment because he had come in on a provincial salary which was well below the manager’s salary in that position …    But then when he became Group Executive then there was another adjustment and then when he became Acting COO there was then another adjustment.    Chairperson probably it is a matter of language …    But it describes exactly how you translate …    From a provincial salary scale level …    To one at Head Office.   No.  Definitely …    That is right.    That is right.    I agree.   I agree very much Chairperson.    I agree Chairperson.  Unfortunately this term - terminology crept into the …    Into this whole thing.    Absolutely Chairperson.    Hm.    Well I - I would think so because Human Resources would not have done any translation.  They did it because of this discrepancy.    Well this was purely in response tothe CEO saying Mr Motsoeneng has just come in.  He is going through different levels very quickly.  He - she needs support from the board.  That was the only reason why the board got involved. ADV THANDI NORMAN    Well I think Mr Tsietsi - I am not too sure but now I am not too sure about that.  Let me …    Not comment.    Hm.    Ja.    Well certainly the fact that he had come in and jumped a number of levels.  Obviously I think that is why even the CEO was worried.    However I think the information would be there in documentation from HR …    As to …    Exactly …    Yes.    Yes.  I mean the differences become quite significant …    If you move …    Someone in different positions …    Into the next.    Hm.    It is sir.    It is what one - one would call ad hominem.  You know.  Where it is something that is just done because the person is needed.    Yes.    Yes.  Of course we have Governance Committee, Remuneration Committee.  Although I do not have the documents but I am quite sure that went through all those stages.    I agree Chairperson.  However unfortunately that did not happen that way.    I think it was the pressure of the situation.    That made this type of selection - you know …    Appropriate.    Sure.   No I - I concede that point Chairperson.    Hm.     Yes.     Well so an acting position does notrequire an advertisement but it’s got to be announced to the staff when it happens.     Well Motsoeneng was only appointed after I had gone from SABC.     Yes I was still Chairperson.     Well I don’t have the advert in front of me but I do know that…[intervenes].    That’s true.     That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct Chairperson.     “The Chief Operations Officer, keyaccountabilities as a member of the Board and reporting to theGroup Chief Executive Officer with full day-to-day operatingresponsibility for the economic content and platformperformance of the SABC.

ADV THANDI NORMAN     Yes that’s correct.     I never handled any advert Chairperson, I don’t know where – who said this to the Public Protector because there’s no advert where I wrote with my hand and say, change this and change that.     Yes she invited me to a meeting and I went…[intervenes].     She did raise this issue.     Chairperson I would have asked exactly about what I asked, show me, show me the report.     No.     Well as far as I remember.     Ja but if that was the case I would have actually, as I said to Advocate Wagener, let me see the report…[intervenes].     No Chairperson, when we were talking about hiring a [indistinct] company, just general discussion, I think it was in the governance committee.  My view was, the SABC had already appointed a COO who was then frustrated by the cabinet or the Minister.    Yes sir, why don’t you just take that report, I mean that advert it and use it, that was my only comment about this.     Just in the discussion.     I think it was governance committee.     Yes I think so but I said my view was we are going to now search for a search company pay money but someone had been appointed at SABC as COO.     It happened before this advert.     Yes I think this advert was drawn up  by a search company, I’m not too sure who did it.     No sir.     I have not seen that advert.     That’s right.     I don’t know.     I mean the previous Board had never had a problem with the advert [indistinct].     Sorry what cover?     Yes Chair.     Sorry what page?     I’ve got the Public Protector’s report.    Sorry?     Oh okay, sorry I looked down here alright, 294?     Sorry.     Yes.     Well Chairperson, I mean this itself states the issue, the advert was changed by someone in 2008 that advert never came before me, it was a management issue.  So I’m absolutely surprised that so much emphasis is placed here by Miss Mokhobo on something that never served, I didn’t know that this advert had been changed, all I said was, why waste money going to search companies because someone is appointed on an advert for a COO position.     That’s correct.     Well probably I was naïve chairperson, I assumed that if someone had been appointed by the Board surely it would have met all requirements, you know.     That’s correct.     That’s correct chairperson.     Yes.     Well Chairperson I couldn’t have said she mustn’t change because we did not have that advert in front ofus.     That’s right, Chair that’s correct that’s as opposed to going to someone to go to write a new advert.     Well I don’t know where she got this because there was no basis for going into this detail at all.     No.    Well you know I think she thought I engineered this.  I did not.  This was coming through HR – through the CEO, I would not have had a mechanism to create this as Chairman ofthe board.      You are right.    That is right.    Yes Mr Chairman.    That lies with him.  It is only when it comes to Group Executive.    That the board – that the board gets consulted.    CEO, CFO and COO.    Yes.    Ys.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well if I remember well it was three.  Yes.    I …    I do not have the actual…    Mental picture.    But I know that it is very significant differences.    Yes.    Well what I knew was that that person would be dealing with Provincial Stations.   And the motivation by the CEO was that he had been good in the Free State.    And that is why he wanted him.    Yes.     That is right.    When he came to head office no-one paid much attention to his qualifications.    Because he was already within the SABC.  This arose later on and then we sought information on the people who employed him.  In fact Mr Alwyn produced an affidavit as to why he had employed him.    In the Free State yes.    So he was there, they found him fit we were not going to revisit that you know.   He had become acting COO.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well unfortunately qualifications do not come in in that type of decision.    It is a question of track record    And the level in the organisation.    That is how acting people areappointed.  They must be at a certain level.    In other words Group level.    Then they get appointed to act.    He was already Group Executive.    In Stakeholder.   That is right.    Exactly.  He was no longer a manager.    He was Group Executive.    That is right.    That is right.    Very sig…    Very significant.    That is right.    It was a function that was within the CEO’s office.   I – it is a – my regional manager.    Yes.    It is a category.    Yes.    Yes.      That is right    No probably let us go back a bit.    He comes in as …    Manager Stakeholder.   In the Group     Chief Executives Office.    He then gets promoted to Group Executive.    That is a big jump.    From that one of being manager.    After that he gets appointed acting COO.    That is also another big jump.    Yes.    That is right.    No.    It would be impossible.    For the manager.    For Stakeholder Relations.    To do other jobs.    Yes.    Yes.    That is right.   Yes right.    That is right.    That is right.    Absolutely.    But my understanding was that whoever could have been doing that job had failed hence the CEO wanting somebody else.   I am not too sure whether GE Stakeholder Relations never existed.  I am not sure about that.  Yes.    I think …    I think it is a jump from a level of say 1.5 million.    To over 2 million.    Yes.    Yes.    I think the Chief Executiverecommends that to the board.  I am not sure of the details.    But it would not have happened unless he recommended it.    To the board.    Mr Mokwetle?    As I remember.    Right.    That is right.    That is right.    Well that have been on previous performance.  He succeeded as a Stakeholder Manager.  There was a new challenge and he was sought to be able to do it.  Just like going from that to becoming acting COO it was not a matter of qualifications it was a matter of being able to do the job.      Well I presume the background to that is that prior experience is accepted as adequate if a person demonstrates special knowledge or special capability.  I think that isthe reasoning that we went on.     Yes.    Well Chairperson I fully understand what you are saying however when the house is burning anyone can pass a bucket of water as long as he can carry the water.  That was a situation.  SABC was burning with a lot of degreed people.  It was being reduced to ashes.  So anyone who could carry a bucket of water to put down – to put out the fire would be allowed to do that.    Ja.    Well I agree Chairperson.  This iswhy for the permanent position there was an advert.    But for this we did not do that.    There was an advert for that.    That is correct.    Yes.    Sorry?    29, 29.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Probably I am on the wrong page.  Sorry.    299.    Well it is 299.    And the top of it says And the issue of Public Protector.    Meeting the deadline.    Oh okay.    Oh alright sure.  Thank you.  Okay.    Well the HR Report told us that there was no claim by Mr Motsoeneng that he had Matric.  Ms Pippa Green who was a Board Member also said she knew that Mr Motsoeneng did not have Matric.  That the people who employed him had merely employed him knowing this fact …    And this was the position that we had.   I saw the application.    It said he was doing Matric.  It did not say he had passed Matric.    Yes.    Yes.    As a …    No.    No.    Sorry.  What page?    2-9 …?    (No audible reply).    Ja, I have found it.    I think I have found it.    Sorry.   Just come …    Well I will go with the - Mr Alwyn’s affidavit.  That they knew he did not have a Matric Certificate but they appointed him all the same …   Because of the service that he was rendering.    That to me sums up the attitude of the board in advancing Mr Motsoeneng to the Acting position.    Ja.    No the issue of symbols did not arise.  As I say I am trying to look for what Mr Alwyn said because that is what I have - sort of influenced us …    In our view.  I cannot find him here but …    Yes.    He had no - he had no Matric Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    That is write.   That is …    That is right.    Well he - yes of course.  However …    He told us that he did not have Matric.    So we knew that.  I mean we did not search for all sorts of things.    We knew he did not have Matric but he could do the job.    No.    No, no that did not arise.  I am sorry.    That issue did not arise.  We went with the knowledge that he does not have Matric …    But senior people in SABC saw fit to appoint him.    Well at the SABC it did not arise.  We knew that he did not have Matric …    But we knew that we wanted certain services from him.    Yes Chairperson.    We knew he did not have Matric …    But we knew that he could deliver what we wanted …   And that is what guided us.    Chairperson we know that or we knew that a Matric Certificate and higher qualifications are always required but like the people in the Free State they were dealing with a crisis where the people who were there were supposed to be able to deliver a successful broadcasting service were failing and hence they took this boy who did not have a Matric and he made a difference. So it was the same approach here.  We know normally youwould want to have those qualifications but when people with those qualifications fail you then try anything.    Yes.    I would say exactly you said …    Chairperson …    But the board knew …    That the people we had …    Had not delivered.    So we were trying to improve the situation …    And - and …   There are people at SABC who do not have Matric.    This was not the precedent …    Or the first time.    People in quite senior positions.    I am sure if HR could provide us…    With a list of all the qualifications …    Of people in sales of people …    In different department you would find that there are some who do not have Matric.    Some of them come from the old dispensation.    Before 1994.    Who did not have Matric but theywere given these jobs and they were doing it very well.    Yes.    That is right.    Yes.    Yes. Well I would not have the documentation but HR would have.    But then Chairperson if you will allow me.    The same dispensation - the new dispensation recognised prior learning and this had a major effect on the thinking - you know - on the board.    You are right.    You right.   Right.    Right.    Right.   Right.    Right.    Well I accept that …    Chairperson …    But when appointing as Acting CEO we have to inform the Minister and get the concurrence.  So that happened.  It was approved by the Minister.  So we thought …    We were doing something alright.    Exactly.    Exact …    Exactly or …    Otherwise he would never have been an Acting CEO.    Yes.   Right.    Right.    Right.    I do very well.    So U?    Okay.   Sorry.    Thank you.    This is the - 2-1-9?    Ja.    Sorry.  Appointing of the Acting …    The - the letter is from …    The letter is from the Minister.   Oh.    Oh, right.   Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    No.  There is a mistake.    She says as the Chief Operations Officer of the corporation.  We were talking about an Acting COO.    Yes.    Yes but it is …    That is right.    Yes.    Sorry.  Are the minutes here?         Well apart from the three positions the Chief Executive Officer can appoint Acting Group Executives.     Chairperson the people who is appointed acting should be in the same position as the person who occupied, in other words ...(intervention)      Grade 5 or Grade 7.     They must be in the same position.     Then the CEO will appoint and inform us that so and so is now acting.     That’s right.     Yes sir, apart from the three positions.     That’s right.     And reports to the Minister.    No Chairperson absolutely.     Sorry, page?    39?     It is correct.     Page?     Okay, right.     No Chairperson let me clarify, that non-participation in terms of voting was when he was ...(intervention)      ...communications.     Now he is Acting COO, he is now part of the three Group Executive members of the Board.     He was a member ...(intervention)      Yes.     Exactly.     Alright.     Ja, Chairperson the issue of encryption had been a ball that has been kicked around a lot at SABC.  It has gone to the Supreme Court, I think even Constitutional Court.  When I wrote this remark in my statement it applied to a discussion after the – I think the High Court or Constitutional Court had ruled that this matter should be settled by broadcasters, and not involvepoliticians.  So that opened a whole lot of discussion around the issue of encryption.  There was a strong view that encryption makes access to broadcasting material for the people conditionally, that the SABC Act stipulates that there must be universal access to any broadcast, but done by the Public Broadcaster.Now the encryption will mean that some people could switch off members of the public and not have – therefore contravene the full access requirement, that was the type of discussion that was happening, it was not decisive, but the majority view tended to be to a large extent that let’s not create any obstacle for people who don’t have subscription DSTV or whatever other subscription channel can be switched off and not have access.     Sorry that is the other file?     Sorry what is the number?     Okay.     Yes Chairperson.     Chairperson NCA – I’m sorry, eNCA was becoming a very powerful competitor for the SABC, so there was a lot of discussion as to how the SABC can host or provide a 24 hour news channel.  You know ...(intervention)      To compete with them.     The news people through the head of news examined this issue, even suggested that we would take SABC 3 and make it into a 24 hour news channel, but they needed partners, so Mr Olivier and Hlaudi Motsoeneng even went to India to try and and find a partner who could help them turn SABC3 into a 24 hour news channel.  They even went to London, I think they spoke to ITV on this issue.  When they came back and reference was made to ICASA,ICASA said there is no way SABC3 could be turned into a 24 hour news channel because the license conditions are that it is a commercial channel, it is even accounted for separately from the public broadcaster, which is SABC1 and 2, so that brought an end to that discussion. But then the Minister of Communications, because the Portfolio Committee was very keen that we move on with the 24 hour news channel called me and Ms Mkobo to a meeting and said ...(intervention)      No, no Minister Bule.     Yes.  We went to a meeting, we were told that it is important that we talk to MultiChoice because that isthe only remaining alternative.  So we started discussions with MultiChoice, we progressed the discussions very significantly, until we wrote, I am not sure whether it was a contract or an MOU, but we did sign a document that MultiChoice will host the SABC on DSTV as 24 hour news.That seemed to fulfil the requirement that we have a 24 hour news channel.   However the problem came when it came to how MultiChoice will pay for the SABC on their DSTV bouquet.  They said they will pay R50million the first year, R40million the second year, R30million the third year, R2million the fourth year, R1million etcetera,it was – and then there will be nothing payable to SABC after that.  That broke the discussion.     That was still MultiChoice.     Yes I am not sure it was a contract or an MOU.     But we had signed the document.     Yes.     But then the issue of money, of payment, came in.  There was another grouse on the side of the SABC,that they must carry regulations which are included in the Broadcasting Act, stipulate that any subscription provider who has thirty bequests or so must carry SABC1 and SABC2 but they do this free of charge without paying any money to the SABC.  This was a sore point for SABC in that they benefit from audience ratings, they get advertisement out of the content produced by SABC, they just cream off the work of SABC.  Now to add now to this fact that MultiChoice only would pay R50million initially and end up paying nothing for the 24 hour news channel broke the conversation, that is how I left it.    That is right.     Yes.     Well I am aware of many things that the media says.     Well as I have stated everything was done in good faith on the assumption that it helps the SABC.       It is correct sir.     No.  Well this is now taking me by surprise, there was no mandate given to me to get rid of Mr Motsoeneng.  Mr Motsoeneng raised some issues as Acting COO about some Board members who were wanting to get into a Siemens contract, he raised it sharply with the Board, and that process was stopped. That is the only -  but that did not lead to any of us being given a mandate to fire him.       Well it must be someone higher than us, because I wouldn’t have ...(intervention)      Certainly not.     Sorry, this 56?    62?    Well because of the turnaround project the Board tended to be probably too involved in terms of the conditions of the government guarantee the Board had to ensure that all predetermined objectives such as austerity measures were timeously attended, this meant close monitoring and supervision of management in implementing the turnaround measures.What I did not say here was that Board members feltcompelled to be very closely involved with the turnaround, because there was this lack of trust between the Board and senior management.      No we did not have a company in the broadcasting sector at all.     No, not a single one of them, I mean unless they act in Generations or something like that, which I may not know about, but there was no one doing business with SABC.     That’s correct.     Yes sir.     That’s right.     Well that is the adverts that I wasgiven to read.     For a permanent position.     No, when he was stakeholder manager in the office of the CEO.     He was then asked to be also communication person for the Board.     When he became Acting COO he did not do those jobs anymore.     He was an Executive Member of the Board.     So there was no connection between him being stakeholder manager in the CEO’s office and being Acting COO.     Those two were still before the COO Acting stage.     That’s right.     That’s right.     That’s right.     That’s right.     That’s right.     Yes.     That’s right.     That’s right.     We were not involved in that.    No.     That’s right.     Well there should have  been because it was now a vacated position.     I was not involved.     Yes.     No the three, CEO, CFO, COO.    But the others are made by the CEO but reports to us.     Yes.     No.    That’s right.     Absolutely, and informed the Minister.     Yes.    That is right.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is right.    That is right.   No that is higher.    That is right.    Yes.    Yes.    Must be at the Group level.    Yes.    That is right.  That is right.    That is right.    That is right.     That is correct.    Absolutely.    In my time Mr Chairman.    Yes.    He knew the SABC backwards.  He knew exactly who was doing what.  What system was being overridden?How false commissions were being generated.  He knew a lot.  So he was very valuable to us to stop money flowing from the SABC illegally.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Except that Chair maybe just to – thequestions that you asked the witness now they are – about his progression and the career history.    Alright.    Thank you.    Can my legal representative have a record of this?    Thank you very much.   He deals with the DTT and he is going to demonstrate how it works and he is going to be along witness and I would not want to rush him Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  We are now at page 9 of your statement Doctor Ngubane.  And you deal there from paragraph 32 and following with your dealings with Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng could you then tell the Chairperson how did you get to know Mr Motsoeneng and under what circumstances?  Oh sorry yourmicrophone is off.  I beg your – sorry.  And also switch it…    Thank you.  Yes.l    So – sorry this progression then from being a stakeholder liaison to being an acting COO how did that – how did that happen?    Yes.  And then ordinarily who is responsible for make – for appointing people to these executive positions in an acting capacity?    Yes.  Could you just tell the Chairperson what – what skill did he bring?  I mean if you talking about a Chief Operations Officer you talking about the Auditor General’s findings those are largely matters that would deal with the financial aspects of the organisation. So what is the skill that he was bringing on board to deal with those matters?    Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  And then in – when he acted in that position of the COO position when he acted there do you know who – what happened to the person who initially occupied – who was occupying that – who left having occupied that position as to what happened to that person?    Yes.   Yes.    And who was the Minister at the time?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  And during this time.    I am sorry.    So when you came in there was simply – there were acting people?    Thank you Mr Chairman.    Yes.  Yes Chair.    Yes, yes we will make them.    Yes.  Then in paragraph 39 then you deal withthe elevation of Mr Motsoeneng now to a permanent COO position.      Oh I am sorry can I just – that is my understanding of what you say in paragraph 39 I could be wrong.  Could you just read what is – what you say there in paragraph 39 [indistinct] 1?    39 at page 10.    Yes.    Oh not – still not in the – not the COOposition?    Alright oh sorry that is my mistake.    Thank you Chair.  Then you deal in paragraph 40 about the Mr Motsoeneng attending board meetings and could you just tell the Chair how did that come about?    Yes.  Whose responsibility was it to communicate to the staff from whatever it is that the board wanted to communicated before you embarked on in deciding that Mr Motsoeneng must fill in that – that space?    Yes.  Now when your say then that was not being done properly what exactly do you mean?    Yes.  And then did you raise that matter with the GCEO, the Group Chief Executive Officer that look we are not happy with the manner in which you communicate the board’s matters to the staff and we believe that we need to have somebody else to do that.      Yes.  So then he got invited then according to what you say – he attended to the board meetings at your request?   What would be his role?    Sorry.    Thank you Chair.    Yes.  Thank you. Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then you say – you say in paragraph 40 Doctor Ngubane that his role at the board meetings would – that he would not participate.    Because he was not a board member.    Yes.    Yes.  And many a times…    Sorry.    Yes, yes Chair.    Answered that question.    Oh yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  And then just following up on the Chair’s question – would the Company Secretary not do that?  Because if I am a member of staff and I hear that the board has taken a particular decision the first person to make the enquiries to – would be the company secretary and you say – could you just confirm with me at the meeting that the board held on such and such a day did this take place, what was the decision?  Would that not have been the easiest way of controlling the situation?    But at least the Company Secretary wouldhave communicated the decisions of the board effectively because he or she is the one that records those decisions.    Yes.  Then could you just explain in paragraph    Yes.    REGISTRAR   Okay. 
NGUBANE:Chairperson under normal circumstances it would be exactly as you are saying it but this situation we were in and the board was becoming very activist at SABC because the relationship with management was in many ways very weak.  We are absolutely correct Chairperson.  You know there was such a lack of trust that the board suspended the Group Chief Executive that is how he left SABC/ 
DR BALDING SIPHO NGUBANE:   No it is not true.
