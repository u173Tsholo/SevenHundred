CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Good morning Ms Brown.    Thank you.  Good morning to your legal team, good morning to everybody.  I must just once again thank you Ms Brown for making yourself available on apublic holiday.  I must thank your legal team for their cooperation so that we could have this session on a public holiday.  I must thank Mr Seleka and his team, the technicians, the commission’s staff, everybody for making it possible for us to sit even on a public holiday.  Thank you very much. Okay Mr Seleka.    Ms Brown the oath you took on Friday will continue to apply today.  Is that alright?   Okay alright.    Okay alright.    Okay Mr Seleka.    Do you want to tell me where to find that first?    I am sorry Mr Seleka.  Ms Brown youhave said that you did not understand that you would be questioned on the Fundudzi Report today and if you knew you would have prepared.   Now I do not know what Mr Seleka has to say but if that is the position and if it did not fall within what was arranged as the issues that you would be questioned on from – from Friday then maybe what we would do it is say answer as far as you are able to but where you are not able to answer without having refreshed your memory then we can take it from there.  Mr Seleka.   You would like to say something about what Ms Brown said?    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.     Hm    Does that mean that questions on the Fundudzi Report as far as you are concerned fall within the scope of what she was to be asked about from Friday?    On the Eskom.    Ja.  Ja.    Okay.  Ms Brown Mr Seleka says he believes that insofar as the Fundudzi Report refers to the composition of the Eskom board he believes that fell within the scope of what you were to deal with from Friday.  Is that – is that your understanding as well?    Yes.    Okay.    Ja.   Yes.  Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Well accepts the – except your answer is another thing but I think the – what we will do is you – you will answer as much as possible and to the best of your ability depending on when we finish and dependingwhether – how far we have gone on this issue we might see what can be done because.    It would be good if we could use today’s time as much as possible.      But let us see how it goes.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.    So – so as I understand the position Ms Brown what you are saying is you gave instructions that the pool or data base be opened up so that more people could have the opportunity of being considered for appointments to various boards, is that correct?    Yes.  And the process was – or the pool was then opened up and once that had happened anybodyand everybody could send his or her CV or someone else’s CV to the department for consideration to be included in some or other board.  Is that correct?     And our evidence is that it was the responsibility of the Legal and Governance Unit within the department to vet everyone whose name or CV was to be send to you to ensure that by the time such a person’s name was send to you to consider to a point, they would have been vetted.  Is that right?    H’m.     They did not go beyond a certain stage?     H’m.     H’m.     Your portfolio.     H’m.  Yes.  But I think what you are saying is in line with what I was saying.      Namely, on your understanding that the Legal and Governance Unit of the department had a duty to make sure that nobody – nobody’s name was sent to you who had not been vetted.     Ja.  There may be people whose CV’s they received that they might not have vetted.  You might not have issues with that as long as they do not send them to you without vetting them.     So that is the point you are – that is part of the point you are making.  And if you appointed anybodywho had not been vetted, you are saying that you would have assumed that they had been vetted because that is what the Legal and Governance Unit in your department was supposed to have done.  And if they did not vet somebody for any particular reason, you would have expected them to bring that to your attention before you could appoint that person.  Is that right?     H’m.    H’m.  Okay.  Mr Seleka.     Was the...  I am sorry, Mr Seleka.     Was the – was one of the requirements in the first advert, maybe also in the second advert, in terms of academic qualifications that the candidates needed to have a senior degree or a masters?  In other words, a junior degree not enough or what was the position?  If you can recall ...[intervenes]     Postgraduate?     Ja.  Ja, I think it ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct]      I think Mr Seleka has got ...[intervenes]      No, no ...[intervenes]      No, I think Mr Seleka has got the relevant document.  What were the requirements?     H’m.     [No audible reply]      So is my understanding correct that in terms of the first advert, a postgraduate degree was an essential requirement in regard to the second advert, apostgraduate degree was a recommendation?  It was no longer an essential requirement?     H’m.     Yes.  Does that accord with your recollection Ms Brown?    H’m.     No, no.  That is fine.  It is just that if the second advert relaxed the academic qualifications a bit compared to the first one and therefore no longer made apostgraduate degree an essential requirement.  It would mean that even if your preferred candidate did not have the – not completed her postgraduate degree, she would be eligible to be considered.  And of course, I would imagine that if somebody else had a postgraduate degree and which she did not have, maybe she was left with only one module but taken together with her experience in the department and her acting streak of about a year, I think you said, she might well have been considered to be, you know, the most suitable candidate despite not having a postgraduate degree.  Now I mention that, being alive to the fact that you said she withdrew her application.  So I am alive to that.  But I am just saying, it is interesting that, first, apostgraduate degree was required and then in the second advert she withdrew even though the requirements had been relaxed.  But I do not know now whether she withdrew before the second advert went out or after but she was no longer a candidate.  But she would have been eligible to be considered, at least.  If ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     Second advert.     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka.    You ...[intervenes]      H’m.     H’m.     Was – do you recall whether the reason why he wanted to meet with you was to indicate that he was considering making himself available for consideration as a candidate for DG?    Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.    H’m, h’m.     H’m.     Well, I guess, you are probably right thathe must have wanted to talk to you about the possibility of him making himself available because you say you told him to put in his application or CV.  So that seems to tie in with a discussion about ...[intervenes]      ...the position.  Would you actually accept that?     H’m.     H’m.  So you ...[intervenes]      Yes, but is the point you are making thatthe purpose of the meeting might have been something else and the issue of him making himself available for the position of DG might have come in at the end of the discussion ...[intervenes]      Ja.  So.  But you cannot remember what the main point was that he wanted to canvas with you?     Yes.     Ja, ja.     Ja, no, no, no.  And is your recollection that that meeting that you had with him took place at some stage after the first advert had gone out and before the closing date in terms of the second advert?     Yes.     Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     But I am sorry, Ms Brown – well if what the Fundudzi report says is correct in terms of lot of communications between Ms Davids and this Infoportal email address, if the emails that they say were exchanged between the Inforportal address and Ms Davids and the content of at least some of those emails, if that is true, it seems to be that it could be concerning, it should be concerning at least in regard to some of the emails because without going to any specific one some of the emails seem to involve an outside person quite a lot so I am wondering whether that is part of what, you know,surprises you or it is something else?     As you see I am saying if all of that is true, you know?     Mr Seleka?     You did not say about eleven monthsinto his position.     Five months, ja.     Ja, I think you need to …[intervenes]    You need to tell us whether you are still on the Fundudzi report or we can take that away.     Oh, yes, no, no, no.  Shall we make it …[intervenes]     Okay, no, no, let us make more thanthat, let us make it ten minutes and then we will come back.     Ja, okay.     Let us take an adjournment.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue, but maybe I should just mention something that I think everybody should know about today in case it has not been communicated.  My expectation for today is that we should be able to finish with Ms Brown’s evidence before lunch butat the latest by lunchtime.  I thought I must just mention that so that everybody is aware at least of what my estimation is.  Mr Seleka, what is your own estimation?     Ja, okay alright.  Okay, let us continue then.     Yes.     What is it, that must be A?  You said there is A and B?     This one can go away or you will still come back to it?     Okay.  Good day, Ms Brown.     Ja, well, I do not see anything wrong with your hair.     Yes, Mr Seleka?     Hang on, Ms Brown …[intervenes]    Hang on, hang on, hang on.     Hang on, let him finish what he is putting to you first.     Well, let her answer now.     Because I did not – I stopped her.  Ja, answer now, Mr Brown.     Do you want to let her see if she getsthe page she is looking for.     I think she is looking for a page where she made comments that are relevant to her answer to your question.     I’m sorry Mr Seleka, so is the positionthat you admit that on that day, a meeting did take place between – which involved you and Mr Tsotsi. What you do not accept is what he says you said to him in terms of, effectively, threatening to get rid of him immediately if he was not doing his job, you say, the discussion was about something else, namely, you were saying to him, he should stop interfering in operational matters, is that correct?     Yes, but my question is, whether I’m correct in understanding, that you say, a meeting did take place involving you and him…[intervenes].     And it took place on the day that he saysit did, the difference is that you say, the meeting was to discuss his alleged interference in operational matters, he says, you said to him you would find somebody else if he didn’t do his job or something to that effect.  That’s the only difference between the two of you about what happened in that meeting, is that correct?     Yes, okay, Mr Seleka.     Well of course, Ms Brown it may well be that the situation was – lots of people were interfering in matters in which they should not be interfering.  They might not have been procurement matters if the evidence of the Board members who gave evidence is true, you didn’t want, on the 11 t h of March to say, I’m instructing  you to suspend the Executives but they say it was quite clear that that’s what you wanted and of course if the evidence by Mr Tsotsi and the acting DG at the time is correct, the former President was interfering in when theEskom Board should have a meeting and when it should not have a meeting and then it may well be that Mr Tsotsi was also getting involved in procurement matters.  So, I’m just mentioning that I’m not saying that to the extent that he may have got involved in procurement matters when he shouldn’t have, I’m not saying that you should not have raised the issues, I’m just saying, it may well be that that’s, ultimately the position that may be emerging and you might be able to say something, or you might not be able to say anything about that?    Ja, okay, Mr Seleka.     Well, it depends, I mean it depends, Ms Brown…[intervenes].     No, it depends, Ms Brown I’m sure, 1) if it’s not a long story, it it’s a few words that somebody saidto somebody or to you, on a certain occasion, they could remain embedded in your mind to say, he said something, she said or he said you never set your foot in my house again, that could remain in your mind for many years, you know, it just depends, you know.  So – and of course if you are directly involved and maybe you are being threatened you might be more likely to remember all of that because of what may have been at stake for you than somebody else who may have listened to the same conversation but wasn’t directly involved or the person who  uttered the words, youknow, because there might not have been much as stake there might not have been anything at stake for them it just depends, you know, so all of those things will need to be taken into account.  Okay, alright, Mr Seleka?     Well, you – Mr Seleka, you might need to, in terms of time.     Focus more on the matters where Ms Brown is directly involved.     Because as far as Mr Tsotsi’s removal is concerned, it’s the Board that, by its own admission, waspushing for that and ultimately, he resigned.  There is no suggestion, as far as I’m aware, that Ms Brown had any particular hand in the Board pushing for Mr Tsotsi’s removal.  If, in the end, you want to draw to her attention, various features of the evidence relating to Eskom from different witnesses which maybe seem to involve the Gupta’s in one way or the other, that could be done later but also, it’s the kind of thing where she could be told to go and consider A, B, C, D, those features.     And then give us her comment by way of supplementary affidavit because those are the features that are there or may be there but certainly with regard to Mr Tsotsi, she doesn’t appear to have been part of the push for Mr Tsotsi’s removal.    Ja, I’m just mentioning that you might consider that ja.     Ja.  Well, remember to pace yourself appropriately.     You still have quite a few matters to deal with.     I’m looking at the time.   Well…    Well Ms Brown you could have done that if you did not listen in the first place and that is why Mr Matona had to be removed and then Mr Molefe put in.  Maybe you did not listen.    Yes.    But your – your…     Ja.     Well, you still have about 28-minutes before it is one.      One o’clock.  If you want to deal with that now.     Let me ask you something Ms Brown.     I have understood from other evidence in relation to Transnet that your predecessor in the Ministry of Public Enterprises, Mr Gigaba, had approved certain guidelines which SOE’s under Public Enterprises, I guess, were suppose to follow in the appointment of CEO’s.  I take it that when you arrived at the ministry, you became aware of those guidelines?     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.    Oh, okay.  So I guess what you mean is.  There are certain guidelines that you were – you became aware of when you came to the ministry but as to who had ...[intervenes]      ...who had established them or had, you know, approved them, you might not know about that.     Now, if I recall correctly and – ja, if Irecall correctly.  They contemplated that the board of an SOE should follow a process when they want to appoint a CEO.  A process which would involve having other candidates or not having more than one candidate.  I cannot remember whether they contemplated that there should be an advertisement as such but I seem to recall that, in the end, the board was, in terms of those guidelines, required to give to the Minister three names.  Maybe it is that.  At least three names  I am not sure but three names.  And they were supposed to then give – to identify their preferred candidates.  Does that accord with your recollection of what the guidelines you used, provided?    Yes, yes.     Now were those guidelines followed in the case of the permanent appointment of Mr Molefe as Group CEO of Eskom?     H’m.     H’m.     Ja, ja.     Yes.      Yes.     Yes.     No, no.  That is fine.  And after today, ifyou get a chance to refresh your memory and wish to supplement your answer, arrangements can be made for you to do that.But let me tell you that Mr or Dr Ngubane, I think was asked about this if I am not mistaken.  And his answer was to confirm that no process was followed that involved other candidates.  And when he was asked ...[intervenes]      And when he was asked why and I think there might have been no references to those guidelines in – when he was questioned but he may have been asked in     Ja.     Well, I do not know whether you – whatyou think of the reason that Mr or Dr Ngubane gave, whether you would have regarded it as a good reason not to follow the guidelines.  Are you able to say anything on that or...?     H’m.     But, you see, I have some difficulty with the reason given by the board and I do have difficulty with what you say too because I would think that the fact that there is a particular candidate that fascinates those who have to recommend or appoint, it cannot be a good reason not to follow process and it cannot be a good reason to exclude other possible candidates.  What do you say to that?    Yes.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja.  You see, I may have said this toDr Ngubane but I might not have said it.  If you think you have got a good candidate.  The fact that there might be – you might go through a process where there are other candidates should not make you feel at risk that you might lose this candidate.Particularly, in the context of what we are talking about because Mr Molefe was there at Eskom.  His acting term could be extended while the process was being followed.  There would be nothing wrong with that, I would imagine.And then he would complete with whoever else and if he was so – if he was that good, he would still come tops, you know.  So there is no – there should be no –     H’m?     [laughs]     Ja.    I think what you want to say is.  Maybe     And you are thinking    [Indistinct]      Ja.  No, I think you need to have a look.     To refresh your memory of what happened because it is an important issue.  Certainly from my point of view but also, and this might not have anything to do with you, maybe, because maybe it is the board which made the decision as opposed to you making the decision in regard to the Group CEO, namely, withMr Singh.  My understanding is that he was also appointed without following any competitive process.  Are you able to say anything on that?     H’m, h’m.  You ...[intervenes]      H’m, h’m.     H’m.  Ja, ja.  Mr Seleka, am I – is my recollection correct about Mr Singh’s appointment to Eskom?     There was no competitive process either with him?     Ja.     Ja.     [Indistinct]      Ja.     No process thereto ...[intervenes]     Ja.     H’m?     Yes.  Yes.  Oh.     Okay.  Do you want to just mention that?     So that the Minister can hear.     H’m.  I guess to the extent that Mr Seleka may have got the right clause of the MOI, I guess that if the appointment was in breach of the MOI, that would be unlawful.  Ms Brown, would it not?    Ja, ja.     No, no.  That is fine.  That is fine.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  No, that is fine.  So I think that the arrangements, therefore, is that you will refresh your memory on the issue of processes that may or may not have been followed or the process that may or may not have been followed in regard to the permanent appointment of Mr Molefe to Eskom.  And what reasons there existed, if any, why no process was followed and saying no process in the context of either the guidelines or, if Mr Seleka is right, whatever the MOI contemplates as well.  And maybe we could thenhave a supplementary affidavit which deals with that from you.  Maybe we could – if there is a chance that we could have that affidavit before the Easter weekend that would be appreciated.  If there are challenges then maybe you would in the first week – within the week of Easter Monday so that we could have a look and take it from there.  Mr Seleka?     Oh.     Ja, okay.  Okay, you want to do that?     No, he is not threatening to ask you questions, he is threatening to give you more homework.ADV SELEKA     Well – or you could send something to her lawyers.     Which highlights various features.     And I think maybe I could say this, Ms Brown, part of what I have to look at is if some of the things that I have been told happened which connected orinvolved the Guptas or their associates, if indeed they did happen, what do I make of what was happening at Eskom during your term, your tenure, you know?  And in this regard there are a number of things.  You do not have to note them down now but I just mention you have Mr Henk Bester ’s evidence that in 2014 he was told by Mr Salim Essa that Mr Molefe was going to be the next boss of Eskom.  He was meeting with Mr Salim Essa about something else at Transnet and Mr Salim Essa, according to Mr Henk Bester, was trying to push Mr Henk Bester to include his company into a certain business that they had got a Eskom and Mr Henk Bester was resisting this and Mr Essa sought to show Mr Bester that, you know, they are very powerful, they had already made a decision that the next boss of Eskom would be Mr Brian Molefe.  At that timeMr Brian Molefe was Group CEO of Transnet and so there is that. And then Mr Matona gets appointed in October as Group CEO but within a few months of him he gets suspended, he gets out, Mr Brian Molefe happens to be the person who is brought in, who is seconded and then later he gets appointed permanently and maybe depending on what you will come back with in your supplementary affidavit, maybe he gets appointed even in breach of the department’s own guidelines as to how CEOs should beappointed.Then Mr Singh follows him from Transnet, follows him to Eskom, maybe he too gets appointed permanently as CFO without the following of any competitive process and then if Ms Daniels’ evidence is true and if Mr Abram Masango’s evidence is true – or no, let me first say then on the 8 March 2015 a meeting takes place in Durban at which, according to Mr Tsotsi and Mr Linnell, the President takes part where the idea of the suspension of three executives of Eskom is discussed. And then if Mr Abram Masango’s evidence is true and if Ms Daniels’ is true, on the 10 March before board members other than Mr Tsotsi had to know that there is a suggestion that certain executives be suspended, then on that day Mr Salim Essa meets with Ms Daniels and with MrKoko and meets with Mr Masango and they get told in separate meetings that four executives would be suspended.  Now at the Durban meeting it was three executives, not four, and now there are four and then – and one of them is told, either Masango or Daniels, I cannot remember, gets told that these four would be suspended, they include Mr Koko but Mr Koko will come back after the suspension, the others will not come back, I think.     And ultimately that is what happens buton the 11 t h the meeting takes place, you come to address the meeting, you have four areas that you are concerned with and on the evidence that has been given, you speak on the basis that though the executives who had those four areas should be suspended, but you say I cannot instruct you, the board, what to do.  And then they get suspended and then, of course, in due course they get paid out.  The board says well, we had not problems with them coming back but they paid out to leave.  All of these things. And then you have, on the evidence that has been given, if it is true, you have the President giving instructions that a board meeting, which was quite important, to deal with I think the corporate plan or whatever, gets cancelled and nobody is told what the reasons were, the minister responsible seems to have alsonot been told about that.So you have a lot of things that happened and part of my job will be to try and make sense of all of this but, as I say, it all depends on what is found to have actually happened, what is true, what are the facts.  But some of these, if they are found to have happened, would require me to try and make sense exactly what was going on and, of course, Mr Tsotsi gets – the board says they have confidence in him, he says he had not cooperated with the Guptas and now he was being pushed out.  He resigns.So I am just mentioning these things for what it is worth but you can obviously only say what you know.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     That you can deal with, ja, ja.     Yes.     No, I remember it because – okay, no, I just want to say I remember it because I think I saw it in your affidavit recently, in one of your affidavits …[intervenes]     But I do recall that some witness had said something along those lines about you in regard to a different work stream.     Well, you – well let me say first it is not last time that you have to give evidence because certainly in regard to Denel we still would like you to deal with Denel issues.  With regard to that particular work stream, I think if you would like to say something, do say it because it may be that there might not be another chance.  But if you say look, apart from what you will say now you would like to deal with it more comprehensively, let the Commission know.    Yes.     Ja, no, I think she said it was Mr van Wyk who had said that, if I am not mistaken.     Ja, ja.     Okay, that is alright.  We are going toadjourn.  Thank you very much, Ms Brown, I think arrangements for further assistance from you have been made but you will come back to deal with matters relating to Denel.  Arrangements will be made for that but thank you very much for availing yourself and for availing yourself on a public holiday once again and thank you to everybody.  We will now adjourn.  I can just mention for the benefit of the public that tomorrow I will be hearing evidence relating to SARS, so that will be tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday.  We adjourn.
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Thank you Chairperson.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Brown we were – when we adjourned last time dealing with the composition of the sub-committees I will back to a particular aspect of it in due course but I wish to ask you this.  You are aware that the Fundudzi Report – the Fundudzi has made an investigation into some of the emails exchanged between infoportal email address and Ms Kim Davids.  You are aware of it?    Yes.  And they have produced a report that shows extensive exchange of emails between Ms Davids and infoportal in regard to CV’s of persons that ultimately became appointed either to the board or including in this case Mr Richard Seleke who gets to be appointed at the DPE as a DG.  I – I understand you have seen that report?    Yes.  I have read your affidavit.  I seethat your response in regard to denying knowledge that Ms Davids was acting on – either on your instruction or with your knowledge in exchange in those emails.    Yes.  But I think what is not dealt with in your affidavit is the very fact of her having communicated and received CV’s from this email address of infoportal which is presumed to be the email address of Mr Salim Essa.  What is your comment on that?    Are you saying to the Chairperson you would not have been aware that she was receiving CV’s of would be board members from this email address infoportal?    There is one email which one also findsin info – in the Fundudzi Report in which she writes – and this in regard to…    Yes Chair.  That you will find Ms Brown in Eskom Bundle 7 for hardcopies Chairperson is 7(b) on page 1140.      1140 yes in Eskom Bundle 7.  Are you there?    Ja that will be under 14 – paragraph 14.9 with a heading Appointment of Giovanni Leonardi at Eskom.   So the report says   Then paragraph 14.9.3 says   Yes that is correct.  But what appears from the report is that the discussion with you which she says she had in this email follows after the exchange ofemails between her and infoportal in regard to the composition of in this case certain boards.  SA Express, Denel and Eskom.  The question is, did she come to you with a list of proposals for composition of these boards?    Yes.    Yes.  Could you please explain to the Chairperson how would you have gathered that the CV wasobtained from the Chairperson of Transnet – the CV of Mr Giovanni?    I see but you would have seen from the Fundudzi Report that the findings are different.    Yes.    Hm.  Yes.  What I am – what I am only saying is – I am not suggesting that you would have seen it at the time but I am saying insofar as the aspect of where the CV of Mr Giovanni came from just that aspect you would have seen from the Fundudzi Report that the findingis different.  They make a finding that the CV came from infoportal.    Yes.      Hm.  The report goes further to say inregard to Mr Giovanni that there is no evidence that he was subjected to a shortlisting, screening and vetting process as required by the department  What is your comment on that?    Well the Fundudzi Report says so.    Yes.  Well putting aside …    Yes Chair.  I – these are issues arising from the questions that were sent to Ms Brown.    She has dealt with them in her affidavit in a particular way.      For instance like I – we pointed out and she says what she has denied in her affidavit is her knowledge of Ms Kim Davids communicating with her.    But she does not deal with the fact that there is that communication.   And it is only to the extent that I am trying to bring to her attention and hear what her comment is.    Well on the Eskom work stream Chair.    In it – insofar as the composition of theEskom board is concerned and the sub-committees.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank – thank you Chair.  What – you – Ms Davids what the Fundudzi Reports ofInvestigation Report shows and this is really what one seeks to bring to your attention is that apparent from the emails exchanged with Ms Kim Davids it would appear that an outside third party outside of government, outside of SOE’s had a hand in – in influencing who gets to be appointed on committees of SOE’s.  Your comment on that?    On – on both the boards and the committees because if you tie it – if you tie this report with Mr Tsotsi’s version of and I am putting that to you not because I am saying that is what happened but I am just saying Mr Tsotsi’s version of Salim Essa’s sending him a list so you have his version and you have what you see here in the Fundudzi Report of emails exchanged betweeninfoportal and Ms Kim Davids the picture emerges that an outside person is influencing decision making of who sits on the boards and who sits on sub-committees.  Your comment?    Hm.    Yes.    Just – just bear in mind that the commission is investigating so these questions are meant to help us determine where the truth lies.  Ja.    Insofar as Ms Davids’ would have said to you the CV came from the Chairperson of Transnet can you recall who was the Chairperson of Transnet at the time?    Mabaso.  Did you confirm with her that she sent that CV?    No.    Yes.    Okay.    Let us move on.     Thank you, Chair.  And then, Ms Davids(sic) on – we see that it is not only in respect of the board and sub-committees that infoportal features but also in respect of the appointment of Mr Richard Seleke.  And that, just for reference purposes, is on page 1143 of Bundle 7.       That is correct.  Page 1143, you will see there is paragraph 14.12 which is appointment of board members at Alexkor and below that big paragraph, you have appointment of Richard Seleke at DPE.       Yes, please, we want you to tell the Chairperson.     Okay.       Can I assist you there?     Yes.  It is about the advert.  The position of DG in the DPE was advertised.  It was for the first time around.  The advert did not – or the appointment was not made and it was said that there was non-compliance with the Department of Public Services’ guidelines or requirements.  Ms Makholo testified about this as well.   MS     Yes.     H’m?     H’m.     Yes.  So ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     That is correct Chair.  This advert is of 13 – the closing date is 13 February 2015.       Then there is the second one.  If I may, Chair?     The one – the second one, the closing date is the 23 r d of September 2015.   “The requirements are a relevant degree, an appropriate postgraduate qualification will be an added advantage plus minimum ten years’ experience in relevant senior management positions preferable in the Public Sector...”That is the distinction between the two.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     It would have been an added advantage.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Brown, when we go back to this report where you talk about the CV of Mr Seleke being exchanged with Ms Kim Davids.      Yes.     H’m.     H’m.  Can you recall, when was the meeting?     I mean, which ...[intervenes]      Which year?  Which time ...[intervenes]      H’m.    Thank you.  Just to – Ms Brown, just to finish off on this, has it surprised you to see the level to which emails were being exchanged between Infoportal and Ms Kim Davids?     Yes.  Okay.  I would like to deal with, Chair, if I may …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.    Thank you.  Ms Brown, I want to deal with a slightly different aspect.  The executives that were suspended, let us look at their position.  Mr Matona had just been appointed effective 1 October 2015.  He was in that position for about five months before his suspension on 11 March – sorry, appointed 2014, I beg your pardon, 1 October 2014, about eleven months into that position he gets suspended on 11 March 2015.     About five months into his position.     I am looking at my notes, seeing the 11 March, Chairperson, sorry.  Okay, so 1 October 2014 to 11 March 2015 he gets suspended.  On the day of his suspension in the morning prior to you joining the board, Ms Brown, he was busy presenting his turnaround strategy which he reports to the board that he had shared with the Deputy President beforehand.  Why was he …[intervenes]     I have the same idea in mind, Chairperson, that we should be finished before lunchtime.     Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Brown, I did indicate I want to deal with something slightly different.  Please then turn to Eskom bundle 7, Chair.    Page 512.     Yes, it is.     For us it is (A), Chair.     It can be put away.     Are you there?     Yes.    I would like us to look at the individualpositions of the executives prior to them – or at the time that they are suspended.  You will see from paragraph 15 on page 512, this is the affidavit of Mr Dan Marokane.  He writes about himself, he explains that he became appointed in the position of DG Group Capital and the build programme with effect from 1 November 2014.  I will start with that first.     Yes.  And he goes on to talk about what he was able to achieve after being appointed permanently on this position.  I see you are smiling, Ms     In his period, he said he brought it – he brought it on line.     One week prior to his suspension.     Well, one week, he does not give a date, prior to his suspension but this, this was reported or recorded in the minutes of 11 March 2015 just before you arrived and the board says the minister would like to be invited to such events such as this because it was an important event and on that day a decision was made to have him suspended and he had been there permanently appointed for about four months.  Did you know that, Ms Brown?     Right, yes.     Yes, the statement you have made is the very point of my question to you because he makes that statement in the next paragraph that the problems that you are highlighting and referring to had nothing to do with     Yes, I think you get the point that whether it is three months or two months or in this case ultimately they got rid of them, a man who has been in the position for about four months and he says these problems predate me, I did not cause them, I am trying to resolve them.     Ja, I am not saying you are trying to get rid of him, I am saying whether he is suspended for three months or two months or one month and we know in this case they ultimately got rid of him.  The point he is making was, that I have nothing to do with the problems you have highlighted, you have in fact appointed me just for the past four months and I have been able to bring the Medupi unit on line, why are you targeting me for suspension?  That is the point I was raising with you, but you have answered it.  If you want – can I get through toMr Matona?     Okay.     Okay  Mr Matona, he is appointed on the 1 October 2014.  He comes from your department, he goes to Eskom.  He is there about five months.  The same fate befalls him as Mr Marokane.  The question is, why?     But you know …[intervenes]     Okay.  Ms Molefe, as you say, the same thing will apply to her and you have read her supplementary affidavit where she also deals with historic financial issues and what caused these financial issues but over and above that, the board, as the Chairperson hadindicated to you, was in fact – or some of the board members, were in fact not in favour of having her suspended.  Do you have any comment on that before I move on?      No, I appreciate that.     Yes.     Yes, no I appreciate in April 2014 you were not there but have reprisal – apparent reprisal isexperienced in March 2011 and thereafter and what we see – can I take it further?  She gets ultimately replaced by Mr Anoj Singh and on his watch Regiments get a contract at Eskom and ultimately Trillian, they get to be engaged at Eskom and paid huge amounts of money but under the watch of Mr Anoj Singh.     No comment on that.     Then I can – but  what we see again is that one person, that one person who seems permeate whatever is happening there, Mr Salim Essa, because you will recall also about the meeting on the 10 March 2015 that he said the executives will be suspended in the manner that it turned out to be.  But we have done that, Iam just painting this picture to you so that you can see what apparently it is an external influence bringing its muscles to bear on Eskom.Then Mr Tsotsi’s removal, if I may move there.  Now Mr Tsotsi talks about a meeting he had with you or you called him to a meeting just before the SONA in 2014.  Remember where you tell him about him interfering with management?     Yes and that if he does not stop youwill get somebody else to do his job.  I see you are smiling.     But may I ask you this, are you ...[intervenes]      Oh.     Okay, thank you Chair.     Ms Brown…[intervenes].     Ms Brown…[intervenes].     Thank you.  Ms Brown isn’t it, with respect to you, ironic that the Minister at the time, also engaged in operational matters at Eskom?     The one of the 11 t h of March with theBoard discussions about the stepping aside of the Executives and an inquiry to be conducted.     Yes, now, if we forget…[intervenes].      Yes,[intervenes].     No, I think Chair, I’ve already clarified my position on the issues.     Thank you Chair, because Mr Tsotsi has also sought to – well let me not use the word, sought, but has also explained to the Chairperson how the letter came about.  Let’s go back, you see for Mr Tsotsi what he’s striking about – what he says was your conversation with him is that, he says, on the same day, a few hours later, Mr Tony Gupta has a meeting with him and he calls him to – he calls Mr Tsotsi to his residence in Constantia and there he tells the Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi, the Chairmen, we are the ones who put you in this position and we are the ones who can take you out and he says, it was striking to him because it was a few hours after my encounter with theMinister who, for all intents and purposes, said the same thing to me, referring to himself.     Yes, I suppose that’s why he uses the phrase, for all intents and purposes.     Well, Mr Tsotsi seems to have had fallen out of favour with the Gupta’s Ms Brown.  He goes on to talk about incidents, I mean,  it doesn’t pertain to you but just to give you a picture that the Gupta’s – or Tony Gupta wanted them – wanted him to secure a contract for them at Eskom in respect of the open cycle gas turbine plant an when it transpired that there was a different company, already negotiating with Eskom in respect of a MOU, a memorandum of understanding, he says Mr Tony Gupta was very upset and he said to him that you are working with baba’s enemies, referring to Mr Jacob Zuma,you wouldn’t know about that?     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I think I can paint the picture in the end.     Ms Brown, then, I would like to move on to the removal of Mr Baloyi.  Mr Baloyi seems to have been, as I’ve mentioned to the Board members, a problematic child for them but they came to you with amatter for his removal and he – you called him and Dr Ngubane to a meeting you said they could come with the company secretary and that meeting took place in Cape Town.  His impression of the meeting was that he couldn’t present everything to you but he testified here that he walked away from the meeting on the understanding that, what he had been accused of, which was to have contact with one of the suspended Executives was not, at that stage, a rule that prohibited Board members to do so and you expressed regret that you had not laid down a rule, to say Board members should not contact the suspended Executives and he walked away understanding that, it was your intention to do so, so that in the future, contact doesn’t happen but he was surprised to receive a letter fromyou that you have accepted the Board’srecommendation to have him removed as a Director, are you able …[intervenes].     Yes, well…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Ms Brown, thank you Chair.  I hope you gave me the powers to – Ms Brown just two things, Mr Baloyi in his revised submission to you, I was going through his file yesterday, his Bundle rather, in his revised submission to you after you met – after the meeting he does say, first and foremost he wanted to apologise for arriving late,  “yesterday, 14 April 2015 at your Cape Town offices, the problem was that I did not receive the change of time from 13h00 to 12h00”,So, if you say he didn’t apologise, that’s really unlike him.     But number two, I wanted you to comment on, before your decision, on his version that he understood you to be going to lay down a rule that there should not be contact as opposed to you accepting the decision to have his membership of the Board terminated, that’s really what I wanted…[intervenes].     Okay, but…[intervenes].     Yes, no I understand what you’re saying Ms Brown, what I’m only putting to you is, his impression after having met with you, that a rule was going to be laid, that’s his impression, are you saying that impression was incorrect?    I would – okay – well I would like to deal with something else which and I want to – I want to trim it toyour particular relevance.  This has to do with Dentons investigation.   Now Dentons which is the inquiry you have said that the board should have and that inquiry was as it was decided – decided to be for three months.  Dentons was appointed onApril 2015 to do an investigation.   We have seen from the evidence that Dentons Investigation which was intended to be a deep dive as you have used those words was cut short somewhere in June 15.  So they did not do an investigation for three monthsand a presentation was made to you on the 9 t h of July 2015 which was  draft interim report of Dentons.   Dentons says on that very day they received a call from a board member saying the Minister wants the draft to be made final.   So it would seem that on that evidence you would have played a role in bringing to an end an investigation which you had wanted it to be deep dive.  According to    Now remember I do not know.  I am only telling you the version.      Okay.  Okay.  Because Dr Ngubane   Well let me also just say two things about this investigation or I might add the third one and the third    Yes.    Yes.  No I or the commission can only go according to the affidavits that are provided to it.  So that is what you see from the affidavits?   But here is another aspect relevant to you Ms Brown even before Dentons is appointed on 28 April 2015 you made an announcement on the 17 April 2015 for the secondment of Mr Molefe to Eskom with immediate effect.   And you conveyed in your press conference that even though he is seconded for three months you would actually like him to be there for twelve months.  Mr Matona is tellingus.    It is in the media – in your press conference.    Ja, no it is…    No it is a press conference.  It is – there is a video – there is YouTube …    Yes.    Yes what I am asking you is this when MrMatona was still on suspension and you were already entertaining a thought that Mr Molefe would be there for twelve months what would have been your reason for it when Mr Matona was intended to come back in three months?    It was permanent.    It was permanent.    Permanently.    It was permanently.    Were you the one…    Okay carry on.    I will...    Yes.  I will get the video – video clip foryou.  But tell me was it – was it you who came up with Mr Molefe’s name?  Was it at your initiative that he was seconded?    Yes.    Okay.    Yes they have decided who will be the next boss of Eskom.    Hm.  But remember there was a downgrade of Eskom as a result of the suspension of the executives.    Hm.    But this specific one was particularly linked to the decision in regard to the suspensions and I wonder whether it concerned you.    Ja.  But you know what – what I …    Ms Brown the secondment of Mr Singh. Mr Singh says you approached him in June 2015 to be seconded to Eskom, is that correct?    Hm.  Well let me then just conclude by showing you this and I am sure to some extent you will have been watching the evidence before the commission.   And once Mr Molefe and Mr Anoj Singh come to Eskom we see as I – I think I said this on the first day the way they deal with the transactions pertaining to the Gupta’s and that is specifically Tegeta on the one hand and on the other hand the way they deal with transactions pertaining to Regiments and later Trillian which is owned by Mr Salim Essa and Dr Eric Wood.   So it would appear from the evidence that ultimately the execu – those two executives who are moved to Eskom – seconded to Eskom ultimately appointed at Eskom wouldhave went there with a particular purpose looking at what they do immediately after they are at Eskom.   The transactions in regard to Tegeta, the terminating the cooperation agreement with Optimum Coal Mine which was owned by Glencore and there is a 30 – over R30.6 million payment to Trillian when services were rendered by a different entity Regiments.   This would have happened during your time as a Minister and I wonder whether did you observe these things taking place?  Did they come to your attention and what yourview was?    Yes.     Which ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Which phenomena are you referring to Ms Brown?     Ja.     Okay.     Okay, okay.  Thank you very much.  Chairperson, thank you.I have reached the end, Chairperson, of my questioning.     [laughs]     There are, obviously, aspects that the board says about the Minister which accrued, as the Chairperson had suggested, raised them(?) of the Ministerto obtain her affidavit on that.     Ja.     Yes, let me do that.     Ja, Mr Singh ...[intervenes]      No.     Mr Singh says the Minister approached him.    And asked him, whether he will be seconded.  Or...  But you are talking, Chairperson, about ...[intervenes]      No, there was not.     Ja. [Parties intervening each other – unclear.]     There was no process.     But I wanted to say, Chairperson.     The MOI over and above the guidelines, actually requires a shortlist to be made to the Minister.     Ja.     Yes.     So that is clause – under Clause 13.3     Chair, ja, shall I...?     If I have anything to add I can add to your list.     Yes, yes.     Yes, just two points.     That is the evidence.     Thank you, Chair. 
MS BROWN:  Good morning Chair    Good morning Sir.    Okay.    That is fine.    Yes I am aware of it.   Yes I have answered the questions and I also put in an affidavit on that matter.    I – I said that in my affidavit yes.    My comment on any emails received by Ms Davids would have to go to the Legal and Governance Unit.  So she would not set – she would not send the emails to me she will send it directly to the Legal and Governance Unit.  And the Legal and Governance Unit will then sift through those emails.Now we have had many walk-ins and people phoning to say can we apply and all I have ever – well personally I said just contact number on the – the advert or contact my office.    Yes.    Is that 1140?    Yes.  Maybe we should contact the infoportal – ja I am here.    Yes.    Hm.      And Miriam Cassiem and Leonardi Giovanne is included there.    There was a fellow – the Giovanni issue I remember quite clearly.  When she said how would you feel about having a foreign person on the board?  So I said no well it is not excluded.   And I for all intents and purpose thought that CV was given to her by the Chair of Transnet and even though it was given to her by the Chair of Transnet it is had to go through the process of Legal and Governance.   And so in my mind her bringing me that board I do not remember Miriam Cassiem in that – in the way you putting it as if Miriam Cassiem and Leonardi Giovanni werebrought at the same time.  But I do remember that Leonardi Giovanni was an Electrical Engineering with International experience which – which I was very happy with.  But I do not remember her bringing me a list of any – anybody.  Because I do not really take a page from anyone.   You have got to bring me a decision memo then that is the only time I actually really consider it.  You must – as I said to you before I – I firstly let me also just say I do not know who infoportal is.   When I – when I heard about infoportal and at some point it was linked to my former DG I went to him and I asked him is infoportal your address and he said no.  I never considered that anybody else was having any contact with infoportal or portal at the time.   And for – I cannot remember much about the Fundudzi Report because they asked me a number of questions and the answers I gave them to the questions were that I did not know which names and who – I mean because they – they mention particular names of particular incidents and I do not re – I do not have any knowledge of that.      Because that is the one CV she did bring to me and she told – Ms Davids told me that the Chairperson of Transnet her name escapes me now – Mabaso – Ms Mabaso gave her – gave her that email.    Well from the Fundudzi Report I saw post my departure from the department I did not see the FundudziReport before that.  In fact I did not – when I read through the report the fact that it was not a signed off report, the fact that it – the report made assumptions based on – a whole number of assumptions without asking me specifically about those because they had access to me.  They sent me a list of questions and I answered the list of questions and that was the first time that I saw infoportal within my – my ministry.    It was the first time that I actually saw it.    I did not know that.    I – the Fundudzi Report was quite a long report and I must be very frank when I did not see a – a signature on the report I did not – I did not read the detail of the report I looked for my stuff and I responded to my stuff in your affidavit I put to you.    Oh I – it is untrue.  Unless the department said that they did not feel that they should vet – no not vetting but in my mind I believe that everybody who goes through the process gets vetted because I get a decision memo that says the following people this has happened – you know they have been vetted and these are the people who will go through the process.   I have to say that the only ever time where somebody was not vetted before they were appointed was when I appointed the 2018 board.  Prior to that the decision memo did not bring me a list of people who werenot vetted or they did not tell me that those people were not vetted.   And people were vetted to such an extent that there were really good candidates who had and I remember this one very well without remembering the person’s name who had car fines – speeding fines outstanding and they could not get onto the board.  So I am – I am – I do not believe that they were not vetted unless somebody says so.    Well I do not know if I – look I think theFundudzi Report is an interesting report.  It makes a whole rank of assumptions without actually giving factual information about it.  I am – I must be – I did not think I was reading the Fundudzi Report this morning because I would have prepared differently for it but just off the top of my head it intended – the Fundudzi Report makes assumptions like the emails they say this email went to Kim Davids from this number and therefore the Minister was supposed to know that.      Okay    That is not – I do not mind answering the questions Chair.    Because I have put it in the affidavit.    The issue is that today in my mind.    We would probably end off somewhere with the suspension of the executives even though I think I have clarified the matter.    The removal of Tsotsi.    And the Baloyi.  The secondment of Molefe and Anoj Singh.    And then being questioned on the affidavits.    Now in my mind the affidavit is the – the supplementary affidavit.    That I have to answer on.    And where issues arising from it.  I do not mind answering the questions.    As long as Mr Seleka accepts my answer to the questions as well.    Perfect.    Yes.    You mean – you mean on board or do you mean on committees?    My – as I told you before unless proven differently.    By yourself Mr Seleka – Advocate Seleka unless proven differently my recollection of what happens in the appointment of boards is very simple.Now for some odd reason somebody said that they had a data base and – and I am – I am taking you through so that I can answer your questions.  They had a data base but I insisted that the data base must be opened.  Now I would only know that the data base can be reopened if I knew that that was something that was viably possible.So the data base is – rarely gets opened because I try to work it why you were asking the question you were asking me yesterday or the day before.And so whatever CV even if it comes from the President that CV still has to go through to the Legal and Governance Unit.  The Legal and Governance Unit looks at it.  It then has a separate body – a separate company vetting all of the candidates and the list of people whoeventually come to me are all part of the list.    And they then become part of the list.  So it does not matter who sends the email or sends the CV or sends the name the issue is it has to go through the Legal and Governance Unit.   Not once did the Legal and Governance Unit tell me that they did not vet anyone.  It was one day in 2018 that I phoned the Legal and Governance Unit person Ms Ruthman and I said to her we are adding these three names becausethat came from another meeting with the President and Deputy President.  That was the only time ever I processed the board without it being vetted before by the – by the Legal and Governance Unit.So in my mind the Legal and Governance Unit has almost the final say on it.    Yes.    I said Ms Mabaso.   No.    I did not at all because Chair Mr – Advocate Seleka.    The point is those CV’s had to go through a process it did not matter who the people were.  The still had to go through the Legal and Governance Unit process.   And this process took a long time that is what is – what I – nobody – nobody in my four years as a Minister came and told me that they were some – what you telling me today that Giovanni Leonardi – Leonardi Giovanni was not vetted or did not go through the process.    Yes.     That is correct.     I am not sure if everybody who comes through the process...  Look, Chair, I am not meaning – I am not meaning to demean any profession but people who are hairdressers also applied.     So very often they were not...  This is my assumption ...[intervenes]      Do not...  They go beyond what criteria has been set up ...[intervenes]      by...  I signed off on the criteria.     So I signed off on the criteria.  There are thousands and thousands of people who come.  If mymemory serves me well, too, Chair.  I also remember them saying that the database is old and stale.  That it is people – and that other ministers before me have also advertised.  So the advertising, I also got to know about in the department but that just on the side.  So the people who had been vetted, I think and I really do think they would only be the people who actually met the criteria for any of the six or that were in my ...[intervenes]      Yes, in my portfolio.    Yes.     Yes, that is true.     Yes.     Absolutely.     Absolutely, Chair.     Is that the bundle we are still on?     It is actually quite totally, I have to say to you that – because I – if you would like me to, I can tellyou how Richard Seleke was appointed.     So Fundu – that Fundudzi report say that I – and I think that – I cannot remember but they say I postponed two meetings until Richard Seleke’s CV arrives.     And I mean ...[intervenes]      You can correct me saying the wrong –because I have not read it for a while.     ...besides who was there.     There was a meeting on a Friday, late afternoon, and the composition of the people who make theappointment, they are two Ministers, your Deputy Minister, a DG and the full complement of the HR Department.  On that Friday, the Ministers who were supposed to come, did not attend.  So I postponed the meeting and it was actually only one meeting that I postponed.  They say I postponed two meetings until the third meeting.  My preferred choice as DG was the person who was acting DG.  He worked very closely with me.  He was, I thought, was very close to understanding the issues around state-owned companies in the way that Iunderstood.  So she was my preferred choice.  However, she fell out of the first advert that was placed because she did not meet all the criteria.  And if my memory serves me well, then the criteria that she did not meet was that she still had to do a module or two modules.  I do not know how many modules but she still had to do a module.      So I do not know whose email address that it.  You must remember, I said earlier, that I asked him     I cannot actually remember Chair but I think that you had to have at least a probably a ...[intervenes]      A post degree.      You know, I think – it was quite – it is quite a high-end job and so you had to have a post ...[intervenes]      ...maybe not ...[intervenes]      ...a speculation – speculating on what I think.     This is just what I think would be.[Parties inventing each other – unclear.]     It does not but it could have mean.  I mean, I do not see why it should change.       But it could be that we had so few applicants who actually – and I remember I have had actually in DG and the Public Services Commissioner was on my back on this one, that after a year, I mean, she should be appointed but then she does not have the requisite qualification for it.  So in some respects, and I know that the candidates may – the person involved actually spoke quite much about it.  And so, I did not realise that she was hurt to such an extent by the fact that she did not make it.  But let me get back to the qualifications.  I do not actually have a recollection of that but I am kind of thinking that it mightbe that we were not able to have – we are not getting the requisite people to apply.  So a post grade would be of benefit – would be beneficial and but the, you know, a degree is what we are expecting from you.  So that might be so but I cannot – I really cannot – I cannot say that I can stand on my head here and tell you that this is my – this is just my view.       No, I do not think so Chair.       I think, if my memory serves me well andyou know, I would really like – I am saying my memory must serve me well, but I think she was also in the Public Service for eight years and not ten.  I think if I faltered in anything is that I wrote – I – if I were to have a hand in writing that second advert, then – because the Seleke has a post grade.     But if I had a hand in – I could have said    ...advert but I – I must tell you, honest, she was my preferred candidate.  I still think she is one of the best people who understands state-owned companies.  And so I still think that but I think she did not qualify for it.  And then the other fellow.  Within that meeting that we were in with the two Ministers, the DG and so on, Seleke actually performed much better than the other candidate and a number of issues but, I mean, just on that alone.       I do not know.  I received a request from Mr Seleke himself and it asked if he could have a word – if he could speak to me about it and I took off a long, you know...  I do not know if an official, an advisor to have a conversation with me.  I did not get that – all that stuff that you are speaking about now.     I received a letter from him.  Well, not a letter.  Yes, a letter, actually from him, asking to meet with me.     I took it all – it took a long before I did because there were lots and lots of requests like that and other requests but I did eventually meet him.  And it was out of my head until the issue came to me having toappoint candidates for – or having to approve candidates for the appointment of DG.     Oh, I ...[intervenes]      I do not ...[intervenes]      I cannot tell you.  It is 2015.     I am sure it is in 2015 somewhere.  That is at least six years ago.     And it was a very short meeting     I met him, had a coffee, said to him please, put in your CV.  You know, you sound fantastic.  With any – what I will say to anybody else as well.     Put in your CV and then I had forgotten about it until I saw it in the questions of Fundudzi.     Yes, I think that could be the reason.     I think that is the logical – for me that would be a logical explanation.     I might not and he might not have a     But some of the people I meet and I call them into the office.  Numerous meetings happened in my office.       But I remember that he – he came downstairs and could not get into the building for some odd reason and I said just meet me at the coffee shop.  I am walking down.     And I did that.     I think that is what I did because it is a long time ago.     But I did not go alone.     I, actually, went with – I think with an advisor because it was in Cape Town.  So my officials at that time were not necessarily in Cape Town with me.  So I went with an advisor.     Yes.     But not the central part of the discussion.  The central part of the discussion, I – and that is why I am saying to you that it probably led to that.     And I say    But I agree...  Chair, I am agreeing with you.     Yes.  Yes, it was something like that.  It was     No, I do remember that I liked the idea that he was a development...  I do remember this veryspecifically.     That he was a developmental expert in the area of Land and Agriculture and so forth and that he managed big companies.Not big companies, big parastatals.  So I remember that part of it and talking a bit about the economy and so on but, you know, that could have also been in the conversation that we actually had.     I do not know, Chair, it was a long time ago.     I think it makes sense.    I cannot tell you that that is my actual answer but it makes sense that it could have been like that.  It was not for the first adverts.       I am always very unsure why you want toask whether I – the emotional part of the question but I was very surprised.     No, it does surprise me, Chair.     That is part of the dilemma I have, Chair, part of dilemma I have and, you know, at one state when the Fundudzi report came out – or not – I never saw it until the Commission gave it to me.  The Department of Public Enterprises Minister set up this investigation when he was Finance Minister into the Department of Public Enterprises. So it did not bother me at all that there was this investigation and then there were all these questions and I sat down and the late Simmy Lebala was my advocate and he said to me do you want help with it?  I said no, I can answer these questions myself and I said – in about twenty minutes I sent him all the answers and then he said look, I have got to put it into a particular format and so on.Around the time when I received it from the Commission as a fixed report, I actually wanted to take the matter on review, now because – mostly because it makes so many assumptions based on particular wording or a particular this or that and it kind of also used the newspaper stuff as ways of getting it.  So I was – I must be honest with you, my lawyers then said to me we will hold back the Commission because then they still have to ruleon that and I did not think – I actually did not think too much about it, I thought well, the Commissioner will see, you will see that it has not been a signed document and so on and then they will make a decision about how, how it will be dealt with.  So, in some respects, there is a part of me that wish I did take it on review.  At other respects, yes of course I am surprised, I am shocked about some things and so on, if it is true, but that is just the point I wanted to make about the Fundudzi report because the Fundudzireport goes further to say that I gave some land to somebody who – and then I sent a CV of somebody’s to UWC.  They go further to say all those kind of things and I, you know, frankly, did I commit fraud, corruption in it?  No. I think it is just to nothing else but to put – did I give land – did I give Transnet land to anyone?  No, I did not.  So I feel like that about it but I am in your hands with it and I am happy to answer the questions that you ask and I think it is important to get to the bottom of all these things.Yes, no, no, no, that is fine, as you hear I said if it is true because some of the things we – the Commission needs to look into much more deeper to see what the facts are then take it from there.  Okay.     Where are you on?  Sorry, Advocate Seleka, I do not know where you are now.  We were just on one thing and you have moved to something else, can you send me to the page you are on?     Or are we just going to jump around?     Because I would like to go for – Chair, I would like a two minute break.     Just a two minute break quickly.  I had too much water.     Oh, okay.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.     Is that on mine as well?     Good day, Advocate Seleka.     I am.     I am trying to sit so that I can be – my family is telling me I am not sitting in the middle and so on and my hair is not good and so on, but so be it.  Okay, am I right now?     But you do not have, Chair, so you do not know the problems we have with hair.  Sorry.     And the build programme?     Can I ask you, Advocate, are you saying that Medupi – I am just trying to find it, that Medupi unit 1 came on line in his period or you are saying that it came on line after his period?     Oh.     Okay, so that – he brought it online on the 7 t h.    Well, the only thing I do know, Sir, is that I went to what is called the synchronisation of the Medupi Unit 1 about – I think it was in 2016 and synchronisation does not mean that you get megawatts out of it yet, synchronisation only means that you are starting to pump it up so that in about six months time it will become a fullyfunctioning unit and I am doing something that seems quite academic because in essence I did not make the decision to suspend four executives.   I attended what I call an informal meeting and I told him what my problems were and let me tell you, Sir, that Medupi and Kusile, they were – the start of their build programme was 2007 with cost overruns that now is now creeping up to R100 billion, nothing to do with Mr Dan Marokane but we were running behind time, we were – Eskom was spending fortunes on it.  So they had both costoverruns as well as build overruns.  So nothing was coming on line.So we did not have 4 800 megawatts to add to – I cannot remember the words anymore, but to add to Eskom’s disposable electricity.   I do not know, that was my problem.  My problem was in fact that the build programme was way too late, it was costing way too much.  It was over R100 billion already and since 2009 it is still not where it is supposed to be.  It is not even being synchronised yet.     And I am saying that it is an issue - comment that I making to you but that area was an area that – it did not matter who the person was, the area was an area that I felt could have curtailed our load sheddings if only we had that plant online already.    But I told you before, Advocate Seleka, I wanted the inquiry because that is exactly the question that I wanted answered, I mean, the build programme question.  That is why I supported the inquiry.  Whether the executives remained for three months or not, remember it was a three month step aside, it was not – and a step aside, it was not a firing of them, it was a three months stepping aside.  So, ja, I will leave it there.  I am verylongwinded, I also want to go at lunchtime.     Yes, but Advocate Seleka – and I do not want to be argumentative now …[intervenes]     You said they got rid of him.     Oh, sorry, Chair.     Very shortly, Chair.  I think your use of the words ultimately, and you are not saying I did, you are saying ultimately they got rid of him.  Now I am not sure what the process is between – was between the board and the suspended executives.  Remember I wrote that letter tothem because I did not know what the process was.  So in a way you are asking me a question that I think – ja, I think it is a bit of an unfair question, but I am answering your questions, Advocate Seleka.     The answer to your question is it was a three month suspension.  It was not firing him.  I think Mr Matona went to the Labour Court and then the Labour Court sent him to the CCMA and I do not  - I cannot remember the detail but eventually he took the option of getting out.     My issue remains, my issue, whether you raise any of the other people’s names, my issue remains.  By December 2015 I actually read this morning in the early hours that we did not even have diesel to keep the lights on.  There was chaos in government.  So you are saying that all of them were doing their jobs and actually they were all putting in place the processes that were going to give us less load shedding.  If you look at the speech that I made in the house, I made the same speech that the now Acting CE – or I think he is the CE Eskom made that wewill have load shedding for five years, people were suing me because I said they were going to have load shedding for five years.  We did not see light at the end of the tunnel and for some reason I think the Commission is not understanding that. The Commission is not understanding that - you know, people and they rightly so, I did not go out because people were saying we bought generators because you said we are going to have load shedding for the next five years.  Where did I get that information from?  From Eskom executives.  So I did not see a way clear, I did not see a way clear, I did not want them to go, I just wanted an unadulterated inquiry and at the end of that enquiry we will know what we should do because even though Mr Matona makes the point to all of you, to the Commission, he makesthe point to the Labour Court, he makes the point everywhere that he had a plan.  The only thing I know is that the answer to his plan that we should be the R23 billion from National Treasury and that was going to take a long time still.There was opposition in government to giving Eskom or bailing Eskom out.  There was opposition in the public sphere to giving Eskom or bailing Eskom out.  And who was the face of that Eskom?  Me.  So I had to find a solution and I found that nobody had a plan.  The war roomwas going to do a technical investigation.  Nobody is going to fix load shedding, nobody is going to fix the fact that Eskom cannot pay its workers.  That is what I wanted to have fixed.So, I mean, I hear what you are saying about Mr Dan Marokane and when I have a bit more time or when I have – when all of this is done, I will read through all of it but there could have been a plan.  I only went to launch the synchronisation – and it takes six months after Medupi is – unit 1 is synchronised before it actually comes on line and then it does not come on line with a large amount of megawatts, it comes online slowly, these are huge plants.  I have never seen such huge plants in my life, but they come on line slowly, so it is still not going to help us with load shedding and all of those executives were there for allthe period of load shedding.  I did not mind either way whether the board, the executives remained or whether they went.  I said this yesterday as well.  I wanted to know what we were going to do, what must happen for us to get out of this position.     No, I have said everything I wanted to say about the executives.  The removal of Mr Tsotsi – but before I do that, let me tell you what Ms Molefe believes.  She was appointed in January 2014 as the FD, the CFO of Eskom.  She was 14 months into the job when she got suspended.  In that year 2014, around April, she was told that the corporate plan, funding plan she was presenting to the board was no robust enough and Mr Colin Matjila said I will get somebody to help Eskom and lo and behold, that person was Mr Salim Essa and Mr Salim Essa said I will give you Regiments to do the job for you.  Regimentsteams up with McKinsey when they were asked whether they – when Regiments was asked whether they have the capacity to provide the job.   They were asked to provide a proposal within five days as per their undertaking, they did not do so, they gave a proposed agreement after 14 days.  She refused to sign that agreement and she went into loggerheads with Mr Matjila, to some extent the board defended her but Regiments was still appointed but only to do a high level desktop exercise.She thinks because of her refusal to sign that agreement for Regiments she must have been targeted by Mr Salim Essa and ultimately removed from her position.  You …[intervenes]      I was not there in April 2014 so I do not know and, I mean, you know, I feel lots of things, it does not mean it is true.  I think it must all be tested.  I really think all of this must be tested because I was not there in April 2014, I actually only came in May 2014, in fact at the end of May, the 26 May 2014.     So I do not know about it.  You know, I also feel people are attacking me and dong things to me and so on but I have to test it, I have got to report it somewhere, I have got to tell people this is happening, I have to have itinvestigated.  If I have money, I must take it to court.  We all have to test this.  I do not know.     I am very sorry, I cannot answer – because Regiments is the frontrunner to Trillian and I got very badly burnt by that one when I was supposed to have inadvertently lied to parliament.  So I do not know, I was not there.     I do not have a view on that.     I think it something that must be tested.     Yes, I do remember.     I smile because I think it is absolute nonsense.  Chair, I am smiling at – I am trying to get it on my – because I have been writing on my page because I am absolutely astounded that Mr Tsotsi over such a long period of time actually without a recorder, without taking a recording of my words and he puts it in inverted commas as exact words that I used.  I have told you that we did not have an easy relationship.  I do not think I had easy relationships with a lot of people.  I am very forthright and so – and it is not always very easy to accept.     I have the page Chair, and I see that Mr Tsotsi says that I tell him that we’re going to part ways and that he must do his job otherwise “I’ll replace him with somebody else”, absolute direct words that he says I said,I absolutely deny that I don’t think anyone should be threatened verbally with their job, I think that is a process that has to happen.  If there’s any relationship breakdown between the person in charge and some – the person that accounts to them, there should be – so, I absolutely deny that.  The issue about that weekend, it was the day before SONA, the issue is that I ticked him off for interfering in an operational matter.  Now, I don’t care who wrote the letter the letter does not belong in the non-Executive Committees Division and the Chair for that matter and I make a mistake in my – because it was a very vague issue for me but it was Mr Matona, and that’s  why I took it up with him, because – I took it up with him because the CE came to me and told me, look at this letter, this is the letter Mr Tsotsi has written and many of these things happen all the time.I think the South African public should be grateful that I don’t want the non-Executive Directors to be interfering in an operational matter especially procurement and of course there’s lot of explanations as to why he did it, but the point is, that must not happen.  You don’t procure as – in your personal capacity in that way.     So that was the argument I had with him.     I called him to that meeting, Chair, because just before he was in – before I called him, I knew they were all up in Cape Town because it was SONA.  So, I called him after Mr Matona brought me the letter – and I know one thing for sure, that it was a Japanese company, 2, it’s not buying oil or fuel, it was parts, I mean, that’s an incorrect issue there and then Mr Matona said that was the specific issue that he raised with me and I – but I thinkthis thing with Mr Tsotsi and I came a little bit earlier already because the Directors of the State owned companies are – and the Chairs are not Executive Chairs, so they’re not allowed excess or excessive use of resources.  So, you might have a….[intervenes].     It did.     Only the first – the other difference is that you can’t put mine in inverted commas because mine is not verbatim, his is verbatim.     In which operational matters?     Yes, but I said to the Board, the Board – nobody has given you a verbatim report from all the Board members that says that I did not – I said I’m not allowed to instruct you to do anything, but I would like the inquiry to happen, they could have said no I don’t want to do it.  I did not get involved in procurement matters, it’s very different.     I served – it is a very, very different matter. If I said, go and give the building of Madupi Unit 6 to the Jackson Fives, that would be a direct operational interference in – I was assigned to get the company out of its mess.     I couldn’t be saying the same things to him, because remember he – what he says I said was actually verbatim, in fact, he has it in inverted commas, quotation marks because he says, that’s what I said to him which is very different to what he says the Gupta’s told him.     Well, and I use the phrase for, if you areusing my verbatim comments, then somebody else had to use my verbatim comments for it to be, for all intents and purposes, the same.  That’s my only comment to you, I also don’t know – how do I know we went there, I don’t know Chair, I can’t help you with that, I would like to help the Commission where I can but I can’t help on something that – it’s so vague and so – I mean, I think I’m a little younger than Mr Tsotsi but maybe we’re the same age but I don’t think I would ever remember anything anyone said verbatim seven years ago, so – ja…[intervenes].     Maybe you can Chair?     No.     I was very excited to have Mr Baloyi onboard because my officials told me that – because I was always lobbied by the union members to have the union representative but there are so many unions but – and there’s been an experience of having unions on the Board and for some – I’m not going to say it didn’t work but my officials were saying it’s not something that we could do.  So, I was always very excited to have Mr Baloyi onboard,even though he was representing a union, any specific union, he was a union member which means, in the same way that I have businesspeople I also have union members – union people in.  So, I can’t – I didn’t listen to Mr Baloyi’s testimony at all, but I remember writing to him that I was removing him in terms of Section 78(2) and that was of the Companies Act.  That he may not use his position to obtain information to knowingly cause harm to the company, that’s what I remember.  I also remember – because I think it’s the people in governance committee, they – and I might be – well let me just stick to what I know absolutely.  I wrote him a letter where – and I don’t – and I only have this letter on my own documents because he didn’t write directly to me, he wrote to the staff and threatened them and all sorts of stuff, but I wrote to him, Isaid, following my decision I have – I’ll send this to the Commission as well,  “I have been receiving electronic emails from you on a daily basis demanding that I reconsider my decision. I am concerned that the content of the electronic mail also appears to be a threatening action by yourself.  Emphatically I wish to state that my decision to remove you from Eskom Board of Directors was exercised within the ambit of my powers in terms of the MOI read together with theCompanies Act of 2008 and it is final”,And then I skip, and I say, “You are at liberty to pursue whatever legal avenues open to you.  More importantly I must remind you that you remain bound by the confidentiality required in terms of Section 76(2) of the Companies Act”.I had to reiterate, I actually gave Mr Baloyi an opportunity to come and speak to me and I had my officials present, I had the legal department present, I had Dr Ben and I said he’s supposed to bring some committee, I can’t remember, I think there were two or three Board members present as well.  Mr Baloyi made us wait three hours, I cancelled meetings for other people’s appointments so that I could see Mr Baloyi because I thought I should give himan opportunity to redeem himself and after three hours of waiting he arrives, no apology, and when the officials put the issues to him and he argues about it and they argue and so on and eventually he says he’s taking us all to court, he was very threatening and I thought, maybe it is – it’s not the side issue but I have so much – we had, as a company and as officials and as – we have so much on our plates, I just thought, you know, I used my Executive authority to get rid of Mr Baloyi to just agree with the Board and say, yes, it’s fine we’ll not have Mr Baloyi on theBoard.  Now, I might not have done – it might not have been the right thing to do, and I mean, the Chair will adjudicate that, but I did give – I feel I gave Mr Baloyi – I spoke with him on the telephone because my officials refused to write letters to Mr Baloyi because Mr Baloyi was just so – it was so difficult, he wrote every day.  So, I – that’s what I did.     I’m sure.     There is a MOI and there’s a Companies Act and both of it says, that you are not to distribute confidential matters that will bring the company into disrepute and maybe, I wanted to add, another harsher word in it, but that’s – I don’t think it’s true and whether he arrived an hour late, I mean, he still – he arrived threehours late, I cancelled three meetings.  I don’t have a meeting an hour – I don’t have three meetings in one hour.     And so, it’s his view it’s my view, I have a different view on it, but I don’t know – ja I’m – I don’t understand why he says I have to have a new – anything new that I add in.  I already have a Companies Act, I have the MOI it talks to matters of confidentiality it says that even after you are, as Board member, you have to retain that confidentiality.  You can’t speak out of a Boarddecision there’s a majority decision that get’s taken in the Board, that doesn’t mean you can go and negotiate other matters with other people outside unless we all – I mean it will just be chaos.     I don’t know, I mean I don’t think I need another impression other than the Companies Act and the MOI and I think everybody needs to behave in a congenial way so that the Board can function.    I – why would I even say they must finalise the report?    Yes I do not know that – I do not know that version either.  They had three months in which to do the report.  They presented to me on the 9t h of July and other than – no I do not know.  I actually do not know Chair.    Yes but Dr Ngubane in his statement also says that by the time he left 16 of the 18 areas were covered.  I mean I do not think – you know Chair I do not think the investigation would have – and I am really talking off the top of my head now.   I do not think the investigation would have been any different.  I think what the investigation did was to narrow down what – what was supposed to be happening in Eskomwhich was not happening for the past couple of years.   And I think that is what the investigation did.  It actually narrowed it down – it – I means because out of that 9t h of July meeting the board had a responsibility to have oversight over all – I think it was 18 or 20 indicators I am not sure but all those indicators that they set out the board to have monthly indicators that they could check against and a committee – I am not sure if it is the build committee or what who check it on a weekly basis.   So they had like a dashboard to check what theoutcome is.  The point is lots of people say the Minister made me do it.  I have had lots of people saying you have got to do this because the Minister said so.  And where I know who it is I can take action; where I do not know who it is I cannot take action.     No I do not have a comment on that.  I think it is a picture emerging in a head – someone’s head but I do not have a – I mean you telling me that I approved a – a report an inquiry wanted an inquiry even, approved an inquiry.   I knew there was no money I can say that up – I knew there was no money and I said please find ways to reprioritise.  I also know that Eskom like all the other stateowned companies for a bottle of 500 ml water where we pay R6.00 or R4.00 they would pay R30.00 or R35.00.  So I said go and find ways to – to get the money.   But what you are saying is a view that you hold or you coming to a conclusion that that is what it is.  I do not think that that is so.  I think we actually – I mean the board is actually holding the Dentons indicators accountable the KPI’s accountable to – to themselves and to the executives.  So it – I do not hold that view but I – I am not – maybe you have read something somewhere else and you have pieced together this whole story but it is not a very – it is not a dissimilar story to the one I hear in the public domain.  I must be very frank with you about that.      It is not a dissimilar story.   Did I say that – did I say that publicly or did I say that in the press statement?    Release    Is it in the media release?    So I say that?    Oh I must just be my run of mouth.  But yes I – what are you asking me Advocate?    I – it might have been – you know there was a lot of excitement around Mr – firstly let me say why I appointed Mr Molefe on the 17 t h – I made the press statement on the 17t h because by that time the executives already told me that there has been a negotiation with Mr Matona and that it – it looks like he is hovering on staying orgoing.  I – so there was nothing clarified.   After three months and in the meantime we had Mr Khoza standing in and that was not going so well.  I mean Mr Khoza cannot be expected to do the job of a CE but he was standing in and he was doing an excellent job standing in.  So I also heard someone say that they did not know what the meeting was about that they had to go to but I had a meeting between the two Chairs of Transnet and Eskom.   And I would never – I will take legal opinion to see whether it is possible to move for three – to second for three months somebody from one state owned company to another.  It has happened before and it has happened afterwards.  Having said that after three months appointment the board wanted me to appoint Mr Molefe for twelve months.  I said no.  When they wanted a permanency already I said no.  Because he has only been there for three months, he is only supposed to be there for three months.  There has got to be a much better re – and the point is the markets applauded, the public applauded, the media applauded it was the one good thing that I did in many, many years.   So – and I think it is in that space that I probably said oh I mean I do not know where – I do not know if I said it in a press statement I did not see it in the press statement but I could have said oh maybe he stays for twelve months.  But when I was in the formal setting where the board writes to me and asks me to appoint Mr Molefe for – I cannot remember if they wanted to appoint him permanently or not I think it might be something you should ask the investigators to look at.      But I do –     I do remember.    That I said – sorry.    Yes I said now he must wait – like every other person they – it should not happen yet.  They should give Mr Molefe six months and I – and six months was just off thetop of my head because I was just thinking that look give him six months then give him another three months and then let us see how it will – works out.  Within the six months of Mr Molefe coming in I cannot remember by which month but by August the company already turned around in terms of load shedding – in terms of staff morale.   I mean I visited a couple of festival of maintenance gatherings that Mr Molefe had it was just everyone at Eskom helping with maintenance on weekends, overnight, during – you know it was just – there was just an incredible energywithin the company.   So no I did not want to appoint him for twelve months I said it in a – I said it – it was an off the cuff comment that I made.    And …    And I am only – I am only saying it is an off the cuff comment that I made because you telling me that I have made that comment.  Because it is not a comment that I would naturally – I mean …    I do naturally – I do make comments.  I do make side comments all the time.      When he was seconded to Eskom?    No I did not actually know Mr Molefe.  I think it was in – there was – there was an occasion where I went to the Presidency and there was real issue with the fact – and I mean with the fact that we were still having load shedding and that the possibility of us going into darkness – noblackouts which would kill the economy and will take too long a period for the economy to be – to be rebuilt.   And there seemed to be a very serious exercise that has been done that I had – I could – I had access to.  Now I am not sure if it is an intelligence exercise that was done but Gauteng was going to go into blackout and that I should act on it.   And the one thing I could not act on that was with the – a non-executive director being in charge.  And I think in my conversation with the President and I could have said it the President could have said it, I do not know but Mr Molefe’s name came up.    Now I have heard you say to other people that some man called Mr Herb said that Salim Essa said that Mr…    Yes I heard that so why would I then go and appoint Mr Matona.  I am a new Minister I thought about this a lot.  I am a new Minister, I was going to lose my DG, I have never been a Minister – a National Minister before, I was going to lose my DG, why would I appoint him if I was only listening to some instructions that some strange people concoct things outside of Eskom?  Why do I not just appointhim, Mr Molefe in the first instance and not appoint Mr Matona?    And keep with my Matona in as a DG.    Because I did not – because I did not listen in the first place?   Well nobody told me in the first place.  So anyway but that – that is how it happened.    And then of course I spoke with the DeputyPresident at the time the President today on the telephone and I remember the conversation because we were throwing a lot of names – lots of other people as well.   And then the one person that was the same as the Deputy President and the President was Mr Molefe and I then went to a function of Transnet and I am – Mr Molefe says it and it jogged my memory.  I remember that I used to go to all Transnet’s functions and it jogged my memory and Mr Molefe said it and I – and I thought oh that is actually a viable option – a viable position and I then said – I askedhim if he would be willing to be seconded to Eskom.   Chair if there was anything that I did right in that period of my life in the public space I mean even my family hated me for load shedding.  Nobody believed – everybody believed that I was the person who was shedding the load. So that was actually – for all intents and purposes it was a very positive stance that I took that day and people were very – the markets were rejoicing.  There was an upsurge in the markets on that day with Mr Molefe.  So that is the only thing I can say.    Yes and there was a downgrade of Eskom just a few months before that as well.   So there – Eskom had many downgrades and many downgrades after that.  In fact I am not sure – maybe I should not express myself on it but I think they still have downgrades.    It did.  A downgrade always concerns me because every downgrade means that the bonds that Eskomsells are much, much – it is a – it becomes of less and less value and the company itself become of less and less value.    And I do not want to start a conspiracy theory.  I do not want to you know and then this one did that and that but I also a conspiracy theory around it.  I may be write you down and then the Chair his last moments I – he – of writing the report he will see my conspiracy theory.    You know I – no I do not think Mr Singh’s right with that.  I think I got a board meeting – a board memo because I knew of Mr Molefe I did not know Mr Singh really.  But the board sent me – and I am almost absolutely certainof this the board sent me a letter requesting the – Mr Singh to be seconded and giving it to my DDG of Energy and the DDG of Transport and they were coming back with a memo saying that it is – would be a right kind of decision to make. But I – I approved that decision but I did not make the – I really did not make – I did not say Mr Singh please come and help us.  I said – I said – I went to speak to Mr Molefe and said he must come and help.   So I am not sure if Mr Singh or who said that but that is not – I did not.  I might have spoken with him and said youknow something about finances and so but I do not think I – I do not – I did not actually ask him to come over.      No it did not come to my attention because it was not a section – a PFMA Section 54 Application to me.  A lot of it came out in the media, a couple of months after the process.  But let me – let me put something to you.    Advocate Seleka – Chair you see I understood that Glencore sold Optimum Mine to the Gupta’s and that was a direct sale of the company.  In my mind, Glencore was pushing for a higher amount.  Now I do not care of the amount of coal anywhere.  I care that when you increase Glencore’s coal price, who pay for that increase?  Even though Eskom pays for it through NERSA the general public pays the higher cost of coal.  That is my lay person’s understanding of it.  So Tegeta charges at the beginning R150 per coal – per ton of coal or R100.  I cannot remember what they charged but they were under R 200 per ton of coal.  So I do not...I see it in the newspaper and I...  Look, in this country of factions and connecting dots and all of that.  Other people connect dots differently.  Some people connect dots one way.  Other people connect dots in another way.So I was very happy that the price that will bepassed through to our people – to people in our – the citizens of South Africa will be lower than what it would have been if it was increasing to R 540 per ton.  So that is on the one hand.On the other hand I also hold a view that if there is any wrongdoing and I - after almost negotiating with the SIU for six to seven months because the issue of procurement in Eskom is a very complex matter and so is the issue of procurement in Transnet and Denel and it was...I will always be struck by the fact that I negotiated with the SIU for almost seven months because they did not want to include any of the cost loss mines.  They only wanted to deal where there are issues that were in the present environment.  And I do not know why but it is – it must be interesting and maybe it becomes some students’ doctoral dissertation one day because not everyone wants to look at the total picture of coal.  I mean, nobody looks at the total picture of coal and the price that eventually is in our people’s pockets.  And when I say our people, I mean the whole South Africa, all of us who live here who makes South Africa our home.  So I do feel that on the balance of fairness it might be a little but more useful and I am doingthe – I am not saying what the – I am, actually – and it might be useful to look at the way business gets done in the country.I mean, you know, there are companies that you cannot – if you go to an airport, it does not matter if you eat at that place or if you go to the bathroom or you wash your hands or you use the café in the area, it all belongs to one company.So it might be interesting – I think it is interesting and I think we are a young democracy and these – this – these – this phenomena is going to show its head often and many people will get hurt in the process but it will show its head.  I am not making it as a thread.  I am just saying that that is what happened – that is what I felt about it.      But it is not as simple as you think it is.     I think the phenomena is new entrance to any of the big four or five’s, whether it is in the financial sector.     Whether it is in the coal sector, whether it is in the tourism sector.  We have only four or five bigcompanies.     They are all white owned and they all have all of our, you know, the well-kneaded(?) who serve in that directorship and I think has happened for a long time.       No...     [laughs]     Yes.     Yes, Chair.    I do not know who drew up those guidelines.     But I use...  When I came to the ministry, I was quite new.     So I used what was present in the ministry ...[intervenes]      Until I...  So it might be those guidelines.     Yes.     No.     That does.  That does.     I do recall that now.     I do not – I must be very honest.  I have not looked specifically to that.     But if my memory serves me, that did nothappen.     But...  Yes, that did not happen because I cannot remember who – how that...  I cannot remember Chair.  Let me say that.     Because I only...  You see, I come in at the part where they write the three names in their first preference, their second preference and their preference.  So the board will write the three names.  Now I do not remember seeing it like that, to me.I do remember the board writing to say that they would like to appoint Mr Molefe and Mr Singh and I approved that.  I took it to the ANC Deployment Committee and they approved it and I took it to the Cabinet Committeeand they approved it.  I mean, sorry.  Not Cabinet Committee.  I took it to Cabinet and they approved it.     But I am saying to you, I do not remember having three names.       I have – I remember having only one name.     But, I mean, I could be wrong.     H’m?     I do not know.     I do not remember Chair.  If – I am trying to think about it while I am sitting here while you are asking me the questions because I am trying to think of a plausible response to you.  Look, the guidelines for both executives and even boards and committees and all of that, then there are only a few departments that actually abide by any conventional way of dealing with this matter and I think DPE is one such department.So you cannot take people out of your back pocket to be on the board and you cannot take people just one – get one person because there are – even though thelaw, the Companies Act and the MOI and all of that, they all give you the right to do so.There are conventions that have been developed within DPE how those processes will happen.  So maybe in another department this is how it happens but in Eskom, generally, it happens...  I will look – I will try to check the recesses of my brain again but I have a sense that it is – you are right, there was only one candidate.     Look, Chair, we were all in – you must remember, we came – we come thought a very dark period of – well, literally and figuratively, a dark period.  So Mr Molefe overwhelmed all of us.     I mean, I still feel that in terms of what he did in the company in those first few months was actually remarkable.  There are 42 000 people who work for Eskom.  And for the first time they have seen their CEO.  It was within a few weeks.  And then he got them all to, you know, like rugby scrummed up to be part of this festival ofmaintenance.And then he got them all...  So I think we were probably all swept up by Mr Molefe’s ability by August to have load-shedding under control.  I mean...  So I was just fascinated.  In the control room, there was this thing called, I do not know, it is Thesaurus     I agree with you Chair.     Because, I mean, I even think, how come my Legal and Governance Unit did not stop us?     I mean, I take the blame.  I am the head of...  I am the Executive Authority.  I am not saying somebody else has to stop us.     But how come the process people did notstop?  Not...  The board is not – they are not politicians.  I am a politician.       Or I was.  But the board does not stop – but at least why – you know, they did not stop us.  But I think it is because it is not illegal or unlawful.  And I am using it very, very widely.  I think it is not illegal or unlawful.  But Chair, I think it is something that I must think about.     I must think about.       And if I think more about it, I will...     Because it is a fascinating question.     Chair, what if I suspend?  What if I say I suspended all informal protocols?     I do not know if I did say – I do not think I have said that.  [laughs]     I am just saying.  What if I said, I suspend – in my – the memo, I suspend informal protocols that governance the processes of appointments and only stick with what is – what...  I mean, I do not want o use the word lawfully or legally ...[intervenes]      ...with so many lawyers around and attorneys around but I mean...  You know what I am saying?  What if I had suspended the informal convention or the convention?     Yes.     I think you are right Chair...[intervenes]      That is what I – but that is not what I have done.  I hope I have not done...  No, I do not think...  [laughs]     Yes.     H’m.  I hear what you saying Chair.     No, I think you are right.  You are right in asking the questions that you are asking because we could – the argument is not going to be – the argument that anyone will oppose you with is not an argument that if it is true that it has happened that way.  I cannot be anargument that is outside of the process.     And that is the only argument I have.  And the argument I have is outside of the process.  It is not inside the process that you have just outlines.     But then the part – that is why I need to read the MOI.     And not commit myself at this stage.     But the issue...  There is a part that is missing there.     And that is the part that says that – and I listened just briefly.  And that is the part that says that the only employers of DG’s or HOD’s are not – they are actually employing – they are – their employment is approved or rejected by Cabinet.       So there is also that part that is missing.    No, Chair …[intervenes]     Chair, can I ask a question?     And it is not to go against what you are saying.     I just have – you know, there are some difficulties I have with so and so and so and so saying that and – so, I mean, when Mr Henk Bester says so Salim Essa says that he will be the CEO, so he will never be a CEO for the rest of his life because Mr Essa says he will be a CEO.  I just do not understand what – I deal with the issue of Brian Molefe and his appointment.  We will look – I think we will look into that.    I have not spoken to my legal people.     We will look into that because that is something we – that is something concrete that we can deal with.     And I wanted to – I do not know if I am ever coming back here again, but I want to say just one thing, if you do not mind, Chair.  It has got nothing to do withimplicating anybody.     I, a couple of months ago, it was a Saturday morning, a lady on SA Express said that she was supposed to give me R10 million and I do not think you probably remember it, she [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Can I just …[intervenes]     Oh.  So might that still come up?  Or can Isay it?     Okay.  I just want to say that that is an absolute untruth.  It has never happened, I have never asked any R10 million and never ever received R10 million from anybody for anything including the lady in question and I do not think she is to blame for it, I think somebody else told her that he was supposed to give me R10 million.     This might just stop the people from trying to borrow money from me, I do not have R10 million.     Yes.      Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair. 
BROWN:Let me tell you what happened ...[intervenes]
