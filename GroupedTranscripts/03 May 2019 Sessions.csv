CHAIRPERSON:Good morning Ms September, good morning everybody.    Before we start I just have two matters that I want to deal with.  The one is what I said yesterday with regard to Colonel Madhoe.  Sections of the media may have misunderstood what I said or I may not have articulated what I wanted to say correctly.  So I just want to try again to make sure that I am not misunderstood.   1.  I am hearing evidence in relation to Law Enforcement Agenciesin regard to which there is a suggestion that powers were being abused n regard to the arrest and prosecution of officers wh o were investigating corruption matters and that they were being suspended and there were transfers that appear not to have been motivated by proper reasons but may have been connected with corruption or harassing people who were doing their job.  And in regard to Colonel Madhoe I have heard evidence that suggests that he may be guilty of corruption.  That he may have been guilty of bribery or attempted bribery.  And I have heard that it appears that not much has been done over many years in regardto the allegations against him relating to bribery.  And that includes in terms of internal disciplinary matters within SAPS.  So if not much has been done over so many years that would be a matter of grave concern but I am not at this stage or I am not the person at this stage to say whether he should or should not be there at work.  Somebody within SAPS is supposed to look into the matter and take such decisions as are dictated by the law and the policies of SAPS.  Whether somebody has already looked into the matt er and came to a decision that nothing should be done I do not know but I would like to know whether anything has been done and if so what it is.  Therefore I would like these concerns – this issue to be brought to senior authorities within SAPS because it  is important to find out whether they know about the matter and they know whether anything has been done  and if nothing has been done why nothing has been done, they can lookinto the matter.  But as a commission we would definitely like to have full information as well because there is a suggestion in the evidence that as part of what was happening during the relevant time is that those officers who were doing their job in terms of investigating corruption cases were being victimised and other people were  not being dealt with even when there was a reason for them to be dealt with.  So we would like to look into that.  So the legal team and the secretary of the commission should communicate with the senior management of SAPS to establish whether particularly one I think they could go to the National Commissioner because he would be the one that would knowwho in the hierarchy is supposed to have dealt with the matter and whether he is aware of it and would be able to cause information to be made available as to what has happened.  So no judgment has been made as to whether Colonel Madhoe should or should not be at work.  I have not heard Colonel Madhoe’s side of the story so the idea was certainly not that I have made any decision about whether or not he should be there.  What is important is to find out whether these allegations are known to SAPS?  What they have done about them if anything and even if they have not done anything why they have not done anything?  And then the matter can be taken from there.  All people will be given hear – a fair hearing by the commission no matter how serious the allegations against them are and their side of the story will be heard and considered properly and fairly and nobody will be presumed to be guilty of anything just b ecause a witness has said he or she did something.  Findings will be made at the end of the work of thecommission.  So everybody will be given a fair hearing no matter what has been said about them or against them.  That is the one thing I wanted to say.  The second thing I want to say is this.  Major General Booysen from the evidence that he has given has indicated that there are a number of court applications that he had to do.  He had to bring to court to deal with various matters.  In some of them ther e are judgments.  I would like the legal team to secure not only the judgments in regard to those matters but I would like the full set of papers in each application so that we can have a full picture of exactly what happened in regard to each matter and h ow people against whomcertain allegations were made how they responded in affidavits that were placed before the courts.  I would also like to see the findings that were made by those courts in regard to each matter and in this regard I would like the legal team to prepare for me for later use a list of all findings that have been made by the courts in the various applications where there is no appeal pending.  Maybe they can make them even if there is an appeal pending but a note can be made that in regard to that one specific ones there is an appeal pending.  Mr McBride also gave evidence and indicated that he had to go to court a few times where he brought applications.  I would like the same in regard to him.  And in regard to him I think I may have alr eady said this when he was giving evidence it is important to obtain documentation that was before the prosecutor who made the decision to prosecute and the information that was before the prosecutor when the charges were withdrawn, the criminal charges were withdrawn.  I want to know all ofthat.  Thank you.    Thank you.  Okay we may proceed.     Yes let them place themselves on record.     If there are those who wish to do so.     Okay let us proceed. ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Yes.    Yes let us deal with them now.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Is a judgment?    Ja. ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Okay.  Okay so that particular exhibit then will be marked Exhibit Z[M] – M in brackets.  Thank you.    H’m. ADVOCATE VERUSHKA    Yes.    Oh that is the one where Major General Booysen was saying three judges made a finding specifically that Mr Abrahams was the one who had made the decision despite the fact that he haddeposed to an affidavit saying he was not the one who made the decision.    Thank you.    I am sorry do we know whether this is on appeal or not?  You do not know?    So you can check later on?     You can check later on.  Okay.    H’m.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.  Do you know whether the majority says anything along the lines that they are not making any credibility finding as well in the majority judgment or is that something you are not sure about?     Yes.     Yes.    You would know this judgment quite well.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is paragraphs 55 to 58?     Thank you very much.    And do you know whether it i s on appeal?   How long ago was it maybe first?     Yes.    How far that process is.    Oh okay.  Okay no thank you very much.  Yes thank you.  Well unfortunately I was looking – I was trying to see when judgment was handed down – when the judgment was handed down.  Unfortunately the only date given there is the date when – well there is 30 and 31 October 2017 as the dates when the matter was heard and then at the top of page 32 there is a date for the revision of the judgment being 21 December 2017.  So will – so it would have been handed down sometimes towards the end of 2 017.      Okay.    H’m.    Okay.   Okay alright.  I think maybe the – the legal team should just check whether there is still an appeal pending in regard  to the matters.    H’m.    That is what appointment – that one?    Oh to appoint an acting DPP?     Well if you…     If you just tell me what it says that is enough.     H’m.   H’m.    Would that not be a national of – person as opposed to a provincial DPP?  I am not sure you know these – the structure ofthe NPA can be confusing.  So we are looking for who – who has the power to appoint an acting DPP – Provincial DPP and I do not even think it is called Provincial DPP.  It is – it is the Provincial representative of the NDPP.      Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    And who does it say – that is where it says the Minister?   Ja.    Oh it says the President. ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Oh okay.    Yes.    Oh okay.  Okay.  Alright.    Okay. No thank you.  But is that not a little strange?  A provision that you read earlier on said the Minister may appoint and I thought you were talking about what a deputy director …     Oh is the President.    Oh okay.      So Advocate Noko would have therefore have been appointed by the President in terms of that?     Yes.  Okay alright and later on you can just check and we can correct – we can correct whatever we have said if we have misunderstood who appoints who.  That is fine.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja or no we do not need to view it as if we have got transcripts that would be enough.  You do not have a transcript you just have the…    Ja.    But if you have watched it you can just confirm whether – what the witness said is actually what happened.  But otherwise a transcript can be made later on and made available.     No that is fine.    In due course then it is fine.    H’m.    When she was appointed as acting director of publicprosecutions?    Okay alright.  Just arrangements must be made for us to just get a transcript of that relevant part.  We do not need to have a transcript of the whole interview.    Ja and it need not be now we can get it in due course.    Okay.    Do you know who – or was it Mr Gerrie Nel who was – who had been appointed to prosecute in the matter originally?   Who had been the prosecutor.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, they were – they were the prosecutors or they were handling it?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So – so once the court had se t aside the decision to withdraw the charges the matter should have been pursued.  That is prosecution and one would have expected that the same prosecutors who had been prosecuting the matter would continue unless there was some valid reason to change the m.    Hm.    Hm. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.  Well the legal team should look into that.  All these matters that we – that are coming up we need to know exactly what happened, what are the facts and so on and so on and it is important to get all the facts because with regard to prosecution you may have a case where somebody makes in good faith an error of law and does something that maybe seen as not right but you may have a case where it is not an error of law.  It is something serious and therefore it becomes very important to get the facts right.  What exactly happened, who did what, what was before him or her befo re she made that decision.  Okay, thank you.    Like in one matter or they were there – they were covering a number of matters the same prosecutors or it was a team – a large team of prosecutors in regard to each matter?    Yes.    Before you go to – to those just some clarity.  Thelarge team of prosecutors that you tal k about that would be brought -would come to Durban for the Cato Manor matter even when everyone knew they would be a postponement – would those be from Head Office?  Is that right or would it be a mix of local and Head Office prosecutors?    Ja.    Hm.    Hm. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    And how often did this happen – if you are able to tell?  I mean I know you talked.    About 20 or 19.    Postponements.   Both in terms of criminal charges and internal disciplinary matters nothing happened as far as you know?    Thank you.    I take it that either the investigators or the legal team have been in touch with at least some of those and that either they will be coming forward to testify or at least we know what they have to say.  So if it has not been taken care of it should be taken care of.  Weshould at least speak to each one of those people and if they have got information that falls within the term of reference we should have them give evidence in due course.  Thank you.    What page?    Thank you.  Yes.    (Not audible). ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   I do not see his name here.  Is he here – is his name here?    Oh, okay.    The one at the bottom of page 4.    Oh.   Oh, okay.  I think – I think it will then be important that we have initials to differentiate which one we are dealing with at any one time.    Oh, but the one that you were talking from Durban is Mzinyathi is that right?     Mnyathi not Mzinyathi?    Oh, okay.    Oh, okay.  I thought you said Mzinyathi earlier on.  So that might have confused Ms September as well.  Okay.  So the one in Durban is Mnyathi not Mzinyathi, okay.     Yes, okay.    Thank you.    But I am sorry.  I am not sure that I unde rstand this diagram completely.  The key at the bottom has go Cato Manor written in a certain colour and I take it that that colour is not exactly the same as the colour where you have got many prosecutors starting with Advocate Chauke at the top but I tak e it that that portion of the – ofthat circle tells us the names of prosecutors who were involved in the Cato Manor case.  Would that be right Major -General Booysen?    Ja, to the right yes.  In other words where it says Cato Manor at the bottom there.  It is more or less the same colour as that portion of the circle where you have got a number of names.  So I am taking it that what it does mean is that those prosecutors whose name appear in that portion of the green circle where involved in the Cato Manor case.  Is that right?    Are not included?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.  I thought that the purpose of the diagram was to show the cross section of certain prosecutors in regard to different matters.  So in regard to the Cato Manor you can see there were a number of prosecutors but then in regard to the others it looks like you only see one name.  So I am n ot sure if I understand the purpose of the diagram correctly because it appears only – it appears that it is only the Cato Manor where you have a number of them and a few of them – I mean for example you have got Advocate  Jiba written there acting and DPP but her name is in a colour for which there is no key.  At least as far as I understand this.  So I am not able to make head or tail of whather presence in that portion means and then you have Advocate  Mosing in a portion of a larger circle that is colour ed in a certain way but when I look at the certain key there is no colour like that.  So I do not know what it means to have him there.  Then you have Advocate  Vimbani his or her name – I do not know if it is a female or male – appears in a pink portion of a circle but I do not see a key that tells me what it means for what – what case that is or okay maybe the key is – part of the key is at the bottom.  Part of it is at the top.  I see Amigos case.  Maybe it means she was – he was involved in the Amigos ca se. Then the Panday investigation the colour is bluish.  So I guess that – that is – that shows that but I do not see other colours but also if you just see one prosecutor there I am not sure that it is in line with that I thought was the purpose of the diagram.  I thought the purpose was go – was to say look at the commonality of the same prosecutors and different cases.  That is what I thought the idea was but I might be mistaken.    Yes.    Yes.    I think what – what - is there a case that has got the colour where her name is because if the colour of the part where her name is was the same as the colour for the looting of Secret Service Account then it would tell me that she was involved in both Cato Manor and the looting – the looting of the Secret Service Account but b ecause it has got its own colour for which I find no key it confuses me or do I misunderstand? Maybe both of you understand this.  I am the only one who does not understand it.    Yes.    Yes.    You do not know ja.    Yes. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was it 70 or 60?  60 million or 70 million?    Ja.    Oh, okay.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Oh 1-7, not 70.  Okay. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, ja because.    That was my – that was my understanding that the diagram shows a group of prosecutors who seemed to feature in mostof these cases where people who were doing their job were being suspended charged and all.  That was – that was the impression I had but what you are saying is it is not all of them who appear on the (indistinct)?    It is only some.    Okay, thank you.    Yes.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Ja, okay.    Hm.    Hm.   Thank you.    2014.    On New Year’s Day?    Were you supposed to fly up to Gauteng?     Okay.    At this stage you were not under suspension, one has got to try and just ...(intervention)     You are back at work at that time, okay.     What did he say?    About what?  About the people who report to you?     Mmm, the equity profile referred to what?  MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Oh, the racial and gender representation of people under you.    Oh okay, alright.    Yes, and just to complete the story, I assume theProvincial Commissioner was present at the office on t he day?    Yes okay, continue.    What could have been so urgent about the gender and racial representation of staff under you on the 1 s t of the New Year.    Patrolling?     Was that his job?    Oh.    But what was your understanding of what he was saying, that he was patrolling, I mean it was obviously Festive Season and I come from Durban so I know that sometimes there are a lot of SAPS to make sure that on the beachfront you know people are safe and so on.  Was your understanding that’s what he meant?     Yes okay.    In the Provincial Commissioner’s car?     Yes, yes.   Kind of apologising indirectly or something like that?     Are you saying now in Cape Town?     Now in regard to the investigation that – do you say it’s Roelofse, what was the name of the ...(intervention)     Roelofse?   I just want to pronounce it correctly.     Is there anything significant about the investigation from which he was taken off by General Ntlemeza?    Yes.  Now I understood I think yesterday that the looting of the Secret account that we talked about related to KZN, is that the same or it’s different provinces?     Yes, report.    So the one that Colonel Roelofse was conducting may be described as the National Investigation relating to the Secret Account, or not really?     Just to differentiate it from the one in KZN,differentiate from the leg, the KZN leg as you call it.  So the National leg and the KZN leg would that help to distinguish which investigation?     Oh the Western Cape leg. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Yes, but he and Madonsela were doing these investigations independent, it’s not like one was helping the other, wasunder another one.    Independently, so it would be  in order to talk about    And maybe the KZN leg and the Western Cape leg, even though maybe the Western Cape from what you say might not be completely accurate, but if we say Western Cape leg then we know which one we’re talking about.    Ja, okay, alright.    Yes, no that’s fine, I just wanted to make sure as we talk further I don’t get confused because there was the KZN one so if we talk about the KZN leg then I know which one, if we talk about the Western Cape one then I know which one we’re talking about.     Yes let’s take the tea adjournment, it’s now twenty past, we will resume at twenty to twelv e.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay we may proceed.    I am sorry Ms September.  Let me just go back Major General Booysen to your meeti ng with General Mtlemeza on the 1 January 2014.  Is my understanding correct that the only – there areonly two issues that he raised with you?  One was what the gender and racial dis – representation of people under you were and two that he asked for a report from you?There might have been a misunderstanding of a report about what but he asked for a report from you?    Those are the only things?     Okay thank you.   Maybe I am sorry Ms September again.     And when did you hear from him ab out that report or I do not necessarily – I am not necessarily looking for a date but I just want to see if this was something that was so urgent that it needed to be dealt with on the 1 January.  How quickly did he deal with it?  MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL     Yes.  But you did give him a report about Cape Town at some stage?    And he did not ask for it – did not pursue it?    And he never pursued that?     So would it be correct to say for all intents and purposes to the extent that he wanted to see you on the 1 January for asking the report – asking you to give him a report about that issue he asked for a report that when he did not get from you he did not pursue?     And the only other reason why he wanted  to meet you on the 1 January was to ask you about the gender and racial representation of people under you?     And did you give him an answer on that day in regardto the question of r acial and gender representation?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Did he – did he later on – a week, two weeks, a month, three months, six months revert to you about the issue of the gender and racial representation of the people under you?     So both of the issues that he raised were issues that he never took further?    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    Certainly there is nothing that was said at the meeting at your meeting with him that showed why these two issues were so urgent and the fact that later on he never pursued them or followed them up might suggest that – might mean that – there might not have been a proper justification to want to meet on the 1 January these things could have been dealt with in the normal course?  Okay thank you.    But just to clarify when you talk about IPID or Mr Khuba and McBride investigating the Panday matter what you mean isthey were not doing the investigation that you and your team were doing but they were investigating whether there may have b een any misconduct or other unacceptable conduct on the part of any member of the police in regard to the conduct of that investigation?     Yes.    Yes.    YEs.   Yes.    Ja.    Oh so they – they effectively were going to do what your team had been doing.   Okay.  But would that fall within their mandate?  My understanding has been that theirs is to look at complaints about the conduct of police officers as opposed to investigating the actual crimes committed by people who are not police officers?    Ja.    Ja.    Oh.   Okay.    Okay, okay.  No thank you I just wanted to understand that.  Thank you.   I am sorry I interrupted you.    Is that B for Beatrice?  Is that B for Beatr ice?    Or D for Doris?    Oh.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Was that investigation against Mdluli?     Okay.    Well Mr McBride also said in his evidence that Mr Khuba had told him that General Ntlemeza had put pressure on him to finalise the report relating to the rendition matter.  And that he had also alerted him that something was going to happen to General Dramat on a certain day and it seems that something did happen and that is I think the suspension if I am not mistaken.  Yes thank you.  So it seems if this – if Mr Khuba’s evidence is correct it seems that General Ntlemeza knew in advance what was going to happen to General Dramat and thathe may have known or expected that he would be appointed if and when General Dramat was not there.    H’m.    It is – well we will see at the end of the whole commission findings will be made but there certainly are certain fissures of evidence that I am hearing from you that I heard from Mr McBride.  That should be quite concerning if it is true.  The LawEnforcement is very important and if Law Enforcement is not doing its job properly then we have no country.  So – but I am hoping that more and more people within Law Enforcement who know what was happening will come forward and will not be scared, will come forward and give evidence and tell the nation exactly what has been happening because if the Law Enforcement Agencies are not working then we will not have a country.  We have got to find out exac tly what has been happening so that this commission can make recommendations as to what should be done to make sure that those things never happen again.   H’m.    H’m.    And not everybody can – can stand up to that for a long time.    H’m.    But who is going to get into that post?     H’m.  Well if we are to make recommendations as towhat should be done in the future to avoid some of the problems that may be the Law Enforcement Agencies have found themselves in it would be important to have as much information as possible from people on the ground who know how these things work.  So people like you and other people and organisations that may be involved in Law Enforcement Agencies who wish to make recommendations as to what should be looked at in terms of recommendations who wish to make submissions you know in due course will you know will be allowed and they must be ready to make submissions as to what should be done.  Of course before you can make recommendations you – about what should be done you need to know what has happened and that is why we need to go through this so that the measures that must be taken must match what the problem was that is sought to be addressed.     Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   A good job.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.  No, no thanks.  I am also talking exactly from the same point.  So it is not just a question of addressing issues at SAPS that people might be concerned about that have got nothing to  do with the Commission.  It is to the extent that certain - a certain environment maybe providing a fertile ground for corruption within Law Enforcement Agencies.  So that – that needs to be looked at if we want to make sure that such corruption does not continue.  Thank you.    So he disregarded your – what you had to say?    Hm.    But did the disciplinary hearing proceed or not?     But if – I am sorry.  Before you go to national you – you told – you wrote to General Ntlemeza and said the matter aboutwhich you are contemplating suspending this person has been disposed  of.  He did not respond to you but about five days or so later or a week later the person was suspended.  She stayed at home for about a year. There was a hearing – disciplinary hearing.  You took part or you indicated that if this matter was taken on rev iew you would make sure that General Ntlemeza – whoever you might have said – paid from his own pocket and then the matter was abandoned.  Is that more or less correct?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    That person.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    For what now?    Oh that is (intervenes).    The one that you have discussed before?     Okay.    That lady.  Was it a lady?     Yes and then the – the matter that was taken to arbitration related to her transfer.  The validity or fairness of her transfer.  Is that what was taken to arbitration?    Yes, but do you know whether the reasons for the transfer were in anyway connected with the reason for her suspension or was it something else ?    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay.    The Bargaining Council?    Ja.    Ja.  It is a Bargaining Council.    I mean except for one all were – all the others who had been there before him were not retained?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    To act?    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm and what - what happened after that?  I assume you did not just take that as that is?     You had reached a point where you were quite exhausted in terms of all the fights you had to put up?     Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  This was close to the time that you were going to retire?    So the person who was appointed is it still the same person who is still there now or you do not know?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Was this while – while you were at work or what?     For what?    But you say these people were – you were told were jumping over the fence or something?     In your house.    Hm.    Hm.    The ones who were – who had gone to your house did you get to know what the – the purpose of their visit was?     A notice of your suspension?     So some went to – to your house.  Others went to your attorney’s office or it was the same group?     Yes.  Then they went (intervenes).    Yes.    Yes.    Tell me Major-General Booysen – I am sorry to interrupt you Ms September.  By this time you had been – you know – in the Law Enforcement Sector for decades.  Is that how notice of – notices of suspension are delivered or served on police officers when they need to be suspended?     I am sorry which exhibit are you now on?     Okay.  What page?    Who was that?    Oh. She did not – she would not want to be seen with you?    Oh.    Hm, ja.    Well did he not cover this last time or is there something to be covered?     Oh.  I seem to remember Major-General Booysen talking about him and other people going to Cape Town for an interview but General Ntlemeza not being among them and to his – how he was taken to the Gupta residence.  Major-General Booysen?    Sorry.   Not the second part?    Also the interview?    Yes, but the other one you did about the interview?     You did.   Okay, alright.  Okay, thank you or maybe it is just I read and you have not testified, okay.     No that is fine.  Continue and cover what you need to cover.    Is it the name that you cannot remember at themoment?    Ja.    But let us just go back.  What was the actual complaint that had to be investigated about the online business?     Oh.    Okay.  Some technical things, ja.    Okay.     The one you’re about to talk about is that one?     Yes so that was the first one and it happened – it was in Gauteng.      In Sandton ja.     Oh to the hospital.     Yes, the first one – let’s finish the first one, what appeared to be the purpose of him wanting to meet with you?      Because it – I mean if you phone your friend and say let’s meet, there might not need to be any particular purpose, friends just want to be together for whatever but  if it’s somebody that you have never met before, one would think that there would be a purpose why you want to see that person.    Yes.      Yes okay thank you, then you’re onto the third – and then the second encounter, it seems from what you have said that the purpose was not clear either, you were going to hospital, h e came (indistinct) and much not much was discussed and then he left.     Okay thank you.      How is private school English General Booys en, I’m sure it’s not like my English.    Okay.     Yes continue.     A black sorry?     And in which part of the house were you when this was raised now?     Yes okay so it was a lounge?      Okay yes, so he raised this issue.     What did he say exactly?      Yes because on the face of it, it looks like his interest in having supper with you in KwaZulu Na tal would depend on whether you were appointed as head of Hawks or not, if he says, if you get appointed let’s have supper in KwaZulu Natal.     One would have thought that he would be interested in having supper with you irrespective of your appointment – the outcome of your interview.     Yes that’s what I’m saying that it seems strange that he would want to – or anybody outside of the Hawks anybody outside of the Law Enforcement Agency should only seek to have a meeting withyou or supper with you, if you are appointed.  You know, I mean, if you meet people sometimes you feel like, you know, you like these people maybe you’d like to have tea or coffee or lunch with them some other time, you don’t make that to depend on anything you just say, maybe we should have tea or lunch some other time.     So I’m just saying it – on the face of it, it looks quite strange that, that was to depend on that.      No pressure of any sort was put on you to do anything or not to do anything?      But again let’s go back to – as you left the meeting were you clear as to what the purpose of the meeting was that – of the meeting was, what was the purpose of this meeting?      But the person who had asked for the meeting wasn’t Tony – it wasn’t Mr Tony Gupta it was Mr Duduzane Zuma, isn’t it?      Yes.     Yes, so there were now – you had, had three meetings so to speak, some of them might not have lasted, you know, a long time but each one didn’t appear to be clear what the purpose wasam I right?     Yes.     The reason for the meeting.     But in the second meeting even the investigation wasn’t mentioned it was only the first and the third meeting.     Ja it was just greeting and...(intervention).     Ja okay thank you. ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER  I’m sorry I just want to make sure I follow.  Pending his appeal or petition to the Supreme Court of Appeal, General Ntlemeza was he on suspension or was he at work?     He was at work oh, when you talk about somebody acting in his position you mean after he had been removed?     That was a different Minister...(intervention).      Yes.     Oh I’m sorry Major General Booysen, maybe we should adjourn now, then when we come back you can then tell us.  I see it is about one minute past one, okay we’ll take the lunchadjournment and we’ll resume at two.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you let us proceed.    I am sorry, I am sorry Ms September.  Thank you.     But would she have been the one who would act onthe – on your complaint as I understand it.  Your affidavit was a complaint against General Ntlemza is that right or not really?     Yes.    Oh, oh so the affidavit that you handed to MajorGeneral Matakata was to bring to her attention as the acting head of the Hawks that you had met with the Gupta’s?     And nothing else really?     Okay no thank you.    But of course if they did  not think there was anything wrong with you having met with the Gupta’s they would not have to doanything about it, is that right?     H’m.    Sorry 13?    H’m.    Well Ms September before you move on I see that at page 51 there is mention of Zikhali and I wonder whether that is the person that may have been appointed to your position.  Can you cover that and I see there is reference to Lieutenant Colonel Sonnekus, Adele Sonnekus and maybe that is the lady that – that was transferred – suspended and transferred.    So let us cover that?    Ja.   Well we did not have the name if I recall correctly or did I misunderstand?    Oh okay.    Oh okay that is the name that we did not have.     Oh okay no then I must hav e – but Zikhali?    Ja that is important to …     I did not hear that part.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    That is now?   Zikhali he was – he was leading the attempts to remove Sonnekus?    Yes.    Ja.    Thank you.    Okay okay.  I will let you know if I pick up something that I do not remember.      I am sorry I think he – I think he must – he must deal with paragraph 171 I kn ow he has dealt with it in a certain way but I think it is quite an important thing and I think some of these that come there I think in that paragraph and the subsequent – and some of theparagraph that come after that he seems to indicate specific appointments and there seems to be significance that he attaches to those appointments and I think it is important that we hear what he has to – the evidence ja    I am there.    Yes. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    No you can continue. ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Well I thought at the beginning he confirmed everything in his affidavit to be correct but we have got to – we have got to cover important things because evidence relating to LawEnforcement Agencies is very important and if the evidence that Major General Booysen is giving is true there are really very serious things that have been happening that should not have happene d.  It is very important that we deal with – with these issues properly.      Okay.  We do not have to deal with every detail but we must cover important things.    It is his matter.    You want to – you will not find out what role she played, is that what you want?     Out of the blue? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    You had been to court.  You had been vindicated.  Then you were told about three options but subsequently you got correspondence saying you must say why you should not be dismissed.     And what reason was offered as to why your dismissal was being contemplated?     Redundant.    But that would be if nobody is going to continue to do the job that you were doing I would assume?     But…    Your position was not redundant was it?     So the letter you received from her was  along those lines?    So it was saying your post has become redundant and you must say why you should not be discharged or dismissed bla, bla, bla.    Yes okay.  But the gist of the letter was that it was asking for your representations as to why     You should not be dismissed.    Did you ever hear what the factual basis was for her to regard your position as redundant?    And she did not advance any?     Because there was always going to be a need for the head of Hawks in the province?    That was in her letter?     That was part of that letter?    And the – did she ever file any affidavit in response to your urgent application either before the interdict was granted or later.  I assume it was a temporary interdict you got?     Yes.    The interdict ja.   Part to dismiss you.    Yes.    I am sorry who were you asking now Bheki Cele?     Yes at that time what position was he holding?     National Commissioner.    Oh. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Oh okay, okay so you say you asked him why some of you were being pushed out?     So this would – I remember that you said that that letter would have happened in 2011 or thereabout – the letter?    The – this document that you have just spoken about when did it circulate or when did it emerge?  Was it roundabout the same time?    Oh, okay.  So it was before the letter?     Before the letter, yes.  Okay, alright thank you.    Ja.    Ja.  Thank you.    I see that in paragraph 196 you say that   Yes.    On the Panday matter? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    That is Ngobeni?    Oh.    Yes, okay.    Hm. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   That is Soobramoney?    Yes.    At the disciplinary hearing?     Ja.    So at the time that Soobramoney was – at the time that he moved from KZN to Benoni was he still involved in the Panday investigation?    And he was supposed to be continuing with it?     Ja, he told you he had resigned?     So obviously – and you say but he had not resigned?     He had resigned from the Hawks maybe?     Yes.  Okay.  So – so when he moved from KZN to Benoni he was still involved in the Panday investigation?     Up until ja.    Ja.    And then when he left once he was in Crime Intelligence then obviously he was going to be doing something else?     Then he – he say he did nothing and would therehave been other people who would have continued with the Panday investigation in his absence?  Do you know?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    At the time that Soobramoney gave evidence in your disciplinary hearing how long had he been in Benoni?  Do you – do you have some idea?  I am just trying to understa nd to the extent that this may have disturbed the Panday investigation.  How long did it?     About two years.  Did that coincide with the time when you were on suspension or part of the time?     Yes.  Okay and did you get to know for how long he was sitting there doing nothing in Benoni – of the two years?   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So was your understanding that he was talkingabout that entire period since he had left KZN that he  was sitting there doing nothing?  So if that period was two years that would have been two years of doing nothing.    I may have missed this.  Did you cover – did you cover that issue about Major –General Ntombela at 199 and Hankel?    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, okay.  So he phoned you and said wha t?    That is Ntombela?    And – and which year are we talking about at that time more or less – if you are able to (intervenes)?     Certainly that was a time when the investigation against the Provincial Commissioner in KZN – Ngobeni – had started.   It had started a year or two before?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    So – so you say there was – there was a Provincial Commissioner in Mpumalanga or whatever the province that Ntombela was in who as far as you know had a clean record, had no complaints against him and he had been asked to investigate you and he found nothing and reported accordingly to General  Piyega.  His contract was not renewed and then the contract of the Provincial Commissioner in KZN Major-General Ngobeni there was an investigation pending againsther but hers was renewed.  That is what you are saying?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh Ntombela made – conducted that investigation as well?    Ja.    Yes and then General Piyega was very angry about that?    Yes.  Thank you.     That’s Mabula telling you the story or what?    Who was telling you the story?      Oh you don’t want to mention his name okay.      No that’s fine.     Is the ICD the predecessor to the IPID?      Okay.   Thank you.       From?    Okay.      Yes.    To implicate you?     This was Mabula and w ho, who were...(intervention).     Oh Mabula wasn’t there but it was detectives.      Okay.     Well let him testify, let him testify.      Yes now put your questions more neutrally.     So they put you at the back of a police van?      Oh what’s his name?     What’s the spelling, have I got it here?      Oh okay have you got the spelling?      Okay what was his position?      Okay thanks.    Just repeat that?     Just repeat what you have just said.      What page of that – this Exhibit is that, I thought I’ve got it but it looks like I haven’t got it.      Does this diagram not suffer from the challenges that I mentioned earlier in regard to the other one – okay, alright I’m there.     You said something about how – about those who are in black and those who are in white, the individuals whose names are written on white would be prosecutors of NPA perso nnel – prosecutors.     And then you have got names of – that are on black you say those are investigators?     From SAPS?      Ja okay.   One second.  Okay.    Just rephrase the question so the witness will understand it.   Uncorrect – un-amended?    Ja okay.    Major General Booysen are you looking at the correct lever arch file?    Oh okay.   Okay.    That is the affidavit that you handed to the acting head of the Hawks after General Ntlemeza had left?     Yes okay.  Thank you.   Did you say 329?    Exhibit 29?    Ja.    Okay.    Record it.    Ja. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Okay.    Yes.   H’m.    H’m.    Yes.      Well maybe…     Major General Booysen I must once again thank you for coming forward to help this commission to give evidence and help this commission understand some of the things that have happened or were happening in the Law Enforcement sector and some of the things that some of the people in this – in that sector have gone through.  I am hoping that more and more people within the sector who have knowledge of things that have been happening will come forward and share with the commission and the nation exactly what has beenhappening.  Because as I sa id before lunch if we do not have a proper – proper Law Enforcement Agencies then we do not have a country.  So it is vitally critical that if there are things that have not been going well, that have not been done properly in the Law Enforcement sector we  should know so that this commission can make recommendations at to what should really be done to make sure that the country has proper Law Enforcement Agencies that do their job in accordance with the constitution and the law.  So thank you very much for coming forward to share what you know.  Obviously this is not the last day you give evidence because it is likely that you may be asked to come back and I have no doubt you have no problem with that.  So we will still see you I believe but thank you very much and others who have similar information should come forward and share what they know with the commission and with the nation.  Thank you very much.     Thank you.    You have nothing further.  So for now you are excused Major General Booysen thank you very much.     Thank you.  We are at the end of today’s proceedi ngs.  We will adjourn and on Monday start at ten o’clock.  Is that in order?     Is that in order?    We will start with Transnet?     And then sometime later we will have more witnesses on Law Enforcement Agencies.   Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  Ja.  Okay no thank you.    We will adjourn then for today and we will resume onMonday at ten o’clock.  We adjourn.
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good morning Chair.    Chair I am informed that there are legal representatives at this venue who have not  placed themselves on record as yet.  With your indulgence …     Thank you.    Would you grant me the indulgence to deal with those now?     Okay.  Just one administrative or housekeeping issue.  All the exhibits that were handed up yesterday which starts at Exhibit Z[H], [I], [J ], [K], [L] have been consolidated into a blue folder.   There is one additional exhibit that has been added.    And it has been marked Z[M] to follow the sequenc e.    And that particular exhibit is the case that Chair requested yesterday.     In relation to who took the decision.    And to read into the record 53   Correct Chair.    The next relevant paragraph it is at page 52 of the same bundle.    I am – I do not believe it is.    Yes.    So the next relevant paragraph which is still part of the majority judgment is at page 52.     And it is paragraph 59.    It reads    “Secondly the reasons advanced for the withdrawalof charges against Jiba are based on the material error of law which falls short of the legality expected in a rational decision.”     “And thirdly the defence that Freedom Under Law has not exhausted the internal remedies by seeking a review of the decision to prosecute has no merit.”     The last paragraph which is of relevance to is part of the dissenting judgment.     I do not specifically recall that but I am happy to double check and revert.     Thank you General Booysen.    Yes Chair.    According to my research.    This was specifically on the 12 t h well it referenced the date of the 12 December 20 17.    But it is certainly not reflected in here so I stand to be corrected.     Will do Chair.  If that disposes of that query the next query relates to the appointments.     The National Prosecuting – National Prosecuting Authorities Act…    Chair a query was raised yesterday as to who is authorised …     Yes Chair. CHAIRPERSON   I have a copy of the National Prosecuting Authority Act should you so wish.     But I am happy to just…     It says that the Minister may subject to the laws governing the public service  in Section 16(4) and after consultation with the National Director app oint a Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions.    Chair if I may there are essentially – this particular Act governs the appointment of three, four positions.    The first is the national director.      That is under Section 10.    The second is the deputy national director.     Which is Section 11.    The third is the appointment of directors and acting directors.    For the appointment of directors and acting directors.    And the national director.    May appoint a director of public prosecutions in respect of the office of prosecuting authority.     And the last deals with the appointment of prosecutors generally at Section 16.    That was the deputy director Chair.  Whereas the appointment of directors and acting directors.     Is the President.    The last query that we were able to deal with relates to…    My understanding is so.    If I could just then summarise.  A national director, a deputy national director and directors and acting directors are all appointed by the President.    Be it independently or in consultation with…     The Minister.    And other stake holders.    The next query that was raised relates to the interview of Advocate Noko.     Thankfully we were able to extract the relevant excerpt of the interview.     Which relates to her responses on the Booysen matter.   It is in fact ready and available to be viewed should you so wish?  It is too…     Just the clip and the relevant clip..    Is two minutes.    Unfortunately a transcript was – is not available at yet.   But having looked at it…     Having looked at the video she does mention on at least three occasions.     That Booysen’s matter or other prominent matters, high profile matters in particular were in fact on the court roll when she was there.    Indeed Chair.    As it pleases Chair.    There are other matters but those are still being attended to.  Can I then suggest that we r esume where we left yesterday General Booysen?  And that is on page 41 of Exhibit Z[A].  So yesterday General Booysen you gave evidence about various prosecutors who are – whose names in fact populate slide that– slide 4 which is – forms part of the diagrams bundle.  And the last prosecutor that you gave evidence in regard to was Advocate Shaun Abrahams.  Is there anything that you wish to add following on the evidence that you gave yesterday in relation to him in view of the judgment that has now been presented to the Chair?    Thank you Chair.  General Booysen we are now at paragraph 150 of your affidavit which is at page 46.  You had already alluded to Ntlemeza, sor ry you have already alluded before the tea adjournment to Major General Ntlemeza’s involvement in the matter which has become commonly known as the Renditions Matters which in particular dealt with the rendition of certain Zimbabweans, is that correct?     To what extent are you aware of Major General Mtlemeza’s involvement with…     Thank you Chair.  General at paragraph 150 you talk about an engagement or an interaction rather that you have with a certain Mr Innocent Khuba?     No problem. CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chair.  Before we get to paragraph 150 can you turn to page 45 and at paragraph 146?  You make the statement that the real extent of the nefarious alliance between Major General Ntlemeza, Mr Richard Mdluli was laid bare in the affidavit of Mr Innocent Khuba.  Can you please explain what is meant by that?   No problem.    No problem Chair.  General Booysen you attach a copy of an affidavit by Mr Innocent Khuba which is marked JWB19 and that can be found in Exhibit Z[B].     Yes.    B for Beatrice.    It is one of the lever arch files Chair.    And it is page 291 it is the first annexure in the bundle.   We are informed that Mr Innocent Khuba will also be providing evidence before this commission and so we do not intend to go through the detail of this affidavit but merely just to highlight certain aspects of it.  General Booysen can you in summary inform the importance of this affidavit for purposes of your evidence?    Before dealing with that particular phone call is the paragraph you referring to at page 296 paragraph 5.11 of Exhibit Z[B]?     5.11 at the bottom.    Okay.  If you could just then read that – that particular paragraph into the record?    And that appears to be the excerpt that you were then referring to?     Please.    And on that point can I take you then to the particular paragraph you may be referring to which is paragraph 5.13 on page 297.    5.13 just for accuracy on record.  Can you in fact if I may with your leave Chair just to place on    Cycad Centre.  That is for the record CYCAD. “He had just called me to  tell me the good news.  I    Thank you Chair.  Before the long adjournment General Booysen you were talking about the meeting that you had at the Gupta compound and that subse…     Thank you Chair.  And then you spoke about that on the 13 June 2017 you had handed an affidavit toMajor General Matakata and that is at paragraph 166 of your affidavit.  Is that correct?    Is there anything that you    In relation to that?    General Booysen are you aware as to whether or not any – anything happened after handing in the affidavit?    If you could then go back to Major General Ntlemeza it is on page 53 of your affidavit and paragraph 177 that you make the following statement and that is that he was undoubtedly handpicked for the position.     Can you please explain that?     Apologies Chair it is page 53    And what reason was that?  You say that he was appointed to that position for a very particular reason?  What reason are you alluding to?     Was he involved in the Panday case at all?    Are you then suggesting and please correct me if I am wrong are you suggesting that he protected any particular interests?     And whose interests migh t that have been?    If we can then move onto the next individual that you mentioned in…    Yes.  Okay.    I may have been mistaken I thought that the evidence in relation to Sonnekus was already covered but I am happy to do so again.    Thank you Chair.  Much of theother evidence has already been covered.     No problem.  If I could then take you to paragraph 171 on page 52.     And ask you to please explain that to the Chair.    Is it also correct that Major General Ntlemeza replaced Major General Motsepe as the national head of commercial crime with Major Gen eral Alfred Khana?    Is that correct?    Thank you.  Please proceed.    Unless there is anything else in relation to this.    Okay.  In relation…    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  General Booysen what was the difference in approach or rather let me put it to – ask you it – ask you differently.  Was Riah Phiyega involved in both theCato Manor matter and the Mdluli matter?     And when you mean Booysen matter can you just clarify that please?     Okay then …    In fact – my question is slightly different and that is can you please explain what is the difference in approach that Riah Phiyega a dopted to your matter as compared to the Mdluli matter?    General Booysen please explain much mention is made of the ground coverage document which surfaced from crime intelligence.  Please explain the purpose of that document in context of the evidence you present today?     It is a good idea.    Okay.    Thank you.  And then the last part of your affidavit deals specifically with the role of intelligence services and the Sunday Times.  That can be found on page 66 starting from paragraph 225.  General Booysen do you have any comments in relation to the role of the intelligence services and the S unday Times?    Do you confirm General Booysen that in October 2018 the editor of the Sunday Times Mr Bongani Siqoko apologised for getting the Cato Manor publication wrong and that there was in fact an apology that was published which appears as an attachment to your affidavit at page 510?     It is page 348.      Thank you so much.  And then…    The last annexure that I would like to direct your attention to is annexure 29 which is of the same bundle Exhibit Z[B].      Yes Chair.  Oh apologies.  Exhibit Z[B]     Page 513.    Were you involved in the production of this article?     And just for the record Chair this particular excerpt only includes page 3, 19, 50, 51 and 52 of that particular report.  And then finally General Booysen do you have any closing remarks?    Chair    Chair  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Noted Chair.    That is in order Chair.    We will be trans – dealing with theTransnet tranche of evidence.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Yes Chair we are by no means complete with the Law Enforcement Agency tranche of evidence.     But that will resume.    After a certain law – SOE’s have been dealt with.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV YUSUF PEER:  Thank you Chairperson.  My nam e is Yusuf Peerfrom the Johannesburg Bar.  I appear on behalf of Minister Nathi Mthethwa to observe the current witness’s evidence.  I am instructed by Mabuza Attorneys and the lead counsel is Mr [indistinct] who is not present here but is part of the tea m.  Thank you Chairperson. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  To withdraw.  Yes.    Thank you Chair.  C hair if I could just direct you to the relevant paragraphs of that case.     Where it is – Chair can find on page 80 at paragraph 43.    And with your leave if I may read?  It is under the heading “The decision to withdraw against Ms Jiba.” “Both Mr Abrahams and Mr Mogatle say in their affi davits that it was Mr Mogatle and not Mr Abrahams who took the decision.  Mr Abrahams with the wording of Section 22 (2) C of the NPA Act in mind says that he did not take the decision for the very reason that after Mr Mogatle had taken the decision he, Mr  Abrahams would be able to review the decision of Mr Mogatle.  Mr Abrahams does not say what he would have done had Mr Mogatle been in favour of continuing the prosecution of MsJiba.  Mr Abrahams was not bound by the view of Mr Mogatle.  Mr Abrahams could had he so determined continued with the prosecution.  What Mr Mogatle had sent to Mr Abrahams was merely a recommendation rather than a decision.  Section 22 (2) C does not provide for the review of a recommendation.  In my view the decision was taken by Mr Abrahams.  I make no adverse credibility finding against either Mr Abrahams or Mr Mogatle.  I simply prefer my interpretation of the facts and the law to theirs.  This finding makes it unnecessary for me to consider the lack of authority to delegate poi nt.”    Chapter 3 in particular deals with the appointments of various members within the NDPP – within the Prosecuting Authority.    And in relation to the appointment of Deputy Directors it says tha t the Minister may apologies it is Section 15 of the Act.    That is Section 13.  Section 15 as I have…     Yes Chair.    Okay.  Following on from the judgment that has been handed up in your view what ought to have been the consequences in relation to the prosecution of or rather the charges against Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba?     Sorry it is paragraph 177.   I welcome your direction Chair.  The next individual is reflected on page 55 of your affidavit and that is paragraph 184.  The person marked is Riah Phiyega.     No problem Chair.  You have highlighted beneficiaries relative to each particular investigation.  Do you have any comment as to exactly what the benefit would be to anyone who has – who is in a position in decision makin g positions    Chair I would also just like to point your direction to the affidavit of Colonel Padayachee which at page 475 and paragraph 11 also deals with the involvement of themedia and in particular Mr Wa Afrika.  And then I have just realised General Booysen that I forgot to ask you to confirm one of your affidavits which is attached to your papers and that is in fact the affidavit that you had prepared which was unsigned and that you intended to hand or rather that you handed to Major General Matakata. Can I ask you to just quickly page to 348 of File Z[B] and confirm that that is in fact the affidavit that you had handed in which dealt with your visit to the Gupta residence?     It is Exhibit 29 which is at page – starts at 513.    Do you recognise this article General Booysen?    And do you have any comments in relation to this particular article?  
SEPTEMBER :The first paragraph is paragraph 53 which is on page 50, 50.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair sorry for interruption.    There are credibility findings.    Exactly Chair.    And paragraphs 55 to 58.   They are not credibility findings against both Advocate Shaun Abrahams.     And Advocate Marshall Mogatle.    That is correct Chair.    In the majority judgment Chair.    Thank you that is very helpful.    Chair I think there –     Chair I will have to check but what I do recall Chair that there was an appeal by the NPA and also by I think Advocate Abrahams.    I am not too sure.    One of the parties withdrew but I think there could be an appeal still pend ing.   Thank you Chair.  Chair not really except that the diagram that was shown yesterday pertains to the Amigo case, the Panday matter, the looting of the Secret Services account and then the Cato Manor matter.  I did mention that yesterday but I would just like to reiterate it.  These same prosecutorsinvariably were also involved in the prosecution of members from SARS and also Colonel Sibiya and Dramat in this so called rendition saga.     Chair although there is a majority and a minority judgment but in the end all three the judges set aside the withdrawal of charges by Advocate Abrahams.  Advocate Jiba had already appeared in court.  The withdrawal then was set aside by a full bench of the high court.  So my understanding then is they should go back to where they – they were that the matter should be placed back on the roll.  My understanding is that Advocate Abrahams then sent the docket to Advocate Smith from North West.  Whether Advocate Smith had the authority or the jurisdiction to review whatAdvocate Abrahams – Advocate Ferreira and Van Eerden has already decided upon that is an open question.  But to me it is almost akin to contempt of court for the court to make a finding and then fo r Advocate Abrahams not to place it back on the role but to send it to another advocate to review the matter.    That’s correct Chair.    Chair for lack of a better word when he was appointed all hell broke loose within the DPCI, I cannot describe it in any other way.  He was appointed I think on the 25 t h or 24 t h of December, the very first thing he did and that’s what started to raise some red flags to me, the very first thing he did was I received a call from him six days after his appointment on New Year’s Eve in the afternoon.    Two thousand and ...    2014 Chair, that’s just after General Dramat was suspended.     I received a call from him and he said to me that he would like to see me on the 1 s t of January, Chair normally your operational people work on the 1 s t of January, it’s the first time in m y police career of forty years of which I sat at home for more than three years, that I had been summoned to a meeting in the morning of a New Year ’s Day.     That’s correct Chair.    No Chair, I am goingto get to that Chair.    So Chair he wanted to see me at the Provincial Headquarters where my offic es are situated.  Initially he told me he wanted to see me I think it was ten o’clock.  So I went to bed early on New Year’s Eve, I didn’t celebrate with the family, and I woke up that morning just after seven and it was Ntlemeza, General Ntlemeza.    I’m back at work Chair.    Yes I’m back at work Chair, so I was in my post.  I was busy reviewing all these casesagainst Panday, Madhoe, General Ngobeni etcetera.  I woke up just after seven, he phoned me he said to me no I need to come through now, he is at the office already.  So I sa id to him okay I’ll get dressed, which I did and I drove through to Durban, it took me about half an hour to get there, and on my arrival there I phoned him to ask him where he was, and he said to me no he’s on the 17 t h floor, with the Provincial Commissioner.  Normally Chair when the Head of the Hawks comes to KwaZulu Natal like General Dramat, he phones the Provincial Head like myself, or whoever if it’s Shadrack Sibiya in Gauteng or if it’s Matakata in Cape Town to make travel arrangements for him.  On t his instance hemade his own travel arrangements, he was fetched from the airport by a Colonel and taken to General Ngobeni’s office.  Now Chair would recall that Ngobeni at the time was the subject of a criminal investigation.  I went up to the 17 t h floor ...(intervention)     Chair it was a Colonel Clarence Jones who was one of my colonels, so normally  I would get the call, I will designate someone to go and fetch whoever from the airport.  In this instance Colonel Clarence Jones was phoned, I do not know by whom, to fetch General Ntlemeza from the airport, and I mentioned Colonel Jones here specificall y because during the Panday investigation I was sitting in a restaurant, and I’m digressing a little bit now because the Advocate wants me to say who Jones is, I was sitting at a restaurant in Durban North at the Bite Your Tongue Restaurantwhen Advocate Knox Molele, he’s from the National Prosecuting Authority, walked by and he saw me and he came and sat down with me and we had a chat and he told me that he’s got some concerns that Jones had been making contact with him, at that time Advocate Molele was the Head of Asset of Forfeiture in KZN, and he told me that Jones, who had absolutely nothing to do with the Panday investigation had approached him to write a letter to say that there’s no case in terms of assets forfeiture to have the fifteen million which  I had frozen released.  Simultaneous to that Brigadier Lawrence Kemp, who was the Head of Finances in the Province, phoned me and asked me whoColonel Jones was, so I said to him it’s one of the Colonels that report to me, so he said to me he was snooping around at the Financial offices making queries about the 15million I had frozen.  So I said to Kemp well just ignore him, he’s got nothing to do with that investigation, I had frozen the money and I will be the one that will unfreeze it.  I wrote to General Ntlemeza no fewer than three, it could be four, it could even be five times, reporting Jones conduct to him, he never even bothered to acknowledge receipt of any of my letters, to such an extent that I phoned Brigadier Kubie Moodley, who is now the Head of the Hawks in the Free State, who is in charge of those investigations, those type of investigations, I said to him Kubie what is going on here, and I could sense a feeling of discomfort from Moodley and what I gathered from what he was trying to te ll me that he was being frustrated or inhibited by Ntlemeza.   So Chair back to the meeting at National Head – Provincial Head Quarters I went up in the lift and when I arrived on the 17 t h floor you turn to your left to go to the Provincial Commissioner’s  office and as I approached her office her secretary was also there, so she jumped up and said to me no, no wait, you must go and sit in another office there in the corner.  So I went and sat in a corner in another office.  After about fifteen minutes Ntle meza joined me in the office and he asked me about number one what does my equity profile look like.  I thought it was strange because my equity profile was available on the system at his office, and then he complained and said to me no, noyou’ve got too many Indians here.  So I said well it’s none of my doing, I never did – all these people are from the Scorpions, I cannot just chase them away, I’ve inherited them.  And then he said to me he needed a report from me, and I couldn’t understand what report it is that ...(intervention)    He wanted a report from me.    Well inter alia about my equity profile and also about investigations that we were busy with, but he was very incoherent Chair, I couldn’t make out what he was trying to say.    Yes, yes.    But Chair in my opinion that was just a guise to com e to KwaZulu Natal because what’s he doing talking to a suspect in my criminal investigation.  General Dramat would never have done that.     She was there as well Chair.    And that’s what really concerned me is he spends time with a suspect in a criminal investigation, then he tries to make me believe he’s there to look at my equity profile on the 1 s t of January 2015 in the morning, which didn’t make sense and he then asked me, Chair I’m not exaggerating, the way he communicates you can never figure what he wants or what he doesn’t want, so he asked me a for a report ...(intervention)     Chair that was a ruse.  That was a ruse to do something else.  And that ruse was heimmediately, well he – while Dramat was suspended I wrote out an application to fly to Cape Town, I wanted to go and see Dramat, because I knew Dramat was under severe strain at that time.  And my intention to go and see Dramat was to tell him to hang in there, that we need him, the country needs him, we need him there.  So I sent – when I sent the itinerary unbeknown, well I didn’t realise then until afterwards what his gripe with Dramat was, so I didn’ t say I wanted to go and see Dramat, I wrote there I want to go for investigations, and the thing came back immediately and he wanted a full report from me what do I want to go in Cape Town.  So I thought no I am not going todo that so I bought my own plane ticket and I flew there and I went and I did have the meeting with General Dramat. So he says to me yes and what were you – what did you want to do in Cape Town and he caught me off guard, so I quickly had to think, I said no I wanted to go and see an investigator, Colonel Kobus Roelofse, but he happens to be on leave in Jeffreys Bay or something, which he was, so he says to me no he wants a report and then he – he says to me and he wants a report the following morning, no, no late that afternoon.  I had to phone Brigadier Maransela, Captain Pelser and Colonel Andre Laats to come into the office and extract all this information from the computers for him.  When I was finished with – I then went home, a few minutes later he phones me he says to me no I must come back to town, he wants the thing now.  I got dressed again, all the way back to town, when I arrived there he wasn’t at the office, so I phoned him, I saidokay we’re almost done with the report, he says to me no I must now bring it to the airpor t.  Now I’m starting to get irritated with him, we basically had the same rank, although he was acting as the Head, I said to him why don’t you rather come to office, I’ve asked people to come in on the 1 s t of January, at least just come and greet them and  say thank you for sacrificing the New Year’s day, so he says to me no he is busy patrolling on the beachfront now.     He’s busy patrolling on the beachfront, I don’t know what ...(intervention)    No Chair.    That was not his job.    So Chair so he says to me no, no, no he’s coming back now, I must meet him in front of theoffice, so we hurriedly got the reports together and I took an envelope with the report that he wanted, which I thought he wanted, I went downstairs and Maransela was standing behind me and I think Colonel Laats was also there, and I think Pelser.  So he sat, and that’s when I saw Colonel Jones is driving around in the Provincial Commissioner’s car, not a private car.    One of the State official cars not a private car.    And I immediately felt uncomfortable, I mean Colonel Jones had reported to him, he is driving him around, he is driving him around in a police vehicle that’s allo cated to the Provincial Commissioner, he is meeting with the Provincial Commissioner who is a suspect of mine, but he was sitting in the back of the car.  So he pressed the button for the window to go down and I bent over and I gave him the report and the envelope and he looked into the envelope and he says no but it’s empty.  I said no the report must go inside there.  He had a look at the report and said no, no, no, no, Chair that man has got a very – I cannot describe to you how he talks to people, and he started shouting no, no, and then I had had enough of him, I said to him listen here then you need to start communicating properly, and he could see that I was angry so he jumped out of the car and he took me by the arm and he took me around the back and he says no, no, no, no Johan let us not fight.  Isaid to him but you don’t – I don’t know what it is that you want.  Then he said to me the report he actually wanted was why did I want to go to Cape Town.  Brigadier Maransela actually came to me and pull ed me back and he said to me General just leave it. Maransela travelled with me in my car because he also, we live in the same suburb, well we used to, and on the way back to Amanzimtoti he phoned me and he was on speaker phone, that’s now Ntlemeza now, and he says to me hey Johan we mustn’t fight, you know you people in KZN you are the best and he was basically boosting, I mean Maransela still ...(intervention)    In Cape Town Chair, it could have been a day after or a day or two later, but he travelled from Durban to Cape Town and there he indirectly intimidated Roelofse, Roelofse told me that himself, and later on he took away the investigation from Roelofse.  Chair there was another investigation that we were doing at KZN that I will perhaps talk about later on, it might beirrelevant, which I had to engage with Roelofse and Roelofse expressed his frustrations, he was almost, the impression that I gained, because I wanted to come and see us in KwaZulu Natal and he said to me he can’t, he’s been bound, he cannot leave the office, it’s almost like he was shackled to stay in the Western Cape.     Colonel Kobus Roelofse Chair.    That’s correct.    That’s correct Chair.    Chair it’s highly significant because Kobus Roelofse, C olonel Kobus Roelofse was the lead and main investigator in the looting of the Secret Services account.    No, no Chair so the initial investigation into the looting of the Secret Services account were initiated from a report by General Mark Hanckle which was signed offby Dr de Kock.  That was almos t, if I can call it the whistle blowing point.    Simultaneous to that I think General Dramat then was overseeing the investigation from Head Office but the actual investigator for the looting of  the – we call it the slush fund, was Colonel Kobus Roelofse.  At the very same time that Kobus Roelofse got involved with that investigation General Shadrack Sibiya got – reopened the kidnapping and the murder case of which General Magule was a suspect an d he was also a suspect in the lootingof the slush fund.  So at a much later stage when General Mkhwanazi became the Acting National Commissioner he also directed, because by then there were indications that there was a KwaZulu Natal leg of the looting of the slush fund by Crime Intelligence.  General Mkhwanazi then appointed Brigadier Simon Madonsela, the one that I know, to investigate that leg.  That was a much smaller leg, the investigation that Roelofse did was much more comprehensive, and it was mu ch bigger than the one that Madonsela did in KZN Chair.    I would say so Chair, because ...(intervention)     I would say the Western Cape leg.    They were doing it independently Chair.    That will be the Roelofse one.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Those were the only two things Chair.   That is correct Chair.    No.  No Chair I did not.    No he – when he realised – well when I realised that is not what he wanted to know hesaid to me now I should favour him with the report but I just ignored him I did not send him one.    No Chair.    That would be a correct interpretation Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I could not give him a – I told him I could give him an average more or less.     I did not have the stats in front of me.    The fact is he had those stats available.    At his own office.    So that to me was a ruse to come and ask me about equity.    And then he said to me no, no, no you got too many Indians.  So I said to him but he must realise with our amalgamation of organised crime, commercial crime and the Scorpions I then became the – I inherited those persons.  I could not just now turn them away.    No Chair.    He did not Chair and that is why I interpret his visit on the 1 January about equity and that – and a trip to Cape Town as a ruse to link up with the provincial commissioner.   At that particular time the national commissioner was General Riah Phiyega.     So I – what I am trying to say is to me there was appears to have been an alliance between General Ngobeni and General Phiyega.     And with Ntlemeza being appointed I think and that is my observation Chair that he – one of his first tasks were to go and take care of that particularinvestigation against General Ngobeni and then secondly to go and interfere with the investigation of Colonel Kobus Roelofse.     Chair Mr Innocent Khuba is from IPID.  When Mr McBride and myself met when I returned back to work I met Mr Khuba and he was part of the team appointed by Mr McBride.  So they were revisiting the Panday investigation and the investigations that had become dormant in my absence.  But at the same time obviously one discusses other issues as well and at that time they were under pressure because of the so called rendition thing.  And …    No Chair what happened is when I returned back to my office Chair would recall I received a telephone call from Mr McBride.     Obviously he had now become aware of what was going on and I do not know in the media or whether someone reported that to him.     I then gave him a report.    And because IPID had oversight over SAPS     We decided and for tactical reasons as well.    For IPID to take over these investigations.    Exactly Chair.    And corruption.    And then there is also that – also that nice little ride at the bottom that says any case that the head of IPID decide to allocate to IPID.     The second – the second leg of their mandate is if they investigate with the IC – with the previous ICD Act they could make recommendations about disciplinary steps but with the new IPID Act they – they can actually instruct the police to initiate disciplinary steps.     But they can do the criminal investigation Chair.    In summary Chair and as early as 2013 when General Dramat was the head of the Hawks Chair would recall that there now were investigations against RichardMdluli.  The initial investigation I did not mention – I do not think – I might have mentioned that in my statement.  The initial investigation into the alleged murder case and the kidnapping case at some point in time had also been done by General Mtlemeza before he was – he became the head of the Hawks.  I cannot recall what his position was. He basically white-washed that investigation to say tha t there is no case.  But what…     Yes.    But that was a wishy washy investigation that he conducted Chair.  What e merges from Khuba’s statement is that as early as 2013 there seems to have been an unholy alliance between Mdluli and Ntlemeza to get rid of Dramat.  Because after the Sunday Times’ so called expose on the renditionmatter Dramat gets suspended and they ar e now facing Dramat and Sibiya are now facing the charges of rendition.  There was an initial report which Innocent Khuba from IPID wrote that I think went to Parliament in which he indicates that there appears to be a case to answer by General Dramat and Shadrack Sibiya.  But the investigation had not been concluded and I still recall asking Mr Khuba Innocent I said to him, Innocent we both investigators something is not right here.  Why did you advance a report on the investigation which you know was not complete yet?  And his answer to me because I said to him, I am going to cross-examine you I am going to be a lawyer now I am going tocross-examine you.  And that is how I spoke to him.  Because it did not make sense.  You do not send a report unless your  investigation is completed and his answer to me was, there was pressure on him from Advocate Mosing.  Now the same Mosing who was involved in my matter and the same Mosing who was involved in setting the stage to have the Amigos case withdrawn.  He said t here is pressure from Advocate Mosing to provide him with either the report or the docket I cannot recall.  But what – but then comes to light is unbeknown to me at the time that I wanted to fly to Cape Town I only established now later on why there is this animosity towards General Dramat from Ntlemeza’s side.  According to Khuba Ntlemeza put pressure on him to finalise the investigation.  And I do not want to quote from the statement but the words to the effect were used that if there might – if he experiences problems Richard Ndluli had told him via Ntlemeza now that he will look after him.  At some stage he even phoned InnocentKhuba on his wife’s phone and he would come to Khuba’s house, Innocent Khuba’s house.    296.  Paragraph?    Yes Chair.     “Again in October 2013 this is now the statement by Innocent Khuba Chair, my wife called me wh ile I was watching TV and informed me that Mlegazi referring to General Ntlemeza was at the gate.  She then handed me her phone and he requested me to order the security to open for him as he had valuable information to tell me.  When he was inside he said  that he was – he has urgent information to tell.  He said on Friday he was at the airport and he met with Ndluli who requested him to tell me that I must not be afraid when dealing with rendition case because there were people who were looking after me.  He said he was asked by Mdluli to deploy people for my safety and that if I see any suspicious car behind meI should call him.  I was surprised because I never met or spoke with Mdluli.  During my entire investigation with Colonel Mokunkwe he never mentioned Ndluli’s name.”    Chair but if I can just conclude my summary of his statement.     The day that Dramatwas suspended I do not know whether they met or whether he had phoned Khuba but it is reflected in his statement Ntlemeza told him his day had now come to head the Hawks.     5.13?    Cycad Centre.    So to me it is clear that there was a strategy from the National Prosecuting Authority sideand I here I will say from Mosing’s side I do not know at whose behest but from his – from the NPA’s side and from the police’s side Ntlemeza to get rid of General Dramat.  And the reason was simple Chair.  General Dramat was the one the driving force put – on a – for a number    Inter alia the Secret Services account, the looting and it was – it had become common cause before I returned to work that General Dramat was supporting me in my investigations.  Because he basically took my side when there was this disagreement between myself and General Phiyega.     Chair I agree the problem with that is and Mr McBride calls it th e Blue Curtain.    Chair believe me if any person at whatever level becomes a whistle -blower I am talking about SAPS I am not talking about any other department.  You are dead in the water.  You are ostr acised, you are worked out.  They – in my instance you get prosecuted, you get suspended and despite of court hearings courts basically agreeing that there is no case against me, being exonerated they will not leave you alone.     And …    That is the one Chairand the other thing is Chair the promotion system in the police in my view should be revised.  Because I know a number of officers they will not set a foot wrong or report something because they are scared that they will not be promoted.  Chair I have sat on those promotion – how to – in the past how it worked is you had to attain a certain qualification    You had to write an exam to become a sergeant.  You had to write an exam to become a warrant officer.  You had to write an exam to become a commissionedofficer and then attend a course t o become a lieutenant.  Then you had to attend every second year for every second rank you had to attend another course.  So currently how it works.  The – a post is advertised and whether you have the right attributes or qualifications Chair I sat on those panels at senior level where the – invariably the decisions are taken before any of the candidates appear.  It is a farce.     Yes Chair.  It is – the promotional system in SAPS is a complete farce.  In most of the panels that I sat and one of – I sat on some panels with at – for a very senior post with General Ncubeni and we would sit there and we independently have to mark candidates on various aspects and once the ca ndidate leaves the room she would ask each one of us.  Johan then I will say 4.  Why do you give him 4?  Then I wills say well that is – and then – so what I eventually did Chair is if the candidate deserved a 6 I will givehim a 6.  If he deserved a 3 I w ill put a 3 there.  If she said to me, Johan then I listen what the rest say I will say no they all say a 6 I also say a 6.  But then I put my 3 there.  Because they decide before the time who is going to be promoted.  It is very rare that the candidate and Chair believe me it has got nothing to do with race.  I am not talking about whites and blacks here there are many, many black officers, good officers that are being overseeing because they do the right thing.  They worked with me.  I have sat on those p anels.  I talk of experience.    That is correct Chair.    Just on that point.  I am not casting any aspersions on General Matakata.  I merely handed her the document.  I am not aware what transpired afterwards.  She may or may have not so I do not want it to be read that I am casting aspersions on her because she is an ex colleague of mine with whom I had had a healthy relationship and I still have a healthy relationship with her.  So for purposes of my evidence I just want to clea r that up.    No not really Chair it was more – I wanted to bring it to – because at that juncture there were these allegations about the Gupta’s and state capture.  So…     I just thought it would be prudent for me to bring that to h er attention that I had met with the Gupta’s myself.    And nothing else Chair.    I am not aware of anything pursuant to my affidavit Chair but there may or may not have been steps taken up I am not privy to that.     I agree Chair.    Which paragraph is that?    Yes Chair.    Well Chair well to – to interfere with investigations such as the meeting with General Ngobeni.  Such as interfering with Colonel Roelofse in that investigation.  The fact that I report – I personally reported corruption to him and he did absolutely nothing about it.  To me it is abundantly clear that there were certain matters that he had to deal with.    Indirectly Chair because General Ngobeni was part of the Panday investigation.  So in meeting her I would suggest that in a way indirectly he interfered with that investigation.    Yes I do Chair.    Chair if one goes back into the history when General Dramat was the head of the Hawks he personally – he actively pursued the investigations against RichardMdluli.  He backed me in my investigations.  After he was – after he left the service there were rumours in the media that he had approached General Menu for the Nkandla docket.  A while later while I was in Cape Town when I launched my book he actually came to the launch and the day after we had coffee and I thought I want to verify that with him personally.  And I asked him, did you ask for the Nkandla docket and he said to me yes he did.  So my conclusion is that they had to get rid of Dramat because he was looking at the Mdluli’s of the day, he w as backing Booysen in the Panday investigation and various other investigations.  He placed him with some unpliable like Ntlemeza andall of a sudden all those investigations basically became dormant again.    That is correct Chair.    No, no Chair we had her name I think the name I had forgotten was the person that introduced me to Duduzane.    That is correct Chair.    Chair that is the person that Ntlemeza appointed to take over from me.     Yes Chair.    So …    Chair when he appointed Zikhali after – while I was actually still in the post.     It became evident tome from reports from KwaZulu Natal because I still communicate with the Hawks frequently.    That things that Ntlemeza placed in motion he continued with that.  For instance the removal of Colonel Sonnekus from her post.  In spite of the fact that they knew that it was unlawful they were steadfast and resolute and not and he was the leader, he was driving the bus at the time and not allowing her to go back to her post.     Zikhali.    By then – when he was appointed Chair she had already been removed.    She was transferred and he is the one who told her that she is being transferred.  So it is clear to me he was still doing the bidding of what Ntlemeza had set in motion.    Chair there was – the Hawks when we inherited the Scorpions we also inherited they had chartered accountants working with them.  So in KZN we had a Brigadier Vleck who was the chartered accountant which is very necessary in investigating these complicated financial matters.  Ntlemeza made Vleck’s life a living hell.  He basically forced him out heeventually resigned.  So  as we speak there is no chartered accountant working with the Hawks in KZN as far as I am aware.  He had appointed people at provincial level and if you look at the – and the appointments are people that I would regard as incompetent Chair I deal with the m and I know some of them.  Well incompetent in that particular field.  They might be competent in the uniform branch.  Some of the senior people that he appointed comes from the uniform branch.  They do not have any investigative experience.  So it cascad ed down to all the levels.  So from provincial level to provincial commander level they would then start as posts became available to – and Chair during –while I was still there there was actually a standing joke amongst the provincial heads the majority of the people that he appointed either came from the Eastern Cape where he comes from originally or from Limpopo where he – where he had been for the latter part of his career.     Chair what happenedthere is when…     That is correct.    Chair what happened there is when the previous national head of commercial crime General Hans Meiring went on retirement General Dramat appointed General Motsepe into the position has head of commercial crime.  And I know General Motsepe is a very capable competent person who can handle that post.  But when Ntlemeza assumed office he transferred Motsepeand created a vacancy and the post was advertised and the person that he then appointed in that post is a person by the name of General Alfred Khana.  Now Khana’s history Chair he was the provincial commander from commercial crime in a couple of year previously.  And according to General Hans Meiring he had been busy with an investigation against General Khana relating to counte rfeit goods.  And it appears that Khana realised the writing was on the wall and he resigned.  He then went to another government department I cannot recall which one it was but nevertheless he landed up back with the Hawks being the head of commercial cri me.  And while I am there Chair a couple of months ago I received a call from a Captain in East London I do not know him at all.  It is a black gentleman.  He met me here on the – next to the road and he handed me a pile of documents and he complained to me that General Khana was interfering with an investigation into multi-million rand corruption which involves theMinister Dlamini.   I took possession of those documents. I phoned Brigadier Bassie from the Hawks head office.  I met him the following day at the Wimpy in – at Attebury where I explained to him what had occurred and I handed him those documents.  There are also other indications Chair I have been phoned by and I would not like to mention this person because then they might ostracise him.  It is  a very experienced investigating officer in KwaZulu Natal.  He was dealing with an investigation of appointments or applications for a medical school in KwaZulu Natal University which also related to certain corrupt activities.  And he also complained to me that General Khana had beeninterfering into that investigation.      I do Chair.    I would not say the Cato Manor matter but definitely the Booysen matter and the Mdluli matter.    Chair the point I wantto make here is if you [indistinct] deposes her approach re Mdluli and re Booysen they were vastly different.  In the Mdluli matter you have  a high court judge, Judge Murphy who criticised General Phiyega for almost wanting Ndluli to come back to work in spite of very serious allegations hanging over his head.  Excuse me Chair.  In my matter in spite of the court having ruled that there is no case against me in a review application in spite of a person that she had appointed Advocate Naseer Cassiem to do a hearing on me who exonerated me she was bent – she was hell bent on getting rid of me. She offered me those three options which I testified about later.  Chair what – what I haveforgotten to mention is and I – when I went back to work I received and I went back in September and that December I received a notice from her that I should indicate to her why I should not be dismissed from the police.  It did not make sense to me.      That is true Chair.    Chair she quoted a section in the police regulations which basically were designed if posts became I am looking for the correct word now.    Redundant that is right thank you Chair.  If a post becomes redundant then you can be relieved of your duties and they will then pay you out for the remainder of your contract.    I think she…   No it was not Chair.    Along those lines Chair.    She did not go into those details she just mentioned the regulations Chair.     I should not be dismissed.   Now Chair that to me did not make sense at all.  On the one hand you have someone like Richard Mdluli who has serious charges of fraud, corruption, murder, kidnapping hanging over his head.  The courts have pronounced on that and she is still actively attempts to get him back to the office by making an – or deposing to an affidavit in the Mdluli matter in the high court and the judge actually criticised her for that.  And in my mat ter in spite of being the courts having found in my favour and the disciplinary officer I refused to take any of the three options, I go back to work andin that December I think she gave me two weeks to say why I should not be dismissed from the police and the two weeks expired I think on the 23 December and Chair I know how they operate.  I knew what was going to happen.  No matter what I say on the 23 r d when the time expires I would have gotten a letter like General Sibiya had gotten that I am dismissed and the same thing happened to Shadrack Sibiya and it takes you forever and a day by the time I would have won my cases to get back to office I would have retired in any event.  So I wrote a letter back to her I gave her two days to withdraw that letter or  else I will seek relief from the court.  And then I think it was around about the 20 t h a day or two before the date expired I received a letter from her office not signed by her stating from one of her officers that the general or the commissioner is not available to articulate her response and then I realised they were leading me into a trap because I knew what was going to happen on the 23 r d or 24 t h.  Because by then it is ChristmasEve there is no courts to approach so I immediately set off and went to the high court I cannot remember if it was the high court or the labour court and obtained the interdict against her and that is where the matter ended.    Chair there was no basis.    There was absolutelyno valid reason or lawful reason that she had to – that she could have dismissed me from my post.    That is correct Chair. CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.  I think one other thing she also mentioned if my memory serves me correctly is that the trust relationship between myself and the provincial commissioner had broken down.    That was part of that letter.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the problem that she had is she had no locus standi because of the Gl enister judgment.    And it is on that basis that I managed to get the interdict.     That she had no authority over me.    General Dramat had.  And I think she realised that when she saw my papers.    And that they never opposed it.    Chair the ground coverage document is a document that emanated from crime intelligence in KwaZulu Natal.  When the Cato Manor investigationstarted and we had this – this focus on Cato Manor I one day went to Mr Bheki Cele because I could not understand what was going  on and I said to him, does – can he perhaps explain to me why is there this urgency to get rid of us?  He then explained to me that two things.  One is when it came to my appointment he had a …     Mr Bheki Cele the current Minister of Police.    Chair I think – Icannot recall whether he had..    No I think – no I think by then he was also himself suspended and had left.     And he – that is correct Chair and he mentioned two things to me.  He said my appointment the then Minister of Police was not happy with Nathi Mthethwe I do not know why.  He preferred someone else from the Eastern Cape.  But in the end Mr Cele was the national commissioner at the time it appears that he managed to convince the Minister that Ishould be appointed.  The second thing is he said that he had a visit  from while he was the national commissioner a visit from Richard Ndluli who requested him to stop the investigation against Ndluli and he refused.  The next thing a document comes from crime intelligence in KwaZulu Natal it is commonly known as the ground  coverage document.  This document Chair is a – it is a very convoluted assembly of information and disinformation and conjecture mixed with facts but some of the important allegations in this document states that Mr Bheki Cele and a number of senior politicians had met I think it was in Grey Town where they discussed how they were going to unseat the thenPresident Mr Jacob Zuma.  A lot of the issues I – my name is also in that report in that Mr Bheki Cele owns taxies in the Stanger area and that he gets Booysen who then gets the Cato Manor people to take out his opponents and this is why I became a general.  That story eventually also appeared in the Sunday Times.  I think it was – SAPS disavowed any information pertaining to SAPS in that docket.  Senior politicians like – I stand to be corrected – I think it was Mr Tokyo Sexwale at the time made comments about the document and he actually said that the elephant in the room was Mdluli.  This document and why I know it comes from a specific individual Chair – I can explain later if it is necessary – but it definitely came from KwaZulu-Natal.  It was then given to Richard Mdluli and he was still – still in office because he declassified it.  He then took that document and sent it to the then President Mr  Jacob Zuma basically telling – showing him what these people are busy with and I think it isroundabout just after that where he also wrote a letter to the President where he said that should he return to work that he would assist the President.    Chair I have mentioned before that the SARS so called rogue unit, the Cato Manor so called death squad and the so called rendition investigation are all in necessary can be linked.  In all of those instance s the intelligence services would leak information to – to journalists the same twojournalists time and time again.  Stefan Hofstatter and Mzilikazi wa Afrika.  Exposes would follow.  Once the exposes are published within a work or two the Johan Von Logge nbergs, the Anwa Dramats, the Johan Booysens, the Shadrack Sibiyas and so I can carry on are suspended.  Investigations that they are busy with become dormant.  It is no coincidence Chair and it is – that has been the modus operandi.  Leaking of information and Chair I think it is important that I mention that the current editor of the Sunday Times Mr Siqoko he at least had the courage of his conviction to approach me and extend a hand to me to apologise.  The editor of the time Mr Ray Hartley he is missing  inaction so I do not want to paint the current editor under the – well blame him for the ills of what happened previously.  And Chair that is one example how the media could be abused to further nefariums, nefarious agendas by certain individuals.  I hav e been approached by a professor from one of the universities who is busy writing a book on how the – how the media could be exploited or used to further nefarious goals.      Un-amended Chair.    Which page?    Yes, yes I have found it Chair.    I confirm this is the statement Chair.    That is right.  General Matakata.    I do Chair.   I was Chair.    Chair I refer to the compilation of this document when I was invited to the Nelson Mandela Foundation.  That is where this documen t originated from. It is a combination of universities that did research on and they titled the document Betrayal of the Promise how South Africa is being stolen.  Itinter alia narrates some of the issues that I dealt with in my investigation and they acc urately     Reflect what…    Chair I am not going to talk from my statement.    The first thing Chair I would like to say I am very – I really appreciate this opportunity after six of – and seven years of – of attack after attack after attack of people that supposed to be protecting me.  Chair I am grateful for this opportunity.  It is – and I am also grateful for the two advocates that dealt with me Advocate September and Advocate Pretorius and also the investigators Mr Groenewald for the understanding in the way the y dealt with this matter.    Chair I am going toconclude I do not want to make a long speech.     But as long as the people that I have mentioned in m y statement they can change the head of the Hawks, they can change the head of the NPA, they can change the State President but as long as these people remain there Chair and I will be proven right if they so happen to stay there.  It happened with Mr Nxasana.  Mr Nxasana I did not know him personally I had managed to meet him at a much later stage.  Mr Nxasana felt the brunt of a cabal within the NPA.  I felt the brunt of a cabal with – when I was member of the Hawks.  Unless they get rid of the rotten app les within the NPA and the police and the Hawks Chair we are doomed.  Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.   Thank you Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  The President.    Nothing further Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No.  No Chair it was Advocate Ferreira.   And Van Eeden.    They were handling it. They were appointed by Advocate  Nxasana.  They were both prosecuting in the matter.    Advocate Jiba had already appeared in court.    They had already prepped me.We had already done our consultations whenAdvocate Abrahams withdrew the charges.    Indeed Chair what I – what I also read in the judgment is that – and I find it quite strange – that Advocate Abrahams between him and Advocate  Mokgatle had reviewed the matter without Advocate  Jiba having maderepresentations.    So it was an initiative by Advocate Abrahams without representations.    And in – and that is the reason why it was sent to Advocate Smit.    If not then I – well I would then say the case should have been placed back on the – on the court roll.    Without having.    Without sending it to another almost like second guessing or – it almost like forum shopping Chair.    To find a prosecutor who will eventually.    (Indistinct) the matter.   Chair when this whole investigation – if I can say the Cato Manor investigation - started it wasamazing how many resources was utilised in that investigation.  I think at one stage they had about nine prosecutors camping in Durban in a hotel on the beachfront.  I would say for more than a year.  Every time we would go to court there was an entourage of prosecutors - five to six sometimes seven prosecutors but on average at least four prosecutors and there had been 20 remands.  17 or 16 of them i n the High Court.  The prosecutors knew.    No Chair.  In the matter in which myself and Cato Manor were prosecuted.  The lead prosecutor - Advocate Maema – knew the matter was not going to proceed and in spite of that they would every time fly down the day before book – check into a hotel a number of prosecutors.  I would even – I would even go as far to say they could have used a local prosecutor to have the matter remanded because it is – it was like a – all those appearances were like three/four minutes and most of the discussions took place in chambers and we would go into court and the actual proceedings would be two or three minutes.     And there were a number of advocates involved in this – in the prosecution of Cato Manor and I do mention some – some of them here like Advocate J J Mlotshwa who incidentally also happens to be involved inother prosecutions of people fighting prosecution.There is Advocate Dawood Adams.  Now Chair Advocate  Dawood Adams - there had been an investigation against Advocate Dawood Adams by the SSU previously where he was charged with the Witness Protection Program and it emerged that while he was in charge of the program he appropriated funds from the program for his own personal benefit.  He had booked – I think it was two apartments in the beach front – the Waterfront area in Cape Town where his children stayed while they were studying at university and the other one was used by himself and friends.  When he was eventually caught out after this investigat ion - Ithink the investigation was done by Mr  Willie Hofmeyr – certain recommendations were made for disciplinary steps.  As far as I know nothing was done about that for whatever reason – there might have been valid reasons but what concerns me is there you have an advocate from the National Prosecuting Authority stealing money.  That is what it is and he does not even get a slap.  I know – I know at the time he was suspended for a while – I think – but no criminal charges were pressed against him.  Yet Advocate Abrahams uses the same - Advocate Dawood Adams sends him to Greece to go and find evidence against me and that is what I find so abhorrent.  That people from a National Prosecuting Authority there is prima facie evidence that they have committed a serious criminal offence.  They are being used to investigate people who are investigating corruption.  The few prosecutors I have mentioned now Chair.     Chair there were no local prosecutors.  It is always Advocate Maema, Raymond Mathenjwa, J J Mlotshwa and a few othersand as far as I am concerned they were wasting taxpayers’ money.    Flying five to six people down.    Knowing the case was going to be remanded.    Check into a hotel on the beach front.    And then fly back thefollowing day.    Hm.    Chair.  Chair in the beginning.    In the beginning in the High Court appearances it was like a circus at the court.  They would have caspers standing outside, snipers on the roof, personal body protection and I think it was here by abo ut the 8 t h or the 9 t h appearance at the High Court that I commented in the media that they are wasting taxpayers’ money by flying this whole entourage down just to do a remand and after that comment of mine the figures tapered down but in the last couple appearances there would at least be – at least two or three advocates with – with other personnel from the National Prosecuting Authority.  Whether they were protectors or whether they were media liaison officers I do not know, but on average the last couple there were to be about four to five but prior to my complaint there were some times be up to five to six prosecutors who fly down – up and down just to come and do a remand.     No Chair.  I had nothing to do with the investigation against Advocate  Dawood.  It came to my knowledge and attention whereas he was sent to Greece to find evidence against me obviously having an investigator background then you start to investigate the people who – who are against you and I established that he – he himself was a subject of a criminal – well not of a criminal investigation and it is clear from that report by Advocate Willie Hofmeyr that money was appropriated byAdvocate Dawood which in my view is – either constitutes fraud or theft but nothing happens to him.    Chair as far as I – well what I have heard with regards to the disciplinary matters or the disciplinary matter I think the period during which they had to take steps had lapsed.  That is my understanding.  So whether it was done on purpose or not I cannot comment on that but theft and fraud prescribes after 20 years not like in a disciplinary matter that it prescribes in 60 days.  So I – I cannot understand why no theft charges or fraud charges were preferred against Advocate  Adams.    Chair I will start with Advocate Bheki Mnyathi who personally told me at the High Court in Durban that because of what was happening to him – as Chair would recall he was the prosecutor who was going to prosecute Toshan Panday and Colonel Navin Madhoe for the attempt to bribe me.  He is the one who received the let ter from Advocate Mrwebi essentially querying the prosecution and he then penned a legal opinion andindicated that he was going to indict Colonel  Madhoe in the High Court for corruption and he told me personally that his stance on the matter had caused him to be overlooked for promotion and he intended resigning which he in the end did.I know that Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa because of what had happened to him in KZN he also resigned from the NPA.  Both those advocates are now in private practice.Then there is Advocate Gerrie Nel and Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach.  Both - in the instances that I have testified about were both involved in a number of those prosecutions.  Gerrie Nel was involved with the previous prosecution of Mr  Selebi but both also left because of – of what was happening at the NPA.     No Chair it is not.    No it is not the same Mzinyathi.  This is the one from Gauteng.     Chair, which I testified about yesterday.    I think this one is an Ms Mzinyathi and the other one is Mnyathi Chair if I am not.     No.  He is Mnyathi. Bheki – Bheki Mnyathi.    And the one from Gauteng is Mzinyathi.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I did not have enough information – personal information although I was subsequently obviously privy to the Justice  Mokgoro Report and other newspaper reports.  I – I did not have enough at my disposal to add him there.     Indeed Chair.    Chair that – that would be the circle to the – to the right?  They were Chair although there were a number of other prosecutors whose names are.     Are not included.  There are – I recall there were two female prosecutors as well or lady prosecutors.    Who names I do not have.  I did not include them there.  So the ones that I have.     Some of them – for instance Advocate Adams I have included him there Chair because he was sent to Greece according to papers by Advocate  Shaun Abrahams.    To go and establish ifhe could find evidence against myself.  Him and Advocate  Maema.    That was the sum total of.    Of his involvement.    Advocate Chauke I think was more an administrative.    Role that he played in signing letters.    Advocates Mathenjwa, Maema and J J Mlotshwa they were active involved in travelling to KZN and doing the prosecutions.    Advocate Pretorius he was in the background.    On one occasion he wrote a legal opinion.    Pertaining to Cato Manor investigation.   Chair if I could assist.  If we look at Advocate Jiba at the bottom perhaps.    This circle intercepts with other circles.    So she – the main circle shares in this - the looting of the Secret Service Account and the role she played there was the withdrawal of charges against Richard Mdluli but her name also intercepts with the Cato Manorinvestigation.    Bar the one or two who – whose names I do not know Chair – who I saw at court but whose names I do not know.   Although their names appear in answering affidavits of Advocate  Abrahams.    But I do not know them.    That is correct Chair but I just want to clarify one aspect there.  If you look at and it could perhaps be slightly misleading.  If you look at the top Chair the Panday investigation where you have Advocate.     He was the prosecutor who provisionally withdraw the charges.     In a R17 million case.    But the reasons at the time.    No Chair.  There was a 60 million one.    Then there was a 17 million one.    That was the 15 million that the created invoices for.   Which eventuallyturned – which eventually came to 17 million.     1-7.    But because of the recordings that were indistinct.  He provisionally withdraw the matter and Chair would recall Chair asked me where – where that docket is now and my response was it is now with IPID.     So.    I do not want this.    Picture to betray all these prosecutors as people being on the wrong side.     That is true Chair. CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.    That is true Chair.  Chair - Advocate Paver – I think I have already explained why he had withdrawn those charges.  Then there is Advocate Vimbani.    Who is the – the Head of the Commercial Crime Court in KwaZulu -Natal.    Whom I – whom I had not dealt with personally.    But she has taken over the investigation as – as Chair would recall.    The Amigos case that    When – when the charges were withdrawn against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  That docket was then taken away from Dunywa – Advocate Dunywa.  And given to Advocate Vimbani.    I will leave it at that Chair.  The rest of the prosecutors - Advocate Mrwebi - he has been involved with quite a number of these cases.    Advocate Jiba with a number of these cases.    Advocate Noko with some of the cases.  Advocate Mosing with some of the cases.  Advocate Pretorius with some of the cases.  Advocate  Mathenjwa with some of the cases.  Advocate  Maema with a number of these cases    That is correct Chair.    That is so Chair.    Indirectly Chair, and then Maransela looked at me and he just shook his head and I also just shook my head.  So Chair the first thing he did after his appointment was to come and to meet one of my suspects.  The second thing he did is I know from there, I haven’t got the exact dates, he travelled to Cape Town where the lead investigator in the looting of the Secret Services account was Colonel Kobus Roelofse.     And later on it became clear to me that there was – because in my disciplinary hearing General Phiyega also testified.  And in that hearing I openly accused of protecting General Ngobeni.  And she said to me no she is not. And I pointed out to her well you are aware of the fact that there are these allegations of corruptions that – corruption that is being investigated.  And she was under oath.  And she said no it is not true.  Then I said – and I knew that she was going to say that so I brough t with me to my hearing my application in the Jiba review matter in which I mentioned her as a respondent.  I think she was respondent number 3.  So I gave her the document.  I said you the respondent in which I detail thenature of the corruption so you c annot say that you did not know about it.    Chair their mandate is twofold.  One is to investigate certain criminal offences against SAPS members like death in custody.  Rape by police officers.     Chair and I am saying that in the context of.   People wanting to come forward.    To expose the rot in the police.    And believe me Chair.    It is – corruption isrife in the police.    I have been out of the police for two years but I still work with Law Enforcement.   I am levelling accusations against prosecutors here.     And senior police officers but there are a number of prosecutors Chair that I still work with.    That do a.    An honest day’s job.    And a number of policemen.  But unfortunately those people are at the mercy.    Of people who are appointed above them who are doing the bidding of the people above them.    Chair historically how the promotions work in provinces.  The provinces are – they deal with the promotions in their own p rovince.  For instance if a Captain’s post was advertised the short – the long listing will be done at provincial level.  The short listing will be done.  The interviews will – everything will be done at provincial level.  Then the recommendations go to national.  At national they will either sanction it or if they think that your equity profile might not be right they might take the number two candidate which is not a problem.  The problem started when General Ntlemeza became the Head of the Hawks.  He hij acked thewhole promotion system of the Hawks.  All the posts that were advertised within the Hawks were dealt with from his office.  He excluded the Provincial Heads – all of us.  At a meeting at Polokwane I took issue with that and I said to him we as Pr ovincial Heads – now I was talking on behalf of all the nine provinces because we discussed it amongst ourselves the Provincial Heads.  I said we as Provincial Heads we – we know the people in the provinces.  We know the dynamics of crime in the provinces.  In KZN for instance I know about faction fights – political killings.  I do not know about gangsterism that occur in Cape Town.  So I would know which – the profile of the person who needs to be appointed and then he basically made some excuse saying to me no well he will incorporate us in the – in the processes in the future which he never did but what he did in fact do - which I found very strange.  He co-opted a police officer from KwaZulu-Natal Major-General Ngembe.  Now she was outside the Hawks.  Sh e wasfrom the SAPS side and she was at Human Resources in KwaZulu -Natal and he would take her all over the country to do interviews and appointments.  I bumped into her one day in the lift at KwaZulu -Natal and she said to me no she is – she has been co-opted by General Ntlemeza to do these appointments and she said to me it is – it is not her field and she does not know anything about investigations.  Chair at KwaZulu-Natal for instance - I always say the person who carries the purse calls the shots.  So there where you – your HR is a very important component of – of a company or a unit.  In my instance for instance there was a Captain then she is a Colonel now –Sonnekus.  She was the Support Head dealing with finances, dealing with appointments.  General Ntlemeza without any cause sent me a notice of an intention to suspend her for a very trivial matter which she was not even responsible for.  So I wrote back to him and I said to him this matter has been disposed of.  Discipline is a line management function.  I regard the matter as – as finalised.  A week after he suspended me he suspended her.  She sat at home for a full year.     Yes Chair.    He suspended her.  She sat at home for a full year.  She then – he then charged her in terms of the Disciplinary Code.  She asked me to come and give evidence which I did.  We raised a few points in limine and the matter was remanded and I told the Chairperson because whatGeneral Ntlemeza would do is he would get his cohorts from other provinces.  General Sibiya calls them the “assassins”.  He would get them there and your fate is sealed with - with the type of disciplinari es that – that he concocted.  So I told the Chairperson there and I told the – the employer representative if they proceed with this matter it will probably be taken on review in the Labour Court and having given them the facts I will make sure that the taxpayer will not pay for that.  They will – they will pay the (indistinct).  They will pay from their own pockets and we never heard from them again.  Then a couple of months later she got a letter to go back to work.    They abandoned it Chair and up until today I know she has been writing for a finding on the matter – up until today there has been no finding.  What they did is when they – when they saw that they could not take it further they told her to go back to work but then transferred her to another place.  I understand she has taken that matter to the SSSBC and as recent as about two or three months ago there was an agreement between the SSSBC – well between her and the police during the arbitration process that she would take up her original post but she – she had been out of that post for – for the better part of two years.  What I am trying to demonstrate Chair is the same thing happened at national lev el where there is a Brigadier Vermaak and Brigadier.    More or less Chair.  When – when I wrote to him that.   Management – line management function has been disposed of.     I did not hear from him again except about three weeks later.  I did not mention t his.  A Colonel arrived in my office from his office.     And he said he is here to do an investigation.  I said what investigation.  He says no the – some files went missing out of another member’s car.     So I said to him who sent you.  He said no it is Ntlemeza.  Now that related to the thing that they wanted to suspend.   That person for.    So I said to but it is finalised.    So I said how long are you here for.  He said to me no for three days.  So I still said to him listen here go and sit in your hotel room.  Buy yourself a barrel of Kentucky then you can have some Kentucky.    Then go back and tell General Ntlemeza he must stop – stop poking his nose into my province.    Tired of his antics.    So he left – then he left it.    Then he suspendedme.  Ntlemeza suspended me and about a week.     That is.    For the fraud matter.    Yes Chair.    And about a week after he suspended me he suspende d her as well.   It was a lady Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair all they want to do is they want to take control of key posts.     She was unlawfully suspended.    She went back to work.    After their hands were basically forced.    Because there were questions in Parliament of members sitting at home for more than a year.    On suspension.  So they were under pressure to let her go back to work.     Now she goes back to work but they do not want her in that position.    So they transfer her to – to another position.    Away from province.    And it is that decision that she took to the SSSBC.     Chair that is – that is equivalent to – for.    Yes it is.    Very similar to the CCMA but for Government Officials.    Chair when the Hawks were established General Dramat became the Head of the Hawks.  They advertised post for the Heads of Hawks in nine provinces.  Nine of us were appointed as Head of the Hawks.  When Ntlemeza came there – and most of them were I would say the majority if not all of them were capable people to lead the provinces from the Hawks’ side but then the Glenister Judgment came out and according to the Glenister Judgment the appointments had to be made by the Head of the Hawks.  Prior to the Glenister Judgment appointments had to be made by the National Commissioner.  So Ntlemeza used that as an excuse to readvertise all– all nine of the posts and except for one.  I think it was General Ntinka who also on her own accord went to another – to another post later on but out of the nine provinces he appointed eight new people as Head of the Hawks.    No Chair.    In my case Chair what he did with me while – while I was suspended.   That is when he advertised and I still had my matter pending at the SCA.     While that matter was pending he appointed someone else in my post.     No permanently Chair as part of that advertisement group.   So technically speaking that post I should – I was in that post until.    The court case was disposed of.   So he did no wait for that.    He advertised the post and filled it with someone else.     Chair at that stage I had been in and out of court over a period of five or six years and I justthought to myself if I have to – you had to pick your fights.    That is so and Chair – I mean Chair every single matter that I took to court.  As I have said and I will – I will mention it later on in terms of the – the financial implications to the taxpayer.  Every single one I won but Chair litigating with – with the NPA and SAPS they use taxpayers money.     Myself and the Cato Manor guys we – we had to find funds to – to fight – to fight what was  happening to us but at that stage besides being exhausted Chair you have to pick your fights.    Because if you – youare fighting all over the show.  And you spread yourself so thin on the ground.    So some of these things I had to let go.  Other – other more important issues I pursued.     Yes Chair.   He is still there Chair.  Chair Brigadier Vermaak was the National Support Head at General Dramat’s office and Colonel Lynn Deveshan was one of her subordinates.  Chair at any meeting whether you are a woman or – the way he spoke to people.  Sometimes I would cringe.  He would shout at them.  He will make racial remarks.  He would be little people and Vermaak and Deveshan told me personally that they just could not handle it any longer.  I mean he would – if - and that was not only with the two ofthem.  If he had found out that anyone had any contact with General Dramat.    He would go berserk.  I just could not understand why at one stage.    And then eventually Brigadier Vermaak took a transfer and so did Colonel  Deveshan.  Alsovery key posts because that was Human Resources and when General Lebeya was appointed I actually approached Vermaak and Deveshan and I said to them look we need to assist General  Lebeya to get the ship afloat again because I think General  Lebeya inherited a sinking ship because of – of what General Ntlemeza did to the Hawks and she said to me General there is no ways I can go back to that place.  If I see that place I am traumatised.  That is how he dealt with people.  Chair in my instance when he served my suspension notice on me they arrived – it was a public holiday.  I was not at home.  I received a call from my neighbour.  He said to me the riot police is at your house.  So I said what do you mean.  He says no they are jumping over the fences with guns and – so I phoned my – my domestic aid and I said to her Lindie what is going on.  She says too many police.     Yes Chair.  That iswhen Ntlemeza suspended me but now he had to give me the notice.  So it was a public holiday.  Then I get a call from my lawyer – Carl Van Der Merwe.  He says to me he received a call they are looking for you.  I said well I am in Pietermaritzburg now.  The next moment he phones me he says no it is a public holiday.  He says to me no the security from his office phoned him now.  Chair now I actually have video material that – to show how they take the national interv ention unit people.  They actually – when they approach the lawyer ’s office they jump out of the vehicles with their guns.  They go into the foyer.  The offices were closed and you can see they talk to the security.  Theywent upstairs came back.  That jus t to serve.    Chair that is – that was Ntlemeza at his best.  He – he wanted to prove a point if you go against me this is what is going to happen to you.  Even when I was suspended - eventually suspended he went to my office.  My secretary was sitting there and my door was locked and he said to them they must open and by the way Chair she – he took with her - just to prove the point he took with him General  Ngobeni the suspect in my investigation.  They went to my office and he threatened my secretary that she should open the door otherwise she will also be suspended.  So it was very highhanded.  If you dared go against him whether you were right or wrong he – and I think he wanted to prove a point.   Booysen went against me.  He sends these people to my house in battle gear to come and serve a notice on me.    Well I was not there Chair.    My neighbour phoned me.  He said to me the – the riot police is at your house.    So I phoned – phoned my domestic aid.  I said Lindie what is going on.  She says no there arelots of policemen at the house.  They are coming from the sides and they have got big guns.    And then I get the call from my attorney.  They are looking for me.  Then they go to my attorney’s office and that I have on – I have a little video clip of that.  How they descended upon his office to come and serve a notice on me.     They wanted to serve me with the.    Suspension – that is correct Chair.   It is the same group Chair.  When they could not find me at my house.     They went to my attorney’s office but I do not understand why they went to his office.  It was a public holiday.    There was no onethere.    Definitely not Chair.  I have – I have never – I have suspended officers before.  I call them to my office.  I tell them the reason for the suspension and I will give them the notice.  I let them sign for it and I treat them as human beings whether they are right or wrong.  I have never ever seen anything like it.  Chair can you just imagine what my neighbours must have thoughtwith the riot police descending upon my house.  My lawyer phoning me.  There are policemen all over the show at this office and as I said I have a video clip that can prove that but no Chair.  That is – it is completely irregular to do that.  I posed no threat.     That is correct Chair.    Chair I have just perused through it.    Chair.    It is indeed so Chair.  She goes into a bit of more detail here but – and I have picked up something here that I was not even aware of.  If I would go to National Head Office she was actually hiding in the offices.  She did not want tobe seen with me because.    Brigadier Vermaak.    Ja.  So I now realise when I went to Head Office I could never find her there .    Because she was hiding from me because she was scared if Ntlemeza sees her with meall hell with break loose.  No, I have not testified about that Chair.    No.  I have not testified about that Chair.    No.  Not the Gupta interview.  I have not testified.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    I do Chair.    Chair I cannot recall the date.  It was when I was back at work.  A person – I cannot recall what his name is.  I will – maybe if we break I will get his name.  Phone me and he wanted to meet me and I met with him and he told me thathe was a friend and a partner of Duduzane  Zuma and then he said to me that there is a complaint they want to lodge with regards to a criminal investigation against the White guy.  I think his surname was Erlang but I can get his surname Chair.  The way he explained it  to me is that Duduzane did not want to go into business with this White male but he convinced Duduzane to go into business with this White male and it is related to online betting and apparently this White male had then defrauded them with millions and th is guy was now sitting in - in the UK.  He then said to me that this White male - the Hawks from Cape Town had mirror imaged this White male’s computer in Durban.  I saidno I do not believe it because I would have been aware of that.  So I thought let me just take – take a chance. So I phoned Colonel Rudolfse.  I said to him Cobus are you aware.  He said no he knows about it.  They did mirror image this White male’s computer and there is an investigation by the British Police regarding this online betting thing.  Be that as it may Chair so the complaint from their side was that we should investigate – it was a couple of million Rand.    Sorry.  The complainant would have been - Chair I will have to get his name.     But I will get it now Chair when we get a break.    So he said they want to – to do – us to do the criminal investigation and Chair I was very weary.  I do not want to do criminal in vestigations from - because we met at a restaurant.  So I pointed a Lieutenant-Colonel Marthinus. His nickname is Tienie Botha to open up an inquiry and a docket to investigate the matter.  So I said okay we will investigate the matter. Subsequent to that he wanted to see me again and we met in a restaurant in Florida Road.    Chair it was one of these technical things.    Online betting.    I am not very au fait with.  These commercial investigations Chair but the complaint at face value appeared to be legitimate and Colonel Botha also reported back to me that thereappears to have been crime committed by this White gentleman who is now in England.  At a second mee ting this time around I met this gentleman whose name I cannot recall and Duduzane came and there was another tall Coloured male with – with them.  The coloured male recognised me but I did not recognise him and – but the way he spoke to me it’s like we knew each other and eventually I picked up that he was a person by the name of Lloyd Hill and Lloyd Hill Chair, if I can just digress a little bit there was a allegation against a previous president of that gangsters that were – that they met up with and very foul language were used, now this was the same Lloyd Hill was at thatmeeting with the president.  So this Lloyd Hill – I remembered him when I was a young Lieutenant, he used to work and went – he was involved with narcotics.  So then I realised who thi s guy was because he had got much older and we spoke about the investigation, myself and Duduzane and I told him, look Colonel Botha is dealing with the matter.  I don’t think they tried to put pressure on me, I think – nowadays the public has to put press ure on the police to do their work.  Then on an occasion I was in Gauteng and I received a call from a Captain, Captain Dirk Swart, now Captain Dirk Swart happens to be friends with Edward Zuma and Duduzane Zuma and he said to me Duduzane would like to meet me here in Pretoria because they knew that I was here.  So I said to him its fine so I drove with my son, my son Eben and we met them in Sandton but when I met them Duduzane was with a youngster, more or less his age, a white guy.  So we just spoke in generalarities and we were in my son’s car so they said, no weshould go to their office.  So we drove to a office and I think I’ll be able to find it in Sandton and we went inside, we saw people there I don’t know who they were.  Thinking back I suspect i t could have been the offices of the Guptas because the boardroom sat in had a big plastic thing with a piece of pole inside but we just had tea and we spoke to this – my son spoke to this young white lighty but they were friends Duduzane and this youngster, they were in the same school and Duduzane spoke about that they were still expanding their business to make armoured vehicles and next time when I’m here they’ll take me in the helicopter and we’ll go and have a look at the place where theybuild the armoured vehicles, I still said it would be nice and then we left.  Then on a second occasion, I think I’ve got the date in my statement...(intervention).     Yes Chair, so I was shortlisted to become the head of the Hawks Nationally and our interviews, I think, was – well the date on which I saw him – Duduzane was the 16 t h, I think the interviews were two or three days after...(intervention).     August 2015.     I once again got acall from Captain Dirk Swart who said to me – he calls him Zane would like to see me again.  So I said to him okay where is he, he said no he’s in Sandton.  So I said to him okay – Chair I just want to interrupt myself there, prior to that, I also got a call from Dirk Swart who said that Zane wanted to see me, I was on my way to hospital a little company of Mary Hospital in Pretoria where my brother’s son had a brain operation.  So I said well I’m on my way to the hospital, then he said, no he’ll meet me at the hospital and I arrived there with my whole family, children, wife and he arrived there, that’s now Duduzane in a Mercedes Benz, one of these fancy cars.  He’s a very likeable personand he spoke to me almost like – and he calls me sir and by then he’d already met Eben my son and they would – and just like a greeting, meet and greet type of thing and then he left with the Mercedes and I went into the hospital.  Back to this meeting in August Chair, so I     No, no Chair this one I’m talking now...(intervention).     He was alone then.     That was the first one when I met him with his white friend Chair.      In Sandton.     the second one was in Pretoria when he came there to the...(intervention).     Yes Chair.     Chair I don’t know, like I say he’s a very jovial, friendly person, I think maybe he want ed to brag a little bit I don’t know, showing me the offices, the nice car.     Chair as I said during that first meeting with him and that white youngster we went to th ose offices and nothing much was said although he spoke about the investigation that we were busy with but I just said to him look – because they were pressurising – not so much him, it was done by theother chap whose name I’ve forgotten now.  They were p utting pressure on myself and the investigating officer, Colonel Botha and I explained to them, we cannot just go and access documents we have to subpoena the documents and then when I met him – but when I met him here in Pretoria, when I met Zane in Preto ria I don’t think the idea was for me – for him – for me to give feedback about the investigation.     Because we discussed it but it wasn’t the primary cause of it  - it was – the discussion on the case was, we’re busy with it, Colonel Botha is dealing with it.   And with that discussion just about my whole family that was there, we stood there in the car park, we spoke about the weather and the nice car and he said he had to go and I also said I also had to go now because we have to go see my brother ’s son.     That’s correct Chair.     So Chair I received a call again that he would like to see me, I said where, Sandton again,where in Sandton, I can’t recall exactly where so I said once agai n to my son Eben to a accompany me and we drove in his car.  Now on the way there we put the phone on speaker phone and then I received a call on the speaker phone which Eben could hear and asked where we were – well he said we are here, I said we are on o ur way, we should be there in a few minutes and then we terminated the call and then my son said to me who’s that now but because Zane speaks very private school English and – but...(intervention).     And like my English Chair.  Then my son said to me, “wie is dit”, - who is that, so I said to him I think it’s his white friend talking because of the way he spoke English and we eventually go the place where we were supposed to     No Chair I was confused too then because I thought maybe – because the first time we met the white youngster was with so I thought maybe this time again, the white youngster is with because it sounded like a white person speaking, the English he spoke.     And then when I eventually arrived in Sandton at the spot where we were supposed tomeet they weren’t there or he wasn’t there.  I phoned him and we kept on missing each other and eventually I said to him listen I’m hungry now, there’s a burger place around the corner by the Gautrain Station.  So I said to him, listen let’s go have a bite quickly we went and as I ordered he phoned again and I said, no we’re just having a bite and this time around he said, meet me at the Gautrain station at a specific place around the corner.  We finished the hamburgers and my son parked his vehicle, so I thought let me get out of the vehicle so that they can see me...(intervention).     Chair as I said in the beginning of my evidence, if you know Duduzane, he’s one of those – like he could be your son plus we were doing that investigation in which he was a complainant or a co -complainant with this other gentleman so I didn’t see anything untoward in meeting him at that stage.      So Chair I got out of the vehicle and I stood on the pavement so that if they come they can now see me because we kept on missing each other and the next moment – Eben was still in the car, the next moment I saw a black lady coming from the opposite direction with her child and I saw...(intervention).    A  black lady coming from this side with her small child and then the next moment from this side I saw a Rolls Royce a black Rolls Royce pulling up behind Eben’s car, my son’s car.  I thought this car is stopping to pick up this lady but this lady kept on walking, so I thought okay and I bent inside the car and I said to my son, look at this car behind us because not every day that you see a Rolls Royce and then when I looked I saw no there’s Duduzane sitting in the car and what I forgot to say Chair, when we were still in the car finding each other, he said to me are you going to jump in the car with me, I said, no I’ll follow you.  Then when I saw it was  him I went to him and I greeted him, then I decided no it’s better to drive in the Rolls Royce that my son’s Corolla.  So I went to my son, I said, no I’m going to drive with him.  So I jumped in the Rolls Royce and Eben, my son followed us in the Toyota and we went in the direction where the offices were but then we went past and I recall during that week there was some comments in the media about the then President again and I said to him, hey your old man is having a hard time and he said yes and we spoke about the hard time the old man is having and we carried on driving and the next moment I saw we were close to the zoo and then right next to the zoo we drove – we pulled up to the gates and I saw these huge gates which I’d seen before in the media and the gates opened.  There was a lot of activity of security detail, we drove in, my son drove in with us, I alighted from the vehicle so did Duduzane and my son came up to meand he said to me in Afrikaans, “Dadda is ek waar ek dink ons is, Dad are we where I think we are”, I said to him, I think so.  We then went to the staircase, Eben was with us, the door was opened, there’s a foyer as you enter the door and we were asked for our phones, we handed our phones over and we went into a lounge area where I was introduced to Tony Gupta, well he introduced himself as Tony Gupta.  Chair the initial talk were – first they spoke to Eben.  What do you do Eben, Eben said, no I’m in the IT industry and they then said to him, well if you have any business proposals don’t hesitate to contact us and spoke about the weather and the importance of schooling and he orderedsome snacks.  The people that served us with the snacks – Chair I’m from KwaZulu Natal I know Indian accent and I’ve been to India, I know how the Indians in KZN talk and I know how the Indians in India talk, these people definitely also from India, the people that were bringing the snacks and they gave us some snacks and some stu ff to drink and then at some point – and this is where things turned funny he, that’s now Mr Gupta, raised the issue about me being shortlisted to become the head of the Hawks.     It was myself, Eben and Duduzane and Tony Gupta.     Chair you walkupstairs and then there’s  this huge door then there’s like an entrance area and then it goes into a – it’s a huge lounge a very posh lounge.      It was a lounge Chair.     Yes Chair, so I said...(intervention).     So he said to me, soI understand you might become the head of the Hawks.  Chair very few people knew that I’d been shortlisted for the post although there was a newspaper article in KwaZulu Natal, I think it was in the Mercury, that said Booysen’s going for Dramat’s job or something – words to that effect but over and above that it was not  generally known that I’d been shortlisted for that post and I said to him, ja it’s true and he said to me but if you do get appointed that we should have a supper in KwaZulu Natal.  I did not know what to make of that, if I get appointed we should have supper in KwaZulu Natal, so I just smiled at him and nodded my head, I didn’t respond because I was – it was a bit of an uncomfortable situation.    Yes Chair.      Chair the impression I gained, he said to me, if I’m appointed then we should have supper in KZN.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.  Chair not anything else was discussed about myself be ing appointed or not appointed. Zane did not take part in the conversation whatsoever, it was a short discussion, it continued where I think my son liked the juice that they were making, he had a second cup of the juice and we decided – well not decided it was clear that we had said what had to be said and I then departed but no promises were made, no undertakingswere given.   Nothing, no Chair.       Chair I suspect that what he was trying to tell me is that should I be appointed – although he did not say that, is that, he probably would have had a hand in myappointment and that I might then have been indebted to him, although it was never said those were my conc lusions that I made.     That’s correct Chair. CHAIRPERSON    You’re 100% correct Chair.     I did not initiate the meeting, they phoned me.     You’re right Chair.   Although the investigation that they were the complainant in was discussed but that never seemed to be the...(intervention).      Yes Chair.     Yes the one at the hospital...(intervention).     That’s correct Chair.   After this engagement?     Yes I did Chair.     No Chair.     No Chair.     Chair okay, obviously I went home afterwards with my son Eben.  At that point in time it had become abundantly clear to me that Ntlemeza was not someone to be trusted.  I had to report to him and I was definitely not going to reportsuch a thing to him.  In the meantime what had ha ppened is, the lobby groups had brought in an application to set aside appointment of General Ntlemeza for not being fit and proper, because of a ruling, I think it was Judge Elias Mohtiyane in the Sibiya matter where he said that he had lied under oath an d that he lacks integrity.  The Court ruled in their favour, it was appealed it went to the SCA where General Ntlemeza basically lost his case and I think I’ve written the date somewhere in my statement Chair.     That’s correct Chair on the 13 t h of June 2017 at half past three the afternoon I prepared a statement about this meeting that I had at the Gup ta compound and on that particular day the judgment came out that Ntlemeza was finally to be removed from the Hawks.  The acting head of the Hawks then wasGeneral Matakata, Yoli Matakata and I phoned her and I said to her I would like to meet her.  I left my office in Centurion and she left Pretoria, she was on her way to the airport...(intervention).      No he was at work Chair.    So Chair when the SCA confirmed that he had to be removed, he had no more recourse and so – there were a few developments there where the minister actually had to go and physically boot him out of his office and he left with a car, that was all in the media.       That was Minister Fikile Mbalula.     So Chair I prepared a statement as to what – about the meeting, I met General Matakata at – what’s that place called, at McDonalds...(intervention).     That is correct Chair.    And as we adjournedas I got up I realised the name it is Winston Innes.     Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I think it wasroundabout 2010 roundabout there.    It was before the letter Chair.    Thank you Chair.     Yes.  So – but I would just like to say there Chair this ground coverage document I know it comes from a certain individual within Crime Intelligence.  A person by the name of Colonel N H Singh.  The reason why I know that is when I took the Sunday Times to the – to the Press Ombudsman we communicated to and fro about my complaints and they would respond and in one of their letters to the Press Ombudsman at the time they mentioned that one of their sources was Colonel  N H Singh who had given them the infor mation but more importantly General Deena Moodley was the Head of Crime Intelligence in KwaZulu-Natal told me personally that N  H Singh was responsible for the compilation of that document while he was seconded on duty to work with Richard Mdluli in Gauteng for a period of time.  I think it was   Chair other than my observations that she was hell bent on getting rid of me in spite of me being exonerated on more than one occasion yet on the other hand someone that faces serious charges she tries to – well – not try to get him back to work but she – like Judge Murphy said she did not want to stand in his way to come back to work.  That to me just did not make sense.    Chair what happened there is subsequent to myself having laid a complaint against Advocate Jiba and the matter was being investigated by a Lieutenant-Colonel Botha.  He had investigated the matter and obtainedall the necessary statements I assume and then the next thing I he ard on the news that they wanted to serve a subpoena or a summons on Advocate Jiba to appear in court on charges and that she was not available at the office.  It was in the media at the time and then eventually the media reported that they had served a su mmons on Mr Nxasana to give to her because she reported to him and then that same evening I overheard – well I heard a radio statement of Mr Nxasana who took issue with General  Piyega for the role she played because there appears to have been a spat betwee n Piyega and Nxasana and it was evident from the news reports and from the radiointerviews that there was conflict between the NDPP and the National Commissioner of the Police.  In my view the National Commissioner of the Police should not have involved her with decisions taken by the NDPPs Office which she clearly did.  She was so incensed by the fact that Advocate Jiba eventually received the summons that she summarily terminated the services of Colonel  Botha.  Colonel Botha had been on an extended contract.  He was one of the investigating officers in the Oscar Pistorius matter but she summarily terminated his contract and then General Muno who was then the Divisional Head of the Detectives assigned that document to – I think – it was a Major-General (indistinct).    That is correct Chair.  Chair when my disciplinary hearing was ongoing when they closed the case against me it was now my turn to give evidence.  I had approached a number of the investigators from the Hawks to come and give evidence on my behalf and most of them undertook to do so but every time I would phone them a day or two before the time they disappeared.  I could not get hold of them.  My attorney eventually managed to get hold of them and theywere given instruction.  They said they instruction came from Piyega that they cannot come and testify in my favour.  At that time Soobramoney – Chair would recall - who was one of the investigators in the beginning whom I had to investigate who.     He had told me at the time that he had resigned but I had found out in the meantime that he had not resigned.  That he was working at Crime Intelligence in Benoni.  I then managed to trace him and I asked him Vassan are you prepared to come and testify for me and he said yes I will.  I did not tell anyone that he was coming.  We were – the hearing at that stage was in chambers here in Sandton.  So I said to him I will pick him up at the Gautrain Station which I did the morning.  I took him in.  It was at thatstage where they wanted General  Ngobeni to come and testify and I knew she would not come and then said no they are going to adjourn now because she did not arrive.  I said no I do have a witness here.  We can proceed with this witness.  Chair I was – I was unaware of what he was going to testify about but I was.   No this was Vassan Soobramoney.  Ngobeni neverpitched.    I just wanted him to confirm.    Soobramoney Chair.  And they also indicated to him that there is a possibility that he might be promoted if he comes.  I – this was not reported to me.  That was now the first time I heard about this.  He then said.     At the disciplinary hearing Chair.   He says - that is what Soobramoney told me.  He then – because he feared for his life – because he has got a wife and a kid I think – he decided to take up this position with Crime Intelligence and be known and he said to me he sat in the office doing nothing.  He told them at the time that he needed to continue with the – with the Panday investigation.  He said but he was basically just left there in the office to such an extent he was getting so bored he pleaded with then to give him something to do even if it is some HR work.  So the hand of Mdluli is clear into the interference of the investigation of Panday.    Yes Chair.   Chair he told me he is going to resign.    Ja.    I – I.    No Chair but – initially he told me that he had resigned but later on obviously through yourcontacts in the police I established that he was working at Crime Intelligence in Benoni.    Up until the day he left Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes, but then he did nothing Chair.    Well Chair there – there were a couple of investigators.  Colonel Hans Van Loggenberg.  And there was Colonel Hurst.    Most of them were people from the ex-Scorpions DSO.   Even Soobramoney was also from the DSO.     Chair I would say probably about two years.    It coincided with a period of my suspension Chair.    Well Chair he told me.    Soobramoney himself told me after he had given evidence that he sat there doing nothing and he actually pleaded with them to give him something to do.  He  was getting bored.    He even said that – he asked them give me some HR work to do.     That is exactly what    I do Chair.    I confirm that Chair.    She did Chair.  What happened is Padayachee whom – who was in charge of the monitoring of the Act 17 interceptions at one stage also reported to Riyah  Piyega issues relating to the investigation and I think that is perhap s something that he can talk about but for – for his effort he also got suspended and then a while later he informed me that – Chair how it works is the interceptions are done at a specific place in Pretoria.  The investigators would sit in their respectiv e provinces.  It is not live listening.  So they record and then they will send it to the investigatorsbut the originals are kept in – in Pretoria.  Then at one stage Padayachee informed me that General  Piyega has sent a Brigadier – I cannot recall the name – I think it was a White lady.  I stand to be corrected – to uplift the intercepted calls – the actual discs but Chair if it is indeed true and she did not follow due process in my view that is – she committed a criminal offence.  She might have followe d due process but I am not aware that she had followed proper protocol and process.    I confirm that Chair.   That is true Chair.    No Chair, it did not.    Chair with regards to General Ntombela. While they were having the disciplinary hearing against me he phoned me and we met and he told me that he was the first person that was given the task to  Chair he was a Provincial Commissioner either in Limpopo or Mpumalanga.  I cannot recall.  I think it was Mpumalanga.    So I meet him and he says to me he just wants to tell me he was the first person who wasallocated with the investigation against me and that he did not feel comfortable with it and he did some investigations – I do not know what he did but he reported back to - I think it was at the time General Piyega and she obviously was not happy with that but the other important thing is Chair - and that is what he told me.  Piyega asked Ntombela to investigate the conduct of Ge neral Mark Hankel the whistle blower.  So he did a complete investigation.  When he finalised his investigation his conclusions were that Mark  Hankel had done nothing wrong.  He had done the right thing and he said to me Piyega was furious with him.  She then allocated the investigation to someone elsebut the important thing Chair at that point the contracts of both General Ntombela and General Ngobeni had come to end.  He had a clear record – absolute clear record.  He had no complaints.     Ntombela. CHAIRPERSON   His contract was not renewed whereas General Ngobeni having all these investigations hanging over her head General  Piyega renewed her contract.    I would say 2013/2014 Chair.    It was not.    Chair it was in an advanced stage.  I think it coincide s with a letter that Advocate Noko - I alluded to that yesterday and I actually mentioned that.     In my response to Noko’s memorandum.    That I find it no coincidence that that report was released at the time that General Ngobeni’s.    Contract had expired. CHAIRPERSON I think it was somewhere in 2014 Chair.    Over and above that the issue that he was instructed to investigate Mark  Hankel.    The whistle blower.    Which Piyega was also – well the result of which she was not.     Happy with either.   He did Chair.    He told me. CHAIRPERSON Nothing against Mark Hankel.    He said she was very angry.    It is in that context Chair.   Chair Major-General Jan – I think it is Ntebo – Mabula but we know him as Jan  Mabula was my counterpart in the North West Province.  When the – when the Cato Manor matter started General  Dramat told me that he is appointing Mabula, General Ntsika and General Badie to investigate the allegations in the Sunday Tribune.  Ntsika never arrived and Badie never arrived.  Mabula arrived with a team from the North West.  One of them I recall was Colonel Mano also a very controversial officer who subsequently passed away.  It did not strike me at the time but later on I put two and two together.  Mabula – General Mabula was in cahoots with Advocate Jiba at the time of the arrest of Advocate  Gerrie Nel.  What transpired Chair after my arrest  I received a phone call from a senior police officer who wanted me to meet someone.  So I happenedto be in Pretoria and we met at Centurion at the McDonalds and this person related the following story to me Chair.  He said to me what Mabula is doing to y ou is wrong because he is guilty of something like that himself and he related the following story to me.  There was a huge heist at the O R Tambo airport.  I think over R100 million was stolen.  Whether it was Dollars or Rand I cannot recall Chair and people were arrested for that and the monies was recovered and kept in the safe at – I think – Benoni Organised Crime.  Someone broke into – into the offices and I think R12 million was stolen.  Mabula at the time was a Colonel and he was tasked to lead the i nvestigation into the theftof the money.  Chair then I started to do some research myself afterwards but let me continue with the story.  He says one of the people who they arrested is a guy by the name – I think Solly Ngwenya – a suspect in the matter.  He was taken to the Mmakau Police Station and at the Mmakau Police Station they were busy interrogating him. Jan Mabula was in an adjacent office.  He was not present.  He was in the office next door and he was there with – I think – she was a Captain Makwena.  He says and they were busy interrogating this suspect – Solly Ngwenya but they were torturing him.  He was part of it.  He told me and he says he described me to.  They would take a tube and then put it over his head until the person suffocates.  A long story short.  This person collapsed and they could not revive him.  Then they realised this person had died.  He says and then he went next door or they went next door, I can’t recall whether it was him or...(intervention).      No Chair.     It’s a gentleman, I do not want to mention his name...(intervention).    But if the Chair would want me to I can – but I think for his own safety...(intervention).     Because what happened afterwards Chair, people were being killed left, right andcentre.  They then went next door to tell Mabula, we’ve got a problem now this man (indistinct) he doesn’t want to wake up.  Then Mabula was sitting on the chair he fell down, he passed out himsel f and then one of the captains there, it was a Captain Dube, female captain took her coat and waved him to wake up so when he woke up they realised they had a problem.  So they decided they were going to take the body to, I think the Baragwanath Hospital a nd then they took him to the hospital to say, no this man had a heart attack.  When they arrived at the hospital the doctor said no, no this man has been dead for about two hours now he didn’t have a heart attack.  They went back and reported this to Mabula, Mabula then had some arrangement, he didn’t give me those details with a doctor who eventually certified this person dead.  The family at the time and the media, I obviously later on started reading about it, was very unhappy that their family member ha d died in police custody.  Then the people that were present, when this person died,when Solie died, Mabula met them at a lake, I can’t recall – I think it was Germiston lake where he told them how to formulate their statements.  They had a follow-up meeting in which – and they described to me the one guy said no they’re having nightmares, nightmares.  I said to him, what do you mean nightmares, he says no they were saying that one of the people that were present when Solie died was that – they were having nightmares at night, this man was spooking by them and then Mabula would say to them, no don’t worry we’ll sort it out and he told them exactly how to make their statements. Chair at that point I listened to what he said but I was in themiddle of the fight of my life with Jiba and all and sundry I didn’t do anything about it at the time.  Six months later I get a call from General Shadrack Sibiya, I might mention Chair, the person who introduced me to this other person was General Shadrack Sibiya.  He th en said to me, Johan did you report this thing to ICD, I said to him Shadrack, I’m too busy fighting my own battles here I haven’t got time for that, he says no, no the person who related the story to me and another person who was off sick, they were the o nly two people that never made statements at the time that Solie Ngwenya died and now all of a sudden ICD is approaching them for statements.  I said to him, Shadrack I can give you an undertaking I did not contact ICD I’m too busy.  He said to me, can these guys come and see you, I said by all means.  Chair that was about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, 7 o’clock the following morning I received a call they’re in Durban, so it must have been of some concern to them because they had driven through the night.   I then asked, I think it was Colonel – Captain Pelser from my office if he’s got a recording device for me, I took a recording device with me and I met them on the beach front and I had arranged with a person that I know at the Sun Coast Casino that we ca n go and sit in one of the restaurants and talk.  So they enquired from me, they said to me, it’s just strange that they were the only two that never made statements in that matter in which Ngwenya died but now the ICD wants to see them and I told them there’s no ways it was me that told the ICD and then we tried – I tried to figure out who it could have been and we had some discussion and Chair then...(intervention).    Yes Chair.        So Chair then I said to them but let’s just recoup what happened when Solie died and then they told me the whole story from the beginning to the end exactly like he told me the previous time and I then said to them look my – the only suggestion that I can make to you guys, go to a lawyer, make an affidavit, go to the Prosecuting Authority and lay your cards on the table because there’s a whole group of you people it’s – the first one that decides to become a 204 witness and I said to them look, what I’ll do for you is, I’ll take  you to my lawyer.  I made an arrangement for my lawyer to meet them, he met with them, they related the story to – and he gave them – the lawyer gave them th e same advice.  They said they would think about it but it was clear that they were extremely scared. They then left and they said that they would let us know.  They never went to a lawyer and deposed an affidavit.  I subsequently took the recording and I gave it to Mr McBride.  Mr McBride initiated an investigation and not long after that he was suspended himself.  When he returned to office he phoned me and he said to me the recording had gone missing, do I have another copy, I said no, I have another co py so I favoured him with another copy.  Subsequent to that Mr McBride told me that they had managed to obtain corroborating evidence and the matter had gone to the DPP and those were one of the cases that Mr McBride expressed his frustrations about, that they were not gettingany positive feedback from the National Prosecuting Authority, I don’t know where the docket is right now Chair.      Chair I might just add if, I managed to obtain a copy of the post-mortem report of Solie Ngwenya and the post-mortem report says he died from asphyxiation.     From asphyxiation.      So he’s in police custody he dies from – someone must be held accountable for his death it’s not – if you die from asphyxiation it’s an unnatural death while you’re in police custody and no-one is responsible for that.     Chair which takes us to his investigation with the Cato Manor matter.  When he arrived there, I said to him, Jan here’s my office, here’s my equipment I made everything at his disposal and I think I did testify  about this earlier on where people like Mostert would phone me and say to me the investigators have traced their informers and they’re putting pressure on the informers to change their versions and that’s when I also received a call from Lieutenant Zungu who met me and told me he had been approached  by detectives working with Mabula and he told me that Mabula was present in the room at the Blue Waters Hotel wherethey interrogated him about certain issues relating to the killing of Mkhize and they wanted Zungu to change his statement to implicate me in the killing of Mkhize and he refused.      Yes Chair and he refused, Zungu refused and...(intervention).      The detectives that worked with Mabula.     Chair he told me Mabula was there and prior to m e giving evidence, I just wanted to make sure, I phoned him again, I said to him Zungu, I just want to confirm, you told me that Mabula was present there and he said yes he was present.    Chair I think I’ve testified extensively about Mr Rajen Aiyer.  He was subsequently dismissed from the police for dishonesty, there’s another case pending against him, of intimidation and – well, no, no sorry Chair h e was dismissed for the case still under investigation for intimidation and a few other charges that matter, I understand is with the DPP’s office.  In another matter in which he fabricated evidence against individuals in a robbery matter, the Magistrate Mr Anand Maharaj ordered an enquiry into his evidence where he lied under oath and fabricated evidence, he got his girlfriend to  make statements which were untrue, to implicate people that weren’t implicated in the commission of that offence at all and that disciplinary hearing and the criminal trial is still in the process but subsequent to that he committed another offence which is still under investigation but he was dismissed from the police for that.  The point I’m making Chair is here we have a person  with a very dubiouscharacter which got an axe to grind with myself whom I had to – charged departmentally, he was found guilty and basically kicked out of the Hawks by General Dramat and that’s the type of person – and even if he’s – what he says is true in his statement Judge Gorven held that it relates to nothing other than office politics but that’s the type of witness – that’s their key witness Chair that advocate Jiba and Shaun Abrahams relies upon to convict me for racketeering.      I do Chair.     Chair Brigadier Xabaused to work with me in KwaZulu Natal, he was a colonel then and eventually he was promoted to head office where he is a brigadier.  My understanding that he’s – he heads Crimes Against the State and I refer to the PCLU at the National Prosecuting Authority yesterday who are mandated to do serious crimes like human trafficking, foreign military assistance Act.  Crimes Agains t the State, in my view would relate to crimes such as treason, sedition and crimes of that nature.  So to start off with, I find it suspicious that a brigadier who is in charge of Crimes Against the State manages to get himself involved with an investigat ion relating to a complaint by Mr Tom Moyane, I don’t regard that complaintas being a crime against the state.  During that investigation there was an incident that was televised on television where Mr Xaba and people with him – and that’s my observations  of watching what I saw on TV, kept in a room against his will, they also took or attempted to take documents from him by force which, in my view could amount to at least common assault.  My understanding that a case was opened but under the stewardship of the NPA at the time Mr Shaun Abrahams unsurprisingly that matter was also declined to prosecute.  I was also told by Mr McBride that Xaba had involved with the investigation against Misesi Koko and Mr Innocent Khoba but Chair the point I’m making is, a brigadier heading crimes against the state getting involved with these type of matters.  What I also found very strange was, in one of the affidavits that advocate Jiba deposed to in a civil litigation that we were involved in, he happens to be the person th at commissions her statement.  One could read anything and like that but I just find it a bitsuspicious.  Mr Xaba might argue that the investigation is lawful, the investigation might have been lawful but I find it a bit conspicuous that he had involved himself in these type of investigations and I just want to go back a bit further Chair, same prosecutors every time, same investigators every time. Brigadier Xaba, and I know him personally, he’s got a LLB degree, he should know what is right and what is wr ong when it comes to what to do and what not to do.  He’s not stupid he should have told whoever told him to do what he was doing, he should have told them, I’m not going to involve myself with this or at least have booked off sick or do something but he k new well that he wasdoing the bidding of someone else when he performed these actions.      Chair I’ve already given evidence how he arrested me, he didn’t even know what a founding affidavit was but nevertheless, he was the henchman tasked to arrest me the first time I was arrested and he was al so the henchman tasked to arrest me the second time when Shaun Abrahams authorised my prosecution and I recall when they took me to the cells the second time around at Durban Central Police Station, the moment the cell doors close he immediately made a cal l and he said, General he was arrested.  Now the only general that I can think of that he had phoned at the time, and I’m speculating but it must have been General Ntlemeza.  There was no reason, Chair, to once again chuck me in thecells, put me in the back of a police car and then cart me to court and then put me at the bottom of the grill and up the stairs like a common criminal.  Chair Ncube also got involved with ...(intervention).      They wanted to Chair but then there was another officer, I cannot – no, no, no I can, it was a Brigadier Pembe, I think it was, I had done a course with him in Stellenbosch, he heard from his office that I’m in the cells at Durba n Central and they were going to put me in the back of the police van to take me to Court.  He then came down and he said to them there’s nowways he’s going to allow – because him and myself were like partners on this course in Stellenbosch and he told th em there’s no ways he’s going to let me drive in the back of a police van he’s going to take me in his police car, so I jumped in the car with him, he took me to court.      Chair before – can I just make a correction it was General Mpethe, I’ve just remembered now the guy who said he’s not going to allow them to put me in the police van he’s going to take me himself.    Mpethe I can’t remember his first name Chair.    No it’s not on my statement Chair.     Chair I’ll spell it M-p-e-t-h-e.     That time he was a brigadier Chair, but I understand he’s now a general.      I do Chair. ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    That’s true Chair.     Chair in the Cato Manor investigation the Secret Services Account investigation, the common denominator there from the advocates are advocate Jiba Ntenjwa.  With regards to the Secret Services Account and the Panday case Ntlameza, the Panday case and the Amigo case, Mgwebi.  The Amigo case and the Cato Manor case Mosing, the Panday case and the Amigo case and the Cato Manor case Noko.  Cato Manor case theSecret Services Account case and the Panday case Ngluli and Phiyega.      Chair from time to time there will be coincidences where certain individuals will over lap with other individuals but over a period of time invariably the same names from the Prosecuting Authority, the same names from SAPS, the same investigators from SAPS, when these types of investigations – I refer specifically about the Cato Manor investigation, the Pandayinvestigation, the Amigos case investigation, the looting of the (indistinct) investigation, the rendition investigation and the SARS so called rouge – Chair I think I have a better chance of winning the lotto but it’s impossible that the same people, somehow, just figure to be the prosecutor or the investigator or the manager of these investigators in all those cases Chair over a period of time.      In the Amigos case the obvious beneficiaries are Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu.    There the beneficiaries in the Panday matter Chair would be Colonel Navin Madhoe, Captain Narain Persat, Lieutenant General Nkobeni she’s now resigned from the police, Toshan Panday, Deebo Mzobe and Edward Zuma.     Chair although in myview there were a number  of beneficiaries but the ones that I directly dealt with and know about is Richard Mdluli and Minister Nathi Mthethwa.     Chair that’s my evidence that that’s imperative.    I would like you to rephrase that question please?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can now then turn to paragraph 136 which is on page 41 of your affidavit?  You now talk about other prosecutors.  What do you mean by other prosecutors?     General Booysen were you involvedin the matter that you alluded to in relation to Advocate  Dawood Adams as in were you part of the investigation team at all?     So.    If we could then turn to page 42where you deal with prosecutors who resigned due to interference and in particular you mention certain prosecutors who in your view resigned for that reason.  Can you please explain to the Chair in that regard?     Thank you Chair.  In that instance can I ask us to look at Bundle/EXHIBIT Z(D) which is the diagrams bundle and slide 4 which is currently displayed.     Page 4.    So General Booysen you mentionedan Advocate Mzinyathi.  Just for the record the periphery circle that appears on the bottom right hand side is that the same Advocate Mzinyathi that you had just given evidence about ?    In the periphery circle at the bottom.    Right hand side.    Thank you and then the key at the bottom - on the bottom left hand side talks to common prosecutors involved in more than one case.  Is th at correct?    And so for the record it is recorded that Advocate Mrwebi was involved in the Panday case and the Amigoscase.  Advocate Mosing in the Amigos case and the Cat o Manor case and Advocate Noko in the Panday case, the Amigos case and the Cato Manor case?    There was evidence led in relation to Advocate Mrwebi’s role in the Mdluli loo ting of the Secret Service Account.  Is there any particular reason why he is not recorded to have been included in that one to?     And so this diagram then represents the evidence in your affidavit at the time that you deposed to it.  Is that correct?    General Booysen do you know of a prosecution.    No, not at all Chair.  If I may General Booysen – the prosecutors who are reflected in this diagram is it a comprehensive list of all prosecutors involved in all four matters?   And these are certainly the prosecutors that you are aware of were involved in these four matters.  Is that correct?   And that is 1-7?    In.    And who exactly are those some?                To move on in your statement we are now at page 43.  The next them of your statement relates to Law Enforcement and in particular the Hawks and the South African Police Services.  A similar diagram has accordingly been prepared as with the prosecutors which can be found at page 5 of EXHIBIT Z(D).  Is it correct that the same rationale in the preparation of the one – of the diagram for prosecutions informed the preparation of this slide?     There are two persons in particular outside of others that your statement or rather your affidavit deals  with and the first person that you mentioned at page 43 of EXHIBIT ZA paragraph 140 is Major General Berning Ntlemeza.      Thank you   Thank you Chair.  General Booysen you touched on the issue in relation to Human Resources and the appointment of people within the police.  In your affidavit you talk specifically about Major-General Ntlemeza’s approach to promotions in particular.  Can you please explain the detail in relation to that?        If I could.   Just for the record what exactly does SSSBC stand for?    If I could then take you to paragraph 155 of your statement?You talk about specifically Major-General Ntlemeza’s replacement of Provincial Heads.  Can you give clarity to that detail please?    Do you have anything to add to this in relation to a certain Brigadier  Ronel Vermaak and Colonel Lynn Deveshan?  If I am pronouncing that correctly.         If I could ask you to turn to EXHIBIT Z(B) and in particular page 306?     At page 306 you have an affidavit that has been deposed to by Ronel  Vermaak.    EXHIBIT Z(B).    Page 306.  Is it correct that this is anaffidavit deposed by Ronel Vermaak and the date of this particular affidavit is dated 8 February 2019 as reflected on page 313?     Have you read through this affidavit?     And does it ascribe the - or the same or similar manner of your dealings with Major -General Ntlemeza?    And in particular the relationship between Ronel Vermaak and Major-General Ntlemeza?    We are now on page 48 of your affidavit in particular from paragraph 157 which talks about the appointment of the Head of the Hawks.    No Chair.  This is something new.    Chair he certainly did allude to certain aspects of his application for the position.  General Booysen do you know Mr Duduzane Zuma?    How do you know him?    And whose side when you say his side do you mean?    Who – who was the complainant in the matter?     Yes in fact if I could take you to paragraph 158, it’s understood that there  was, in fact a meeting shortly before your interview.     And that’s the 16 t h of August 2015.     Thank you.  Before you continue GeneralBooysen with there not being any specific purpose for your previous meetings why were you inclined to meet with him again?      Please proceed.     And who was all in the room at that particular point in time?     Yes.     Was there any discussion in relation to this meeting that you had at the Gupta residence?      At the time that you had this meetingor any time before, for the sake of clarity, were you involved in any investigations in relation to the Gupta family?      Okay what did you do after having this meeting with Mr Tony Gupta, did you take any steps after you had the meeting – after you had this meeting on the 16 t h of August 2015?     That would be page 50 paragraph 1.6.6 where you say on the 13 t h of June 2017...(intervention).    There are certain observations that you have made in relation to sequence of events which takes cognisance of this particular report and you do s o at paragraph 191 page 56 of your affidavit.  Can I ask you to read these observations into the record please?     Did you mean to say published?     Chair a copy of that judgment isfound in Annexure J(B).    Sorry Annexure Z(B) from pages 354 to 441.    If I can now ask you to turn to page 60 please?  Can you please – you make certain statements in relation to Riyah Piyega and Richard Mdluli.  Can you please clarify the relationship as you understood it to be or understand it to be between those two individuals?   If one were to look at paragraph 201 you talk specifically to Riyah  Piyega’s relationship with Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.  Is there any additional comments that you wish to make to that?    General Booysen do you confirm that there are in fact two affidavits that have been attached to your affidavit from Colonel Brian Padayachee?    And do you also confirm that it was Colonel Brian Padayachee who managed the intelligence in relation to the Panday investigation?     Did Riyah Piyega get involved in theupliftment of communication recordings at all?     Chair for the record I failed to mention that the affidavits of Colonel  Padayachee is reflected at EXHIBIT Z(B) which is J(B) 26 page 472 until 49 8.  At paragraph 207 of your affidavit do you confirm that Riyah  Piyega was also the subject of a criminal investigation when she alerted Lieutenant-General Arno Lamoer?    And that was an alert of a criminal investigation against him?     But this – but it did not result in any prosecution steps being taken?        Thank you Chair.  If we can now turn to page 62 of your report?  The next individual who you refer to is Major-General Jan Mabula.  Your concerns in relation to this particular individual is mentioned in the context of three investigations.  The first is one which relates to the former Police Commissioner Jackie  Selebi.  The other is a several multimillion R and investigation of exhibit money which was recovered after a heist at O R T International Airport with - which was stolen from the Benoni Police Station and the last is in relation to the investigation of the Cato Manor Death Squad.  It is in that context that you place evidence before this Commissioner?     Can you please give detail to your evidence relating to Mabula in the context of those investigations?      Thank you Chair.     Chair on that point a copy of Zibusiwe William Zungu’s statement is included in the bundle in Exhibit ZB and it begins at page 500 with a typed version continuing to page 508.  The next individual that you deal with is Colonel Rajen Aiyer and that’s on page 64, you have already  given much evidence in relation to Colonel Aiyer to the extent that – based on the evidence that you have given there’s nothing – there’s nothing additional in the affidavit as such.  Is there any additional remarks you may wish to make in relation to him?    If I can then take you to page 65 at which you deal with the next individual who’s named Brigadier Niyameka Xaba.  Do you confirm that this particular Brigadier workedunder your command?     And do you also confirm that he was involved in the investigation relating to the complaint from Tom     He was also involved – or rather under Brigadier Xaba’s command...(intervention).     No problem Chair.  Do you have any comments in relation to his involvement on the matter concerning Mr Flock Simmington.     Thank you Chair.     And then the last individual that you deal with is on page 66 and that is Brigadier Pharasa Ncube.  What are your comments in relation to this brigadier?     Thank you Chair.  In that instance can I ask that we please turn to slide 6 which appears in bundle ZD and that’s the diagrams bundle.   General Booysen you will recall that at the beginning of your evidence and I shall quote,...(intervention).      Okay let’s deal with slide 6.  Do you confirm that this slide is essentially a consolidation of the two previous slides, the one which deals with individuals in the prosecution cluster and the other being individuals within the law enforcement cluster?     It’s the next slide.    Yes, Chair the witness has confirmed that this is a combina tion of the two slides on the top right- hand side is a little block which has a black backing and that indicates the law enforcement individuals which populate the diagram...(intervention).     It’s the last page Chair, page 6.     This diagram the witness has confirmed is a combined diagram of the law enforcement diagram andthe prosecutions diagram and in particular the individuals that this witness, Mr General Booysen has addressed in his evidence.  General  Booysen if I could point you to the diagram as such...(intervention).      Yes Chair.     That’s individuals from the law enforcement team, be it the Hawks or the  South African Police Services.     Yes Chair.     It’s simply a combination of the two previous diagrams.  Having said that if I could take you to the diagram itself, there appears to be common role players as you’ve already given evidence to.  When I say common role players I’m specifically talking about individuals who have been involved in more than one of the cases that you’ve given evidence to, is that corr ect?     If I could then take you down to the key on the bottom left-hand side which then identifies the individuals who have been involved in more than one case as you’ve give nevidence to being the Panday investigation marked in blue, the Amigos case marked in red, the looting of the Secret Service Account marked in yellow and the Cato Manor investigation marked in green.  Can I ask you to read into the record the individuals who appear common in more     Yes please – yes General Booysen.     Thank you. Is there any coincidence based on your experience to there being common individuals involved in these matters?     If I could then turn your direction to the blocks alongside the circles, so if we start with the red circle which is the Amigos block, alongside it is marked a block, beneficiaries in the Amigos case.  In your view, based on the evidence that you’ve given who were the beneficiaries in the Amigos case?      And then in the Panday investigation which is the circle marked blue, there’s another blockwhich...(intervention).     And if one had to do the same to the block alongside the yellow circle which deals with the looting of the Secret Service account, who were the beneficiaries?     If I could then remind you of evidence that you placed before this Commission on your first day of hearing when looking at the overall organogram, dealing with both the police and dealing with the justice clusters it was your evidence that the clusters of police, justice, intelligence, finance, governance, parliament and the Presidency cannot do without each other .  They all form very important gears in this big machinery and if any one of those are absent the whole justice system will be compromised and that’s the evidence that you have given.     So what would be the benefit ofanyone who would have a beneficial right over the National Prosecuting Justice cluster or rather, apologies over the justice cluster or even the police cluster? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Major General Ntlemeza wasappointed on the 24 t h of December 2014 as the Acting Head of the Hawks, what were your observations following his appointment?     Which year was this?    Before you go up to the 17 t h floor who was the colonel that transported Major General Ntlemeza?     Chair we are informed that Colonel Kobus Roelofse will be coming to t he Commission to give evidencehimself.    And then would now be an appropriate time to take the short adjournment?  
BOOYSEN :My racial...(intervention)     Although the investigations that Colonel Roelofse did also included cases that occurred here in Gauteng.  Chair I will substantiate my assertion there.  In the period that I worked with General Ntlemeza he did not demonstrate to me that he had remotely the ability to lead an important institutio n like the Hawks.  Secondly the mere fact that a judge in the high court had found him to be dishonest, lacking integrity and in spite of that Minister Nhleko still appoints him.  I think the rest of what emerged after his appointment, his interference in a number of investigations clearly indicates to me he was appointed for a specific reason.  That is the only – that is the only unescapableconclusion that I can come to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Chair I will give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he wanted to be hands -on, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt for that.     Chair that is how I interpret events.  Why would Ntlemeza who at the time was outside the Hawks put pressure on Mr Khuba to expedite his investigation?  And then from the National Prosecuting Authority side you have Advocate Mosing wanting reports before the investigation is finalised.     Chair that is indeed so and Mr Siqoko also gave me an opportunity to write a full page unedited in the Sunday Times which I did.  He went as far as to saythat he would write an editorial comment which he would allow me to edit and that says a lot abou t him.  He had shown me his – his editorial comment and I did not change a thing and my article went in unpublished. 
BOOYSEN:Chair my understanding was that he needed a report pertaining to operational matters.  That is why I called in those officers.  But that evidently wasnot what he wanted.  He wanted something else.  And when I – when he told me that – that is not what he wanted he then indicated to me no he wanted to know why did I want to go to Cape Town?  
CHAIERPERSON:   Oh okay, the one where he was with his friend, roundabout – when was that more or less, was that the first one?     Yes okay and then now you are into the third one and that the one, two or three days before the interview.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN W ESSEL BOOYSEN:  But when she came back…
