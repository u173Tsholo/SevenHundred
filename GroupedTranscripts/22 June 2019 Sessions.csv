CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Ms Hofmeyr on a Saturday morning, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Are you ready?    Okay thank you.    Good morning Ms Tlatsana     Thank you.    Yes thank you.    Thank you very much.      Okay and they are agreeable to that?    Yes okay thank you very much.  Ms Viljoen you are released and please return on Monday morning.  Monday we will start ten o’clock?    Ja I think let us start at ten o’clock so be back at teno’clock.    Thank you very much.    Yes we may continue.  The oath you took Ms Tlatsana will apply throughout until you have finished your evidence.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes no that is fine.  Thank you.    That is the one that DD…    As in DD8[a].    Ja thank you.    Just one second.  Thank you, you may proceed.    I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.  We looked at page 17 and then you referred to page 37?    Oh okay thank you.  Okay.    Well the – the question is you were told that – you have said you were told that this amount was for other stakeholders.  You were asked what you understood by the - and you said you thought it was for or you – or you were told it was for fire trucks.  Now thequestion was, was it your understanding that the business that your closed corporation was going to be involved in would involve trucks at any stage was that your understanding before this happened – before this amount of R5 million was taken out of your account.    Was it ever your understanding that your business included having anything to do with fire trucks?    Okay.    What is the basis for your answer for saying no it is not possible?    Why do you say no it is not possible that the fire trucks could have been delivered between September 2015 and early 16?     Yes but you could only have seen it early in 2016 because you – I understood you to say you did not go to the airports before early 2016.    Hm.    No, no, no am I correct in understanding your evidence to be that you only went to the airports in early 2016 – earlyin 2016?    Between September 2015 and January 2016 did you go to the airports?    So how would you know if trucks did arrive during that period and were – and disappeared?    Ja.    Oh but I thought you – your answer was that they could not have been there.    Maybe I misunderstood you.    You would not know?    Okay.    Did I misunderstand something Ms Hofmeyr?    Okay, alright.    No she is saying they will ask.   They will ask – they will ask her whether she knows anything about fire trucks that may have come during that time.    No, no that is fine.    Tell me who else apart from Ms Dube could have reported to you if fire trucks had arrived during that time?    But did she make regular reports to you during that time as a matter of fact?   So would it be correct to say you had no expectation that she would tell you if anything happened at the airport?    Okay.  So there was – is the position that there was nobody at the airport who you believe could have taken the trouble to tell you if there were trucks – there were fire trucks that had arrived?    Was that the position only during that time namely September 2015 to early 2017 or was that the position throughout from May when you started working – your company started working throughout?    Of the business.    Of ground handling.    Up to the end.    So you – you were – you were in charge – you were – you were the founder of the closed corporation.  You were the person who came with the idea and sold the idea to relevant people but therewas nobody that was working in the airports – in the two airports who was reporting back to you as to what is happening?    Ja.    The business was hijacked from you?    And when – at what stage did you realise that?    At what stage did you come to that conclusion that mybusiness has been hijacked?    Ja but the question is at what stage did you come to the conclusion that your business had been hijacked?    No, no, no I understand that part.  At what stage did you realise that my business has been hijacked?  Was it in May when you started …    Working on this ground handling business with SA Express?  Was it in March, was it in July, was it in August 2015, was it in 2016 or was it in 2018, 2019, when was it did you realise what has happened here is that my business has been hijacked?    No Ms Tlatsana.      I understand what you are saying.  I want you to tellme exactly what happened.    And I am listening to your evidence very attentively but I am asking now for the third time at what stage did you realise that your business had been hijacked?  Was it in 2015, 2016..    2017, 2019, yesterday or today, when exactly?    2016 or 2015?    2015 okay.    Around June, July?    Okay alright.  And when you realised this what did you decide to do about it?    We are maybe asking you things that maybe should be asked later in terms of the sequence but I want to find out now.  Let me go back to yesterday’s evidence.  When you agreed to Mr Van Wyk’s suggestion that you should take in more people in your closedcorporation and he suggested two names and you agreed to have them as registered as members of your closed corporation did they pay you anything for the interest namely shares in terms of closed corporations it is called interest but effectively for the shares in your company?    Did you ask them to pay anything?    Did they bring anything of value to the – to the business as you understood at that time?    And did you all three become equal partners as it were in the business?    And in terms of dividends were you all going to get equal shares of dividends?    Were you going to get more?    Yes but you say in terms of paperwork.    They were registered as equal partners to you?    Yes.      And you did not seek any legal advice in regard to this before you agreed to this?    Yes.  But you say when you were – had spoken to your spiritual advisor you did not decide to take any steps – stop – any steps to put an end to the hijacking of your business?    Yes.    By July or around July 2015 is that when you said you got about R450 or R500 000,00 from this ground handling business that the accountant put into the account of your other company, was it around about that time to July 2015?   You can check but you do not have to be exact, July, June, August I am happy as long as – I just want to remind – to be reminded about around when you got the R450 – the R500 000,00?    It was somewhere in the middle of 2015?    Okay.  Up to that stage you had not been physically threatened that if you did not agree to do anything you would be harmed had you?  Had any of the people involved here physically threatened you with anything?    Were you scared of that threat?    What could the ANC do to you if he told them whatever he might tell them about you?    Hm.    But did you – what did you think the ANC would do toyou that you were fearing?    Why did you think that?    Why did you think the ANC would kill you?  Well what – what had you done which you thought would make the ANC want to – want you dead?    But your spiritual advisor advised you to what – to record everything (intervenes)?    For what purpose in the end?    As you – as you understand what he was saying.   From your point of view as you were recording activities and discussions did you intend taking all of these things to some authorities to say look what so and so has been doing?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr we went on – on – I was following a certain issue but …    Please proceed.    Oh that – that was the amount I also wanted to askabout …    Because it seems to be hanging.    Yes.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  No that is fine.   Okay.  No that is fine.    Okay.    I am sorry – but did you raise any issues about this money with either the accountant or Mr van Wyk?    Yes.    Had – had you reached a point where you had decided you were not going to be asking any questions?   Yes.  So …    So you had reached a point where you had decidednot to ask anything?    Okay.    Alright.    Is that in regard to the five million at 4.44?   Ms Hofmeyr.    It is about that?  Okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Oh.    Okay.    Is that what the bank reported to you as having been said by her to them?    Hm.    Did you realise that this was not a normal way of running a business?    At what stage did you realise this?    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Why did you not decide look this is my company - this is my close corporation.  It has been hijacked by other people who were not there when I came up with this whole idea and they are doing allkinds of things that I do not understand.  I do not know what is happening at the airport.  I just hear what I am told. When I ask questions I am told to relax not to ask questions.  I must stop them continuing to be involved in my business.  Why did you not take that attitude?   In other words why did you not decide I am not going to have any further dealings with Mr van Wyk?  He is not good for my company.  I am not going to have any further dealings with Mr Kalisilira.  He is not good for my business.  They are now in charge of this business.  I am – I am nothing in this business anymore.    Apart from seeking advice from your spiritual advisor did you not think of seeing a lawyer or seeing some other organisations that maybe support or help business people particularly women – you know – business people?    Well I have got to look at all angles of the story.    So I will ask you the question.  What would you say if somebody said the reason why you might – you continue to have dealings with them – with Mr van Wyk and Mr Kalisilira – is that youcontinued to stand a chance of getting money as well and big money?  You had already got about R500 000 therefore that is what made you to accept this bullying that you are talking about from Mr van Wyk and that it is what made you tolerate all these things that you did not like being done in your company.    Yes but my question is what would you say if somebody said you continued to tolerate what was happening becauseyou knew that you stood a chance of making some money in the process.    No, no finish what you want to say.    The R500 000 that had been paid into your other company’s account did you understand that to be for all intents – intents and purposes yours or was your understanding that from thatamount you would still have to maybe pay staff?  Let me ask the question differently.  By June/July your – your staff who were working at the airport had been working from May.  Is that correct?    Who was paying them?  Did you know what they were paid, how much they were paid, who was paying them?    Did you know how much each one was paid per month or per week or whatever the arrangement was?   The contracts?    But Mr Kalisilira was the one who was paying them?   Okay.  So the amount of R500 000 that was paid into your account was not going to be involved in any expenses of the company – of the close corporation?    Your dividends?    Oh, okay; and then let me also ask you this.  Whowas the owner of the airport building in the two airports as far as you know – as far as you knew at the time your business started – when you started?    To the North West Government?    And for – in terms of the arrangement as you understood it were you supposed to pay any rent for working there or not or what was the position?   For your company.  Where your staff working there and so on?    They were SA Express staff?    They were not Koreneka staff?    Now let me try and understand that.  Koreneka had employed staff who were working at the airports?    In terms of it’s ground handling agreement with SA Express.    Those employees of Koroneka they wore SA Express uniforms, is that correct?    But they were not SA Express employees?      Yes.       Yes and they were paid – their salaries were paidby Koroneka?     And why were they not wearing a Koroneka uniform?      Okay, alright, thank you.      Yes.      Yes it’s just strange that employees employed by one company should wear the uniform of another company.      I mean if you go there and you have a problem with that employee you think…(intervention).    And then they tell you that person is not our employee.       Ja that’s fine.      Did we – earlier on, I think in your statement you did mention who owned Neo Solutions, is that right?         Mr Vivien Natasan.        Yes was he the only director there, do we know, just for interest sake?      Yes okay.      This was now in December 2015, okay.      Before that, I may have missed something, I just want to make sure I get it.  Before you decided to go to the bank and take the steps necessary to deny Mr Kalisilira access to your company’s account, had you spoken to Mr van Wyk about what was going on or did you speak to him after?     My impression from your evidence is that at a certain stage, maybe it was in December 2015 at a certain stage you concluded that you had, had enough of payment that – being made from your Close Corporation’s account without knowing – without having invoices, without knowing what was going on, that’s why you decided to deny Mr Kalisilira access, is that right am I right to understand your evidence along those lines?      Ja my question is (indistinct) once you had come tothis conclusion that you were going to take steps to put a stop to this thing, did you speak to Mr van Wyk before denying Mr Kalisilira access to the account of the company?      You didn’t speak to him before?      And you didn’t speak to Mr Kalisilira himself before doing it?      Did you only speak to them after or did you just takeaction and left it to them to contact you?      Yes and then they then contacted you?     Let’s talk about Mr van Wyk, how soon after you had denied Mr Kalisilira access did he speak to you, a week, a month, a day or two, or you are not sure – soon thereafter?       When he spoke to you?      Oh when you denied the accountant access.      Oh the accountant was the only one who had access, Mr van Wyk did not have access did he?     Ja okay and you spoke to Mr van Wyk soon thereafter, a few days thereafter?      Access the account.      Ja was he of the two, was Mr van Wyk the first one to contact you about this?     But Kalisilira also…(intervention).      Oh okay, thank you.    Maybe also let me also clarify this before, up to now, I haven’t heard from you any evidence relating to what your two co-members of the Close Corporation may have been doing were they not involved in anything as far as you were – you knew at that stage?     They were not involved?      Ja they signed and after that you never had any interactions with them in any serious way in 2015?      2015?      Oh he wasn’t there for a long time.     He resigned.      And did he speak to you before resigning to say hewas resigning because of A, B, C, D?      In and out.      Ja.      He resigned.      Mrs Phiri stayed on?      Of 2015?      Yes.      How much was that amount again, was it 20million rand?      Okay she resigned as the money was about to come in.      Working for government.      You don’t do business with government.      Oh so did she resign because that problem arose?      But the two never gave you any trouble, Mr Thabeng and Mrs Phiri during their time in the Close Corporation?      They are not doing anything, their names are just there.     Okay thank you.         Before that time you didn’t know what her normal job was?         Yes, by the way when you were told by Mr Phiri – Sorry Mr van Wyk about – when Mr van Wyk told you her name as one of the people that you should include in your Close Corporation, did you say that you knew her, you knew Mrs Phiri before this?         Oh you didn’t know her before that?         And what about Mr Thabeng?      Oh okay.         Yes that’s fine.    I have in mind that we could take the tea break at 11.       Ja okay, alright.      Yes, okay that’s fine.     Yes.      I’m sorry maybe before we get there, Ms Tlatsana, you did say that you were advised by your spiritual advisor to recordyou said, these people.      Did you understand that to mean you must record conversations that you had with them?         Yes and did you go along with this suggestion?         And did you then decided that you were going to do that?    And to that end what did you decide to do to prepared yourself to start doing that, did you buy anything to use to record them?           Is it something you had anyway, was it something on the phone?         Did you buy is specially?         Oh for this purpose?         Okay, alright.      Thank you – or maybe she should just tell us if she’s able to because understand at – that this was in a meeting, when that meeting was.         And was it received by Koroneka in December 15?        Okay.     And at the meeting was it just the two of you, yourself and Mr van Wyk or was there somebody else as well.       Okay alright. I’m sorry what is the device called that you purchased for purposes of recording?       Oh there’s no particular – or you don’t remember?         Okay, alright, that’s fine.  Is she able to hear anything?    Ja okay let’s adjourn for the tea break now and we’llresume at five to eleven. We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNED INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes.    And anyone other than Ms Tlatsana is able to hearwhen they listen to the recording, the conversation?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Ja okay no that is fine.  Thank you we can do – we can proceed on that basis.    Just also – I just emphasize that when you tell me what you hear I want [indistinct] to hear what you are hearing in terms of both conversation – both of you who are talking at the meeting.  This is what he said, this is what I said.    And then the next portion and so on and so on okay?    Okay alright. [MS TLATSANA IS LISTENING TO RECORDING THROUGH EARPHONES]    Okay.    Okay.      Okay first of all let me ask because you have got enough paper there to make notes.   Okay alright.    Ja tell us what you have heard so far?    I am sorry for the?   Or reflector jackets.    Yes.    R400 000,00.    Oh what did you understand that to refer to ANC 104 celebration?    104 years/    Oh so he said they had paid R400 000,00?    They had spent?    On – they had spent in connection with the ANC    104 celebrations.    And was he talking about money that had been taken out of the account of your closed corporation for that purpose?    And who – who is they that he was referring to?  Who Iwas he talking about when he said they had spent?    Oh okay.    And what was your understanding of why you should pay that to them?    Them?    Oh and what did you say to him in response to any of the things that you have just told me he said to you at that meeting?    And that is when he said he would give you – he would forward you the invoice?   Did you understand that the invoice was going to be in respect of the R400 000,00?    Okay.     Did you ask him any further questions about this R400 000,00 and why your closed corporation should pay for it?    You did not ask okay.    As much as possible.    Without you asking too much?    Yes okay.    Alright.    You are ready?  Yes.    Okay yes.    Oh maybe before we do so and the note might refresh your memory but from what you hear what are the points that have emerged so far in your conversation at this meeting that are covered by the part that you have listened to? 1.  He – did you say he complained about you denying the accountant access or that is not part of what is in the conversation so far?    Yes okay. But you said he – he asked that your closedcorporation should refund him and the accountant the R400 000,00 that he said they had paid on the ANC 104 celebrations?    Yes.  And you say your response to that was what?  Did you agree to refund them, did you not agree, did you comment,what did you say?    Yes.  And what did he say in that conversation?    Oh that is where we are going?    Oh okay alright.  But is it – is it therefore fair to saythis part of the conversation that you have just listened to really deals with the issue of the R400 000,00?  This part that you have listened to so far…    Of the conversation is it correct to say all that is dealt with is really the R400 000,00?    For now?    Okay alright.   Okay.   Oh.    Okay that is what he is talking about?    Oh okay yes.    And what do you say in response to this?    In the conversation what do you say?    Yes.    Yes thank you I have got it.    Were there – I am sorry were the two of you sitting at a table in such a way that you could see when he was pointing at this page – at the page that – at the paper that he was writing on?    Or did he bring it closer to you for the – you – for the two of you to share and look at the – at the document?    Ja.    Oh – oh it was quite close?    You were sitting at the same table facing each other?    Oh okay, okay, no that is fine.   Yes I was thinking about that.    Ja.   Ja is that a slanted position a bit or…    Ja.  Ja.    Ja.  So you – so she turned a bit and in a slanted position looked at the page that Mr Van Wyk she says was writing on.  Okay.    Okay.   Before – before you move away from that document that you say he was writing on next to DOT on the right there is a line like a slash and then there is something that looks like P which is a big letter and then is something that looks like an E or small P and e, do you see what I am talking about?  Do you see what I am talking about?   Yes.  Does it mean anything that slash…    That PPE or something like that?    Yes.    Ja.    Is it DPE or PPE?   Oh and what does that represent if you – if you – if you knew – if you know?    Oh did he say anything about it?    In the conversation?    Oh what did he say in the conversation about it?    Oh the one that is difficult to read?    Okay.  And what does that represent, what does it mean?    Minister Lynne Brown?    So you say what – what are the letters that are there because when I look I cannot tell what they are?  What are they? Those letters for Minister Lynne Brown?   Yes.    Oh okay wait, okay, okay.    The one on top of that DPE…    Ja.    Oh Lynn.    Okay and you say that is a reference to the then Minister Lynne Brown?    But in the conversation does he say anything about Minister Lynne Brown?    Or is that a part that is still to come?    Oh okay thank you.   Do you know if it represented anything – represents anything that he said?    You will come to it?    Oh okay.    But that is still to come in the conversation?    Okay alright.    Did you want to say something Ms Hofmeyr?     okay alright.    Okay thank you.    You ready?    Yes. What did you hear?   Yes at the top of the document reflected at page 588.    Ja.    It is 20 what – 20 what?    R20 million?    He says it should go to Ministers.    Okay.  Just in general or does he specify which Ministers or is that to come later – or it does not say?   Okay no that is fine.    You must – ja you must just – it is just that I do not want to forget asking so    If I ask and it is something that is still to come just say to me it is still to come.   Okay.    It is just under 5 million is that what he was saying?    For – for the – for the two Ministers?   Oh that is what he said?    And the two Ministers you – were who and who?    Minister Dipuo Peters and Minister Lynne Brown?    Okay, alright.    Who is Tonakgolo?    The Premier?    Oh, it is like Undanankulu in isiZulu.  Okay, Tonakgolo is – is that Setswana for Premier?    Okay.  So what did he say about the Premier?    Yes.  What did he say about him?    I am – I am sorry.  Before we go to MEC did he mention any amount for Tonakgolo – for the Premier or that is yet to come?    Okay that is fine – that is fine.    And then now he talks about the MEC?    To be given money?    Ja.    And how is MEC – MEC?    Oh MEC, oh.    MEC it is just that he     No it is just that you – you mention both you say MEC– MEC.    So, ja.    At this stage did you understand what MEC – which MEC he was talking about or is that to come later?    Okay, alright and he says HOD as well?    And we will hear later which HOD?   Okay, alright and you do not say anything in response.  You are just listening?    Oh, okay.    I am sorry you said are you referring to …?    Okay.  That was HOD for which department?    In North West?   Okay and what did he say?    Okay.    Yes and did you ask – did you know who that was?    That is what he is – he is saying in the conversation?    Yes, okay.    When you talk about the diagram.  Is it the same document at page 5-8-8?    Okay, yes.    Yes.    That is a block - there is a block written YR1, another one below that YR2, another one below that Y or TR3, next one YR4, YR5 and that is on a vertical column and at the top on a vertical – on a horizontal column there is something like DOT at the top and then there is one on another column next to – on another box next to the one written DOT and on another box next to one – next to the one written one there is a block written M and on another vertical column on the right of the document or diagram there is HACF. There is HCF, there is HFCF and then something that I cannot read.  It looks like 1-1 or 11 and then another one written 11.  On theextreme left there is a column which is vertical …    It is written 5-3 and immediately below that but somehow between five and three in brackets something that looks like two.  In that column there are there are one, two, three, four, five –three places where it is written five three and below that in a small brackets it is written either two or seven. I am not sure and at the bottom there is 15.  Then on the horizontal column at the bottom it is written something that reads like update or upgrade – upgade U-P-G-A-D-E as it appears to me and then there is something that is written that I cannot read on the right hand side of that word and below upgrade or upgade and the word that I cannot read there is 300 and then there is something written after that that looks like a zero that has been shaded and below that there is a triangle written and two – well no I do not know if that is a triangle.There is - there is two written on either side.  I have tried to try and describe …    What I see here.    Somebody else might give a different description of some of the things but I just want to enable you – Ms Tlatsana – when you refer us to any part of that document to be able to just say under – in regard to 5-3 or in regard to YR1 which maybe year one, year two, year three.  Okay, alright.  You – you can proceed then.   Now you say Department of Transport and you are saying so with reference to this diagram.   Are you - are you referring to where it says DOT next to year one?    Okay.  That is Department of Transport?    And then you are saying once off?    Does that refer to – to what appears like one on the block - on the right hand side of DOT?   Hm?    Yes but when you say once off I am asking whether that is a reference to that one or not really?    Ja.    Oh okay, okay alright.   Okay.    Yes.    Oh.  Now DOT on the column next to the – on the block next to the block written year one …    Refers to Department of Transport and the block next to DOT written one …    That represents number one of the province?    And then there is a block next to the block which hasgot number one – which has got one.  That is written M.    You say that M refers to Ministers?    Oh Minister?    Okay and okay continue.    Yes there is H.  There is a block next to the block thathas got M that is written H and below that CF, yes.    In other words for year one up to year five?   The YR1, YR2, YR3, YR4, YR5 which appear on the second column to the left that refers to year one, year two, year three, year four, year five?    So you say that what is written on the – on the column on the extreme right on the diagram where it says H and then CF and then CHCF throughout and I think what is written in regard to year four and year five is just some punctuation mark to indicate same thing.  Is that right?   So it represents that the head of the department and the CFO would be paid right throughout?    The five year period?    And when you look at the column under D – DOT it only – it is only written in respect of year one.    It means they would only get something for duringthat – the first year only in that regard.    Yes the - the DOT was a once off and number one in the province was also once off.   And the Minister was also once off?    So they would be paid something but on a once off basis?    Not every year?    Okay, alright.  Continue.    And the Minister of Transport that he is talking about there in the diagram is it – was it still Minister Dipuo Peters?    Okay, alright.    That is what he says in the conversation?    Okay.  Continue.    Yes.    Before – before he jumped who was the CFO at the time that he was referring to?    The CFO of the …    North West Department of Transport?    Okay.   Page 5-8-7?    On what – on what page is it?    The subsidy or grant?    Yes.   Okay.  Now let us look at that.  In that diagram thereis 31 – there is the number 31.  You say what did he say about that 31 and then there is 20 below that and then there is 51.  Can you just repeat what he said about those number?    Paid by the Department of Transport to your close corporation?    Okay.    Into – into Koreneka?    Okay and R20 000 – R20 million?    Okay and that made a total of R51 million?    And then – and then there is something written below 51.  Do you say that is 18?    Ja, what did he say about that 18 million?    So he was saying there was going to be an increase or was he saying they could make an increase?    He says there was going to be an increase?    Of the subsidy and it would – they would add R18million?    Okay and so that the total amount would – would not become 69?    Would that be now for the whole of the year – 2016?    The increase was it going to be added to the – to what - to the 2015 subsidy or was it going to be for the 2016 subsidy?    Oh okay, okay.    Alright, okay.  Continue.  You did not say anything in response to this part of the conversation?   Okay, alright.    I am sorry before we go to other – to another diagram.  The diagram that we have been dealing with now – up to now at page 5-8-8 yes that diagram.  The figures of 5-3 on the extreme left what did they represent?  What did he say about it or what you understand them to refer to?    Oh, to come.  Okay, alright and also that upgrade and 300 at the bottom still to come?    Okay.  Thank you.    Okay.  You may proceed.    Yes.    Yes at page 5-8-8.    Huh-uh.    Yes that is the one …    That is – ja that is the one that you said refers to number one of the province, ja.    Is that the five …    Where is the five on top?    Okay.  I am trying to locate where the two of you are.    There is province.    Ja.    Oh yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, yes.    Yes.    Oh.    E represented who?    E, oh okay it was not a reference to somebody’sname?    Is there a reference in the diagram to R700 000?    But that’s what he says in the conversation?    And you remember that when he was saying that he was pointing to this E.    Okay.  So just repeat what he said about E, about the MEC.    Yes.    He said there was only R700 000 remaining to be paid to him.    Okay.   Continue.    Oh okay, so he said HOD.   Okay.    Okay, okay but that still was going to, that still related to the 2015 allocation?    Okay.    Yes.    And the money that had been paid in December was R20million.    Did he so far has he indicated how much the two Ministers should get?    How much was that?    Okay, okay.  So that means that the whole amount that your close corporation got in December, the whole amount of R20million that you Close Corporation got in December was to be paid to the two ministers on the basis of R10million each?    Okay, and did you say at this part of the conversation did you say anything about this R20million being paid to the two Ministers?    Okay thank you.    Is that the budget for the subsidy?    Yes.    For the voice?    Boys, for the boys?    So they must get something as well.    Oh, that is the number one of the province, the boys of number one of the province?    Okay.    Yes.  Yes?    Yes, and did he say who his boss and the Chairperson of the Board were that he was talking about, was that still to come?    Oh, okay.    Oh so it was not 53?    You say he was saying that they would get for each of the years, year one up to year five, something between five million and three million.   Oh so there would be one amount and then they would have see who gets how much based on however between five million and three million, it’s not like each one would get either five or three and another one another three, it will be shared between the two of them?    Okay.    That is yourself?    And but is that also in the recording or is that your – just your recollection of the conversation that he is not necessarily in the recording?    It’s in the recording?   Okay.    Yes, okay, okay.    I’m sorry, I’m sorry.    Why do you think the 300 referred to him?    What was the 300 on that diagram at the bottom ofthat diagram at page 588, what does it refer to?    You can’t remember?    And the word upgade or upgrade do you remember what it was all about, what it meant?    Oh so you say this word was meant to be upgrade?    He was talking about the upgrading of the airport?    Oh, okay, okay, thank you.    Yes.   That there would be – there should be an agreement between Koreneka and Mr van Wyk?    Okay, alright.    Did he say what that agreement was going to be for?    Oh of your working relationship, to formalise the role that he was playing, that is your understanding of what he was talking about.    Of your close corporation.    Yes.    Okay, okay, but you – so your understanding was that he wanted an agreement with Koreneka so that he could continue to play a role in Koreneka’s business?    Okay, alright.    I’m sorry before you talk about way forward on the extreme right or if you go horizontally on one that is five years what did that five years represent, what did he say about five years?    Oh, okay, alright.   You had moved to two on the way forward.    So I see there’s a box there and there’s an asterisk on the left hand side of the box and in between inside the box is written one month meeting, is that what he was talking about?    Okay, continue.   Ms Hofmeyr I don’t know whether you don’t want her to finish that line or is it more convenient to finish each line before ...(intervention)     Okay.   Oh was David Mr Kalisilira?    Okay.    So these are the queries he was raising with you?    Okay.    Okay.    Payments for?    Are the letters that appear next to what may be four, but is not so clear, but under three are those letters PMT?    Yes okay and then there is five and then there’sfifteen and then there’s 725 and there’s 75 and there is to company.    (Laughing)   Was Koreneka involved in some farming of some sort, why did you need a tractor?    Is that for doing something on the grass in the airport?    Of watering and maybe cutting grass and so on.    Oh, okay.    So it’s not out of the norm, okay.    Okay.    These things Ms Tlatsana many of them went so outside, so much outside of what you understood you know groundhandling to be about.  Did you understand all of these things to be very  much part of ground handling which is what your business, Koreneka, was about in regard to the airports?    Yes, but my question is different, my question is whether when you entered into or the agreement with S A Express the business that Koreneka was going to be involved in was described as ground handling is that correct?    So and when you explained to me yesterday if I recall correctly, and maybe it was another witness, ground handling, it was very much about processing passengers from when they come to use aircrafts, when they want to fly, they want to travel, they come into the building, they need to check in, their luggage needs to be checked in and they need to be taken to aeroplane or that kind of thing, that’s how you described it, is that correct, or did I misunderstand your evidence?    Yes.  But now this thing of – these things of firetrucks, cutting grass and upgrading the building and so on, didn’t they seem to be very much outside of the business of ground handling as you understood it?    After the agreement had been concluded?    So he said this is what government decided to add?    So – so at least the cleaning part, maintenance and maintenance part that you knew about – you knew about that from some – from a certain stage?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay and…    And being paid by Koreneke?    Oh so therefore the tractor for cutting grass that is the part that would require the tractor?  The maintenance and the maintenance and cleaning part?    Okay, okay.  And you had accepted that that was partof what was going to be Koreneke’s responsibilities after Mr Van Wyk told you?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   And there was an addition on the subsidy in order to take care of the salaries for the maintenance and cleaning staff?    There was no addition?    Hm.    To the agreement.    Okay and how many – more or less how many employees were involved in cleaning and maintenance?  Or you cannot remember?    Oh that is quite a lot of people.      You say they were added without any increase on the – on the subsidy to help Koreneke to pay their salaries?   When I say subsidy I am just referring to the money that came from Department of Transport.   And went to SA Express and then came to you or came straight to you.  I am just using one word for all of those monies.    There was no addition?    Okay alright thank you.    Did you say page 156?    A okay.    Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine but I also wanted to mention to you that from my own side I will not be rigid by one o’clock if we – that westop at one o’clock if we need a little bit more time just to finish her evidence.    So …    So we could continue if we – by that time we are about to finish.    Okay.    I am sorry just before that.  Did we finish with that meeting where she was recording?  Okay let me just check.  On what basis was that meeting ended?  So Mr Van Wyk said a lot of things and you said most of the time you kept quiet you said he must continue. Just tell us some of the points that you made during that meeting?    If any?    That he – that should be paid?    Ja.    If you could assist with regard to that?    Oh the pin code or password.    For the accountant to get into – access the account.    And what did you say?    Oh he was asking you to think about that?    Yes.  And what did you – did you say anything in response to his proposal that your closed corporation should enter into a contract with him for five years?   Yes.  Is there any particular point of importance that you made at that meeting that you want to tell me about?    To him that you made to him?    How long did that meeting take if you remember more or less?  You cannot remember?    Oh okay.  So by the end of the meeting you had notpromised him anything.  You had not agreed to anything?    Yes.    But okay can mean I agree.    Oh.    Okay.  Okay.      Yes okay.  So the meeting ended without any particular conclusion?   Yes alright thank you.    And that is in the recorded conversation?    Okay thank you.    Yes.   Hm.    No you know this one I am not sure of.    Ms Hofmeyr I just want to make sure that we are on the same page on how much is left.    Before you finish.    But part of the reason I want to know that – to know your estimate it is because I do not want you to necessarily rush toomuch when I might still have time.    So what is your present estimate of how much more time you need without doing any injustice to …    Okay.  I can sit another 45 minutes.    I think let us just carry on.  If it is – is that fine with you Ms Tlatsana and with everybody involved?    Okay alright let us – let us continue.    Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.   Ja.    Yes.    Did their withdrawal come about after you had given your version of what had happened or not really?    Oh okay.    One second - I am sorry.    Thank you, proceed.    With reference to the meeting that you held with Mr van Wyk at Spur Restaurant where you recorded your conversation where – when was it when you then decided to make payments – remaining payments and when you had to deal with the question of making a payment to the ANC. Where are we talking about?  What timeframe are we talkingabout?  What – what time, when, which month, in 2016?  The meeting was – was on 23 January.    20 January 2016?    Now when you made this decision to make some payments to some people so that you can have nothing to do with him because you were – he was giving you too much pressure.  When wasthat?    Oh, you cannot remember?   You – you think it could – it could be before – it could have been before the 20 t h before you had the meeting?    You cannot remember?    Late in the year, early in the year, mid-year you cannot remember?    It is early in the year?    Okay, alright.    Ja, but …    I am sorry.  Let us go back.  I do not – I did not get the story correctly.  How did the idea of your close corporation paying the ANC or you paying the ANC something arise and from whom did it arise and what was the occasion?    Earlier on when you talked about your meeting with him on 20 January 2016.    You said he talked to you about your refunding him and Mr Kalisilira – I hope I am pronouncing the surname correctly – refunding them because they had paid a certain – a few millions I think.   Sorry?    Oh, 400 000 not millions.    R400 000 for the ANC 104 celebrations.  Now when the question of paying the ANC that we are now talking about arose was it in relation to that money or was it something else?    To him and Mr Kalisilira?    Yes.    But this time he was not talking about that R400 000?    Okay.    Oh, he asked you to make a donation to the ANC?    Okay, alright and what did you say to this suggestion?  What did you say to his proposal or suggestion?    Yes.  So you agreed?  So you agreed to pay a donation to the ANC?    Did he indicate to you how much he was suggesting you should pay or did he leave that to you?  The amount that you should pay as a donation did he make a suggestion to you or did heleave that to you how much you would – how much donation you would make?    You do not remember him making ….   Talking about an amount?    Okay.  How much did you pay as a donation to the ANC?    R1 million?    Would this have been around early – early in 2016, around mid-year or you are not sure?   Early in 2016?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    Ms Hofmeyr do you want to describe that for therecord or not?    Fixing their face and doing whatever they were doing.  Was it threatening or not really threatening?    Ja.    That is what you were thinking?    What a watch?  Hm?    Okay.    The – the witness is holding her wrist – right handwrist and moving her arm in a – as if she is fixing or rearranging her watch but she says it was not a watch.  Is that right?    It was not a watch.  It was a skin that is – that somebody was wearing around her wrist – his wrist.  Is that right?   Okay.  It is a traditional skin that is worn by African people under circumstances.    It is an animal skin.    A goat skin or you do not know – sheep skin?    Ja.    Okay.  So you – he was making movements with his hands suggesting that – he was touching this animal skin and you say you do not know whether was threatening you in terms of any traditional muti?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay, yes.   The people who were talking to you …    That you say were making you fearful.  Did you say one of them said his name was Sipho?    Ja.    Did you look at the ID or you did not even want to look at the ID?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and among the things that Mr Ngwenya said this person told him was that – was that the money that Mr van Wyk had – I cannot remember if he used the word “taken” …    Moved …    Ja, moved out; was moved out to the ANC or for the benefit of the ANC …    Or something along those lines according to Mr Ngwenya.    Okay, alright.  Are you able to give some description of this person who called himself Sipho or has the – has his face kindof faded from you – you cannot remember or – or in terms also of the height and everything?    Let us talk about Sipho.  Is he tall?  Is he short?   You cannot remember who was Sipho between the two of them?    Ja, but now they will – if you recognise – if you say it is so and so and you say you can recognise them they will say on your own evidence you said when you are fighting you cannot remember people.  How do you remember them then?    Ja, but if they – I asked you to describe them.    One of them was short?    Huh-uh.   Is there anything on his face or anything that stood out for you that would still be there in his – on his face if you saw – saw them on anyone of them?    Nothing stood out?    But that was – that was what two years ago – three years ago?    When you saw them?    When you had a meeting with them?    Did you subsequently see them again?    Why would you be confident that you can recognise them quite well three years later when you saw them once and the atmosphere was – I think as I understand what you say like you were fighting?  Why – why do think you would be able to recognise if you were shown some people and you were asked whether they are among them?    You think you have some chance that you could recognise them?    Okay.   The one who was sending you messages?    Phone calls?    Oh.  Any SMS’ – no SMS’?    And SMS’?    And he was saying – you said he was Sipho?   In terms of what he said was there anything that he said or wrote to – in the SMS’ that suggested that he was one of the two people that had met you?    Oh, okay.    Mmm.    Mmm.   Was this said also in sms messages, these threats ofkilling and so on?    Nothing has happened?    Did they take a statement from you at the policestation?    And as well as the recording?    Oh you recorded these conversations, or these recordings that we were using earlier, which recordings are you talking about?    Which recording are you saying they also took?    Oh okay so you handed those over to the police at Mafeking?    When was that?    17?    As the threats were happening?    And you say up to now nobody from the police has ever come back to you to say how far the investigation was?    Do you remember who the investigation officer was who was assigned to the case or were you never told?    And the police officer who took the statement from you what was his name, or her name?    But you can recognise him if you go into that police station?    Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr do you know whether there is anything that the Commission may have started doing to try and find out how come about close to two years nobody has ever come back to her to say what’s happening about the investigation?    Ja I think we should I mean threats of this nature are very serious threats.   And if somebody goes to the police station and opens a case and a year goes by without anybody from the police station saying anything to him or her is just totally unacceptable, now it’s about two years.    I mean this is why people lose confidence in the police.    Ja, please follow up and let me know what’s happening.  Ja, thank you.  Well you have heard what I said Ms Tlatsana, the Commission will try and find out exactly what’s happening because it’s unacceptable that you are kept in the dark for so long, actually that it takes so long is also quite a matter for concern that investigation takes so long, nobody has been arrested and they have not told you that you have no case therefore nobody will be arrested, and you are simply not informed at all of what’s happening when youhave laid a complaint about such a serious matter.    Yes, but you decided that you would come forward and give evidence despite not feeling safe and despite all the threats.  What I mean is you are prepared to make sure that the Commissiongets your evidence.    Mmm, mmm, thank you very much for coming.    Yes, okay.  Ms Hofmeyr?     In front of me I don’t have any other file.    Thank you, yes.    So the file containing Ms Kalandra Viljoen’s statement will be marked EXHIBIT DD9.    Well before you turn over you don’t intend to get her to read what the document reads there or is that – you want to do that with Ms Viljoen?    But maybe we must just read it so that whoever reads the transcript can associate the document which has got that signature with the writing.   Who and who were in court, who against who in theproceedings, ja the proceedings about which you were in court, who had brought them against whom?     Okay when that litigation was going on you say that Mr Thabeng also indicated that he wanted to be part of the case?   Letters.    Oh, but there was correspondence you can’t remember everything that was said in the correspondence.    But part of it was that  he was contending that he wasstill part of your – of Koreneka?    Okay.  But did he bring proceedings himself or he just – his lawyer just sent letters, did he institute court proceedings, Mr Thabeng?    Oh, okay.    I’m not sure Ms Hofmeyr whether it’s a fair question to her.   Ja, it may not be, it may not be yes.    Mmm.    Yes.    Ja.  Well part of the reason why I am saying I am not sure if it’s a fair question because it might involve law.    And – but there may be a way maybe of asking it in away that is not very legal or legalistic ...(intervention)     Maybe let me try this.  Let’s assume that when one looks at this agreement that Koreneka concluded with S A Express and how everything was carried out if one were to conclude that if you lookat everything this agreement that Koreneka had and some of the payments that came in and came out were tainted by corruption, let’s assume, we are not saying it is so, let’s assume that that were to be the position, would you think that you would still say you must be paid money in terms of that agreement, despite the agreement and the payments being tainted by corruption or would you say well if it’s tainted by corruption then you don’t think you should be paid?    Yes, no, no that’s fine.   It might be something where you need legal advice, there may be litigation going on, you might want to reserve your position.  I don’t think we should take that further, ja.    Yes no thank you.  Thank you very much Ms Tlatsana for coming forward to give evidence, we appreciate it and the fact that you were able to come on a Saturday.  It may be that you would be asked to come back at some later stage, I am sure if you are askedagain you will come back.  Thank you very much.    You are excused.    Thank you.  We will adjourn for the day and we willstart at ten o’clock on Monday.    And thank you to everybody for having taken the trouble to come on a Saturday, we have to try and work hard, there is not a lot of time left before the Commission finishes its work.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.    Indeed Chair.    If I may just request then…    Chair if I may request an opportunity just for the legal representative of Ms Viljoen to place herself on record?    Chair just one or two logistically matters if we may before we commence with Ms – well recommence with Mr Tlatsana’s evidence?  Chair when we concluded fairly late yesterdayevening we were anticipating the prospect that we may be able to get to Ms Viljoen’s evidence today.  Having looked at what still remains of Mr Tlatsana’s evidence that needs to be covered today my suggestion is that in fairness to Ms Viljoen who may well not be reached in her evidence today she be released from attending today to return onMonday morning.  The idea would be then to ensure that we complete Ms Tlatsana’s evidence today so that Ms Viljoen’s evidence can be the first up on Monday morning.    Ten o’clock should be fine.    Thank you Chair.  If we may then continue with Ms Tlatsana?    Chair one thing just as Ms Viljoen is leaving Ido just want to mention that Ms Viljoen’s lawyer was contacted yesterday about the fact that there is an aspect of Ms Tlatsana’s evidence that may be relevant to Ms Viljoen.    Does it require her to be in attendance   At the hearing today.    But she should just be aware of that fact.    If we then move Ms Tlatsana when we concluded yesterday we were at page 17, 17 of your affidavit and we were at the point…    That is – apologies – DD8[a].   Thank you Chair.    DD8[a] at page 17 and we were at paragraph 4.36 there where we were dealing with the R500 000,00 that was transferred out of Koreneke’s account with – for a payment with a reference L Skakkel, do you see that Ms Tlatsana?    Thank you Chair.  Ms Tlatsana you alsotestified about an amount of initially R450 000,00 and then a subsequent about of R50,000,00 that was paid into the bank account of your other business Kenk Supplies and Facilitators and what I would then like to take you to is the next amount that comes into the Koreneke bank account as I have it from your affidavit in DD8[a] andyou will find that at paragraph 4.37 on that page.  What amount was that and when was it received?    No apologies Chair it is paragraph 4.37 on that page.    And Ms Tlatsana you were telling us 8.5 millionwas received into the account and what was the date?    And then your affidavit progresses to track the amounts that then flow out of the account after the 27 August.  If you go down to paragraph 4.38 when – when was the next amount that went out and what was its amount?    What explanation were you given for thatpayment out of the account?    How did he indicate that to you?   Well was your understanding of your agreement with South African Express Airways that you were going to be required to purchase fire trucks?    But Ms Tlatsana you did have an idea of the proposal and the type of work that you envisaged doing, did you not?  As I understood your testimony yesterday you had a sense from him on the day that you were signing that you would be doing ground handling work.  You would be maybe doing some gardening and some cleaning.  So tell me why then fire trucks are a basis for R5 million exiting Koreneke’s account?    And then the second explanation you weregiven security cameras for the airports.  Did you understand that to be part of the business that you would be doing for South African Express?    Were you subsequently I understand from your affidavit you reference a later request to pay some money in relation to security cameras, is that correct?    Tell us about that please?    If I can just give you the reference to assist Ms Tlatsana it is at page 20, 20 of your affidavit which is in Exhibit DD8[a] and you will find it at paragraph 4.50 on that page.   What was that amount that you were required pay?    So can I just get clear on the chronology.  This is after the 20 – the 16 September when an amount of R5 million goes out of the Koreneke account and you are told by Mr Van Wyk it is being used amongst other things for security cameras at the airport, correct?    But then later in 2016 as I have your testimonyyou were required to make a further payment of R495 000,00 for security cameras, is that correct?    And insofar as the fire trucks are concerned were you ever aware of any fire truck having been delivered to either the Mafikeng or the Pilanesberg airports?     And insofar as security cameras are concerned other than your testimony about the interaction in 2016 were you at anyother point aware of security cameras being installed at either of the airports?    Can we just get clear because yesterday yougave us testimony that you actually had not visited Pilanesberg airport until a date at the end of 2016.  Can you tell us what the position is in relation to Mafikeng airport?  When had you been there?    Thank you.  That is a correction then on my part.  I had incorrectly record your evidence to say the end of 2016.  So in both cases you went to both airports for the first time in early 2016, is that correct?    So when you give evidence about what was or was not at the airports the fact that there were not fire trucks and the fact that there not security cameras that you are aware of being installed I must take that and correct me if I am wrong to be evidence related to the period after early 2016, correct?    Apologies it was quite a detailed questioned.  You have just given evidence Ms Tlatsana that you are not aware of fire trucks ever being delivered to either airport, correct?    You also as I understand your testimony said you also do not know of any security cameras having been installed at either of the airports until your interaction around the R495 000,00, correct?    What I am now trying to understand is to what period does that knowledge relate because you only visited the two airports as I understand your evidence from early 2016, correct?    Thank you.  So it is from that date that you can say you are aware of no fire trucks and no security cameras, correct?    If fire trucks had been delivered prior to that do you think they would have still been at the airports?    No.  Well let me be clear about my question.  You did not ever see fire trucks, is that correct?    So the question still remains.  Remember you have been told in – on the 16 September 2015 that the R5 million as I understand your testimony was going to be used to purchase amongst other things fire trucks, is that correct?    And your evidence is that no fire trucks were delivered to either airport, correct?    But you only visited the airports in early 2026, correct?   So what I am probing is, is it possible that fire trucks were delivered between September and early 2016 then never to be seen again from early 2016?    Thank you.      Did you…   No Chair it is the clarification we are indebted to you for.    Ms Tlatsana if that is so did you havesomebody working for you that was on sight in Mafikeng airport and Pilanesberg airport in that period September 2015 to early 2016?    Who was the facilities manager?    Did you make any enquiries of her as to whether fire trucks were being delivered or cameras were being installed?   But she would have been on the ground at the time at the airports?    So we could enquire from her?    Sorry I was saying we could ask her for that clarity?    The commission.    Thank you.    Of course.   Thank you.  Chair I would just like to follow up just so we keep faithful to her chronology and I would just like to get clarification in relation to what you have just said in your testimony.  As I understand your answers to the Chair you started to become concerned about the hijacking of your company around June/July 2015.  Correct?    And then you move to your engagements with Mr Ngwenya.  Now those are in June 2016.   Correct?    Right.  It is important that we just look at that time frame because between June 2015 and June 2016 you do – as I have it from your affidavit - also take other steps to deny Mr van Wyk access …    To the bank account.    We will come to that but just so we have it in time.  As I understand your affidavit – that is around December 2015.  Correct?    So could we just go in sequence then becausethe issues that the DC – the Chair is probing relate to when you first realised that this company has been hijacked and we have your evidence to be June/July 2015 but Ms Tlatsana there are still further payments that come out of the account at that time.  Correct?    So you have not taken steps to stop that conduct in your business yet have you?    Okay.  So if we could then just continue with the payments.  So we contract them chronologically and then I wouldlike to get us to the point where as I understand your evidence you do deny access to the account.    So let – if we – let us if we may go back to page 18 – 1-8 – of your affidavit.  That is in EXHIBIT DD8A because the next amount as I have it - unfortunately you do not attach this to a date – this particular amount but Chair there will be evidence that will clarify for us when this amount goes out and that is the amount referred to at paragraph 4.39.  Tell us what …    Hm.    It is hanging Chair …    And that is actually related to the evidence of Ms Viljoen.    She will go into detail …    About when those – that – that reference to Asset Management and Financial Services CC …    Is her CC.    So we will get that clarity.  It is not available here …    But if we can have your evidence on it Ms Tlatsana.  What payment and in - what amount was made and to whom at paragraph 4.39?    Thank you and Chair just because it may be useful for the record those payments occurred to Asset Managementand Financial Services.  This is evidence to come.  Just so that it is contained here.  On 1 May 2015, 7 May 2015 and 6 September - sorry – those are the incorrect ones.  Those are on the slips. Let me just get it right.  8 May 2015, 11 May 2015 and 16 September 2015 …   But those total - as I have it from your affidavit Ms Tlatsana - nine million.  Correct?    Then let us move to the next payment out.  I have that at the bottom of page 18 at paragraph 4.43.  What was that amount and when was it paid?    And what did – did you understand managementconsulting to be?    And if we then move to …    And for the chronology’s purposes by this stage you had received that R500 000 payment.  Correct?    Thank you.  If we then go over to page 19 and if you could it up at paragraph 4.44.  That is the next payment out ofthe account - as I have it from your affidavit.  When was that payment made, in what amount and to whom?    And what inquiries did you make about that – if any?    So more cameras?    14.9 million was the total amount that was going to be paid for cameras.  Is that what you were told?    It is indeed.    But – but the total – as I understand the evidence.    There is this payment of five million to Neo Solutions for which the explanation of security cameras is given.   We have had a previous explanation of another five million to that effect.    And then there will be a subsequent one of 4.9.    So that as I understand it is why Ms Tlatsana says the total being paid for security cameras was 14.9.    It is the five plus the five plus the 4.9.   So as I understand it then Ms Tlatsana 14.9 in total over this period was going to go for security cameras?    And who gave you that information?   I am going to ask you at the conclusion of this money flow in and out about any documentary records related to these payments.  So just bear that in mind.  I would like to finish them and then we will go back to that question but at page 19 paragraph 4.46 you indicated what else happened on that day of 11 November in relation to payments.  What was that?    Why did they do so?    How – how did they try to find you?    So did they make contact with you?    Oh sorry.  On line you mean on the call?    Okay.  So did you go back to them?    But how did you know they were trying to get hold of you then?    Hm.    And what did she say to them?   So can I – can I just get this right.  On11 November there is a first payment of five million that successfully goes out of the account to Neo Solutions.  Correct?    Did you get an SMS notification of that?    Did you make inquiries about that payment on that day?    Ah.  So I did not understand that previously.  He had told you that before this 11 November payment?    So you did not have reason then to query.  It was in your mind part of the security camera payments?   Hm.    So can I just clarify then does he phone you to tell you this or do you follow up with him after you get the SMS notification of the first five million?   Thank you and that is what he said?    He said it is for security cameras and there isgoing to be a second payment as well?    Right.  Then tell us what happens with the bank on that day?    And what reason were you given for that?    And when did they tell you that?    Because previously you said it was the next day that they contacted you.  I am trying to get this clear as to what was happening on the 11 t h and what was happening on the 12 t h.    Certainly.    Huh-uh.    What reason were you given by the bank for them trying to contact you on the 11 t h?    Of the second five million or both – well the first transaction and the attempted second transaction?    Hm.    And why is 10 million a worry and 4.9 million the next day was not a worry for – for the bank?    So the banks concern – if I understand your testimony – is that on the 11 t h five million went out and then a further five million was attempted to be taken out of the account.  Correct?    The following day – 12 November – the bank made contact with you.  Correct?    Hm.    So it is because of your confirmation that they then did not take issue with the 4.9 going out on 12 November.  Correct?   And as I understand your testimony you gave them the explanation that Mr van Wyk had given you that it related to more security cameras?    Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana I said I would come to the question about documentary proof for any of these transactions.  In this period – remember the first transaction goes out just after your receipt of the 8.5 million on 6 May.  You already start having money go out of your account on 7 May and we have now progressed to12 November in your testimony. What inquiries did you make about invoices - proof of any of these dealings with your business at this time?      No they were not SA Express employees in terms of the contract.       Thank you Chair.  Just for clarification purposes in relation to this latest debate, it does appear that this aspect was governed by the Koroneka agreement, Chair, it’s an aspect that comes up – you’ll find it at page 96 and what  it seems to envisagethere, albeit – let’s be clear on Ms Tlatsana’s evidence at this stage she still hasn’t seen the agreement but at least this aspect of it, what she was told seems to be consistent.  If we go to page 96 of DD8 (A), Chair you’ll see there, there’s a heading clause 12, Personnel and what it seems to envisage there, the handling company, when it’s referred to here as a reference to Koroneka and when there’s a reference to the carrier, that’s a reference to South African Express.  12.1 seems to say that the handling company shall recruit suitable personnel responsible for the provision of services which shall consist of three customer service agents and three general workers, then 12.2 says,“The abovementioned personnel shall, with the assistance ofthe carrier, so that’s SA Express, receive ground handing training to enable them to fully discharge their functions andthen over the page they even deal with uniform which is 12.3,the carrier, that’s SA Express, shall provide the personnelwith uniform which shall be issued once a year inaccordance with the SA Express uniform policy”.     So that part seems at least to be consistent with the text of the agreement.       Indeed.     You would go to South African Express, indeed.      Indeed, well in due course we may be able to probe that with Mr van Wyk, indeed.          Ms Tlatsana if we could then go back to page , of your affidavit in DD8 (A), you’ve actually covered already in your evidence, paragraph 4.49 and 4.50 o that page, where I would like topick it up is at paragraph 4.51.  Now what I want to make clear before asking the question, is as I understand this paragraph, this is not information you had at the time of the payments to Neo Solutions, is that right?         Please tell us what you subsequently were able to establish about the payments to Neo Solutions.      Did Koroneka have any dealings with Batsomi Investments?          And how do you know that?       And what did they establish about any links between Mr van Wyk and Batsomi investments, if you want a record for that it’s at paragraph 4.52 at page 21.      Can I just ask Ms Tlatsana, I accept that youonly came to this information later right but what I understand you were told at the time of the Neo Solutions payments was that it was for security cameras.    Do you know what the business is of Batsomi Investments?       Don’t know but the total amount of 9.9million that went – well of the 14.9million that was for security cameras, as I understand your evidence 9.9million went to Neo Solutions, is thatcorrect?     If we total up and Chair I have done this in advance of today, because my mental arithmetic would not serve me well, if we calculate and add up all those amounts at paragraph 4.51 of your affidavit they total the full 9.9million don’t they?        And as I understand your investigation you established that went out of Neo Solutions to another company called Batsomi Investments.     So if Neo Solutions was a legitimate company providing security cameras they would then have received no remuneration whatsoever for providing the security cameras, is that correct?        Okay Neo Solutions, according to Mr van Wyk got 9.9million to put security cameras at the airports, correct?         But 9.9million was paid out from Neo Solutions’ account, according to your investigations, correct?         So it seems – I’m putting it to  you for your comment in case your investigations went there at all, if 9.9million comes in and 9.9million goes out then Neo Solutions is left with nomoney for the security cameras that they were allegedly putting up at the airports correct?         Thank you.        Yes indeed, she does do that…(intervention).     Correct Chair and he will be giving evidence in the course of next week to the Commission.    Yes.           Let us then move, Ms Tlatsana to December15 because in December 2015 you took steps in relation to your bank account, can you tell us what those were?    Why did you do that?       Ms Tlatsana I’ve actually not found that detail in this affidavit, I ask you of it on the basis of what you’ve told the Commission in your previous interactions with them that you tooksteps in December and that is also referenced in your recording in early January 2016 that you’ve provided to the Commission but please recount for us to the best of your recollection whether you – what you did in relation to 2015, if at all, in relation to your bank account?      You seem – I just want to be clear about your evidence are you clear that, that happened in December 2015 or are you not certain?         Let me just assist to locate you in tie interms of your testimony thus far, you have your discussion with your spiritual leader in June/July 2015, that’s when your suspicions about your company being hijacked first really arise, you then see a series of payments for the remainder of 2015 coming out of the account, the last of those that we looked at was on the 12 t h of November 2015 and then just to assist you in time, your recording that you provided to the Commission of you conversation in the Spur with Mr van Wyk I on thet h of January 2016.  So can I then have your best recollection of when you denied Mr Calasiera access to the bank account, was it before the Spur conversation?     So towards the end of 2015 then?          Fine somewhere there?           But before the Spur conversation and after the last payment that you have recorded in your affidavit going out which is the 12 t h of November 2015, can we work with that timeframe?     I’m trying to establish when you denied Mr Kalisilira access to the bank account and your affidavit has given us a date to work with, which is the 12 t h of November 2015 is when the lastpayment that you reference in your affidavit went out to Neo Solutions, correct?        And you have a Spur conversation with Mr van Wyk which we’re going to listen to the recordings of shortly on thet h of January 2016.         And I’m asking whether you denied Mr Kalisilira access to your bank account between those two dates,between 12 November 2015 and 20 January 2016?         And you – why did you do that, why did you deny him access?         Could we then move to early 2016 in the lead-up to the recording that we’re going to listen to shortly…(intervention).     Thank you Chair, and then we move to thet h of January 2016 when you had a conversation – a meeting, as I understand your affidavit with Mr van Wyk, is that correct?    Please tell us how that meeting was arranged…(intervention).          Ms Tlatsana, Ms Phiri litigated against you in relation to her removal as a member did she not?         What did she say?       And what happened with that litigation?  MS BABADI SYBIL      Yes.      Did she come back?         When did you receive the outcome of that case?       So Ms Phiri’s version of the facts that you’ve just relayed to the Chair indicate that she does not accept that she voluntarily resigned from the Close Corporation, correct?     Subsequent to the resignation though was the department satisfied that they could pay the 20million to Koroneka?          And was it the department who indicated to you they would not pay it as long as Ms Phiri was a member of the Close Corporation?        And did you relay that information to Ms Phiri?           And at what stage then, did you learn that she was employed by the Department of Education as a teacher?       Thank you Chair, with your leave I’d then like to move to the recordings.      Chair what…(intervention).            That should be fine, indeed.       What we’re going to do for this purpose Chair, it’s my proposal that we adopt the following approach.  The recording is quite a long recording in total about an hour and a half, what the Commission has done is extracted excerpts of it which are the ones which are pertinent for today’s evidence.  The quality is not ideal but we’re hoping that when we play it, we will be able, with MsTlatsana’s assistance to determine what is being said.  It’s her recording, she was in the conversation so we will ask for her assistance on that.  The idea is to play portions and then have her translate in a sense or tell us what is being said.           Chair there’s a point in that interaction where it’s Ms Tlatsana’s evidence that Mr van Wyk was writing down on a piece of paper certain handwritten notes, we’ve already seen those notes, it was the first annexure to Mr Ngwenya’s affidavit but what we’ve done for today’s purpose is we have created a version of that, that can be projected on the screens so that we can follow what is going on as Ms Tlatsana will endeavour in her evidence to explain to us what various things on that page mean but for those of us who have the benefit of the bundles in front of us, we’ve also reproduced them.  So Chair if we all go to DD8 (B) and we turn right at the back there to page586.         Ms Tlatsana do you have that yet, it’s 586 it should be right towards the back.         Do you recognise that page?         What is it…(intervention).        And- I’ll ask you about that in a moment, let’s look at page 586 if we may, that’s in Exhibit DD8 (B), you indicated that you recognised this page, what is it?      And if you go over the page to page 587, I just want to explain, Chair, what we’ve done, in order to try and make it a bit clearer on the screen, we’ve broken that page into two parts Ms Tlatsana you’ll see at 587 there’s a section of that page which has been cut out and then if you go to 588 there’s the sort of last third of the page if you hold it in the landscape position, do you see that?         So what I’m going to suggest is that wemove between those two in the course of your evidence and you can indicate to us where we should be looking on the page, for the purposes of the evidence.       With your leave Chair.      Yes when did you meet with Mr van Wyk, when he wrote this down?        And where did you meet?        And you’ve mentioned a recording device that you purchased, did you purchase it before this meeting or prior tothat?     And what did you do with it, when you were meeting with Mr van Wyk?       Had you tested it before?         Were you satisfied that if it was in the handbag it could still record?        And why for this meeting in particular did you purchase the device?         And what money was he desperate about?      So by the 20 t h of January had that 20million been received by Koroneka?         And as I have your testimony earlier that’s a payment directly from the North West Government, is that correct?    If we could then start with the first recording we will play it, Ms Tlatsana if you’ll assist us with what is being said and if at any point in that recording it’s necessary to go to the page which is handwritten you’ll let us know, thank you.       Chair I think we’re going to have to turn it actually softer because I think the amplification is what’s distorting it, Chair it may make sense to adjourn so that we can try and get this right if we may.    Extended break.    We have encountered some difficulties when we seek to play the recording on all of the speakers in the room.  There is a level of distortion that is making it difficult for Ms Tlatsana clearly to hear the recording.  It is therefore our proposal that for the purposes of her evidence today what we do is we enable Ms Tslatsana to listen tothe recordings through earphones played from a laptop and she will indicate to our commission investigator who is with her when she would like to pause and stop the recording and then she will tell us through her testimony what she hears on the recording. Chair these recordings are in the possession of the commission and they can be made available to any person who wishes to listen to them after this evidence is given and they will then be in a position to the extent that they want to dispute any aspect of them to do so.  So it is our proposal just to make today’s evidence proceed that we do it on that basis.    You are certainly able to hear parts of the conversation.    It takes place in a restaurant.   And so there is some background disturbance at points.    There are however parts of the conversation that are very clear.    In English.    Parts of the conversation.   That are in other languages.    And parts that are less clear.    But anyone listening to it will be able certainly clearly to make out parts of it.    Thank you Chair.  My proposal Ms Tlatsana isthat we begin with the first excerpt of the recording which relates to as we have listened to it a reference to a R400 000,00 payment. So what I will ask Mr Madlala to do is to allow you to listen to it, when you want him to stop so that you can relay to us what is being said you can do so and then you can tell us what is being said in the conversation.  Is thatfine?    Thank you.    Ms Tlastsana may I just interject there.  When you say he is that Mr Van Wyk?    Thank you just for the record.    May I just understand.  Is there more of that first recording that we need to listen to?  Is it going on?    Okay so we can continue to play it.  Thank you. [MS TLATSANA IS LISTENING TO RECORDING THROUGH EARPHONES]   So as I understand it that is the end of the first recording.  We will now move to the second – well let me be specific excerpt of the recording, the whole recording as I mentioned earlier is over the period of the whole meeting but we have selected excerpts that are relevant to today’s proceedings so we will move to the second one if we may?  And as I understand it this is one where you may want to refer to the handwritten notes that he was making in the course ofthe meeting according to your evidence.  So if we could beam those up.    Thank you. [MS TLATSANA IS LISTENING TO RECORDING THROUGH EARPHONES]    Ms Tlatsana I see from – you are pointing I think to the page – the handwritten page is that right as you are explaining this to us?    Is it useful for us to then take a look at that page?   Thank you.  Where is he pointing on the page when he is reminding you about the DOT and its agreement?    The page with – that one?    Thank you and where is he on that page at that point?    Right at the top.  So can we just put a market there?  Chair you will find that at – in the bundle DD8[b] at page 588 that is the section we are looking at.    Thank you.  And Ms Tlatsana this – this is whatyou recall him doing physically while he was speaking, is that correct?    Thank you.  And…    Ms Tlatsana just for the record.  We need to describe how you were sitting.    Indeed.    Because people who read this in due course and have not had the benefit of being here will need to understand.  So can I just be clear what I understand from your evidence is that you were sitting opposite or facing each other at the table, is that correct?    And then you made a motion with your body to explain how you had to turn to be able to look at it, did you turn to the side is how I saw it?    I think slanted is probably the way to describe it.    Yes.    We are indebted Chair.  Thank you.    And Ms Tlatsana you were telling us that he made a reference to the Department of Transport and the agreement.  What else did he say?    Is that as we track down on that page those four words.    At the top?    We can see there DOT and then below it it looks like Province.    Is written and then airline is written and then MG CO. is that correct?    So that is where he is pointing at this stage on that page?    Thank you.  And is that the end of the recording you have listened to?    So we will continue on.   Is that above DPE?    Yes.    Ms Tlatsana just before we go off it just to complete this.  There is something above DOT as well on that page I understand that that may come up in the recording but maybe just to complete it now what is above DOT if you – if he made that clear to you?    And above it there seems to be also some writing what is that?    Just the letter D?    Thank you.      No.   We can continue thank you Chair.    We will continue. [MS TLATSANA IS LISTENING TO RECORDING THROUGH EARPHONES]    Indeed.    Thank you Chair.    Ms Tlatsana can I just get one point of clarification?  Previously you indicated that there were two Ministers who were being referred to.  That is when we were at the top of this section of the page but when you are describing now what was said in relation to year one I – I understood you to refer only to one Minister.  Is that correct?    Oh.    Yes.   Yes.    Oh, I understand sorry.  So DOT in that columnnext to YR1 …    Is actually a reference to the Minister …    Of Transport?    Right.  Then the one signifies the number one in the province the Premier …    And the M signifies Minister Lynne Brown whowas the Minister in the Department of Public Enterprises?    Thank you.    Thank you.    Yes.  Could we move to the other side?  This one Ms Tlatsana?    Oh.    If we go back to 5-8-8 – this one and we go tothe top of it.    Keep going.  That one - you want the top of it?    Yes.    Yes.    Is that a 1-8 that we see below the 5-1?    Right.    And then there is a line to total.  Is that correct?    Ms Tlatsana may I just interject there?  The 31million who paid it to Koreneka?    Thank you.    Right.  So now we are going to move to the third recording which I have it deals with further payments.    And Ms Tlatsana if I could just add to the – tothe list that we are now compiling you will see in the top right there is – where province is written there are lines going out from the province.  Then you have got something written there and then I can make out above it a five and a 10.  Will you also address that?    Thank you.    Above the one.  Is that right?    On the right hand side.  So we have got the word province as I am following you Ms Tlatsana and then we have got lines coming out of the words province towards the top of the page and then we have a one on the first line.  Is that correct?    And what does that signify?    And above that is that where we find the number five?    Apologies Chair.  If we – if we go to the top …    Province.   If you take the word province there are four lines coming out from the word province.    And then we will move to the next recording.    Those are the extracts that we compiled for today Ms Tlatsana, but what I would like to ask you is whether you recall any other important aspects of that conversation that you regard as relevant and what might assist you there is to look at that diagram because the Chair as I have it still has a few questions in relation to it,the one that the Chair raised is in that section that is reflected now, the end column on the right that we’ve extracted, you will see down the left hand side that is in EXHIBIT DD8B page 588, there are 53, 53, 53 written with what appears to be little two’s beneath them, what was that section of the page signifying?     Who is the third?      That’s Mr van Wyk.    And what does the two beneath that signify?    And then I think remaining on that page is just the bottom where it seems to say upgade or upgrade and then the 300 split and what appears to be two two’s, can you explain to us what that is?    Is that the word next to upgrade that seems to have been crossed out?    Okay any greater memory about that bottom section?    Okay if we could go to the other part of the page then.   Apologies Chair.    And then Ms Tlatsana we were going to the other section of the page which we have represented in EXHIBIT DD8Bat page 587, if we can look at that with you and you can talk us through what was being recorded there.    I think that is preferable Chair, if before we get to David’s role Ms Tlatsana you’ve taken us in that line where there’s a box one month meeting, you’ve taken us across it, reading from left to right, you’ve told us he was worried about – well he wanted to discuss what was happening, finances, financial and tax, then there’s areference to the word audit there, I understood your testimony to be that’s a reference to the auditor, Mr Kalisilira, is that correct?    And then below that there seems to be MAAR in brackets and a 1 April, what did that signify?    Understood and then you moved down to the next asterisk which reads David role as I have it and you were going to describe that to us.    And then if we go below that there seems to be – well just to right of that before we leave that line there seems to be something scratched out, do you recall what that was?     That’s fine, if we then go down to three there seems to be the words bank statement what do you recall about that?    Did he give an explanation for why?    Well didn’t he have access to that previouslythrough Mr Kalisilira?    So in December as I have your testimony you cancelled Mr Kalisilira’s access to the bank account, so is Mr van Wyk talking about the period thereafter then, he wants access to?    And why did he need that, did he tell you?   And below three seems to be a four, what – is that correct?     What did that mean?  Do you recall?    But then you had moved us to five which I understood you to say are the things which need to be paid, is that correct?    And as I read those it seems to be facilities,tractor, flowers, grass, gardening equipment, ablution upgrade and diesel.  Is that as you read them?    For what?    This is the business of Koreneka we’re now talking about, is that right?       We haven’t really been focusing on that yet in this conversation, but are we now back to what Koreneka is actually doing in terms of its agreement.    Thank you, I mean ...(intervention)     And did you understand those to be things that Koreneka was involved in at the time?     Just to complete this line of questions if I may Ms Tlatsana about what work Koreneke did or did not do.  Did Koreneke ever engage in route marketing for the routes that were flying into theairports?    And that you will recall Ms Tlatsana because you have looked at the subsidy structure page of the main agreement.  If we go in DD8[a] to page 156.     Yes 156 of DD8[a].    Ms Tlatsana if you have a look at that page 156 this is not a particularly good copy we have seen better copies I cantake you to one but I assume you have seen this page before. The second half of the page deals with what the management company    So it is in excess of 29 million that total and as I have your evidence your company never engaged in route marketing?    But you did receive that payment of 29 million nonetheless?    Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana if we can then go – I am conscious of the time and what we still need to cover.  The remainder of your affidavit starts to talk about the success of companies who are then appointed to replace Koreneke for – in relation to ground handling at the airports.  We have had quite a bit of evidence in relation to those aspects from previous witnesses so Chair with your leave my – I propose to ask specific questions that are peculiar to Ms Tlatsana’s personal knowledge in relation to those aspects.    Because we have had the benefit of the settingout of the time and the circumstances of their appointment.    Through other witnesses.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.      If we go next Ms Tlatsana in your affidavit thatis in Exhibit DD8[a] to page 23.      23, 23.  Ms Tlatsana that page of your affidavit there is a heading towards the bottom of the page Valotech agreement.  We have heard about that agreement in previous testimony.  I have a few questions in relation to it.    Could I ask a follow up in relation to that Ms Tlatsana.  Did you understand what Mr Van Wyk then said to you in thecourse of that conversation to be an explanation of where the monies that you had seen go out of the Koreneke account actually ended up?    Let me break it down.  You had previously seen amounts go out of the Koreneke account, correct?    And you had made enquiries of Mr Van Wyk about what those monies were being used for, correct?    Now you sit down with a meeting on the 20January 2016 and as I have your evidence he said to you he is now going to be frank with you, he is going to tell you what is really going on, is that correct?    And then he proceeds to tell you about millions of rands that need to be paid or have been paid to people, correct?    Did you understand him to be giving you an explanation for where the monies that had been taken out of the account previously actually ended up as opposed to the reason he gaveyou previously?    But he did not ever say to you remember when I told you that there was a payment for fire trucks that was actually apayment for this person or that person, he did not say anything like that?    Thank you.    And if we go – I was going to direct you to page 23 of the affidavit in DD8[a].    You have a heading there the Valotech Agreement.  Ms Tlatsana we have heard evidence about that I would like to ask you just a few questions.  Who was Ms Nothando Dube?    And did her role cease at Koreneke?    And what happened?    So I think we had evidence previously that you dismissed her, is that not correct?    When did you do that?    In May 2016?    And what role did she then play in Valotech to your knowledge?    And to your knowledge did that payment take place?    And were you able in that investigation to establish any links between Ms Dube and Mr Van Wyk?    What were they?    We do not need that detail.    Thank you.     Yes I would just like to get a few more details in relation to Valotech.  To your knowledge did they render any servicesat Mafikeng airport?    How do you know that?    Until what date?    Thank you.  I would also like to just draw your attention to a document that we actually received in the course ofyesterday Chair but it has been added to the bundle just for Ms Tlatsana’s comment.  You will find it in Exhibit DD8[b] and you will find it right at the back at page 584.  Chair this is an email that we received.    From Ms Petudi actually yesterday but it was not dealt with in the course of her evidence insofar as the document was concerned.    But her evidence was that Valotech invoiced the North West Department in terms of its agreement with SA Express the invoice came through on an email from Mr Kalisilira and it is for that reason that I want to ask Ms Tlatsana whether she recognises the person who is sending this email at page 584.    And who is that person?    And is that email address indicated for him one that you were familiar with?    It was – you did know his email david@jdk.tax?    Okay.      Were you aware of his – the name of his company or the one he worked at?    Were you aware of the company that Mr Kalisilira worked at?   What was its name?    Mint Books yes that you refer to in your affidavit.  So does this company JDK and Partners mean anything to you that appears under his name in the email?    Thank you.  So – were you aware previously that Mr Kalisilira was involved at least on the face of this documentwith Valotech?    Yes.    Indeed.    Yes.    Probably 45 minutes Chair.   Should we carry on and then break?    It seems to be fine Chair.    I just want to mention I am the only one who has been standing for the whole day but I will keep it together for the next 45 minutes without any problem.    Thank you so much.  We – Ms Tlatsana you have confirmed that despite Valotech receiving a payment from the North West to your knowledge they delivered no services at Mafikeng airport, correct?    Ms Tlatsana I then understand that there was a point at which you were arrested towards the end of 2016 can you tell us about that?    2016.    And what were you arrested for?    And if you go to page 22 of your affidavit in Exhibit DD8[a] page 22.  You indicate at paragraph 4.58 that you were subsequently charged, what was your charge?    That is Koreneke, correct?    And were you granted bail?    In what amount?    And what has happened subsequently with that case?    And was the bail money returned to you?    Just for your reference I have that at page 28 paragraph 4.85.  There you say the criminal matter has subsequently been withdrawn against me and the other role players are now thesubject of criminal investigation in respect to the money laundering referred to in this affidavit.  Chair we will look into that in due course.  I do not propose to do it with Ms Tlatsana you will recall at the opening of the aviation evidence I indicated that we had taken steps to make contact with the priority crime investigation unit.   So we will update you in due course on that.    But Ms Tlatsana I understand your testimony to be that the charges are provisionally withdrawn, is that correct?    Thank you.      And you as I understand it the second affidavit that we have referenced in these proceedings is an affidavit that you have provided to the Hawks, is that correct?    And in relation to your bail who – how did you manage to come up with half a million rand for that bail?    Thank you.  Your personal bank account?   The company - Koreneke’s.    I can take you to page 30, 30 of your affidavit.      Well if you go back one page sorry just so that you can get the heading.  At page 29 you will see a heading ‘The termination of the ground handling agreement’ and at paragraph 4.91 there is a reference to an email that you received.  We can go there. The email is at page 245 in the same bundle.  No apologies that is the order.  The letter is at 242.  That is the one in relation to the proceedings.  I do apologies.  Please go back to 239.  That is the letter of the 13 March please tell us what that says?    And who in particular at SA Express wrote the letter?    Thank you.  And what does it record?  Whatdoes the letter say?    And as I have it from your affidavit you took legal steps in response to this letter, is that correct?    And what happened in those legal proceedings?    15 April.    Apologies Ms Tlatsana.    So the second declaratory – as I have it youobtained - was that the ground handling agreement entered into between yourself and South African Express remained binding.  Is that correct?    And then Ms Tlatsana if we go to page 33 of your affidavit in DD8A you then detail the agreements that were concluded with companies that we have been colloquially referring to as PAMCO and MAMCO.  We have been through those details previously in evidence. What I am interested in – in terms of your knowledge iswhether PAMCO rendered any services in relation to either the Pilanesberg or the Mafikeng Airports?    And when you – when exactly did you move off site at the airport?    And when was that?    In 2017?   But until that point you had been rendered the services at Pilanesberg and Mafikeng.  Correct?    You say on page 34 paragraph 4.108 that   Right.  So you can say until May 2017 they were not rendering the services.  Correct?   But you do not have knowledge after that point.  Correct?    Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana I would like to ask younow just in summary to go to a diagram that has been prepared by the Commission.  You have been show this diagram previously and you will find it in EXHIBIT DD8B right at the back.  It is at page 5-8-5.  Ms Tlatsana you have a copy in front of you. There is also a graphical representation that is been displayed in the room.  You will see on the top left there is a little what looks like a house representing the North West Government and then you will see a series of lines in red on that diagram which when this was put together was intended to denote payments out of the North West Government and you will see a whole number of lines at the top –covering the top of the page - going from the North West Government to South African Express.  Do you see that?    There are also payments going from the North West Government into Koreneka.  Do you see that?    And then payments down out of the North West Government to Valoteck, MAMCO and PAMCO.  Do you see that?    And then below Koreneka there are a series ofpayments out.  Ms Tlatsana this has been produced based principally on your affidavit evidence as well as certain of the evidence Chair of other witnesses.  So it is only fair Ms Tlatsana can only speak to that of which she has personal knowledge but we thought it useful just for summary purposes for us to get a picture of how much money and towhom it went. So if we talk about your aspects Ms Tlatsana you can confirm – can you – that 20 606 435 million - that is the line between the North West Government and Koreneka - that money came into Koreneka.  Correct?    And the line from South African Express which is in the top right hand corner down to Koreneka of 31 million.  Can you confirm Koreneka having received that?    And then out of Koreneka this is tracked from your affidavit there as the 500 000 that went to (indistinct).  Correct?    Another 500 000 that was given a reference management consulting.  Do you recall that?    Two million that went to a Mr Peters.  Do you recollect that?    Nine million that went to an entity calledAMFS?  As I recall it the only indication you were given of that on a statement was an entry movement and finance.  Is that correct?    9.9 million that went to Neo Solutions?    And then the balance of that is 29.1 million.  Do you see that?    And you indicated there Ms Tlatsana as retaining that 29.1 million.  Do you see that?    You will recall yesterday we have asked for an account of what happened to that 29.1 million and I understand you will still be providing that to us in due course.    You did give us some information about it in the course of your evidence yesterday.  You said at least 500 000 was paid to your associated company around June/July 2015.  Is that correct?    Ms Tlatsana I also understand that you made another payment out of that account to the ANC.  Can you – in early 16.  Can you please explain to us the circumstances around that payment?    20 June.    Sorry- 20 January it was.    Could I probe that a little bit further?  How did you obtain details for the payment to be made to the ANC?    In the North West.   400 000 Chair.    400 000 – as I have it.    And as I understand your evidence you got the account details from the Regional Office of the ANC.  Is that correct?    And when you provide us with your affidavit in due course accounting for the 29.1 million that is not accounted for on your affidavit I take you will get the details for when that payment wasmade?    Amongst others and can I ask you today to your recollection were there any other payments that you made to political parties or politically connected persons?   But you will go back over the bank statements and give us a full account?    Ms Tlatsana there are one or two sort of tie up questions that I want to put to you but before we go there.  Your affidavit to the Hawks talks about threats about that you received over the period of your engagements with Koreneka and South African Express.  Can you tell us about those?  What – what did they involve?    That is – can we just locate in time.  December 2016 is where you – when you arrested.    Correct?    So that is where we are in time?    A little bit behind that?   Before that, thank you.    I am not sure I will do it justice Chair.    Ms Tlatsana did you feel fearful in this interaction?    Ms Tlatsana you – I think you mentioned somebody amongst the people who approached you identifying themselves with the name Sipho.  Is that correct?    Yes.  Just please tell us about that because it is quite important what the name of the person was.    Well …    Did you catch a surname when you looked atthe ID?    No.    If you saw them …    If you saw them again would you recognise them?    And with what level of certainty do you recall the person’s first name being Sipho?    So you had that confirmation.  Did you?    Of the person in the office?    Chair some significance we submit and we will certainly investigate it further but you will recall that Mr Ngwenya’s interaction …   Later in the year is with an individual who he recalls identifying himself as Sipho.    So this will be an aspect we will investigate further.    Yes moved from …   Or moved out, yes.    Hm.    Indeed.    Hm.    Thank you Chair and Ms Tlatsana that was – I asked you what threats you had received.  That was the first example that you gave.  Were there any others?    Ms Tlatsana before you go to the last one I just want to locate us in time.  You do not have to go there but as I have it in your affidavit to the Hawks you said that that funeral was in about June 2017 is that – does that accord with your memory?    Thank you and then your third example.    Chair we haven’t, as matters stand, as I have it, this is actually the first time that certainly we’re hearing about it, what we have followed up on are the criminal cases that have been opened in relation to this whole money laundering scheme, that is therespect in which we have received the report that I make reference to but there’s no reason why we shouldn’t ask for an account on this as well, so we will put that in process.    Indeed Chair.    It’s unacceptable.  I mean they may have done something but they haven’t told her and the fact that they haven’t toldher what’s going on is unacceptable.    Indeed Chair, we will certainly follow it up.    Thank you Chair just one or two concludingquestions, they are small aspects but they are actually going to be relevant to the evidence of Ms Viljoen and so Ms Tlatsana is going to be asked one or two questions in relation to them.  Ms Tlatsana you have a file near you which includes Ms Viljoen’s evidence.  Chair you should also have yours, it’s a soft file.   I think your registrar indicated it would be put there yes.    Chair it hasn’t been entered into the evidence yet, we had hoped to have Ms Viljoen today (break in audio) three pages that I would like to ask for Ms Tlatsana’s comment on because she knows what Mr van Wyk’s signature looks like, given that she has signed agreements with him.  I propose that it be entered into the record as EXHIBIT DD9.   Ms Tlatsana if you will go into that bundle, DD9, to page 64.    64, you will see it in the top right hand corner of each of the pages, they’re KV and then they have a number after them, it will be under the tab 7, have you got that?    Thank you.  If you turn that page to landscapeyou will see a signature in the bottom left hand corner, do you recognise that signature.    Whose signature is it?    How certain are you of your ability to recognise  his signature?    Have you seen him sign anything else?    What else?    If you turn over the page to 65 ...(intervention)     That was my intention Chair, as I have it Ms Tlatsana has no personal knowledge of this page, Ms Viljoen will explain to us in her evidence what it is.    Of course, right.  So just for record purposes in bundle DD9 at page 64 there is a page bearing a date of 01.05.2015 and on that page is written R2million received by B T van Wyk and then there seems to be a number, M for mobile of – I won’t read that out for privacy purposes but we can see it on the page, and then below that onthe left is the signature Ms Tlatsana that I’ve asked you to identify correct?    And you’ve identified it as belonging to?    Thank you.  If you turn over the page to 65  you will see another page similar to the previous one, this one again has a date, 7.05.2015 R2million received by B T van Wyk and then the same number recorded there and do you recognise a signature on that page?    Whose signature is it?    And if you go over lastly to the third page in that sequence, page 66 of Bundle DD9 again a page with a date at the top 06.09.2015 R5million received by B T van Wyk, the same mobile number and below in the middle of the page do you identify that signature?    And whose signature is it?    Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana also relevant to Ms Viljoen’s evidence that will commence on Monday, can you tell us about the investigator who was assisting you in your case, what was his name?    Oh you have a series of cases, I do apologise, the one involving your criminal complaint against Mr van Wyk who was that investigator?    Yes, that’s in the Hawks and was there a forensic investigator who as assisting Captain Magosi.    Judeel, how do you spell that Judeel?    Thank you.  Now to your knowledge does he have an official position in the Hawks?    You don’t know, you don’t know whether he’s employed in the police force or priority crime investigation unit?    Used to be?    Do you know where he currently is?    And has he ever relayed to you an interaction that he had with Ms Viljoen?    Let’s just pause there, who is Ms Magosi?   And what did he say about him and Ms Magosi?    Mr Judeel yes.    Is that all you recall?    And do you remember when that was that he gave you that information?    Then I just need to ask you for completion sake, Mr Thabeng, who was one of the members who you added to the close corporation, did he dispute his resignation from the corporation at all?   So he wasn’t in the same category as Ms Perry who suggested that she had been unlawfully or fraudulently removed from the register?    He did it on his own, and was there any litigation against you that he embarked upon?    But then, can I just get clear because I – my question was did he dispute his resignation and as I have it your answer was no, but then I asked well has he litigated against you about it and I understand your answer to be yes, and it related to the fact that he was still a member, can you clarify that for us?   Which proceedings were those?    Thank you Chair, Ms Tlatsana in conclusion from my side certainly we understand it to be the position that you are still seeking payment from the Northwest Government in relation to thisagreement, is that correct?    You indicated in the course of your evidence that you were told by Mr van Wyk that as a parastatal South African Express doesn’t need to go through a tender process, do you recallthat?    If you were now to be told that South African Express must go out on tender before it grants the contract of the type that you got, a ground handling contract, and you know as a fact that process wasn’t followed before your contract was concluded what would be your comment on the proposition that your contract is unlawful?    You can’t.    You can’t.  If you were persuaded that it was unlawful to have concluded that agreement with your company without any tender process having been followed I assume, but I would like your comment on it, you wouldn’t have a basis for continuing to pursue payment out of the Northwest Government or South African Express, is that correct?    But if that contract was unlawful from the start then you would have no claim for that money would you?    It may not be.      No, I am indebted to you Chair, the force of the point is simply that one of the questions that remain outstanding for the Commission, and it’s fair that I put this to Ms Tlatsana is that we do not know what happened to the 29.1million that came into Koreneka as matters stand here and how it was accounted for in the business.      And that is of concern because the scheme of these arrangements suggests an underlying invalidity in relation tothose contracts.    And it is flowing from that that I am interested to have Ms Tlatsana’s submission in relation to her continued pursuit of funds notwithstanding everything that she has uncovered about – to quote your affidavit, the sham that these agreements were.    It may.    Yes, technical, indeed, indeed.    Certainly Chair.  Chair those are the questions from our side.    Thank you Chair. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Good morning Chair.   Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.    The amount is 8.5 million Chair it enter the account on the 27 August.    The date was the 27 August 2015 Chair.    The next amount was 5 million that came out from Koreneke account on the 16 September 2015.    Mr Van Wyk indicated to me that it is for other stakeholders, fire trucks and the security cameras in both airports.    He called me to inform Chair. ADV KATE    Other stakeholders to me by then it was yes the – like he said the fire trucks and the cameras in both airports that was my understanding Chair.    By that time I did not have thecontract Chair to know what was entailed in the contract.    I did not know Chair that was the information that I was given by Mr Van Wyk that they are going topurchase the fire trucks and the cameras.    No Chair.    No Chair, no Chair.    No Chair.    Yes Chair.    At a later stage in a – 2016 and I received a call from the Mafikeng securities that there have beencameras that they have put and I have to pay – Koreneke has to pay an amount of R495 or 65 if I am not mistaken.    Yes.    I was required to R495 000,00 Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    There was never a fire truck delivered to any of the airports Chair.    I have never seen any security cameras being installed in any of the airports Chair.    I started going to the – to both airports from the beginning of 2016 Chair.    Yes Chair.   Come again with your question?    Yes Chair.   Correct Chair.   Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    No Chair.   I only saw an old fire truck in Mafikeng airport which when I asked Mr Kalisilira he said it is coming from Mpumalanga it is being hired to come and assist.    Correct Chair.   Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    No, no, no Chair.    Thank you.    There were no…   The new, the new truck they were talking about it was not there and if it was delivered I would – I would have known I would have seen it.    That was not a new fire truckaccording to…    That was not a new fire truck Chair.    Yes Chair.    No Chair I did not.    No I – I did not know Chair.      I would not have known Chair becauseI have never been there.    No, no.    No, no Chair.    No I would not know Chair.    Yes Chair there were facilities manager as well as the staff – the ground handling staff, the cleaning and the gardeners.    It was Ms Nothandu Dube.    No I did not enquire from her.    Yes Chair.    No I did not enquire from her.    No.    She would have – she would have said if a fire truck would have arrivd.   The ground handling staff or the gardeners.  I think they would – no, no not I think – they would have reported but anyway it is not their responsibility to report to me.  The person to report is the facilities manager.    Chair there was no relationship between me and Ms Nothando Dube she was reporting to Mr Brian Van Wyk.    Yes Chair I would say that.    Yes Chair if – ja.   From the beginning – from theinception of …    Of the business.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    If I have to respond to that Chair.    The business was hijacked from me.    Yes Chair.    Um…    Chair the business was hijacked in the beginning because a lot of things were happening.  Mr Kalisilira would do the transactions I would not know.  I would just see from the phone that money has gone and after the money has gone if I ask I will be toldanother story that the money has gone according to the way it appeared on the statement and on the phone.  If I have to – to ask of the daily running’s of the business no, no it is not necessary we are doing the reports – the reports are in the files – we are doing the reports and then we are giving the reports to SA Express because on daily basis for whatever services that was done they have to send the reports to Ms Jacobs, Maureen Jacobs.  So they were communicating alone the…    I had no control of it Chair.   Okay.    Chair in the beginning when – during the flow – immediately when the first money enters into the account if Iask I was irritating the tone of Mr Van Wyk started to change.  He will just shut me out and answer me quickly just to dismiss me.      Which is…    Okay.    No it is difficult.    2015 I think June, July.    10, 15.   Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    It was a concern to me Chair and I communicated this concern with my spiritual father in church and he advised me that you know if things are going like this the only thing that you do is record everything – everything that is happening, everycommunication record it so that you could have something to stand on.    No Chair.    No Chair.    No Chair.   Yes Chair.    No Chair.    According to Mr Van Wyk he was saying that there would be – it is just for the – for the [indistinct] to indicate that at least people are there.  They will just get small portionof dividends at the end of the year.      Yex.    Yes Chair 33, 33.   And then I was 34%.    No Chair I did not.    Yes Chair I thought of all those but now I – I have to have something on concrete to say this is what theywere doing.  I did not come that I should be on a haste to take any legal steps hence I reported to SA Express.    My experience.    If I have to – can I check my statement?   Chair I do not remember the time but ja that was …   Yes Chair.    Chair Mr Brian Van Wyk’s character is – he is a very arrogant person and he is very bully.  And he was very bully by the end I was to do as he says.  And if I questioned he would threaten me that he will report me to the ANC people, his – he issecured by the ANC people so what he is telling me to do I must just do as he says I should do.    Yes Chair I was scared because I – I…    By then what came into my mind that was the time – that was – I do not know whether it was during or after the – that incident of Mr Bozwana when he was killed and the – for me to save my life is just to be quiet and abide with what Mr Van Wyk wassaying I should do.    Because he would boast to me that he is a high person in the ANC and I am – I am asking too much questions.    To be killed Chair.    Chair Mr Van Wyk…    Chair here is the project that is going on and I am busy asking Mr van Wyk so many questions.  He is getting irritable.  I am calling – I am not finding him and what is it – the thingwas what is it that I want to know because I told you that we are here – I am here to assist you to see that the project is going smooth. Why do you not just relax as I told you that you should just relax?  That is what he was saying.    Every communication, yes Chair.    For the purpose …    For the purpose if maybe this would lead me into – maybe if killing, death or maybe this at a later stage just be observant, just be listening to him and be observant.  Create conversations so that he should end up saying what his intention is he – does he want to do with this company because the way he was goingon it was not good.  It was very bad.    Yes Chair because it was too much on my head.  I did not – I could not even think straight by then because here is a business.  Here is my life and then I – I was seeking advice from the people.  One of the first person who I spoke to is – it was Ms Jacobs who is working for SA Express and then she advised me that why do you not contact the security in our company, Mr Ngwenya …   And – to inform him this – about – about this thing.  Anyway this – these things they came in 2016.    About – go to – contact Mr Ngwenya and try and talk to him because immediately after – can I Chair?    Yes because in January when I was refusing them access into the account Mr van Wyk and Ms Phiri they went – they opened a case against me that I illegally took Ms Phiri outof the company and by then Ms Phiri resigned because there is a story before then in the company.    Correct.    Yes, yes.    Correct, correct.    Yes.    Yes.   Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    No, no Chair.    Okay.  Yes Chair.    The amount is nine million that has been made to Asset Management and Financial Services.    Correct Chair.    On 21 September 2015 500 000 was paid to management consulting.    No I did not Chair.    No Chair.  There was …    No chair.    Yes Chair because I was asking – I was talking too much.  I was asking lots of questions too much …    According to them.    Yes Chair.  I just decided to stop.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    R5 million was made to Neo Solutions on 11 November 2015.    I inquired and it was said that it is for the cameras.    Yes.  Cameras were – were supposedto be 14.9 million.    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    Mr van Wyk Chair.  On the same day of – of 11 November 2015 Mr Kalisilira attempt – attempted to transfer R5 million into Neo Solutions and the bank reversed that transaction.   Because the bank needed to confirm the correctness of – of this transaction and they were trying to get hold of me.  They did not find me on line and they did not find Ms Phiri to confirm this transaction and then they reversed it.    By calling me.    Yes.  They tried to get hold of me.  They did not find me – get me on line.   On the call yes.    No, I did not go back to them.  You cannot call – you cannot go through if you call the bank on the – onthat dial line.  You cannot.    And she too – she was not on line.  Though at a later stage they said they managed to get hold of her.    Ms Phiri told the bank that she does not know anything about Koreneka.  She does not know anything about five million.  She does not even have that amount of money in his account.  She is just a mere teacher.    Yes Chair.  That is what the bank told me.    Correct Chair.    Yes I did Chair.   I did not make inquiries because Mr van Wyk has already mentioned that there is going to be money amounting to this for the purpose of security cameras.    Yes Chair.    No, no.  Not – not before - not before wait.  Not before.  After this transaction went …    And then said Babadi this money is for the security cameras and there is going to be another amount that is going to go out from the company because we need to install the security cameras.  They are not there in the – in the airport.    I called him after – after this first five million has gone out.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.    The bank reversed the transaction.    Because they did not find anyone of us from – on the phone.    The very same day.   Can I – can I go back to my – my statement …    And refresh my mind?  Yes, yes Chair.     And the network there – I remember if I refresh my memory right - the network was not good that day and I was in Mafikeng the following day.  I arrived late that very day.  YesChair on 12 November that is when now the bank informed me that they tried to call me and that is when they made another transaction of 4.9 million on the 12 t h.    They wanted confirmation of these transactions?  Of the first – of the secondtransaction for the – for the same day because it – it was going to mean that on that day 10 million was going to go …    Out, yes.    Chair I gave the bank an explanation according to Mr van Wyk that Mr van Wyk says there has to be security cameras at the airport and now those monies are going to be paid into Neo Solutions.  That amount is going to be 14 – it was supposed to be15 million and then they made 14.9 million for the cameras.    Correct Chair.   Wait.  Can I go through this?    Yes the – the bank called me the following day and I confirmed that it is okay that the 4.9 can – can be paid out Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Chair I was not allowed to ask and I needed to hold meetings with them so that I can see the report and theinvoices and they were just not ready – they were just reluctant to give me that information of – of the invoices for every transaction.    Yes Chair.    After I spoke to my – to my spiritual father and he said record these people because these people I think their intention is just to put you into trouble …    With all these monies.  Record everything that they are saying.    That is when now I began to record every trans - every conversation.    Yes Chair.    Chair that was …    Chair that was – that was my concern and my torture that I do not know what is going on and nobody is saying anything for me and what is it that I – Chair I think I was - I was in a confused state.   Chair it did not come into my mind not – not by then.  You know – I did not know who to talk to.  I was just – I was frustrated Chair and you can imagine now you are holding – I am holding this kind of business and then the next thing now I am jumping – you know – I was – I was not at - I do not know what to say to that Chair.   Yes Chair.    Chair I was relaxed with that by then because forward – because I wanted to – my – my stronghold by then was let Mr van Wyk be telling me because this thing I can see that it is not going okay.  Let him be saying something that will surely incriminate him that now he is – he is doing these monies because Iwas just going alone with this trying to trap him because I did not want it to be hard on him to indicate that I am not happy. I was just going with him being underground just for me to end it up getting information that what is he trying to do with all these monies because if I ask of the invoices I am not been given invoices.  I am not been given any information and who would I talk to.  It never came into my mind that I should maybe contact the lawyer.  I was just foolish by then.    No Chair it would not – it would not be – it would not be okay because that was not the idea.  The idea was this is the contract that I have gotten and let me just leave Mr van Wyk. Let them do this.  Let them put these cameras and whatever and then after all these works are done and then I will – I will have access into my company because – okay.    Ja, because these are the things that he was saying that they have to be put into the airport.  Let them just do all those things and then after that I have got to go my way.    Correct Chair.    Mr Kalisilira was the one who was doing the salaries Chair.    Yes Chair because the – the staff signed the – the contracts.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    According to Mr van Wyk he said it is – that is part portion of my – my share.    My dividends, thank you sir.  Thank you Chair.    The airports belongs to – to the North West Government.    Yes Chair.    No, no I was not working     No, no the – the staff – the ground handling staff were paid by Koreneka but they were the SA Expressstaff.    Yes Chair.    No they were – they were put in uniform of SA Express.  They were SA Express staff but now their – their salaries were coming from Koreneka because according to – to this agreement all their monies they were going to be paid back into Koreneka.  SA Express was going to pay back for the money that they have – for the salaries of the ground handling staff only.     Yes Chair.      Yes Chair.      Yes Chair.      Yes.      Yes Chair.      The explanation was, they are doing the SA Express work of ground handling.      Correct.     Yes I established that the money that was sent to Neo Solutions, Mr van Wyk got R300 000 cash payment on the 4 t h of January 2016 and then 4million was paid to Batsomi Investment Holdings on the 11 t h of December 2015 and then 3million was paid to Batsomi Investment on the 22 n d of December 2015, 1.4million was paid to Batsomi Investment on the 10 t h of March 2016 and 1.2million was a payment to Batsomi Investment Holding on the 29 t h of March 2016.     No      That’s now when I have appointed the investigating teams to assist me to trace where did all this monies went to.      Yes, what we established is that Batsomi Investment is a company that is registered on the 11 t h of November 2014 and the director for the company it’s Sipho Via-Phiri who is Mrs Phiri’s son and who is Mr Brian van Wyk’s life partner.     Correct Chair.       No, no, no Chair.      Correct Chair.      Correct Chair.      Correct Chair.      Come again with your question.      Correct Chair.      Correct Chair.      Correct Chair.      I went to the bank and stopped the access – Mr Calasiera(?)to have access into the account.     Because I could – wait, wait, where is it here.       What I remember with the bank account I stopped the access of Mr Calasiera into the bank account because I went to the bank and changed the code and I put my phone for the OTP and…(intervention).      Yes.     Certain.      Yes it was before the Spur conversation.      I should think – or beginning of 16.      Ja somewhere there.      Come again with your question Ms Kate.      Correct that’s the last payment that went out, correct.      Correct Chair.      Correct yes, correct Chair.     Because I came to realise that money is going out without any invoice, without my knowing, nobody is contacting me, so let me just stop this business with him.      About denying Mr Kalisilira access      Correct Chair.      No Chair.     No Chair.      No Chair.      I took action and they realised when they tried to access that they had been denied access.      Yes Chair.    It was on the 31 s t of December.         When I denied him access.      Yes Chair.      No Chair it was the accountant.    Yes I think it was on the 3 r d of January Mr van Wyk called me to tell me that Mr Kalisilira is telling him that he’s trying to access…(intervention).      Access the account and it’s refusing.      I don’t remember but…(intervention).      Both of them – it was just series of incoming calls.      Correct Chair.      Yes they were not involved Chair.      Yes.      Mr Thabeng resigned sometime in May or beginning of June.      2015.     No he wasn’t there for a long time, immediately after the first payment that enters and then he resigned.      Yes Chair.      Yes he was asking about all this monies that are going…(intervention).      In and out and I explained to him that Mr van Wyk says that they are going to be for the repairation of the airport, refurbishment of the airport.     And then he just resigned says he’s no longer interested.     Yes Chair.      Mrs Phiri stayed on – Mrs Phiri resigned on the 18 t h of December.      Of 2015.     That time, that was the time when the Department of Finance wanted to make a payment to Koroneka and nowwe were to complete the documents with the Department of Finance and now she – yes that was the time when she resigned.      Yes Chair.    Chair because she didn’t meet the requirements of being a member yes because she didn’t disclose that she is working and in the Department of Finance tender – Treasury…(intervention).      Yes Chair and there was a circular that was in the Department of Finance that anybody that is working for government it’s either you work or…(intervention).     Yes because if you do that there are serious consequences that will be taken against those who did not disclose.      Yes because now from Treasury they were saying that – by the way you should know that if now she will be here in this company working, now it means that her pensions is going to be taken away from her and – yes Chair and I explained this to her she says, she cannot afford to lose her life pensions for this business.     They were not doing anything Chair.      Ja they were just there.      Thank you Chair.      She did.      She said I removed her illegally from the company.    Yes, we went to Court and the outcomes were, I falsely removed her from the company and she should be – she should come back.      No not yet.      Sometime in 2016, I don’t remember when but it’s sometime in 2016.      That’s what she said, yes Chair.      Yes the money was paid in to Koroneka.      That is the information that I got from the Treasury Department.   Yes I did.      That was the time now, that I realised that she’s been with the Department of Education.     No Chair, it didn’t bother me to ask.     I’ve never – by then I’d neverseen…(intervention).      I’ve never known her before.      Mr Thabeng I just knew him as SABC employee.      Okay.     Yes Chair.       Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.       Yes Chair I did.      Yes Chair.

Chair the cleaners and the gardeners Mr van Wyk said the agreement that was entered into with government,they adding some responsibilities of gardening into Koreneka.    Correct Chair.    Yes he said the Department of Transport has added some extra responsibilities into Koreneka, not into the contract, into Koreneka for Koreneka to be doing, since Koreneka has got the cleaners and the gardeners of the airport and to confirm that I even went to Mr (indistinct), Mr [indistinct] told me the same thing hence now he even gave me that circular that this is – these arethe budgets that have been located for the rest for – for SA Express and then these other ones are for management company to be doing that – this kind of work.    Yes Chair this is what I was told about Mr Van Wyk.    And since – because I have not beento the airport remember.    And now those people they were – this the work that they were doing.    Yes Chair.    And being paid by Koreneke.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Chair I found the – in 2016    When now I took over I found those responsibilities being done.    People were doing that kind of – of job. And even the salaries they were paid from Koreneke.    And – and even if I asked the airport manager, the airport manager explained to me that yes this according to what he knows yes this is what has been agreed upon.  Even though the contract does not say that but now he say that that is why the contract has to be looked into and then that was the response that I gotfrom them.    No there was never an addition.    No the subsidy payment.    Was according to the…    To the schedule that was attached onthe service level agreement.    Chair – I would say 30 Pilanesberg, 30 Mafikeng.    Yes Chair.    No Chair.

And if I could be of assistance and …    Yes if I could release and give back the pin codes.    Ja the password to Mr Kalisilira tocontinue.    Correct Chair.    I did not say anything.    Yes and I just kept quiet.    To my knowledge I – if I remember well I never said a word regarding to that.    In the…   In that meeting Chair the purpose of the meeting was Brian to extract more money from the company and my main story was I do not understand why you need money.  I do not understand why you talking about people that are getting their salaries every month to get money from this company and I do not understand – you are busy making arrangements and all this things you are just informing me you are not telling me – you come here to tell me what to do and I am not happy about that.  I remember this somewhere where I was now even scolding him that I am not going to take his story.  Andhe just wanted to – his presentation was Babadi I am in trouble please these people they want their monies that we promised to give them.  Make access available so that we can pay them because there is another 18 million coming in February.  So that is the one that we will play around with.     Chair I think it is – it did not take long less than 30 minutes.      Chair I – no, no, I – as I remember I did not promise him anything.    Because when he was busy talking Iwas saying okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.    No okay.  My okay was to dismiss him.    So that he can get out of my back.    Because at least – because I got what he wanted to say    No Chair if I remember no.    And there is one fact here that you think we should say.  In the beginning of this meeting what he mentioned that I made Ms Kate and the gentleman aware.  He said Babadi to be honest now let me be fair to you – I have not been fair to you all this time.  Let me now be open to you and tell you exactly what is supposed to happen.  Remember that is what he said.  Now that is what he said.  That I have not been fair to you please now I am here let me just be open and fair to you and tell you actually what is going on.   Correct Chair.    Your question again?    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    Chair Mr Van Wyk’s story was not adding up.  It was not adding up.  He was just everywhere.      No, no he did not say – no he did not say that one.    According to my memory he did not say that.    Hm.   Nothando Dube was the facilities manager in Koreneke during the year 2015.    Yes her role ceased in May 2016.    She did not – she did not extend – she did not extend her contract because everybody was – has extendedtheir contract.  She did not extend her contract and she was just there coming every day to office.      It is correct I dismissed her.   I do not remember the date but – maybe the 22 May somewhere there.    Correct Chair.    No after she left some two days after she left now in the corridors I heard that she got a company and her company is being paid – is going to be paid in the 1 June for her totake over the responsibilities of Koreneke in Mafikeng airport.    After my investigation yes that payment did take place.    Correct Chair.    After my attorney Mr Julian Knightenter into the shelved warehouse to check the whereabouts – to make a follow up on this Valotech company when is it registered is then when now we realised that the owner of this company initially it was the name of the company was Estala – Lavel Estavel and it was Mr Van Wyk’s company with the registration number K2013149778 and then thiscompany the person who put it on the shelf his name is Mr Sipho Phiri and Mr Sipho Phiri is Mr Brian Van Wyk’s partner.  And because we could confirm again with his ID number – with Mr Van Wyk’s ID number that yes the Lavel Estavel was his company his ID number is 8208…      Okay alright    Alright thank you.  Should I continue?    They have never rendered any service Chair.    Because I was – Koreneke was there rendering services.    Until 2017 if I am not mistaken.      Correct Chair I do recognise this here.   Mr David Kalisilira.    Correct Chair – I think I can say correct, yes.    I am not sure of this one.   Come again?    Yes I was aware of.    The other company was Mint Books.    Yes Chair during the investigation we realised that this one too is his company.    I was not aware the first time I realised.    Correct Chair.

That is at the end of 2016 I am trying to follow it in the chronology.  The next event that appearsfrom your affidavit is a purported termination of your agreements with SA – your agreement with SA Express which occurred in March 2017.  Can you tell us about that?    Where are we?    Hm.    The letter is from SA Express to the director Koreneke Trading and Projects.    CEO Mr Inathi Ntshanga.

This letter serves as confirmation of termination forstandard ground handling services at Pilanesberg International Airport.  The agreement shall terminate on the 31 March 2017.  Please liaise with the newly appointed airport management company.  Yours faithfully.”    Correct Chair.    On that legal proceedings we went tocourt and then we were – been granted – the draft order says – which one should I read?   “The cancellation by the respondent on the 1 March of the ground handling entered into between the applicant and the respondent on 15 March 2015”    I mean “15 April 2015 be declared unlawful is hereby set aside.  It is hereby declared that the ground handling agreement entered into…”   Okay.    Correct Chair.

This time it is not about 400 000.    This time it is a – a donation to ANC.    Correct Chair.    Chair because these were the thingsthat he was saying - he said before that they should be done and then I said – you know – let me just pay this amount of money so that I can be out of Mr van Wyk’s back.

They were just so - looking strange.  They were driving a big Mercedes Benz. They parked there and then they – they parked there in front of the office opposite and then they came straight into the office and they said – they – they asked the lady who I am working with that they are here.  They want to see me and their car it is a GP registration and I wanted to resist but I said God be with me. Let me just go and hear what these people want and these gentlemen they said to me that they came here to come and intervene into my misunderstanding with Brian van Wyk – misunderstanding.  Yesthere is a misunderstanding because now Brian van Wyk is a – is expecting money from Koreneka and I am not giving him the money and he is under threat because he promised to pay people money and this – these very same men they said that there is a – their portion as well is in that package. I told them that you know what I do not know you.  I do not understand what you are talking about.  Yes Brian van Wyk I know him.  He is a GM of Commercial in SA Express.  I have got no dealings with Mr van Wyk.  So I do not understand what you gentlemen are talking about.  I think if you can just go back to Mr van Wyk and find out whatis he talking about. I do not know.  I have never entered into any business with Mr van Wyk and they – they changed their face.  They started fixing themselves to sit properly.    It was threatening Chair because the other one was putting on a jacket …    And I am in the office and they come from the car.  They are only holding their – their phones and then that other one is fixing a jacket.  Maybe there is a gun there.   That is what I was thinking and he was busy fixing this thing.  This is (intervenes).    This thing that looks like a – that thing.  He was busy fixing it.  I do not know whether they were threatening me that – you know – we are traditional (intervenes).    We will deal with you or I do not know.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    I do not know the animal …    But it looks like (intervenes).   Yes Chair because you know now that our African cultures are so many different.    You do not know whether he is a – he is a traditional healer or this is just a dressing or what or maybe that was a code …   To come and threaten me.    You know.    Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I could not even go home and – because they were saying that no – no we are going to come next time and then maybe we will visit you at your house.    Where my dear?  Yes that is where Imentioned Sipho.    Chair on the next occasion right?    Okay.    Yes Chair because he – he even tookout his ID so that I should confirm his ID.

The other one – the other one I attended a funeral in Mafikeng and one gentleman who – he is a husband to my previous bookkeeper – he – he came to me and said what are you doing here in the funeral.  I said what do you mean.  I am attending a funeral.  He says do you not know that – do you not know that Supra needs your head. He wants to kill you.  Why – why does he kill me?  No theysay you ran away with the airport money and then the other one …    Yes Chair.    The third example was – the third one was in – on my phone.  I would receive a series of calls telling me that ja we are seeing you.  You are driving this car.  We come following you. You are dressed like this and you are about to enter your – your house.  Then tomorrow – we are here at your daughter’s school and she is dressed like this.

And these people they need their money so now they said I should come and kill you.  Now for me not to kill you what are you going to give me in return.      I said why should I have to give you money, he said no you need to put up a price and then I said okay fine price, then give me the price, how much do you want and then he was saying that he wants between one million and one point five million, and then I said to him okay you can go ahead with your killing, I am not part of that, that’s your game.  And he was calling me, he was telling me that he is going to go to my daughter’s school, I said go ahead, be killing is there anybody that if he wants to kill you are telling them that I want to kill you, kill if you kill, that’s what I told him.    Yes Chair, the recordings I gave them to, I reported the matter to the Mafeking Police Station Chair and to Brigadier Kleinhans, he referred the matter to, he was there, he called his subordinates to come and take this matter, up to today Chair I have not hear anything.

He is Kolonel – oh my goodness, I don’t remember his name.    Yes Chair because BrigadierKleinhans called him to enter the office and to take a statement from me.    Yes Chair and even in the very same police station in Mafeking Police Station when I was arrested one of the conditions was to report every week at the police station and I reported until August and now every week I have to register, that register, thosepages where I was doing my register Chair they disappeared from the file and the purpose was I should be arrested because if now you are registering and now the papers disappeared, fortunately I had a back up because every time when I go to register I would go with a diary book, when they sign this paper they sign even my diary book, this book was my way out, and even in town Chair I am being followed.  Chair I am not safe, even while I’m sitting here I am not safe.    Yes Chair in my custom when a father, when a man speaks we women will listen, you called me and I had to obey you and come.

The investigating officer for the current case that is at Mafeking.    Mr ...(intervention)     He said they went to take a statement from Ms Viljoen and then he said she is busy giving them different statements.    Ja, that is all that I recall.   No I don’t remember, I don’t remember.  I actually don’t know because he was giving me information every time after monthly  he will be giving me a report of what they have done.      He wrote a letter and – to resign.    No he did it on his own.   Yes – there was a litigation that he said he is still a member of Koreneka, something like that if I remember well, yes.    Mr Thabeng resigned from the company, he wrote a letter and the letter was admitted to the office, and later after a year now when we are in court I understand that now he says now he wants to be part of this proceedings of – proceedings in the court because now he was part of – he wants to be part of this whole thing so that he can get his portion of share.    We were in court I don’t remember whether it’s the first matter, how many cases have we had.    It’s Ms Phiri against me Chair.

TLATSANA:With the outcomes of that…(intervention). 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  If you go to that top line there’s a one as Ihave the evidence, that is a reference according to Ms Tlatsana to number one in the Province, the Premier.    And then above that is a five, is that correct Ms Tlatsana?    And what does the five signify?    Yes.    And Ms Tlatsana may I just clarify, as I have your evidence on the recording at this point he hasn’t said that either of the Ministers have received a payment yet has he?    So the R18million that was to be added as I understand your testimony was to be used to pay the Ministers, correct?    No apologies clarify for me.   Thank you Ms Tlatsana.    Yes.
