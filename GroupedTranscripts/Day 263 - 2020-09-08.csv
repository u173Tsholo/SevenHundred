CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Okay. ADV SELEKA    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh.  Well it looks fine – the – at least one.    So we will see if there is a problem.    Ja.    Yes.    Of – of this one.    Okay no that is fine.    Okay.    Yes you will have to raise your voice again.    Ja.    Or bring the microphone closer.    Yes.    Hm.  Yes please administer the oath or affirmation.  I am not sure whether Mr Tsotsi is not too far from his microphone.  The microphone that works is that one Mr Tsotsi.  I do not whether you are not too far from if you sit on that chair.      Thank you; you may be seated.      Yes you may proceed Mr Seleka.    Yes.  Are we going to follow the red or black today – Pagination?    Okay.  Okay that is fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Can you see the red – the numbers Mr Tsotsi and the black numbers on each page at the top left and right?    Yes when Mr Seleka refers to a page he will be referring to the red numbers so you can disregard the black numbers.  He will only – he will not call the zero before for example if you go to the beginning of your affidavit he will – we will not say page 001 he will just say page 1 and on and so on and so on.  Okay?    Thank you.    Welcome back you are coming to the commission for the second time.    Ja okay thank you.    Are you going to get him to just confirm his signature and confirm that it is his affidavit and letters?    Ask me to admit it and then mark it Exhibit whatever.    You ask me to admit it?  Mr Seleka.    Ja.    You ask me to admit and have it marked exhibit what?  Eskom U7 – U17?    Well you can change that file maybe to     17A.    Ja and then we can have – so let us say the smaller file which is a continuation of Eskom Bundle 017 or was it 7.  The smaller file will be Bundle Eskom – Eskom Bundle 07.8.    That is another way.  Okay.  So the bigger bundle will be Eskom Bundle 07.A and the smaller one will be Eskom Bundle 07.B.    And Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit appearing at page 6 – starting at page 6 of Eskom Bundle 07.A will be – is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U17.  Do you see – do you want us to say U17 or U17.1 on his affidavit or Point 1 will be the following ones?    Okay.   It will be marked as Exhibit U17.1    Okay.    Hm.    Well the – now 0 something is for the name of the bundle.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.      Ja.    Somebody should make the necessary markings on Mr Tsotsi’s bundles so that he has something that is similar to what we have.    I am sorry Mr Seleka. Can I go back to when you were …    Appointed for your first term.  I see that you say in your affidavit that you were approached by Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu who was then the advisor to the Minister.  That is Minister Gigaba, is that right?    And he enquired if you would be interested in serving on the Board of Eskom.  You responded in the affirmative and ultimately you were appointed, you provided your CV?    So the second term Mr Seleka will deal with it but I see that for the second term you applied    Is that right?    Did you ever try to find out how it came about that they showed interest in you out of the blue?    Find out.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Well it just occurred to me that later on you know that you were told by somebody that they put you in this position they could take you out. So I wondered whether that is connected with how you were approached.  Is that something you have reflected on and you think along the same lines or not?    First appointment.    Yes oh.    Yes.  Yes okay no that is fine.      Thank you.  Continue Mr Seleka.    That is January 2015?    Yes ja.    Hm.    That will be 25 February?    On the 26 t h?    Why not?    Sorry? MR    But was that not all the more reason why you should have asked him?    But the Minister was not available and he did not phone you – or she did not phone you.  The President called you.  Was that not on its own strange that you have a plan for a Board Meeting?  The President is not part of the Board.  The Board is coming – is going to have a meeting to discuss – to discuss its own business.  Why should you get a call from the President saying the meeting of the Board should not take place?  This is not a meeting of the Cabinet.  This is a meeting of the Board.    Yes but sitting there today do you see – do you concede that you should have asked the President, Mr President this is a meeting of the Board that has been planned why must it be postponed?     Yes.    But of course, even if the Minister call – were to have called you after the President had called after you had spoken to the President it would have – you would have known that the real person who wants the meeting postponed was the President not the Minister.  Because from what you have told me the President had – was the one who was looking for the Minister in order to convey the message that the meeting of the Board should be postponed.  So the person who knew the reasons would be the President.  That is the person you should have asked.    Sorry.    Yes.    Yes but here is somebody who is not part of your Board.  You are the Chairperson and you do not deal with this person.  You deal with the Minister.  He is calling you.  He is not scheduled to be part of this meeting.  So it does not have to suit his calendar or his availability.  He is calling you and saying the board meeting must not take place.  But it is not his business.  It is the board’s business that will be discussed.  So was it not strange in itself?     You would not have?     If you did not get a call from the acting DG?     Yes.  But ...[intervenes]      Yes.     The acting DG phoned you.     And did she say the minister wanted you to postpone the meeting or did she say the president wanted you to postpone the meeting?     Yes.  And you asked her for the reasons?     And she did not give you any?     Yes.     Yes.  Did you not consider necessarily to     H’m.  Was the minister scheduled to depart of this meeting of the 26t h of February?     I take it, she would not normally attend meetings of the board because she is not a member of the board?     So she would attend by implication?     Yes.  And on this occasion, the board had not invited her to be part of that meeting?     So she actually did not have the power, did she, to instruct you to postpone your meeting of the meeting?     What is your understanding?  Did you understand that she had the power?     But how she could she have the power to postpone a meeting of a board that she is not going to be attending?  And if she is going to be attending, could she have anything other than a right to request, not a right to instruct the chairperson for a postponement. If she is meant to attend and it is an important issue that she must discuss with the board but she has other commitments, then she makes a request for a postponement.  But ultimately, the power to say yes or no, would lie with the chairperson of the board.     H’m.  But she is certainly not part of the board, is that right?     Yes, yes.  So simple on the principle that she is not part of the board, I do not think she can power to instruct that the board should not sit because the board, as I understand it, is a body on its own.     No, no, no.  I understand.  You know, you     And somebody outside might be able to say at some stage I request that you discuss this issue.  And then the body can decide this is when it is going to be necessary for us to discuss that issue.  We will discuss that on that day.  But the idea that somebody from outside can instruct, just seems odd to me.       You understand?     Ja.  Yes.  No, thank you.  Mr Seleka, you may proceed.     I am sorry.  For the sake of completeness, let me make this point Mr Tsotsi.  The only reason I can think why somebody who is not a member of the board would have wanted the board to postpone its meeting when he or she is not part of the board and was not going to attend that meeting, is that she or she might not be wanting the board to discuss certain matters on that day.   It is not convenient for whatever reasons for him or her to have the board take decisions on certain issues on that day.  That is the only thing I can think of.   Otherwise, if the board is going to discuss matters in which that person has no interest, why would they be wanting the board to postpone its meeting because they have no interest in the issues that would be discussed?   But if they have certain interest in some of the issues, then I can understand.  But it does not make it proper necessarily but I can understand that.   Or they do not want the board to make a decision at this stage on this issue and that issue.  That is why they want the board to postponed.   Or if there is something that they are working on for the board from outside - again, you might not be able to comment.   I am just giving you the benefit of what is going on in my mind as I hear this evidence about people outside of the board asking or instructing.   Because it looks like they were not asking that the meeting be postponed of the board and not caring to even give reasons.       Okay, Mr Seleka.     In your first term at the Board of Eskom, had Minister Gigaba ever requested or instructed that a board meeting be postponed or cancelled?     He had never done that?     Had the former President, Mr Zuma, called you or reaching to you to ask or to instruct that a board meeting be postponed or cancelled during your first term?     It did not happen?     So this was a new thing...[intervenes]      ...when you got this call from the former president and when you got a call from the acting DG, saying the minister effectively wanted the meeting postponed or cancelled?     Yes, okay.     Do you recall what was to be discussed at this meeting of the 26t h of February or at least some of the matters?     The what?     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     Out of the issues that were going to be discussed at that meeting, are there any issues that you though the president and the minister may have a particular interest in?     Yes.     As far as you are concerned, the board could have met and discussed those issues and made whatever decisions they wanted to make?     Ja.  That you could not see no reason why the minister or the president would not want the board to have its own meeting and discuss those issues?     Ja.  Mr Seleka.     When you say FD, do you mean Financial Director?     Yes.     Ja.  If someone reads out the transcript, they might not know what you are talking about.     Ja.     [laughs]     That is the affidavit of Ms Tsholofele Molefe, is that right?     Okay.     Did you say we must go to page 117?     Yes.     Please raise your voice a little bit Mr Tsotsi.     You say, you told her that the president sounded like he was under pressure?     Pressurising you?     Okay alright.     Yes.     Ja.  Okay.     Yes, okay.     That is from the acting DG?     Ja.  So when the acting DG spoke to you and told you that the minister had not given reasons for the request, if it was a request, for the meeting to be postponed.  Did you say to her whether you would have the meeting postponed or you would talk to the members of the board?  It would depend what their attitude is.  Or what did you say to her?     Okay, yes.  Okay.  H’m.     Sorry, you think it is in?     Yes, that the minister can request that meetings be postponed?     Yes, okay.  Could you recall whether it is put as a request that she has power to request or whether she can effectively instruct the meeting be postponed?  Or is it something you might not recall?     Ja.  It would be interesting to know what the provision is.  Maybe a junior could look for that in the meantime.  Or if you have got it, you can take it from there.     Remember to raise your voice Mr Seleka.     953?     Yes.  Oh, I have gone much beyond that, Mr Seleka.     I say I have gone much beyond that.     Ja, I am right in the document inside looking for anything about calling of meetings and postponements, so I have long found it.     I have long found it.     Ja, so I am busy trying to see were we…     Ja.     Well, directors is 13 at page 980.     Ja.  I am already at 982, Chairperson of the board.   And then page 985 deals with proceedings at meetings.     I was trying to look for a provision that talks about the calling of meetings and postponements but they might not be specific provisions for postponements that would be incidental to the calling of a meeting.       Well, I can say that clause 18.9.1 at page 985 seems to give the power to adjourn meetings to     It is not on that basis but on the basis that the meeting will discuss the same business on another date, you know, then it means the same as adjourn, you know?  So but here in clause 13.9.1, the memorandum of incorporation is clear that it gives the directors the power to meet or the right to meet and dispatch business of their business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings.  Regulate their meetings would certainly include a cancel, adjourn or whatever.     So unless you are able to point to something else, it seems to me that the power – that the Minister had no power to instruct that a meeting of the board be cancelled or postponed, nor did the President have that power.     Yes, you are not in a position to say you definitely had seen a provision that gave the Minister that power but you thought there was a provision along those lines but you might now be realising that no, it is not there.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I think …[intervenes]     Yes.     I think what you should do in due course is check any other instruments that you think might have something.     But I would have thought that the Memorandum of Incorporation would be the right instrument to have such a provision.     And that seems to suggest to me that the board would need to jealously guard against the usurpation of any of its control or powers by anybody.  It has got to realise that we are in control of this entity, we have to make decisions that have to be made provided we act lawfully and exercising our best judgment for what is in the interest of the company.  We should be left alone to run the company, the affairs of the company.     You would feel – you would have the same sentiments of what it means for the board to be in control.     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Yes – ja, look this side, I cannot hear you.  Ja.  Yes.     Ja.  But, Mr Tsotsi, it appears to me that your evidence is in effect that you agreed to postpone the meeting without knowing what the reasons were, is that right?     Why did you agree to postpone the meeting when you were not given reasons why it should be postponed?     Yes.     Yes.  Did you the approach other members of the board and relay to them – now I must just understand, did you understand this to be a request from the Minister or did you understand it as an instruction?     Request.  Ja, okay, alright.     Which the board could say yes or no to, I take it, if it was a request.     Yes. And so you approached members of the board and said I have received a call from the Acting DG who says the Minister requested we postpone this meeting, I have asked the reasons, the Acting DG said the Minister did not provide reasons but I suggest that we postpone the meeting.  Is that the sum total what you said to the members of the board?     Yes, okay.  And what was their response?     Or the response of the majority.     Yes, yes.  Were there dissenting voices?  Were there those who were not in favour or you cannot remember?     You cannot remember.     Yes, yes.  But the message you got ultimately was that the majority were agreeable?     Postponed at the last minute.     Yes, yes.  Yes, continue, Mr Seleka?     I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  Terribly sorry to interrupt you, maybe I did miss this, if you dealt with it.  Mr Tsotsi, Ms Molefe, if she is talking about the meeting of the 26 t h here – and you must tell me, maybe she is talking about another meeting.  She seems to be talking about her being opposed to the postponement of the meeting and canvassing the views of other board members, the board members going along with her recommendation and the board members seeking to approve the financials.  Is that another meeting, it is not the 26 t h?  Mr Seleka, you might be able to tell me.     So that is another meeting, not the 26 t h?     26 t h, that one, the majority at least agreed that it be postponed.     It was postponed and then at the next meeting some members of the board expressed concern.     About the fact that it was postponed at the last minute.     Okay, alright.  Thank you.     I interrupted you while you were dealing with something else.     Ja.     That may be right, she may be talking about the board that – the first board that you chaired.     Maybe talk about that board and it was then replaced – she made the meaning it was replaced, that first board, in June 2014 – or that must be wrong because the next board was appointed in December, is that right?     So she might have got the month wrong.     Ja, ja.     How as the date of the 9 t h selected?     The cancelled meeting was supposed to have been on the 26 February.     That one got cancelled.     So was that date of the 11 t h fixed by yourself as Chairperson or fixed that date?     On the 26 t h.     Yes.  Was the Minister asked whether it would be fine with her if the meeting that was to have sat on the 26 February sat on the 11 March?     Was not asked?     Yes, okay.  So it was just your decision the next meeting will sit on the 11 t h?     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Well, I guess let us go back.  You tell me about that meeting at – or your visit to Mr Zuma’s residence so that we can follow the sequence properly.     Is that fine, Mr Seleka?     Yes, maybe let us go back to his affidavit.     Is that fine?  Let us see.  Well, in paragraph – page 3 of your affidavit, paragraph 5, you deal with the relationship with the Ministers.  You do say that you seem to have had a good relationship with Minister Gigaba, is that right?     Yes and you had scheduled meetings with him, regular meetings.     Yes and then I seem to remember that you say somewhere that you struggled to have a same arrangement with Minister Brown to have regular meetings, to schedule meetings, is that right?     Yes, you tried but you did not succeed to have that arrangement with her.     Yes and then you talk about your relationship with the Guptas in paragraph 6 of your affidavit.  If it is fine with Mr Seleka can you tell me about that relationship?     Ja, with the Guptas.  Or does that precede the meeting or is after the meeting at Mr Zuma’s residence that I want you to tell me about.     Mr Seleka, if you want to intervene you please feel free.  Ja, okay, alright.     Yes.     You want to quickly deal with that?     Ja, just do that.     Yes.     To the meeting?     Yes.     Okay, let us just get that clear.  This was the ANC January 8 Rally.     It was a dinner?     Which preceded the January 8 rally.     Okay, already.  So the top six of the ANC were sitting at the main table, I guess.     And you were invited to go and sit with them.     And you say there were two Gupta brothers who were also sitting at the main table with the top six.     Do you remember which ones those are, those two Gupta brothers, or do you not remember?     Atul, ja.  Now apart from the top six, yourself and the two Gupta brothers, who else was sitting at the main table if you are able to remember?     So the main table consisted of the top six of the ANC, then two Gupta brothers and then yourself?     And the Chairperson of the SABC?     Who was the Chairperson of the SABC at the time?     Ms Tshabalala?     But do you know whether the SABC was also sponsoring the event or do you not know?     Yes, yes.  Now – okay, so you took your seat in the main table and what happened, continue?     Yes.     Now I want to divert it but maybe you can answer this after the tea break. I know that it happens regularly, frequently, that state owned entities sponsor events of the ANC.  I want to know why it is proper for a state-owned entity to sponsor a political party’s event.   So now that you have said that Eskom was sponsoring or was one of the sponsors of that dinner, I want to know why it is proper that that should happen.  But we will take the break.  You can tell me when you come back.  Let us take the tea break, it is quarter past, we will resume at half past eleven.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let us continue.  Yes, Mr Tsotsi, what is the answer?     Yes.     You say this particular dinner of January I guess it must have been January 7, I do not know.       2014, you say Eskom got onto the – got to participate through you in the dinner because of TNA or it got to participate in its own right without TNA the new age and you have referred to the breakfast and that in the breakfast were connected with the new age.       But this was an ANC dinner that is one thing sure, is it not?         Yes, as I understand it other TNA or TNA breakfast because that is my understanding and I maybe wrong but I never understood that those TNA arrangements that Eskom had, SABC had with TNA they were dinners.  I understood them to have been breakfast.             I maybe wrong but I do not remember hearing about dinners I just heard about breakfast.  Now you understood that in terms of the agreement between the new agent Eskom this was one of the forums, this was one of the functions which you needed to attend as Eskom.       Yes, but do you know for sure whether that was actually so because as I say I understood all the others to have been breakfast I may be wrong as opposed to dinners this was a dinner and the other ones if I recall correctly it is those about with which I have had evidence here have never been ANC functions.  They were basically Gupta functions but business functions.          Yes, well I can simply say from my own general knowledge I seem to have an understanding that it is usual for the ANC to have a dinner the evening before the January 8 statement…[intervene]        Or January 8 rally.  So if you say it was a dinner that seems to resonate with what I have been observing in the media over the years about the ANC.         So it is likely to have been a dinner.       Yes.     Well it would be ANC members and supporters mainly, yes.        But there would have been during your term I take it there would have been other ANC functions that Eskom may have sponsored which might not necessarily have been connected with the TNA, is it not?  Like what is called buying tables or that functions or dinners or whatever.             You cannot remember that is the only one that you can remember.      But even that I can understand private companies because some of them maybe wanting to have access to the executive to Ministers and so on and so on for good or bad reasons for their business.  But I cannot understand why Eskom would do that because they are a State-owned entity.             There is a Minister that represents you know government that they liaise with and there is nothing they want from government other than a lawful contributions if any for funding and so on and so on.  So when it comes to a private company I can understand somebody saying you know I am going to buy table at that dinner because I want to meet the DG’s, I want to meet the Ministers you know for whatever purpose.  You have as Eskom access to the Minister you know all the time to a Minister who represents the government you are a State owned entity.  So why do you want to spend money in order to be at that dinner?                 Ja.      But my difficulty for present purposes it is just doing it in a manner that quite clearly supports a political party.  Did you ever do any such things in DA meetings, in UDM meetings, in Inkatha meetings, in Freedom Front meetings.  Did you ever do any such - did Eskom ever do that?     It may be that there is justification that I just do not know because it seems to be something that happens and nobody seems to make issue of not just Eskom I think other State owned entities where they seem to spend money on political parties’ functions like the ANC but I do not think they do the same with any other political party.      Yes.       Well of course if you bought tables you know I am using bought in the way that they are used, that term is used.  If you bought tables you made the function possible without the ANC spending its own money as I see it, I may be wrong.        Was the function not on the basis of buying so called buying a table?  I mean from what one reads sometimes these tables are bought for very large sums of money which always gives me the impression that the food that you are going to eat and everything that you are going to eat is going to be much less than the money you pay.  So the balance of the money goes to the ANC.        Because as I recall I am sorry I am interrupting you, as I recall even the ANC leaders or some of them at least in the past when they give out these invitations or talk about them you as a company and I am talking now private sector your benefit that you derive for paying such a large amount of money when it is that you are buying a table is that you are going to network with the Ministers with people high ranking officials of a political party who happen to be also in government who are Ministers.             That to me that always sounds not right.  Why should people buy, spend money if they want to talk to a Minister about something why should they not ask for a meeting to meet with the Minister and talk about it without paying money.  This is not a Minister acting as Minister this is now a Minister acting as a leader in a political party.               But why can you not reach your customers in another way without a political party.       Yes.       Ja.      Ja, Mr Seleka this was just a detour.       Oh then I am terribly sorry well it just shows we did not exchange notes; we are not exchanging notes.       The point being you as Eskom were helping the ANC raise funds.       What is not correct?     Ja, what is the correct interpretation?      Mr Tsotsi that cannot be, it cannot be, what you are saying cannot be true.  You have to accept that such events are fundraising events for the ANC.  Are you not going to accept that proposition?        Yes, so now the ANC is not going to allow you to come and sit at the main table with the top six as part of Eskom if you are not going to be helping them to raise funds.  Why should they do that?       Yes.          Well I do not know about that Mr Tsotsi.  It is a fundraising function of the ANC.  It is publically known to be such, you are brought in to sit at the table, at the main table with the top six of the ANC.  There are only what four people who are not in the top six of the ANC you are one of them.             It just seems improbable that the ANC is going to allow you to sit there if you are not adding to the purpose of the function which is raise funds and probably if they allow you to sit there it is because you have made a serious contribution to the purpose of the function.             Others who may have made some smaller contributions are sitting right there at the back you are right at the top.  You must have as Eskom contributed significantly to the purpose of the function.  What do you say to that?        Yes.      Yes, okay.      Yes, yes.        Well I have a suspicion that if the Gupta’s used their own money they would not be wanting to let you benefit from their own contribution.  They would want you to make your own contribution and they would be happy that they were at the main table themselves only because the money that they got was their money out of the TNA is it not.            It was not I say it – once you have paid what you paid it was their money it was not Eskom’s money anymore.  Ja, okay Mr Seleka if I have encroached on what you were going to do, I am terribly sorry it is just that some of these issues are quite important.        Ja, that could be January 2014.      No he said those two were Mr Ajay Gupta and Mr Atul Gupta they are the two other brothers.      Tony Gupta is another one.  So it seems that what he means is on the occasion of that dinner he met the two namely Atul Gupta and Ajay Gupta but subsequently the person that he had interactions with was Tony Gupta.        Let us take the first occasion then go to the second and then go to the third.      Did he call you or you met or?       Yes did he call you to set up the meeting?       And what was the venue of the meeting?     Oh at their place.      Yes, okay and you say that would have been around mid-year 2014?     Yes, okay so he asked you to come and see him for a meeting and you came and so he talked about this issue?     Yes.      Yes.      Well before you found out just tell about the discussion you are at the meeting now.        He puts this request tell me the discussion how the discussions, how the meeting – how you responded and how the meeting ended?    When you had to go back to him was that by way of a telephone call or was there nothing...    Yes.    Yes.    Yes was there any special reason why when he wanted to meet with you you agreed to go to his house or home as opposed to him coming to you?  He wanted a meeting with you.  Why does he not come to you?    Hm.    Yes.  Well it is just – just strange that from the evidence I heard over the past two years in terms of people who met with them that mostly they got people to come to – to them rather than them going to people.  General Nyanda gave evidence here and said that when they sent messages wanting a meeting with him, he insisted that they should do like everybody come to his office.  They must go through the normal processes and come and have a meeting in the department – and no meeting ever happened.  It seems they – that they did not want to do that and he said well he was dropped from Cabinet.  That it looks like everybody just went to them whenever they wanted a meeting and nobody said well you want to have a meeting with me you come to my office.  So that is why I am asking you whether there was any reason why you went to him rather than him coming to you?    Hm.  You cannot remember any particular discussion around – around the issue of where you – the two of you should meet?    Yes.      Yes.  Well Mr Themba Maseko gave evidence to the effect that he had a meeting with Mr Ajay Gupta in the second half of 2010 and effectively Mr Ajay Gupta was saying something along the lines, we called the Ministers.  We – if they do not cooperate then we tell the – we report them to the President and he deals with them.  So – so I am wondering whether this whole idea that whenever they need to meet with people they do not go to those people’s places. They – the other people must come to them – they must come to their home.  You know.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Seleka.    Yes.  Around about when was this?  Was this still 2014?    Yes.  So there was a vacancy for the position of Chief Procurement Officer at Eskom?    So he thought yes.      Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Was he talking to you in a meeting or over a phone?    Okay was that the second meeting?    Okay alright.  And if you estimate around about which month in 2014 would that second meeting have taken place?    Sometime during the second half of the year?    Ja okay alright.  Even if you cannot remember the date that is fine.    So he – this time how did that meeting take – come about?  Did he call you and arrange another meeting for you to come and see him?    Yes.  Okay.  Then you went there.    And the meeting took place at Saxonwold?    And he said there is this position I would like you to facilitate the appointment of this person to that position?    Yes.  Are you able to tell the person’s name that he wanted to be appointed to that position?    That person was working for MTN?    Yes okay.  What was your response to this request?    Oh so you – what was his reaction to what you said namely I would have to find out but whether you can be assisted but ordinarily there would have to have been an advert that went out and your candidate would have to apply like everybody.  What was his reaction to that?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm. So the meeting ended on the basis that you would find out about this position he was talking about and revert to him?    Yes and then you went to find out?    But was it vacant?    It was vacant?    Oh okay but it had not been advertised.    Yes okay.      Hm.    Oh is that so?    Yes.      Yes.  But you have no party – you have no – do not remember the particulars of his name and what position he ultimately occupied at Eskom? MR      Oh he – from what you heard he ultimately got that position?    Yes.  Well it would be interesting to establish as a matter of certainty whether it is the same person that you had been told about by Mr Gupta.    And that is one and two whether he actually it is true he got this position that Mr Gupta wanted him for.  So I think if the legal team does not have that information please something must be done to just establish for sure what the position is and I assume that you might not remember the name but if you are told that it looks like that position was occupied – was filled by so and so you might recall whether that was the name that you have been told.  And whether that person came from MTN that would link up with your thinking.    Is that right?    Okay.  Mr Seleka.    He was to tell us about the third meeting with Mr Tony Gupta.  He has told us – you have told us about two meetings.    Is that right?    Yes.  Tell us about the third one.    Ja Mr Matjila preceded Mr Matona I think.    At the Sahara offices?    So each time you met you were the one to go to him?    Hm Okay.    Upset.    Yes okay.    You may continue Mr Seleka.    You are going against the wishes of?    The President okay.    Yes if you – if you do anything that displeases them you would feel that you are displeasing the President?    Yes.    What was the fear of what could happen to you if you displeased them and therefore displeased the President?  Why did you have to fear anything about displeasing them if you said, you want a meeting come and see me in my office?  And that is the one point.  The second point is, maybe after the first meeting you say well, I met you at your venue the first time now you come to me.  Let us have a meeting in my office.  What could have – what fear could you have had of what would happen to you if you said that and he did not like that?    Ja.    Okay.       This was at her house, at her office?     Ja.  In Cape Town?     Ja.     This is January 2015?     The new board at that stage had had its induction or you cannot remember?     But it did not have its first meeting?     And would it be correct to say therefore that as at the time that the minister she had received complaints from board members that there would not have been any grounds for the board members to have any complaints against you because you have not started working with them?     Yes, yes.     Ja.  In terms of the management of the – of Eskom.  Would the CEO ordinarily communicate with the minister or would he communicate with you and you would then communicate with the minister?     H’m.     So it would ordinarily be out of order for the CEO to communicate directly with the minister on Eskom matters as opposed to communicating through you or is that not correct?     Ja, there would have to be some exceptional situation ...[intervenes]      ...for the CEO to communicate directly. MR     Yes, yes.     Of course, if the CEO wanted to complain about you to the minister, one would understand not going through you.  Is that right?     Yes.  But at that stage the Eskom had a new CEO that was Mr Matona who had started on the 1s t of October.     And if the position is that Mr Matona had not conveyed to the minister any complaints about you, then if the minister got complaints from anybody else from management, that would be even strange because ordinarily anybody below the CEO, I imagine, has no business communicating directly with the minister?     The CEO has got to go through but we understand that if he has complaints about you that he was going to convey to the minister, that he might not go through you in that case.     Yes.     So you left that meeting to go and see the minister?     Yes and left him in the meeting, Mr Matona?     H’m.     Yes.     Ja.     He had never complaint to the minister?     Ja.  Yes.  Okay.     Yes.  So you have the minister telling you that you might lose your job ...[intervenes]      ..if you do not stop what she was saying you must stop.     Then a few hours later, you have Mr Tony Gupta saying they put you into this position, they can take you out.     And that is what you say you found very strange?     Ja.     H’m.     Now just to go back. Did you have any idea of what it is she might have talking about that she referred to as interfering in management?  I guess, the meant in the management of the company operational matters. Is that something that you had been dealing with the management that you could link this to?     Do that.  Just piece it together.     Just switch on your mic.  Your mic is off, ja.     Ja?     A company called?     Yes, Sumitomo.  Ja.     That would have been around the second half of 2014 ...[intervenes]      2014?     Yes.     Reconstruction of?     Oh, transformers.  Yes.     Yes.     Sumitomo wanted to get a job in – relating to the transformation – construction of transformers?     It was Mr Matjila at that time, the CEO.     Or was it Mr Matona already?     Yes.  Whoever was the CEO or acting CEO at the time.     This was now – this would have been your response to ...[intervenes]      Ja, Sumitomo.  Ja.     And in effect, the gist of your response was what in the letter?     Yes.     Who was the CEO?   She did not give you particular ...[intervenes]    ...as to which interference, what interference she was talking about?      H’m.     Yes.  And there was no other transaction or matter in which you had interacted with the management where you could think the minister – which the minister you thought was talking about, in saying you had been interfering with management.  This was the only one you could think of?     Yes.     Okay.  Alright.     Yes.  Of course, there is something a little strange with what the minister said to you, namely, she was objecting to you interfering in management.      There is something strange about the fact that both she and Mr Tony Gupta were effectively threatening you with dismissal if you did not do what they wanted you to do. And what is strange is that on the one hand, Tony Gupta effectively wanted you to interfere in management and operations.     So the threat is the same but the reason for the threat seemed to be different.  That is on the face of it.  Unless saying you must not interfere with management did not mean what one would think it means.       You understand what I am saying?     Ja, you appreciate it?     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka.     I see we are two minutes to one but you might want to ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Is that 445?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.      Yes, on that is fine, we will have to take the lunch adjournment, we will resume at five past two.     We adjourn. REGISTRAR   All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     Paragraph 102, you say?     Ja?     Yes.     So she may have got confused?     Ja, okay.     Yes, no, that is fine.     Ja, okay.     And that was after the President himself had called you?     And said he had been looking for the Minister and the Deputy Minister.     And could not find them that is why he was phoning you directly.     And he said that it was about – well effectively he talked about the meeting being postponed or cancelled.     So both what the President said to you and what Ms Koko – not Ms Koko – the Acting DG said to you, seemed to connect?     And the Acting DG said it was the Minister who sent her to call you.     Yes.     Unless, of course, the President ended up speaking to the Acting DG after speaking to you and then – but the strange thing is that the Acting DG did not say it is the President who asked her.  She said it is the Minister.     Ja.     Do you recall when in relation to the 26 February you would have sent that memo to the Minister?  Would that have been soon after the 26 February of would that have been just before the meeting of the – just before the 11 March or would it have been after the 11 March?     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Ja, do so.     Okay, ja, if he says…[intervenes]     I am sorry, I am sorry, if there is something you would like him to deal with before he does so, you can ask him to do it.     Ja.     Okay, tell us how it came about now.     Oh yes, ja.  Yes.     Yes.  When you received Ms Dudu Myeni’s call, Mr Tsotsi, at that stage on the 7 t h, there was no meeting of the board scheduled for the 9 t h, is that right?     Okay, alright.  Yes.     What time was the meeting schedule for on the 8 t h?     Yes.     Talent, ja, something.     When you arrived were they there – or everybody that you have mentioned was already there?  Mr Linnell and Dudu Myeni?     Ja, it does not matter, I just wanted to…     Ja, anyway …[intervenes]     Yes, okay, alright.     So you met and the meeting started?     And this was now after the meeting?  The meeting had started now or was she just still briefing all of you ahead of the official start of the meeting?     Had not started.     Yes, okay, okay.     Well just go back to when the President entered the meeting or came to the meeting, now I don’t know whether it’s what I read in your affidavit or whether it’s what I read in Mr Linnell’s affidavit, but one of you seems to say, after he came into the room where the meeting was held that he said something to – along the lines of, what are we meeting about or something like that and then it was Mr Dumiyeni who explained – who then explained, is that your recollection or…[intervenes].     Because that gives the impression of somebody who didn’t know what the meeting was about and that’s strange if he had asked Ms Myeni to call you to the meeting, the meeting was being held in his residence, if he’s like he doesn’t know what the meeting’s about.     Yes, just say that in English as well.     I think I must have got it from your affidavit, ja.     But in this case, according to Ms Myeni’s call to you, he was the one who was inviting you to come and see him.     Yes.     Okay, alright, now for the rest of the discussions, apart from saying, what are we going to talk about today at the beginning and then that was explained by Mr Dumiyeni, apart from that, up to the end of the meeting what was his contribution to the discussion, as far as you are able to remember?    Who was Chairing this meeting, or was there no Chairperson, nobody was Chairing this meeting?      Yes.     Most of the time?     Yes.     Yes, would there be a basis, in your view, for somebody to say, it was like Ms Myeni, this idea of an inquiry was Ms Myeni’s idea in terms of the discussion of the people who were in the meeting or did it seem like it was from the President it was his idea because obviously Mr Dumiyeni knew before the meeting, before you came that the idea was that there should be an enquiry and the idea was that there should be Executives to be suspended.  So she, either had that idea in her own mind or she must have discussed the idea with somebody and maybe with the President because otherwise how would she call you and say the President wants you to come to a meeting to discuss these matters if she had not discussed them with the President?     Yes.     Ja and this idea that he didn’t know what the meeting was about is not reconcilable with what Mr Dumiyeni told you on the phone?     Prior to Ms Myeni giving you a call about this meeting, had you had any interactions with her in your capacity as Chairperson of the Eskom Board?     Yes.    Ja.      Yes, Mr Seleka?     So that’s about the meeting at the President’s residence.     And you said the meeting was concluded on the basis that the President asked you to test this proposal of an inquiry with your Board.     As well as the idea of the suspension of Executives.     Yes, so that’s – and then he said he would inform the Minister?     That’s how the meeting ended.     Okay, take it from there.     What was so urgent about these two proposals that this could not wait for the meeting of the 11 t h which had already been fixed?     Okay.     Okay you can go back sir.   That could have far-reaching consequences.     I want to just go back to the meeting of the 8 t h.  Did you, at any stage, query Ms Myeni’s involvement in Eskom affairs?    I mean based on what you have said in terms of – or the discussion at that meeting of the 8 t h it seems to me that if it could be said that the initiator of the idea for the inquiry and the suspension of the Executives was in that meeting, it seems that one would say it’s Ms Myeni but maybe she was not but because the President comes there and says [African language] what are we talking about and she is briefed by Ms Myeni, she’s the one who called you the previous day, she’s the one who briefs you when you arrive and she is the one who does most of the talking throughout the meeting from what you have told me.     Yes.     Yes.     Well it might be somebody outside the meeting, it might have been somebody who was not in that meeting.     That’s one possibility another is that the initiator was inside that meeting and that she was the initiator, another theory might be, it was the President.  Of course, it would just be strange that if he initiated the idea and he called the meeting that he should come to the meeting and say, what are we talking about, what is this meeting about.     So – ja, okay.     Ja, Mr Seleka.     Well, why would he ask a rhetorical question at the start of that meeting, why would he ask a rhetorical question?  He’s asking what is the meeting about or what are we going to be discussing, now that’s – anybody who asks that question at the beginning of the meeting wants to know what the agenda is or what the issues are.     Yes, that’s one thing, whether you believe him or not but certainly I would think that he wants those that hear his question to tell him what the meeting’s about because otherwise why is he asking, what are we going to be talking about here?       I mean, you can’t have a situation where a meeting takes place in your residence, obviously this meeting takes place with your blessing it involves people that don’t live in your residence, they come to your residence.  So before you gave the blessing, you must know what the meeting’s about, either you called the meeting or somebody made the request, they made the request to you and you approved and you would have wanted to find out, why do you want a meeting in my place, in my residence and you would have been told and you must have been satisfied that whatever needed to be discussed was something that, you know, justified having the meeting in your residence at the time it speaks for.     Well maybe you should have responded and said, but Mr President, Ms Myeni told me that you wanted to see me, so I expect that you know what you wanted to talk to me about.     Okay, Mr Seleka?     I’m sorry Mr Seleka and Mr Tsotsi, that I’m kind of taking you back to this meeting on the 8 t h, actually in your affidavit Mr Tsotsi, paragraph 12.10 – well 12.9 you say, Ms Myeni said – pointed to discussions that she said were going on in the war room on the company’s  poor performance and said that even the war room was very dissatisfied with the company’s performance, at that time you obviously knew what the war room was?     Did you know the people who were involved in the war room?    Yes, and other people, other than from the Executives.      Did you know whether Ms Myeni was one of the people who were part of the war room?     She was not?     But you see, she seems to – from what you say here, she seems to know what discussions were going on in the war room, that’s what you say, she said at the meeting, 12.9, she pointed to the discussion that are going on, on the company poor performance saying that even the War Room is very dissatisfied with its performance.     Am I right?    Ja am I right to say what you say here means that what you heard from her is that she is the one who concluded that there should be an external inquiry.    Let me assist you.      And again, it is what you have written here and you must tell me if I am misunderstanding what you say here.  You are relating here what Mr Myeni said at the meeting on the 8t h okay?    You say after the President had enquired what was up for discussion Ms Myeni began by saying that the performance of Eskom financially and technically was deteriorating to the extent that there was a serious concern that the company could fail to meet its obligations to supply    If what you say is correct that is how I interpret it.  Is that the same how you understood the    Yes.    Exponent ja of the idea.    Ja to her.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Of course, from the paragraphs that I have read and you might be dealing with that elsewhere you have not said about any – you have not said anything about anybody except what she is telling you.    At this meeting.  Okay no I just wanted to go back to that point because earlier on I talked about who the initiator was.    And then I picked this up.  Ja. Okay.    Which Jabu are they talking about do you know?    Oh okay.  Oh you know him?    And he was not in the meeting or you are not sure?    Well if you know him you would be sure?    Hm.    Hm.  Okay.      But you would remember that – that as well.    If you saw him at the President’s residence that day whether at the pre-meeting briefing or at the meeting you would remember that he…    That he – if it is somebody that you know quite well.    Hm.    Hm.      Well what you say the President said namely what was up for discussion is not indicative of somebody who knew what the meeting was about.  That of course might not mean that he did not know.  It just depends what explanation he would give for making a statement that suggested he did not know what the meeting was about if indeed he were to say no I knew what the meeting was about.  And still admit that he made the statement and maybe there would be an explanation.  But you – you say your belief was that he knew what the meeting was about.  Is that right?    Ja, ja.    But he made the statement or put this question which suggested that he did not know what the meeting was about which was strange.    Yes.  Well I see that Mr Linnell in the affidavit Mr Linnell actually indicates that Ms Myeni was at the Presidency in Pretoria on the 6 t h.  So – and that is where they met – well Mr Linnell it seems was invited by Ms Myeni to the President – to come to the Presidency on the 6t h and he travelled to Pretoria.  And he was called by Ms Myeni and they had a prior working relationship at SAA.  She says – he    And is the Chairperson of the SAA Board who is busy coordinating a meeting to discuss Eskom issues with various people and the President.  He calls Mr Linnell on the 7t h he calls you and on the 8 t h you all meet in Durban at the President’s residence.  And at the meeting she is one doing the talking most of the time.    And yet you are the Chairperson of the Eskom Board but she seems to be you know discussing these and making all arrangements, exchanging views with the President about what should happen at Eskom.      Ja.  Mr Seleka.    Hm.    Were there some – would the Minister of Public Enterprises have been part of the War Room?    Yes.    Yes. But the Minister as at the 7t h March when you got this call from Ms Dudu Myeni had never spoken to you about any inquiry at Eskom or had she?    She had never spoken to you about any inquiry at Eskom?    Ja.      I am sorry.  You said there was Mr Talent and Myeni at the meeting of the 8t h.  Did he make any contribution to the meeting?  Do you know why his presence was necessary at that meeting?    He did not make any contribution?    Okay.    Do you recall that – do you recall whether when you met him at the President’s residence in Durban on the 8t h you were meeting somebody with whom you had discussions before or not?  Or you were meeting somebody that you really did not know?    Yes.  Okay.    Yes.  Okay.  Well I see that he also says that Mr Talent Myeni did not play any active role in    Yes Mr Seleka.    Please raise your voice Mr Seleka.    And I see that it does appear that what Mr Linnell says about the role played by the President at the meeting seems to be consistent with your version.  On your version there is not much that he said at the meeting.  He listened most of the time but he did ask you whether you knew the executives who were to be suspended.  And at the end of the meeting he asked you to test this proposal of an inquiry with your Board and you would talk to the Minister.    So – and Mr Linnell says in paragraph 7 the statement. “The President listened to these views and asked one or two questions then he agreed.”    Okay.      How long – I am sorry.  How long did you – do you think that meeting lasted at the President’s residence in Durban?    About forty minutes?    Oh okay.      Yes.  And most of the time was taken by Ms Myeni doing the talking.    Okay.    It must have been strange to be in that meeting as Chairperson of the Eskom Board.  You sitting here with the – with people and the President but the person who was doing the talking – most of the talking about your – the company which you chair is somebody else and like you know saying well this is what – that needs to be done and so like she knows what needs to be done and she needs to – to just sell the idea to you to say, here is an idea.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Did you say 155?    Oh.       Is there anything of that?     Ja.     26 February?     Ja.     Was the... why did the board wanted the minister want to meet with the minister before they could consider this proposal of an inquiry?     Ten...?     Okay.  The smaller bundle.     Eskom Bundle 07.B.     Did the board or was the agenda of the meeting of the 11t h amended to include the latest of the issues the board wanted to discuss with the minister, given that the meeting of the 11t h had to be meant to have discuss matters that should have been discussed on the 26t h of February? In other words, did you then intend at that meeting of the 11t h would deal with both the issues that you needed to deal with the minister and the issues that you had intended to deal with in any event before there was this meeting of the 8t h, for instance? Or did the board just say let us start with issues that require the minister’s presence and then they discussed that and later they postponed the other issues to another date?     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     07...?     Oh, by the way we changed to... ja, 07.B.     I may have said point 1 earlier on.  Okay so what is the page?     Okay.       I think you are right, Mr Tsotsi.     Ja, six something must be the in the other – in the bigger bundle.       671?     H’m.  So we have on the big bundle.     Was it the financial director?     OH, and that was a name that was not included in the names that were discussed at the meeting of the 8t h.       Yes.     You insisted on…?     Yes, so that had been view also at the meeting of the 8 t h?     At the President’s residence.     Okay, ja.       Why was it thought the continued presence of the executives would be problematic or would interfere in any way with the inquiry or its investigation?  What was the factual basis for thinking that they would interfere, indeed that they would not be helpful?     Yes but is that not a problem?  Based on what Mr Matona said yesterday in his evidence, he was told that the basis of the suspension was not that there was any wrongdoing on his part.     So why was it thought that somebody who had not done – who was accepted as not having done anything wrong would not cooperate and actually assist this investigation or if he remained present?     Yes but why would – how could they assist if they were suspended?     But what was the basis for thinking if they continued and the investigation continued and whenever they are needed to answer anything or handover information that they would not cooperate.     Mr Seleka, we are at nearly quarter past four.     Let us talk about how long we…     H’m?  Ja, how long, how much more do you need to conclude Mr Tsotsi’s evidence? ADV SELEKA     I know that the issue of the meeting, the activities of the 11 t h and subsequently there is a lot to be …[intervenes]     That I accept.       But how long was your estimate?     Yes.     Ja.  No, that is fine, I take it that, Mr Tsotsi, you are still available to continue?      Yes, yes and all legal representatives, I am sure there are no problem?  Yes, okay, alright.  We will take an adjournment, let us make it 15 minutes adjournment.     And depending on what you say we could continue from half past four.  Maybe if we take an hour we should finished but you will reflect and you will tell me when you come back.     Ja, ja.     Ja, that is fine.    Ja.  No that is fine.  We will adjourn then and resume at half past four.      We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let’s get going.     Just to conclude on the meeting between the Board and the Minister, what were the decisions taken in that meeting, if there were any decisions?     Or conclusions.     And she added one more name?     Yes.     Now in the discussion with the Minister or between or from the 8 t h to the commencement of that meeting between the Board and the Minister, had you had any discussion with the Minister as Chairperson of the Board?  In other words, prior to her arriving at the meeting on the 11 t h, between the meeting in Durban and the commencement of the meeting on the 11 t h had you had any discussion with the Minister?     Yes, did you write anything to her?     Yes.  Did that memo tell her about this proposal of an inquiry and the suspension of the executives and give motivation for the inquiry, and the suspension of the executives?     Yes, okay.     But in any event the President had indicated that he was going to speak to the Minister, you were going to speak to the Board and he was going to speak to the Minister?       Yes.     So when the Minister came to the meeting did she appear to have a good understanding of the proposal and reasons for the proposal     Yes.     Okay, no that is fine.  Then you may continue in regard to the meeting after that.     Okay I am sorry, you said we must go to 692 and I went there, are you still there?     Yes, okay the page numbers you have given us are for what?      Oh, okay.     Yes, that is fine, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     But do I need to note that down now because aren’t you going to give it to me when we go there anyway?     Oh, okay, yes, alright.     811 to 865, okay that is the first ...[intervenes]       Okay that is the meeting of the Board without the Minister.     Ja, okay.     What are the page numbers again, 8?     I am sorry, that first meeting that the recording is 811 to what?     Okay, so this one is 866 to?   906, that is now the recording ...[intervenes]      ...of the Board meeting after the Minster.     Yes.     Page 692?     And that is – these are all on the same day? ADV SELEKA     Ja.     Ja, okay, but they are regarded as separate meetings?     Okay, so this last one is the meeting of the Board ...[intervenes]      Where Mr Linnell is introduced?     Okay.     787 to 808.   What meeting is that?     Yes, okay.     Okay, yes.     Your voice.     Yes okay.     And the transcript starting at page 866 is a transcript of the recording that we are going to listen to now?     Okay. ADV SELEKA     Yes, okay.  Maybe he can address me from where he is if it is going to be quick.     Yes.     Yes?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well what if we do this, let’s run it, if he is asked any questions and there’s a problem, he says so and we take it from there, in case whatever he is asked he has no problem with?     So in other words, we deal with each problem on its merits as it arises, if any problem arises at all.     Yes, no, no, no I understand.     Ja, no, no I understand what you mean.  Do you want to say anything Mr Seleka?     Ja.     Yes.   Okay I think what we will do let’s go ahead and when Mr Tsotsi is asked to comment or ask any question if there is a problem he will raise it and we will look at it at that stage, and if his counsel thinks there is a problem we can look at it at that stage.  It may well be that there will be no problem and we go, everything will go smoothly.     Okay, alright.     Are the technicians not ready?  Should we – if they are going to take long should we deal with other matters and they indicate to you when they are ready so that we don’t waste time?     I thought you said they were ready from the morning?     Ja.     Ja, they must indicate to you when they are ready.  Well, maybe your junior should be there to make sure that she can see when they are ready so that we don’t waste time.     Ja.     Were you the only one in the meeting who was concerned that they should not be suspended but some other form of absence be agreed upon?  There may have been ...[intervenes]       ...a few others ja.   But was your concern the label  suspension what effect it would have when it is conveyed to the outside world of the executives but you also had the same thing in mind in terms of substance, namely they should not be at work for a certain period of time?     Yes.     Ja.     Yes you know sometimes people say somebody is on special leave, that is saying on suspension, is that what you had in mind?     Which would be a label because when somebody says you are on special leave and somebody is on suspension they are both absent from work for a certain period of time, but one label has certain implications, another one has different implications, so in other words in substance you also had in mind that they should be absent from work for a certain period.     That kind of a label, ja, okay, alright.     Yes.     Well I got the impression, or ja I got the impression in terms of Mr Matona’s evidence yesterday and maybe reading some of the affidavits and documents that while they might not have been accused of any misconduct but what was being investigated included how they were managing the company, in other words their performance, were they managing the company properly, to meet with the challenges, to deal with the challenges that the company was facing, that is the impression I got, but if you say the idea was not to investigate them that seems to be inconsistent with my understanding because my understanding seems to be that while the Board might not have been saying they have done anything wrong, but it seems that it wanted to investigate whether the way in which they had been running the company, or managing the company was the right one.  Of course there was this allegation that the war room was being fed with wrong information, inadequate information, obviously that must relate to the executives.     So what do you say to that.     Mmm, mmm.     Well except that Mr Matona was also not there after you had left, so he was talking very much about what was conveyed at the meeting, was conveyed to him on the 11 t h and I am saying that based on what he was saying it seem to me that your Board was saying this inquiry would – what it would look into included how the management – how the executives, maybe not just these but how the management of Eskom was dealing with the challenges that the company was facing and then there was this issue that the war room was being fed wrong information and I would imagine that the person to approve any information that was being sent to the war room would be the CEO I would imagine. MR     No, no what I – effectively what I am saying is you can’t – it is difficult to say you can speak about the performance of the company without talking about the performance of the executives who are running the company.     Because they are the ones who make certain decisions which either enhance the performance or you know make decisions that end up with poor performance by the company, but I am just testing your idea that before you left the idea was not to investigate these executives and I am just saying but how could this inquiry not include investigating these executives because the inquiry was alleged to be about the performance of the company and they were the top people running the company.     Ja.     Yes, no, no, if you – if what you meant was that there was no - that the inquiry would look into whether they had misconducted themselves.    That – that I can accept.    Ja.  But otherwise in terms of how they did their job.    Whether they made the right decisions and they appreciated the challenges of the company that would be part of the inquiry.    Okay.  Yes alright.    Mr Seleka.    At the …    But remember Mr Tsotsi the 11 t h March was the first sitting.    Of this Board for all intents and purposes to deal with the business of Eskom because the meeting of the 26 February was postponed to the 11t h.    And then on the 9 t h they met briefly about something else.  So it seems to that there would not have been any meeting prior to the 11t h at which the Board would have raised such an issue with – with Mr Matona.    Yes.  And if – if the matter was raised with him it may have been – it could only have been maybe by you as an – as Chairperson if this had come to your attention and you raised it with him outside of the Board Meeting.  Do you remember whether you did raise it outside of a Board Meeting?  He said yesterday that…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and the concern about inadequate information exactly what is it if you are able to articulate it?  Was it that the executives were being asked a certain amount of information and they provided the right information but not enough?  Was it that they were providing poor information – bad information?  What was the exact nature of the concern?    Hm.    Yes.    It is – I mean I can understand a concern that may have emanated from the War Room that would say we are concerned that the current management is not up to the job because these are the difficulties we are having and we have been having these difficulties for a certain period of time.   Maybe it is like they do not appreciate exactly what is needed to be – what we need to be given to us in order for us to try and find a solution.  But then I would expect that that would be put to them save to say you have a – there is a problem.   You are not able to satisfy us in this way so therefore we are going to have this inquiry and we ask you to take leave or you will be suspended because we want to look into this.  But this idea there will be an inquiry.   But this thing about inadequate information seems to be just a peripheral issue it is – you know it does not come to the fore in the manner that one would have thought it would.  You understand what I am saying?    Yes.  Because then if it had been presented like that they would know also okay – there is a concern that are we able to really assist in finding a solution if we are not able to provide information adequately bla, bla, bla.  But you know it seemed like an inquiry and then this thing about information being provided to the War Room is like a peripheral issue.  Ja.    Ja okay.  Mr Seleka.    It is a very strange thing that the Board that is supposed to be in control – have exercise control over the entity – it is a new Board.  The only thing that has happened before this meeting where they – they seem to be so much in favour of an idea that comes from outside the Board of an inquiry and suspension.  It is their first meeting really.   I know about the meeting of the 9 t h but it is their first meeting. An idea comes from people outside of the Board and not from management either they run with it and somebody that has been obtained or provided by somebody from outside of the Board namely Ms Myeni providing Mr Linnell is now allowed to get quite involved in the affairs of    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    That is now the people in governance meeting?    That is now the people in governance committee meeting.    Ja.    Yes.    [not audible].    Yes.    How did that come about in circumstances where he himself said he thought this was too big a job of something like that?    Now just to clarify.  This meeting we are talking about now which was discussing the names of people to act in the positions of the suspended executives was a peoples in governance committee?    Now the – the other sessions which up to  now were being calling board meetings were they also peoples in governance committee meetings we just wrongly called them board meetings?    With the Minister was with the Board?    Ja and the meeting that took place before the meeting with the Minister was a board meeting?    But the meeting after the Minister had left was not a meeting of the full board but a governance and peoples and governance committee.    Is that right?    Okay so was there after the meeting of the peoples and governance committee meeting after that meeting was there another board meeting on the day or had the board meeting end when – before the peoples and governance committee started?    The suspension.    Yes recommending suspensions.    Okay.  And…    And also to decide on the people to act.    So – so the board meeting ended before the peoples and governance committee meeting started?    And then the governance and people – the peoples and governance committee meeting started but it had the mandate to get and to appoint or to recommend whatever the position was on who should act in the positions of the executives?     And for the rest of the day, it is only the people in governance committee meetings that we are looking at from that time on for that day?     There was no further board meeting?     Okay alright.  So after lunch, you joined this people governance committee meeting?     And you found them already dealing with names of people to act in the positions of the executives?     You say to them, amongst other things, none of you know these people.     I am the only that was... And that was because you have been around.     You know, for quite some time.  What do they say to you when you say that, these people in the meeting?     Ja, and they were just going along effectively.     They do not know the people because the minister gave the names. They seem to want to rubberstamp, it seems from.     That is correct, ja.     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     I see I have twenty-five to six.  Shall we just go on and see where we are at six o’clock?  I think nobody has a problem.  Let us review the situation at  six.     Demand/request or proposal.     Or instruction.     Ja.     Okay, that is fine.       They must just be able to get on with it so that we do not waste time.     I am sorry.     Rewind.  Could you please rewind to the beginning?     Page 866.     [No audible reply]  [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     You said we are going to page 866?     Okay alright.  Okay.       Ja, I have got it.  Have you got it Mr Tsotsi?     Okay.     Ja, you can go ahead.     I am sure there is  page which has got a list of the names of the board members.  If you tell him where that page is, he will see the...     Even if he does not remember the first name.     What is the name?     And the surname?     C-a-r-r-i-m?     Okay.  Are you confident that this is the person?     Okay.     There were only two ladies in the meeting?     Three?     Okay alright.  Yes?     I cannot hear.     Who was referred to as Ambassador?     Oh, okay.     Alright.  Okay.  Because had been an ambassador at some stage before?     Ja, okay.     Okay. [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     I guess is supposed to have sent – supposed to have said the people in governance committee ...[intervenes]      Because is it not what we... is not where we are?     Mr Seleka?     Oh, not yet?     Oh, okay.      Yes.  No, I understand that I thought that we were already at the governance and the people governance committee?     We are at the meeting immediate after the minister had left?     That is where we are?     Okay alright.  And that is the board meeting?     Okay alright.       Well, let us sort that out Mr Seleka.  Are we at the people and governance meeting this recording or is it at the board meeting after the minister has left?  Because I hear Mr Tsotsi says this is at the people and governance ...[intervenes]      Oh, okay alright.     No, okay.  Alright.  Alright.     Yes, it is correct.     The discussion continued.     And ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Ja.     And he did insist on somebody answering his concerns?     Ja.     Mr Seleka, I do not want us to listen to the recording on everything.      Because there is a transcript.     I want us to only listen to parts of the record in regard to parts that you regard as important.     So that we must not go through everything.  And if those have not been identified by way making sure that really listen to what you regard as quite important, then maybe that can be done after we have adjourned so that when we get to it is much quicker.     We get to – so we know if there is a discrepancy on the version even by any witness as to what was discussed or decided and the recording does bring that up, then we can just go there and you zoom in.  We listen to that.  We stop.  We move on.     And we listen only when there is something quite important.     Yes.     Yes, we are at five to six.  Where are we?  How much more time we need?     Maybe what we should do to the extent that Mr Tsotsi has not... I do not know whether the transcript, you had a chance to read?     You have not had a chance to read?     Maybe what you should do Mr Seleka is we should adjourn now.  That is point one.  Point two.  Mr Tsotsi should get the opportunity to go through the transcripts and listen to the audio and make notes that will help with the identification of the people who are talking in the audio.  He will be looking at the transcript at he listen and he can make notes.  Where it says female voice or something like that.     He can write who that is and so on.  And that will assist because when he comes back you will know in advance – you will have spoken to him – where the – who the speakers are and the transcript can appropriately be amended.     To reflect the names of the people who will speak at different parts of the transcript.  And one, they can indicate whether he substantially agrees that the transcript reflects the discussions at least for the time that he was at the meeting.   And where – then after that we can just focus on the important things.  And if there is something to listen to on the recording, we just go straight to that.  We listen to that.     How is that?  Is that fine?     It is fine, yes.     Yes.  Now, if we adjourn now, preferable we should be finished with him before we move to the next witness.     And would you be available to continue tomorrow morning, Mr Tsotsi?     You would be available?     And counsel, you are available?     So think that is what we should do.  If he can be given the audio to listen to it in the evening.  I am sure tomorrow when he comes back then the whole job can be much easier.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, okay.  So bearing that in mind, what is your estimate of how much time you might need with him tomorrow morning?     Yes, okay.     So let us... should we start at ten or half-past nine?     The witness who will come after him, how long is he or she supposed to be?     Ja and then there will be another one.     Yes.  And the other one at tow, likely take how much?     Ja.  Oh, so maybe let us start at half-past nine.     Is that fine?     Ja.  No, that is fine.     You can be given those?     Yes.  Ja.  No, just arrange with Mr Seleka.  Those can be given.     Okay so ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  Okay then we are going to adjourn and then tomorrow we start at half-past nine.     We adjourn.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good morning DCJ.    Yes Sir.    Today we will be using Eskom Bundle 07 Exhibit U17.    Marked for A Z Tsotsi.    That bundle Chairperson has been divided into two.  I understand that they have attended to regularising the Chairperson’s bundle as well.    yes.    There is a mini file.    Which is marked Eskom Bundle 07.1.    It is a continuation of the first.    Of the bigger one.    We will mainly be using the bigger one.    Mr Chairperson we are continuing with the second witness in this week that is Mr Zola Tsotsi.    Do I?    Oh yes.    I will.      Indeed thank you Chairperson.    Thank you Chairperson.    Thank you Chairperson.    Mr Tsotsi welcome.  When – you agree with me please speak out do not nod your head for the purposes of the record and you will be addressing the DCJ – the Chairperson of the inquiry.  You have before you two bundles.  There is the thicker bundle marked Eskom Bundle 07.  Can you see that?    Exhibit U17.    You can see that?  Then you have as you heard earlier explaining to the Chairperson the thinner bundle Eskom Bundle 07.1 which is a continuation of the first one.    Thank you Mr Tsotsi. Mr Tsotsi you have provided the commission with your affidavit and that is found on page 1 of the bigger file – U17.  Go to page 1.  Chairperson the – this – this bundle is paginated as you have indicated yesterday.  There is the black pagination and the red pagination.    We can follow the red Chairperson still.    Ja.    I have asked them not to have pages duplicated.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi are you on page 1?    Yes.  Aspects of your affidavit – certain aspects will be – will be admitted and I wish to focus my questions on some of the aspects arising from your affidavit.  So paragraph 2 of your affidavit deals with your qualifications and your degrees.     Oh yes.    Let me do exactly that Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi the affidavit starts on paginated page 1 and it runs up to paginated page 28 and please concentrate on the red numbers at the top of – right hand top of the page.      Yes you see the last page there?    You confirm that this is – this is your signature in the middle of the page?    And that the affidavit is dated 13 February 2020?    And you confirm that this is the affidavit you have submitted to the commission?    Thank you Mr Tsotsi.  So we go back to that page.    Oh yes.    Indeed Chairperson.  I beg your pardon.    U17 or now we have the file which is Point 1.    17.    A.  Indeed Chairperson.    Point 8.  Alternatively – alternatively Chairperson we can mark the bigger one A and this one – the smaller one B.    Yes.    U17.1 Chairperson.    17.1.    I think they might have made an error in the – in the smaller bundle.    As opposed to 07 it should have been 17.  Is that correct?  Yes I gather that…    Oh I see.    I got you.    So – Chairperson.    Okay so that labelling is correct.  Thank you Chairperson.  So the affidavit of Mr Tsotsi dated 13 February 2020 has been admitted as Exhibit U17.1.    Thank you.      Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Tsotsi may we proceed?  So in paragraph – if you go back to page 1 Mr Tsotsi of the affidavit.      So paragraph you set out your details with the ID number.  Paragraph 2 you set out your qualifications and where you obtained them.  Paragraph 3 you deal with your career.  You turn the page.  And 3.3 likewise you deal with your service on various board as    Eskom South Africa.  And then you    And how long did you stay in that position as a Chairman of the Board of Eskom?    December 2014?    When the new board was appointed?    Did you get to be reappointed on the new board?    In what capacity this time?    As Chairman of the Board?    Non-executive?    Yes Chairman.    Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Mr Tsotsi you were dealing with the – your second appointment as the Chairman of the Board and I wanted to know from you whether in that capacity were you an executive or a non-executive Chairperson?    Now the Chairperson has asked you the other questions relating to how you became appointed.  As you say in your statement that you applied the second time around following a publication of an advert that the application be followed by interviews.    Could you tell the Chairperson when you say in your case are you aware that in other – in the case of other Board Members whether or not they were interviewed?    Now that is in December 2024 you say.  We learnt yesterday from the witness of Mr Matona and you at present here as well, you confirm that – that you were present here as well yesterday?    That the Board went through an induction, recall that?    Well we did not – we did not get an indication of whether or not you attended that induction so I would like you to tell the Chairperson whether did you or did you not attend the induction?    And can you recall when in terms of date and month did the induction take place?    2015.    Yes.  So you attended the induction you say?    So that is January 2015 does the Board then have a timetable for its meetings for the year of 15?    So in that case what was the first date on which the Board would have its first meeting in 2015?    Could you tell the Chairperson whether that meeting took place?    And what – what were the reasons why the meeting did not take place?    So were you given the reasons for the postponement or for that request to postpone?    Did you ask the former President Jacob Zuma for the reasons why he asked – he wanted the meeting to be postponed?     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, please let us go a little bit into that.  If you turn to page 10 of your affidavits.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, page 10 of your affidavit.  If may consider this a little further.  Because there you write in paragraph 11.4 of page 10... Are you there, Mr Tsotsi?     You say     “The draft schedule for these meetings is circulated to board members towards the end of the proceedings here for their comment.   Once dates are confirmed up, the final schedule is signed off by the chairman and published in the formal meeting roster of the company.   None of these meetings may be cancelled because each one is designed to deal with specific aspects of the business which have to addressed at specific times.  Examples would be shareholder contact, corporate plan, integrated report, auditing of financial statements, planning of general meeting, MRPD tariff application, et cetera.   These meetings can, however, be postponed on the understanding that they will be rescheduled.   This postponement can either be canvassed amongst board members for good reason or maybe affected by the chairman under plausible circumstances or may be requested by the minister.” Now I see that you use the word postponement in this paragraph.  Do you see that?     And this is not the same concept you used when you referred to your telephone call made by the former president to you.  You said the request was for you to cancel the meeting.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Yes, Mr Tsotsi, so you were explaining that you, by your own understanding, when this request is made to you, you need that the meeting would have to be postponed?     But the request to you is that the meeting should not take place?     Thank you, Chairperson.  Yes, Mr Tsotsi, you say when was the financial year-end for Eskom?     31 March?     And would you, in your explanation to the Chairperson, said one important – one of the important issues to be discussed there in the meeting of the 26t h of February, were the financials?     And indeed, your FD at the time agrees with you in that regard.  If you turn to page 117 of the bundle before you.  So the FD that is Ms Tsholofele Molefe to her, submitted an affidavit to the Commission.  Chairperson, that affidavit ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chairperson.     The Financial Director.     Correct, Chairperson.     Having met with so many Eskom officials using the initials, you become accustom to their language, Chair. [laughs]     The affidavit, Mr Tsotsi starts on page 9.  Chairperson, we will have to mark it.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is...     Page 117 of that affidavit.     Mr Tsotsi, are you there?     Now paragraphs 21 and 22.  And I will read 21 just to give context to what she says in paragraph 22. “The G Forensic report highlighted that there was wrongdoing on the part of Mr Matjila, in that he did not have the delegation of authority to commit the company for a contract of this size without following the company’s governance process. The board then started to seek legal advice on the actions to take action against Mr Matjila who by then has stepped down as interim CEO. And the new CEO Mr Tshediso Matona had taken office effective from 1 October 2014. As a result of this transgression of the interim CEO at the time, the auditors indicated that they would qualify their review opinion for the interim financial statements with an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding a report of an irregularity, I an executive authority.”     Yes.     Ja.  Just before that.  Would you not tell the Chairperson what words you used?     Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  I did not get that last part of your answer to the Chairperson.  The minister has what?       Yes?     Yes.  And you did mention earlier but let me ask you this.  Where would that authority come from?  Will we find it in a document such authority of the minister?     Yes.  We... as ...[intervenes]      I do not recall precisely but my inclination it to say, it probably speak of a request.     Yes, indeed Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, the Commission has been provided with a copy of the Memorandum of Incorporation of Eskom.  It is in the smaller bundle.     It is in the smaller bundle.  Thank you, Chair.  Page 953.  You have it?     You found it Mr Tsotsi?     Well, let us look at this document.  It is the Eskom Memorandum of Incorporation.  Authorisation date.  Can you see that block at the top of the page?     9/20/14.  Do you see that?  On page 953.     953, Chairperson.     Chairperson?     Oh.     You have not found it?     Oh, you have long found it?     I see.     We will do exactly that, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, you are – I wanted you to look at the document, look at the index, the table of contents just to refresh your memory that you are familiar with this document.     And let us see the part dealing with meetings of directors and you could assist us in that regard, but I will go to the relevant paragraph for present purposes.  If you turn to page 972.     If you could please.  So we see there paragraph 12 deals with shareholders’ meetings.  Would you know offhand which paragraph will with the directors’ meetings?     Or turn to page 980.  Thank you, Chairperson.     So you see paragraph 13 deals with directors.     Do you see that, Mr Tsotsi?          Go to page 985?     See whether you cannot find anything there under paragraph 13.9 dealing with proceedings at meetings of directors.  Well, let me say this to you, Mr Tsotsi, I have gone through this and maybe you can correct me.  I have gone through this and I could not find a provision that empowers the Minister to call for the cancellation of a meeting.     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi may I also refer you to page 983, paragraph 13.7 of the same Memorandum of Incorporation.  Are you there?     With the heading Powers of Directors     Do you see that?     Otherwise all the powers in terms of this provision to manage and control Eskom vested solely in the board.  Do you see that?      Thank you, Chairperson.  Well, on this occasion of the request you did not say anything in your affidavit about a request having been done in writing to you prior written notice to you by the Minister.     There was not such.     Now this meeting that gets to be cancelled on the eve of the board having to deal with some of the important issues, as you say, one of them are your financials because you are nearing the financial year end, how do you - and the financial director is also, in your case, about wanting the financials to be approved, how do you deal with that, as a Chairman of the board?     To find what?     If possible, Mr Seleka, I would like us to wrap up on this meeting of the 26 t h and move on to other matters.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, let me, just to wind up on this aspect, I will read to you further about Ms Molefe writes in her affidavit, turn the page     Ja, let me assist.  Mr Tsotsi, that is in the preceding paragraph.  The Chairperson is reading the preceding paragraph.     Yes, okay.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Going back …[intervenes]     Not a problem, Chair.     That paragraph 23.     “The board that had been deliberating  on the matters that I have stated above were replaced in or around June 2014 with the exception of Tsotsi and Mabude.  The board meeting…” Well, I suppose June 2014 should be an error there, an obvious error.     She is saying     That is correct, yes.     Yes, correct.     Is that correct, Mr Tsotsi?   I think she must have gotten the dates wrong, instead of June it is December.      There was not a gap between the new board and the old board.     Was there an intervening period?     Oh, okay.  Then she carries on    Now this is an important meeting.  It gets cancelled and you said earlier then you would look for the next available date to discuss these important issues.  Did you in fact do that?     And what as the next available date?     Well …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, you mentioned the meeting of the 9 t h whether it was – in a statement in relation to a response to my question or not but let me ask you about – I mean, ask you a question in relation to that.  Was there a meeting on the 9 March 15?     How did that meeting come about?     That is absolutely – thank you, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     No it is fine Chair thank you.  Yes, I thought I had left it to the end but you brought it forth.     No not at all.  Yes, well Mr Tsotsi this was indeed as you write in that affidavit a usual fundraising gala dinner and this is for the ANC.  You say that in paragraph 6.1.           The ANC had its usual fundraising gala dinner.  So the funds are being raised for non-other but the ANC.      No certainly Chairperson not to be sorry at all.  Chairperson I think we should explore that aspect to its limits and then we can go to where I wanted to go earlier.  Mr Tsotsi well you write further there in paragraph 6.1 after you mentioned the tops, you said the ANC top 6 and two other.             All the Gupta brothers the table had name tags.  So those who did not know one another were able to introduce themselves.  This was the first and the only encounter I had with these Gupta brothers.  I never got to see or talk to them thereafter.  Now this is January 2014.  Is that correct?        January 2014.  The next paragraph and I am trying to understand that concluding statement in paragraph 6.1 visa vie the next statement you make in 6.2.  You say I was requested by Mr Tony Gupta to meet with him at their Saxonwold residence on some of three occasions and once at their Sahara Computers offices in Midrand.  Now my question is was Mr Tony Gupta one of the brothers you referred to in paragraph 6.1?          The two older brothers.      I see, thank you Chairperson.  You confirm that Mr Tsotsi?      So okay 6.2 refers to a different person a different occasion?      Different person different occasion.  And having been requested as such did you attend at their residence in Saxonwold?      And what gets to be discussed in a nutshell on this – I see you say some three occasions.      Sorry can you recall when was that?     2014?     Okay then you may proceed about what gets to be discussed in that meeting.     Thank you Chairperson.  Now Mr Tsotsi a follow up question to that is – is given that he was making a business proposition to Eskom why did he seek a meeting with you a Chairperson of the Board non-executive and not anybody else in operations at Eskom?    Yes.  Well one has in mind for instance if you talking about persons in authority you have a CEO there he certainly one person in authority.  He is the face of the company. So why not him but you?  Do you – did you ever ask yourself that question?    Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Mr Tsotsi he – writing in…    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi you have mentioned that they used the name Baba’s enemies – the concept of Baba’s enemies.  Let us look at    And you have explained that you had this meeting with Tony Gupta on three occasions at their residence in Saxonwold and their offices at Sahara Computers.  Why did you agree to going back the second time, the third time?  Why did you not rebuff them?    Ja.  Well I do not follow the reasoning but is that how you thought about it at the time?    Because in fact you do have another meeting according to you on page 7 of the affidavit – paragraph 7.3.  And again, on this occasion as the Chairperson has emphasised it is not them coming to you it is them calling you to come to themselves.  And you right if you go to page 7 please paragraph 7.3.   Just to put context to that.  It flows from your two preceding paragraphs which above which you say a day or two before the State of the Nation Address of February of 2015 – 5 February 2015 that is in paragraph 7.1.  You have an encounter with Minister    I see.      Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi let us seek could – could the answer not lie in what you say Mr Tony Gupta told you?  Let us go back to that paragraph 7.3 which is the question the Chairperson is asking.  What did you fear would happen to you if you did not comply?  So you arrive there.   “He suggested that the meeting be at the residence in Constantia to which I agreed.”     Yes.  You do say in paragraph 7.4, you     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, let us go to... I think what you were relating in regard to your encounter with the minister, can be found in paragraph 7.1 of you affidavit, page 6.     And you said you had a conversation.  She had summoned you to her office.  And the second     Is that what she told you?     Thank you, Chairperson.      Thank you, Chairperson.       Let me just canvas this point with Mr Tsotsi.     Mr Tsotsi, the minister or former Minister, Lynne Brown, has provided the Commission with an affidavit after being furnished with your affidavit and she speaks specifically about this issue in a paragraph in her – or certain paragraphs in her affidavit.  It is in your bundle and that is on page – the paragraphs that I want to refer to, they are on page 445.       445.  Correct, Chairperson.  You will see that ...[intervenes]      ...the beginning of... the beginning of this affidavit is on page 434 and it is titled Supplementary affidavit of Miss Lynette Brown.  And if you go to page 445,     The last question before we take the adjournment.  Who did you say was the author of this?     Chairperson it might be an opportune time, I suppose the other, we could finalise the point after the adjournment.    Thank you Chairman.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, when we adjourned, we were dealing with certain paragraphs arising from Ms Lynne Brown’s affidavit in regard to your meeting with her two or three days before the State of the Nation address in February 2015.  I think we have exhausted that aspect insofar as it is relevant.  Do you have anything to add to it?     Ja, to that exchange or the Minister ’s response to you.     Thank you, Mr Tsotsi. Ja, you will see, for what it is worth, we could complete this, paragraph 104,     Yes.     Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.     I was about to ask that question.     But just please make note of it, Mr Tsotsi.     Now we touched on this aspect this morning about the cancellation of the meeting of the 26 February 2015 and that on your version it was on the minutes does request or at least that is how you conveyed it to the board.  Correct?     The Minister has – or former Minister has touched on that in her affidavit, the very one in front of you.  If you go to page 442, for context we could start at 441 at the bottom half, page 441.  On what page are you, Mr Tsotsi?     441.     At the bottom of the page, paragraph 65.     It reads    She says    Then she mentions …[intervenes]     Yes, absolutely.     Yes.  The other thing which I just want to make a comment about is this statement she makes about when she turned up at the meeting, the board meeting, when the board invited her.     Yes.      I see.     Have you shared that memo with the investigation team?     Oh, okay.     Yes.      Yes.  So that is the cancellation of the meeting of the 29 February and then you mentioned the meeting on the 9 March.  I would like you to tell the Chairperson whether the meeting of the 9 March, was it a normal scheduled board meeting or not?     We will be going back to your affidavit.     Yes.      But before [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]  The Chairperson say also, that is correct.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Whether it was a scheduled board meeting.     Thank you.     Chairperson, if I may, for your convenience and the witness’s convenience, I have copies of the calendar for the relevant month for 2015.     I will beg leave to hand them up, not as exhibits but simply to facilitate the witness’s testimony.     Thank you Chairperson.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, what did you then do with what is asked of you by the President?     Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, a couple of things arises from what you are saying because what we understood from Mr Matona yesterday was that the meeting on the 9 t h with the one agenda item was actually short-lived because Board members expressed displeasure with what had been proposed to them, which is slightly different from – maybe you can correct, you having the intention to arrange that meeting in order to prepare for the meeting of the 11 t h. What will be your explanation to the Chairperson?     Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi you relate at that meeting, in your affidavit on page 12 and page 13 of the affidavit, I could refer you to the paragraph but the purposes of the wording that the DCJ, I mean the Chairperson is postulating there.  Page 13 paragraph 12.8.     If you could read that first line.     May I just stop you there.  I mean is that – that enquiry by the President that you say it is an enquiry what was up for discussion, I mean, in your assessment of your further engagement in the meeting, I know you tried to explain that he’s mannerism – is that a rhetorical question or is it a question to find information?     So rhetorical, I mean, it’s not a question that requires an answer, I know what the answer is.     Thank you.  Mr Tsotsi, given what we’ve read from the memorandum of incorporation this morning and what you would have known about the position of the Board, that the management and control of the company vests in the Board, how did you find the President’s instruction to you, to go test this with the Board, that there should be an inquiry, that three people -three Executives should be suspended, how did that sit with you?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi quickly still on that meeting and you have seen Mr Nicholas Linnell’s affidavit which you have referred to earlier.  It is also contained in your bundle.  It is on the relevant pages I want to refer you to. It is on the first bundle – the bigger one page 148 and 149.  Okay.  Okay now as you turn there because Mr Linnell places another person in that meeting one called Jabu and he further explains later Maswanganyi.  So Chair from paragraph 14.  Could you tell the Chairperson whether you have any recollection of that person because I did not hear you mention him.    Ja because if you look at paragraph – on page 149 paragraph 15.    Mr Linnell writes   Ja.  Anyway, then the following paragraphs Mr Linnell gives certain details about how he came to know that a gentleman called Jabu was Jabu Maswanganyi.    Paragraph 18.  Then he specifies again    Well how do you reconcile that statement that Mr Nick Linnell says the President was clearly familiar.  Now you say the President entered and enquired what was – what was up for discussion.    I see.      Thank you Chairperson.    Mr Tsotsi who headed the War Room?    So did he at any stage call you to raise concerns of the War Room with you?    Thank you Chair.  Just to complete the paragraphs that the Chairperson…    Thank you Chairperson.  To complete those paragraphs the Chairperson was reading out to you Mr    Thank you Chair.      Has provided also a statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee along the lines of his affidavit that statement is also contained in this bundle.  It is on page 123.  Yes.  And there is just two paragraphs I want – I want to refer you to on page 125.  Oh page 125.    125 yes.    So he says in paragraph 7. “The President listened to these views and asked one or two questions then he agreed.  He undertook to speak with the Minister and Mr Tsotsi would speak with the Board.” That is in regard to what had been proposed the inquiry and the suspension.    And your…    Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chairperson.  So do you also recall Mr Tsotsi the President ending or concluding the meeting by saying he will speak to the Minister?    That is correct.    So then Mr Linnell says   So you would have then Mr Tsotsi called a meeting of the 9 March after this meeting of the 8t h?    Now have you ever had to call a meeting at such short notice before?    So Mr Linnell then says   Yes.  He has attached those to his affidavit and that is on page 165 of the bundle before you – we are busy with.  See whether you recognise this email?    160 I beg your pardon Chairperson.    Page 160 Mr Tsotsi.  It is an email from    Is this then what Mr Linnell would have sent to you?    Ja can you explain to the Chairperson if it is not Eskom?    Does anything turn on the fact that an Eskom email address was not used by your private?    Does anything turn on the fact that Eskom in their address was used to forward these documents about your own private email address.     Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.  Now the following pages, page 162.  You may turn there.  And page 164.  Starting with page 162.  I presume that is the memorandum referred to in Mr Linnell’s email to you.  Do you see that?     And on page 164, it is a resolution.     This would have also been a document attached to Ms Myeni’s...     So these documents, you then circulate... or shall I ask you rather?  You said earlier you forwarded then to the company secretary.  Correct/     And the company secretary at the time, is who?     And your request to him is to call for the meeting on the 9 t h of March?     2015.  So when would you have because     I beg your pardon?     So that will be on the same date, 8 March?  On Sunday, 8 March?     So take us into the meeting of the 9t h of March.  Well, you have and the meeting was short-lived, or rather, let us expedite the process.  The meeting is short-lived, the resolution is that you as the board wanted to meet with the minister.        Is that what was decided?     Was the meeting on the 11 t h a scheduled board meeting?     Okay.  Now in that meeting of the 11t h of March or before then.  If it is rescheduled.  So you were in the board meeting resolving to have the minister invited to the meeting.  Do you make contact with the minister for that purpose?     Regarding the meeting on the 11 t h?     And did the minister... ja, the minister.  Was the minister ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.  Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, it has just been drawn to my attention.  If you please quickly in the smaller bundle, page 1086.       86.     The smaller bundle.     Thank you, Chairperson.  1086.     On that page is an email Mr Tsotsi from Malesela Phukubje.     On Sunday, 8 March 2015 one minutes     The subject is    It says    When you call or made contact with the minister, is it by telephone in regard to now the meeting of the 11t h?     Yes.  And to your recollection, was the minister surprised by the invite or was she expecting the invite?     Yes.  So when the minister arrives at the meeting on the 11t h of March 2015, what does she and the board talk about?     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, we have been provided with the minutes of that board meeting.  If this will assist your recollection.  On page 671 of the smaller bundle, Eskom Bundle 07.B.     Point B.     Point B.     Page 671.     It starts at?     In the other, in the first one.       Yes, 671.     So that is... Mr Tsotsi, let us see if that will assist your recollection.  It is the minutes of the Eskom board meeting with the Minister of Public Enterprises held on the 11t h of March 2015 that the board room is mentioned,     And the list of other members there.   “Mr Matona, Ms Mabuda and Ms Naidoo, Ms Klein, Ms Carrim, Mr Naidoo, Mr Pamenski, Ms Molefe and Mr Baloy, Dr Ngubane and Mr Xhosa and Mr Khumalo.  Also, in attendance is Miss L Brown, the Minister of Public Enterprises, Ms M Mokolo, Director General DPE (acting) and Mr Phukubje, Company Secretary.   Board In-Committee Session.  After introductions and formalities, the minister raised the issue of the location of a bugging device which was found in the board room at the Eskom Megawatt Park.  She also noted that the fact that no investigation into the matter had been initiated and pointed out that it is a very serious matter over which action should have been taken. The CE responded by explaining that the matter was being dealt with and that a number of new procedures had been introduced in order to stem the possible repetition of a similar matter.   It was standard procedure that the board room is swept for the existence for recording and transmitting devices a day before the meeting, as well as the day after the meeting.   He, thereafter, reported that he is still awaiting a report by the service providers about the origins and the exact nature of the device.   The minister stated that the matter needed to be investigated urgently and that it should be recorded as necessary urgency which she is not detecting from the actions taken thus far.   At this point, the CE and the FD... That is the Chief Executive Officer and the Financial Director.  Correct, Mr Tsotsi?          Then you were trying to recall and relating to the chairperson what the board and the minister discussed on that day.  If you could give us the points or you could look into the meeting to assist you in your recollection.  I see there are certain points made at the bottom of page 672. But let us see, if I may just quickly?  The paragraph just     That I have no right to instruct the board on any matter.     Yes.  It is because, if we suppose, prior knowledge of something she might have – she might have been told the board would engage her on, if her starting point was, I have no right to instruct the board.       [No audible reply]      Could it be that in your communication to her to invite her to this meeting, you would have indicated what the board requested her to come and deal with the board about?     So that is why I am saying, the statement made there, proposes prior knowledge of what was going to be discussed.  You understand what I am trying to say?     Did the minister discuss the inquiry, the establishment of the inquiry with the board?     Did the minister discuss the suspension of the executives with the board?     Did she support the suspension of the executives?     Thank you, Chairperson.  Did they change the position you articulated to the Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi and in your affidavit that you were in fact before the president and Ms Dudu Myeni opposed to the suspension of the executives even though you were amenable to the inquiry?     Yes, certainly.  Are these board meetings recorded?     Could you tell the Chairperson whether the meeting with the minister was recorded?     A digital recording, yes.     So the minutes we have read out from would have been produced from handwritten notes ...[intervenes]      ...of somebody who took the minutes at the time?     Then the meeting, you said it commenced before the minister arrived, you had your schedules meeting with the board?     Was that meeting recorded?     The meeting then after the minister had left, are you aware that that meeting was also recorded?     Yes.     Well, I would not know but you were saying you could go to a meeting where the suspension of the executives was decided upon.     Which meeting was that?     That was not recorded?     We have the recording.  As you would know, this is a Commission of Inquiry.     So the Commission has done, in the process of its investigation, obtained information.  It has a recording of the minutes before the minister arrived.     And a recording of the meeting... sorry, I said the minutes.  Of the meeting before the minister arrived and of the meeting immediately after the minister arrived.     Even of that as well.       Now I asked the question - just before I go to those audios and I will take you to the transcriptions of those audios.  I asked you a question, whether did the minister show of support of the inquiry and of the suspension of the executives, even as you say adding the fourth executive on the list of those to be suspended, changed your view that you were opposed to the suspension of the executives?     Yes.     Correct, yes.     Yes, Chair.     We [indistinct] 5.13.     To cover.     Yes.     Yes.  Chair, we could take a five minute adjournment with your leave.     And I could make a judgment call.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, I will consider my notes, Chairperson.     And indicate to the Chairperson before we resume.     So that the Chairperson knows prior to that on the time.     Thank you, Chair.      Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi we were on the meeting of the 11 t h of March 2015, the Minister has left and you were saying you could take us into the meeting after the Minister has left.       Thank you Chairperson.   Yes Mr Tsotsi you were saying you could take us into that meeting but I would like to go ahead of you if I may, because as I said the Commission has obtained the audio recordings of that meeting, the transcript of that audio is contained in the bundle before you.  I believe you have already opened to it, you can help me with the page number there at the top of the page.     692, thank you Mr Tsotsi. There are – there’s four different recordings the Commission has obtained and I am going to focus on two of those recordings, I will take you there now, let me just explain to you, the one, the first recording in the transcript is the meeting of the Board before the Minister arrives.  Chairperson I am going to give the page numbers, which can be written down, that is on page 811 to 8 ...[intervenes]      I am there Chairperson.     Are the – there’s four meetings, recordings in respect of four meetings.     So I am going to give you the bigger picture before I go into the detail.     So you will have the first meeting without the Minister.     The transcript thereof is on page 811.     If you jot it down Chairperson for present purposes.     Yes, because I want to confine myself only to two of those recordings.     So it is 811 to 865     That is the first meeting before the Minister arrives.     Without the Minister.     Then the Minister arrives and we don’t have a recording of that as Mr Tsotsi has correctly indicated but then there is a recording of the meeting after the Minister has left and the transcription of that is on page 866 to 906.     866 to 906, nine zero six.     865.     906.       After the Minister.     Yes.     Then there is a board meeting where Mr Nic Linnell is introduced, the transcription of that is on page 692 to 787.     692 to 787.    All on the same day.    They are indeed separate meetings, one after other.    With Mr Nick Linnell.      Is introduced.     And then the last one Mr Tsotsi referred to as the P & G meeting is page 787 to 808.    That’s P & G meeting, People & Governance committee.     So I want to start at the meeting after the Minister which is on page 866.      I have arranged with the IT technician to assist us in that regard Chairperson.    I have arranged with the IT technician to assist us in that regard Chairperson.     Mr Tsotsi the audio will be played and during the course of that I would ask you to identify to the Chairperson the speaker at each given moment.  Audio clip 911.     Correct Chairperson.     Chairperson my response would be that the best evidence in this case is the audio itself.     It is a recording of the Board’s meeting where Mr Tsotsi was the Chairperson, he will hear himself and nobody else speaking, he will hear his colleagues at a time speaking, I am not sure what will be surprising to Mr Tsotsi in the audios, so he will have, if there is any correction to be made in the transcription make the correction by reference to the audio.    That is also my anticipation Chairman.     Thank you Chairperson.  So we are on page 866, audio file 9.1.1.       Chair may I proceed?     Ja, that’s what they assured me yesterday already.     Well Chair I am going to leave them to sort it out.     Thank you Chairperson.     Now Mr Tsotsi despite your opposition to the suspension of the executives, we know from Mr Matona’s testimony yesterday that four executives were ultimately suspended.  I think you have switched off the mic.    Thank you.    Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Mr Tsotsi a couple of things. Let me start with the first one and it is just about the War Room and the allegation of apparently inaccurate or inadequate information being provided to the War Room.  Were you aware of that being a concern?    Where did the Board raise that as a concern with the Executives such as Mr Matona in this case?    You heard him say yesterday that that was never raised with him.    Thank you Chairperson.  So Mr Tsotsi just for a quick reference in your affidavit on page 17 to page 21 the bottom of page 17.  Paragraph 15.  Under the heading Board Meeting of 11 March 2015.  Yes?    So you do say that the Board Meeting of the 11t h was twofold.   “The first papers was intended to make up for the 26 February meeting that got postponed. Secondly the Minister had indicated that she was available to attend on this day.”  Turn the page you carry on on page 18. “Mr Linnell spoke on the resolutions which stemmed from the memorandum he had developed.  The resolutions were circulated to Board Members in the meeting of 9 March.”    I appreciate that.  And 15.6 says   Yes.  Now I have read the minutes and affidavits of various witnesses. I grapple with the understanding of knowing and I would like you to explain this to the Chairperson if you can because you were in this meeting.  What did the Board resolve to do in respect of this executives?   What is the concept that was applied and ultimately effected to have them stay away from work?  What did the Board resolve?    Did it resonate with you Mr Tsotsi?    What did the Board con – what was given as the reasons that resonated with the Board for them not to be present?    Could you tell the Chairperson whether was that a concern of the Board?  A very concern of the Board.    Yes now how do you say that with conviction when the Board has not even had a meeting with the executives prior to 11 March 2015?  This is a new Board.    So what would be the answer in regard to yourself because you also say there is reasons resonated with you?    Yes.    Yes.  So how does – how does the commission ascribe – how does it understand the idea that the Board was the one saying the executives should be suspended for these and the other reason the inquiry should not be impeded when the commission and the information you yourself has provided is shown that Mr Linnell is the one who drafted this resolution and it did not originate from within the Board.     Thank you, Chairperson.  So should the Commission ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chairperson.  Should the Commission Mr Tsotsi then accept that this board ultimately succeeded through the demands of the then president or Ms Dudu Myeni, and/or?     Correct.  Thank you, Chairperson.       Or instructions.       Effectively, yes.     Yes.     So this Commission should... yes, understand that to be the position.  Thank you, Chairperson.  You see we are talking about the new board and when we take it from yourself.   What you say was your response to Minister Brown on the 15t h of February 15, when she says to your management and board members are complaining that you are interfering with management.   And remember, your response     Does that not similarly apply to the executives?     Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.  Chair, I believe the recording is ready.     I hope we get to play.  We were ...[intervenes]      Correct.  I want to – because Mr Tsotsi says he went on lunch and came back to find that the PMG meeting had started.  Or I could start with that but maybe I will put the point on it Mr Tsotsi.  Let us go back to that page I had given, page 866.  And that is audio 9.1.1.   [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     Okay, can he pause it?     To the beginning.     Are you fine, Chair?     866.     866.     YOU found it, Chairperson?     Thank you, Chairperson.   [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     Please pause.  Mr Tsotsi, please identify to the Chairperson whose male voice was the first?     It is your voice?     We hear a female voice coming on.  Can you play it, please? [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     Have you been able to identify her?     Sorry, just come again?     What is the first name?     We showed you the minutes earlier.     [No audible reply]      Thank you.  Can you...? [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     Mr Norman Baloyi?     Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.   [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     So is that your voice, Mr Tsotsi?     Thank you. [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     No, ,no, no.  Just so far.  Pause.  Sorry, I think that was your voice and then somebody else interrupted.     Whose voice was that?  Let us play it again. [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     Carry on.  [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     What I hear Mr Tsotsi is your voice saying Mr Ambassador.     Sorry, is.. was Dr Ngubane being referred to as the Ambassador?     Oh.     That is who?     Yes.  Mr Tsotsi, just before we carry on.  You heard, what you say, is Mr Norman Baloyi speaking there.     He sounds or have sounded to have expressed reservations about forging ahead with the decision propose particularly in regard to the suspension of the executives.  How did you as the board deal with his reservations?     Oh, your microphone sir.     [No audible reply]      Not yet, Chair.     Not yet.     But I think the question is relevant to the board because they make the decision.     No, Chair.     Correct.     Correct.     [No audible reply]      It is correct, Chairperson.     So that is the board meeting.     Yes.  No, correct.  But what I am asking is.  Based on your recollection, having been part of the meeting and hearing one of the board members expressing reservations in regard to the decisions that are about to be taken by the board, because this is at the moment of deliberations, the word used in your affidavit.  How did the board deal with his reservations?     Thank you, Chairperson.  You may proceed. [Audio 9.1.1. play on record]     Correct, Chair.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     Ys.     Yes.     Indeed, Chair.     Let me go to the section where it goes into the PMG Committee, Chairperson.     [No audible reply]      That is correct.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     That is perfectly fine, Chairperson.     That is the way to do it.     I would say so.     [No audible reply]      Yes.  Chair, I could not agree more.     I think the latest development most of the audio required.     So it was intended to be played in respect of Mr Tsotsi.     Ja.  So we should be very brief on that, Chair.     I think I would need 45-minutes, Chair.     Yes.     Or 09    We were scheduling her for the morning.     Then there will be another one at two, Chairperson.     Again, until the beginning of the next day.     Yes.     Indeed, Chair.     Now... ja.  It is fine.  Because my understanding was that Miss Lynne Brown’s statement had been emailed to Mr Tsotsi together with the statement of Ms Dudu Myeni.     Because if... they confirm they have the one but not the other.     Because I understood they were in one email but we will provide them with ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chairperson.

MR TSOTSI:  Zola Andile Tsotsi.    No.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes I am.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Yes.    Eskom South Africa.    Yes.    I was appointed around August 2011 until the Board’s term completed on the 8 t h I think of December 14 when the new board was appointed.      That is right.    Yes.    Yes I did.  I was reappointed.    Once again as Chairman.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    No I did not specifically find out.    From them.    But I had an understanding of where probably they – their mind was living at the time.    No Chair I do not connect my…    First appointment with that statement.    You must remember that statement has other connotations but not in reference to my first appointment.    Yes.    I was non-executive.    In my case no I was not interviewed.  The – I suppose the Minister just took the decision that she did not need to interview me – I do not know.  But I was not asked to be interviewed.    Chair no I do not.  I have not asked any of the Board Members if they were ever interviewed.    Yes I was present here yesterday.  Yes.    Correct yes.    Chair I did attend the induction.  I was present.    The formal induction – there was an informal meeting of the new Board Members with the Minister in her office in – sometime in December.  Shortly after the Board Members were appointed whereupon the Minister indicated that she would like there to be an induction of the new board and that this would be taking place sometime in January.  Because we were at the end of very much of the year and so there was very little going on and people were going on leave and holiday and so on.  So the induction was then arranged for January.  If I recall I think it was somewhere around the – if not the 16 t h January.    2015 yes.    Yes I did.    Yes what normally happens Chair is that at the end of the previous year I normally sit down with the Company Secretary and work out dates for Board Meetings for the following year and this is done in consultation with the Board Members to make sure that they will be available for those days and once that is completed then this is published in the company roster.  So the dates are fixed at the end of the previous year for the following year.    The first Board Meeting in 2015 was scheduled for the 26 February 2015.    The meeting did not take place.    What happened is that on the evening of the eve of the meeting 25 t h.    That is right.    At about eight, eight thirty in the evening I received a phone call from the then President of the country President Jacob Zuma and the President asked if I had – well first of all he stated that he had been trying to get in touch with the Minister – my Minister at the time being Minister Lynne Brown and he was not successful and he tried to find the Deputy Minister and he did not find the Deputy Minister either.  And ultimately, he found the acting DG at the time was Matsietsi Mokholo.  And he then said to me that he has asked that the meeting tomorrow not take place.    On the 26 t h yes.  Then he said I will be contacted by the acting DG in regard to that.  But he is just giving me like a – a forewarning if you like that the meeting is not going to take place.  So I simply thanked him for the call and waited for the phone call from the acting DG who then did call.  So I was told by the acting DG that the Minister had asked that the meeting be postponed.  And that is how the meeting got postponed.    I did ask the acting DG what the reasons were for the postponement of the meeting because I would need to give those reasons to the Board Members and she then responded to say that the Minister did not give her any reasons for the postponement of the meeting.  So she did not have any reasons for it.    No Chair I did not ask him.    The reason I did not ask the former President was because as Chairman of Eskom I really do not have any formal business with the President.      Well the way I saw it Chair was that my fiduciary responsibility rested with the Minister and I – I felt that I needed to ask the Minister if she does not give me any reasons.    I would agree with you entirely Chair.  I did not understand the reason why I got a message from the President to this effect and my position I felt that I needed to raise that issue with the Minister.    I do concede Chair that I could have asked him.    Why the meeting – why he wanted the meeting postponed but I – I clearly would still have felt that in terms of my communication to the Board I would have had to have consulted with the Minister so that she can then show me exactly.    From my perspective Chair at the time I was dealing with the issue.  I wanted to be certain that I follow what I understood to be my fiduciary responsibility.    I wanted to follow what I understood to be my fiduciary responsibility.    With the Minister.     It was strange, Chairman.  Let me put it to you in another way.  If, for instance, I had not communication with the DG who purportedly spoke on behalf of the minister, I would have authorised – I would not have postponed the meeting.  Let me put it that way.     Postpone the meeting     Yes.     Because my view would be that the president does not have any jurisdiction in terms of that determination.     So my asking me, for me was neither here nor there, if only to learn perhaps what reasons he had.  But because I felt that he had no jurisdiction in my responsibility, if I had not heard from, as I say the DG, I would not have cancelled the meeting.       Yes.     No, she said the minister asked that the meeting should be postponed.     For the reasons, for it, yes.     No, she did not give me any reasons.     Saying to me that she was not given any reasons why the minister has stopped this.     I did ask her if I can get in touch with the minister.  The whereabouts... the minister’s whereabouts.  She said she did not know.  She tried the minister herself and she could not find her.     No.     No, she was not part of the... she would not attend meetings.     That is correct.     No, she was not invited.     [No audible reply]      My understanding is that Chair, the MOI of Eskom does authorise the minister to request board meetings to be either postponed or changed or cancelled.     Well, Chair I am not certain in terms of whether she can only request a postponement on the basis that she was going to attend the meeting.     No.     Yes, I do not have the capacity Chairman to make that analyses.     Yes, Chair.     I understand the point.     Yes.     Ja.  I understand.     Yes, I am there.     Yes, it was.     Yes.     Yes, essentially, what I was trying to convey there was that the meeting should not take place but obviously I knew at the time that the only thing that will happen is a postponement because this one of the ordinary board meetings which has a specific purpose at that time of year and has to take place.  So needed that this meeting needed to be rescheduled.       No.     No, not at all.     No, sir.     Not at all.     Yes, Chair.     That is correct.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  At that time of the year, we would have just dealt with the mid-term results of the company and ...[intervenes]      At the mid-term financial results.     And the auditors would be preparing the financial statements for the company ...[intervenes]      Because the financial was about to end at the end, in fact, the end of the following month of March.  So the board would have to discuss the financial result and it would be presented by the auditors.     Ja.  That is one of the key aspects.  The other thing was.  What Mr Matona had discussed yesterday.  There was a process which we started to engage the management to look at the strategic outlook for Eskom for the next several years.  And that occurred between the time of the resignation of the previous chief executive and the incoming, namely, Mr Matona.       So he then arrived with some groundwork which have not been done and he then went on to work further on that exercise and he was going to present that to the board.  So that was to happen.  So some of the more important issues.   There could have been also a discussion planned for the tariff application.  I am not sure whether that year was the year for tariff application but there could have been.   If indeed it was, that issue would have had to been talked about around that time as a continuation of what was determined in the previous year.     Chair, to be quite frank.  No, I do not think so.     No.     Yes.     Yes, to the extent that I felt the idea for postponing the meeting was rather strange and rather sinister.       The financial year-end would be the 31s t of March.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I do recall that there was an attempt for a road show which was typical around that time.     And I know that the FD was very keen to make sure that we make progress on the situation regarding the statements and I did speak to her.     Yes.  I was saying Chair that I did speak to the FD.  And I think, if I remember well, I was trying to ensure that we will find time to go back and have the statements presented to the board for the board’s approval but because of this intend to cancel this meeting, this was not going to happen on the 26t h.  And she says here that that I was receiving pressure from outside.  I probably said to this specifically what had actually happened.  And she is maybe not putting it the way I put it to her.   I think she was being, I guess, modest in putting it this way.  And I understand that.  But at the end of the day, what happened was that the company secretary sent out a notification to all the board members indicating, you know, the formality.      Chair, I do not mean to be disparaging in any way but I did tell to Molefe that I felt that the president sounded like he was pressuring the board to take this decision.     He was pressurising ...[intervenes]      Yes.     In other words – yes, in a kind of a bleak way.     That is the conversation that I had with her.     That is where the pressure came from.     But I am sure I told her that I finally got, you know, the contact from the Deputy DG, saying that the minister had asked that the minute meeting would be postponed.     From the acting DG, yes.     Well, I told her Chair that in view of my understanding of the authority that the minister had, as I said previously, then we would go ahead and postpone the meeting.     I said in view of the – my understanding of the authority that was rested with the minister ...[intervenes]      ...to be able to ask that the meeting be postponed or cancelled, I exceeded to that request by her.     I think it is in the MOI of the company.  I think so.  I stand to be corrected.     The Memorandum of Incorporation of the company.     Yes, I think that is where it is stated.     H’m.  H’m.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No.     985?     Yes.     Yes, it is evident that it is not explicitly stated here in the MOI, Chair.     Yes, I have always understood that there was such a provision.     Whether it is in the Eskom internal documents.     That could be the case.     I have always understood that that was the prerogative the Minister had.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, alright.     Yes, sir.     Yes, sir.     That is what it says, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     No.     Well, the right thing would be to find the earliest opportunity to do just that.     To find the earliest opportunity, Chair.     I am saying that the thing to do then in that situation is to find the next earliest opportunity to do what was meant to have been done at that particular meeting that got cancelled bearing I mind the requirements, the timing, you know, of particular decisions..     Yes.       Chair, like I have indicated, it was my understanding at the time that the Minister did have that authority and that the Minister provide the reasons at some date, at some later date.     So the board can have an understanding of what was happening.     I understood to be a request from the Minister.     Yes.     Yes, the board could have said yes or no.     Not to the same degree of detail, yes, but in essence that is what I said.     Chair, I …(intervenes)     The majority response was yes, accept that the meeting should be postponed.     I would be hard-pressed to remember if there were dissenting voices.     They would probably have responded back to the company secretary.     Yes.  What I did get, Chair, was at the next time the board sat, there were some board members who expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that that meeting was postponed.     Being given, yes.     Yes, I see that.     No, it is not the 26 t h meeting.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I am not so sure, what is the question?     No.     Yes.     No.     No.     Correct, yes.     Yes, we did.     It was the 9 March.     Okay, the meeting of the – you know, with the 9 March, I stand to be corrected, Chairman, I think it was [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes.     It was the 11 t h, not the 9 t h.  So two meetings, one after the other, the one that is in fact referring to the issues that Ms Molefe was talking about would have been the 11 March not the 9 t h.  Yes.     Yes, it was, it was, it was fixed by me because it was a request once again to deal with the issues that were not dealt with as a result of the postponement.     Of the 26 t h, yes.     Minister was not consulted, Chair.     No.     Yes.     Yes, there was.     Okay.  Chair, that meeting came about as a result of my visit to the residence of President Zuma on the – I think the 8 t h, 7 t h or the 8 t h.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.      Yes.     Yes, that is correct, Chair.     Yes, that is correct.     With Minister…?     No, the issues that I raise …[intervenes]     The issues that I am raising, Chair, in relation to my relationship with the Guptas, are varied on that I simply point out where I met them, where the interactions took place and so on.     So …[intervenes]     Yes, I can certainly do that.     My first encounter with the Guptas I seem to recall was at the ANC January 8 t h statement which took place – or function, which took place in Nelspruit.  I see to recall it was 2014.  Maybe I stand to be corrected, I am not sure hundred percent that it was 2014, but…     In any case, at that function I happened to be seated – I was requested to sit at a table where the ANC’s top six were seated together with two of the Gupta Brothers, myself and Chairperson of the SABC because we were – we had provided some sponsorship to – or some support to the …[intervenes]     Yes, to that one, Chair.     And that is the first time I got introduced to two of the Gupta brothers, two of the older brothers.     It was a dinner.     Yes, a fundraising …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes, I do, it was Ajay Gupta and Atul Gupta.     It was just us.  There were 10 sets and there  people.     And the Chairperson of the SABC.     Ja.     It was Ms Tshabalala.     Yes.     I think so, Chair, because she spoke briefly, she had some brief words during that function.     Well, we were introduced to one another because everybody had a name tag so whoever who you did not know you introduced yourself to that person.  So that represented the first time that I had a face to face encounter with them.     Yes.     Short sharp and quick.   Chair let me just reflect back Chair, you may recall in previous testimonies that were given here by myself and others when we talked about the TNA matter at this time Eskom had added into one of those TNA contracts.     So what happened was this – and this normally happens when the – in the course of these TNA contracts; Eskom took an opportunity in consultation with the TNA people who were running the contract to showcase the 49M program and other Eskom issues at this particular gathering. Now you may be aware Chair that at some of these gatherings what happens is that the ANC invites business people to take up spaces, to take up tables in an organised business environment where business people are then able to interact with government officials who attends these functions including members of the executive where there is this networking that goes on.             So essentially because the ANC is the governing party it is assumed that it is a networking opportunity for business people to network with the African National Congress Ministers and other senior members of the organisation.  So it was from the perspective of the TNA contract and the opportunity to expose Eskom as part of the program that Eskom had including the M49 program.  With that management asked me to attend and speak on behalf of Eskom at this function and in fact I address the function dealing with specific issues that were problematic at the time particularly the load shedding issues.             So though it would appear as if this contract was targeting support for the ANC the idea that we were advancing and my understanding of what management was wanting to do was to give Eskom the opportunity through my presentation at this meeting, at this dinner and to profile the company and give the opportunity for us to reach our customers through the media that was provided by the SABC.         Yes.        What I understood at the time was that Eskom was in fact and I say carrying out the contractual relationship between itself and TNA and this particular platform was one of this platforms that the TNA contract was addressing.  Whether it is a forum where someone from Eskom is able to participate and give a profile.       It was an ANC dinner, yes.       Yes.       Chair this might have been a breakfast itself I might be wrong myself.       Yes.       Yes.       Okay that is fine.        So Chair I think if you view it from the perspective of how the TNA breakfast themselves were being conducted it would seem to me that this was a similar format because the people who were predominantly present in this particular function were not necessarily ANC members.  In fact, there were a lot of business people who…[intervene]       So the idea then was this was another forum where the TNA and – or the 49M contract then had an opportunity to express itself in the same way that it was doing so at the breakfast meetings you know that you are aware of.  So that was the essence of it.       I cannot really say for sure Chair.        That is the one that I can remember, yes.        Chair it is not about, it was not about the networking with business in our case.      We were leveraging you know the communication opportunity that we had with our customers via the SABC network to be able to put across whatever messages we wanted to put across because of the availability.          I do not know Chair; I would not - I have not heard of it.  I have not heard of any…[intervene]       Chair I do not believe that there was any specific benefit to the ANC in this process.       There certainly was not.       Yes, I do not recall that there was anybody other than me from Eskom who was present but I do not know.       Yes, that is a common practice, yes.       Yes, from our perspective Chairman what we saw was a platform for us to reach our customers which was...[intervene]       We do and we did.       But on this occasion I think the presence of the SABC was an advantage that we saw because we would ordinarily be charged by the SABC for them to give us a platform.  So there was that benefit that we recognised.       But I say that was the thinking at the time.       Yes.        That is not correct Chair.       I think the interpretation of what is written here is not correct.  Let me correct it.       As I said Eskom was not there for any purpose other than to exploit the platform that the SABC provided for us to reach our customers.  That was the basis upon which I was asked to go and present at that function.  As far as I am aware there was no tables that the company had bought but I stand to be corrected.  I did not know of any such nor was I told that we had bought any tables but what I knew was that we had this TNA contract and the purpose of the contract was to be able to facilitate the use of and create an understanding in our customer base of the use of electricity through the 49M program.  So…[intervene]         It is a fundraising event for the ANC that is true.       What is possible Chair, what is possible is that the ANC could have received funding from the contractor who is TNA themselves.  It could well be that the TNA could have contributed some money as its own contribution and then in the process we then get involved as a partner of the TNA.  But I am not denying the fact that it could be that Eskom could have paid something.       But I did not go there with the intention of supporting…[intervene]       What I say to that chairman I am not aware of that I was never made aware of that.       I was never told that there was such a contribution.        And I think it’s possible that one can – this can be discovered in fact did it happen or not.        But my thinking at the time was that the likelihood would have been that TNA themselves would have used the Eskom contract to contribute.       Yes.       Yes.        Yes, a different person yes.        Yes.        Yes.       Okay the one occasion…[intervene]       On this particular occasion it was sometime in 2014 it could have been around sometime in the middle of the year.         2014, yes it was sometime in the middle of the year.       What had transpired is that there was a request from our company that wanted to supply gas to the Eskom open cycle turbines which – are based in the Western Cape and the idea would be once Eskom has converted those units which were now firing with diesel into what they should be gas firing.             Then the idea will be to bring in gas into the Western Cape, get a contract with Eskom for the two units to supply gas and use that as an anchor tenant to then get into the Western Cape’s business, gas business.  Now the evidence is here that Tony Gupta had that there was such an opportunity and I said to him look I do not know anything about that.       Yes, we were talking face to face I met him at the Saxonwold residence.       Yes.       It was at Saxonwold.        Yes.       Yes, Chair.       Yes, he wanted to find out if we can assist him with facilitating a contract with Eskom.       So that they can supply gas to them.       So when I then found out what was happening, I reverted back to him and…[intervene]       Yes.       Okay as I said he asked for the assistance for the supply of gas to the OCGT’s like I said and I said look I do not know anything about that and he in fact is the one who said that there is an opportunity for that business.  So I said look I am not aware of that I can find out from Eskom what is happening in that regard and it was a very brief discussion really to say look I do not know anything about it I can come and find out and get back to him.             I subsequently then enquired at Eskom and what I was told was that there was a company which had raised the same discussion at Eskom and they were then directed to speak to the Department of Energy because the way that process is done is through an MOU which MOU is signed with not with Eskom but with the Department of Energy.  That I conveyed to him that that is the, as far as what Eskom gave me.  So it is not only that it is out of Eskom’s hands it is a matter that he would have to raise with the Department of Energy, let alone the fact that it looks as though someone had beaten them to that.  So that was the one encounter which I had with it.    I think I called him yes I think I called him Chairman.    I do not recall going back to – to that.    I think I just phoned.    Chairman I cannot specifically say why he – I did not ask him.    To come to my office.  I do not recall that I had asked him to come to my office.    Yes.    Well Chair there was no discussion in the sense that there was no debate as to whether he should come to my office or me go to his – his place.    Because I knew that they – the tendency for them is to ask I know that the tendency for them is to ask that the meetings be held at their place.    Chair it was – it was common knowledge amongst the government officials and people who had reason to interact with them that they certainly have the occasion of the President and were close enough to the President to threaten people with – with Baba as they call him.  They did the same to me.    At some point.  So I suppose they felt that if they had that kind of leverage with the President, they could demand whatever they wanted to be done and that be done or else there might be consequences.    That was common knowledge.    Chair I got a very distinct impression that the – this guy specifically Tony Gupta not only had no understanding of processes but he had no appreciation and I think could not really care less.  All he is interest was is the person who he perceives to be in a position of authority and a position of power to deliver whatever details that they – he wanted delivered was the person he would focus on.  And the processes of approaching the organisation through the operational and correct channels he was not interested in that.  So it did not surprise me because he certainly had no regard for processes.  Especially when we talk about the way they responded when in fact I was unable to assist them in specific instances.      Well I did not really engage myself with that issue because I understood that they have this notion that they can operate with impunity at levels of government.  And so engaging them in process-oriented discussion about who they should approach and who they should not approach was a useless exercise because they did not believe in that.  They did not understand that and they were not interested in dealing in that way.  Of course, in my response to issues that they – for example I will give you another example just to deal with your question.  Chair there was a time when the same person Tony Gupta had wanted a particular individual to be employed by Eskom in a position in procurement.  There was a position on the establishment list of Eskom of a Chief Procurement Officer.  And he wanted me to assist him to get – well that person to get that position in the company.    This is 2014 yes.    So he thought.    Yes.    In fact he did not refer to it as a vacancy he said there is a position.    And he wanted that position for his – for his candidate.    So when I discovered …    It was once again one of those visits I had at…    Yes.      Well I know that it was….    Probably the second half of the year yes.    Yes.      Yes Chairman.  He called me to arrange another meeting to come and see him.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    I do not recall the name but I know that he mentioned that the person was at the time working for MTN.    Yes.    I said to him, look I know nothing about that.  I mean I am not in operations so I would have to ask the people in operations if they can assist you.  And I said to him ordinarily there would be an advert for that position and that your candidate would have to apply like everybody else.  I thought he was essentially looking for – what shall I call it? – some sort of support at the process where the candidate is now – has applied and is being considered – is being evaluated.  I thought that he was interested in that sort of support.  Well I discovered …    I do not remember specifically Chairman.    But I was convinced that he was looking for me to pull strings for him so to speak.    But I suppose not knowing what was actually the situation he maybe did not know what to say because I said, look I do not know the situation I would have to find out what is going on.    Yes correct.    Yes and what I established was that not only was the position on the establishment list of the company but the position was in fact not advertised.    It was not advertised.    It was vacant yes.    It had not been advertised.    And that is what I told him.  I said to him well the position not been advertised and so there is no issue.  You would have to wait until the position gets advertised.    I stand to be corrected here Chairman but I think I subsequently heard much later after I had left Eskom that that individual did in fact go and work for Eskom.    That is what I understood.    Yes.    That is what I ultimately heard yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.    Chair the third one has to do with the TNA contract.  You will recall Chair the last time I was here that we raised the issue of the irregular expenditure which occurred at the instance of Colin Matjila who was at the time the acting Chief Executive of Eskom.  This was now I would say around October – no it was a little bit before October.  Just before Mr Matona came into the …    That is right yes.  And on this occasion, I met – remember I met him at his Saxonwold office – I mean sorry his Sahara offices.    Yes.  I was on my way to a meeting in Pretoria.  And …    Correct.    Then at this meeting he asked me what was the problem with the contract that Eskom had signed with them – with TNA?  He hears that there is a – some problem to do with this contract.  So I told him I said, the contract has been entered into irregularly and that there is an inquiry in fact a forensic audit to establish precisely what had happened and how to remedy that situation.  So he said to me, look you are the boss why – you can make thing go away.  And so once again it reinforces the mind-set that I spoke about earlier that they have in terms of the structure of the organisation and how it works and processes and all of that stuff.  So I told him that in response that first of all I am not in operations and secondly even more importantly this particular incident irregularity that has been picked up of its own triggers a series of events which I would have no jurisdiction over such as you will be aware the audit trail and also the formality of reporting this incident not only in the financials of the company but also reporting it to the audit authorities.  So the essence I told him then that there is nothing I could do or anybody else for that matter could do to assist in this regard.  This issue has got to take its course.  And as I reported in the last time, I was here Chair that for the first time I noticed that he was visibly angry or upset.    Upset with me – with my response.  So that was one of the …    Occasions.    Yes.    Chairman this is an interesting question because you know the – as I said earlier that there was a well-known situation regarding them insofar as their relationship with the President.  And there were – I had heard of instances where people were supposedly threatened by them if they were not able to at least give them whatever assistance they felt that they needed and that they would report them to the President whom they referred to UBaba.  And they seemed to have this authority about them.  And I think it is – I suppose something that if one looks at what influence they are capable of exerting then it is clear to me that responding to their requests and their needs whatever it is that they want to have done is something that would cause them to feel that a lack of such of response would be in a way once again disrespecting UBaba.  So the one operated with the thought that you were at the – the behest of people who if you are not able to assist them you are in fact going against the wishes if I may put it that way.    Of the President.    Yes.  Because of their…    Essentially that is what it is.    So I felt that meeting them was not a critical issue.  What was critical for me was whether I was in a position to subscribe to what it is that they wanted to do and whether in fact it was within my purview or my authority to do so.  That to me was really the critical issue.    Yes.    There is an element of intimidation yes that is true.  There is an element of intimidation considering the fact that they have the relationship they had with the President.    Chairman I think it will be – it will be correct for me to think considering what subsequently happened to think that I would have incurred the displeasure of the President if I had did not respond to them in the manner that I did.  And I think what might have happened is that I might have either been reprimanded by the President or might have been asked to assist them when they want assistance.    Which I know had happened with – or supposedly it happened with one of the colleagues in government.     Well, that was partly one of the things that, you know, rested in my mind because I heard of instances of people who supposedly because they did not cooperate, if you like, with them.   They seemed to have had some difficulties.  And we have heard of stories of members of executive who had suffered their faith, supposedly.   And, you know, people talk and the mill goes around and they raise these issues.  So in a way, they had themselves a reputation of being able to use their position to jeopardise people’s positions in government to the extent where people may have – to be dismissed from their positions because they were reluctant to interact with them.     Okay.  At that meeting... Okay, let me just step aside and say.  Chair, this was about the time of the SONA in February of 2015.  And I was in Cape Town attending the SONA.  It could have been a day or two before then.  And sometime in the later morning or towards the middle of the day, I got a phone call from Minister Brown who asked me to come and see her in her office of which I did. And when I got to her office, she was in fact preparing to go into parliament or something or to another meeting.  And I did not even get a chance to sit down because we spoke and she was already about to leave.     At her office.     In Cape Town.     Then the minister then says to me    Yes.     Yes, the board had its induction.     Yes.     That is precisely my view, Chair.  There was no basis for them to have that attitude.     Because I have not started working with them.     The way the communication was set up is the DG and the chief executive would be the ones who would communicate.  And then I as chairman would communicate with the minister.       That was the setup.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Chair, as it turns out, at the time when the minister called me to come and see her, I was in fact with Mr Matona in a meeting of the portfolio committee.     Numbers.  We were having sort of a workshop.     I left that meeting to go and see the minister.     That is correct.     I then went back to that meeting.     And of course, I then seized the opportunity to ask Mr Matona what is going on.       And he knew nothing about that.     He had never complaint to the minister.     Yes.     Yes.     That is precisely what she said to me.  That is pretty much what happened, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     Exactly.     Chairman, I will have to preface my response to you by saying that I do not have any concrete evidence that I can that this is what happened but deductively I can piece together where this came from.     Okay.  The way I reasoned this is that ...[intervenes]      Sorry.     There is a time when I had received a letter from a company called Sumitomo when I was chairman to Eskom.     Sumitomo.     Sumitomo, yes.  And this would have been around the beginning of Ms Brown’s term, I think.     June/July.  Somewhere around there.     2014.     And Sumitomo had – what they were – they addressed the letter to me as chairman, requesting my assistance in dealing with the matter with Eskom which they were at a point they felt they are not making progress with Eskom in the matter.  That is a matter to do with the reconstruction of transformers.     Of transformers.     Yes.  This is a Japanese company.     And as usual, when something like this happens, I ...[intervenes]      What essentially was happening was that Eskom had asked Sumitomo to construct or to build transformers for them for a specific purpose and that they would then give Sumitomo a permission to go ahead at a certain point and this was not happening, apparently.   So in the interactions with Eskom, Eskom was not able to come to an agreement with them about proceeding with the contract or proceeding with the construction of these transformers. Then when they wrote to me, they asked for my assistance in trying to resolve the issue with Eskom.  So as normal, I then spoke to the chief executive and I said there is this letter from Sumitomo and the person who is ...[intervenes]      It was ...[intervenes]      I cannot remember where it was Brian Dumas or it was Mr Matona.       Yes.  Then I asked the legal people who were in my office.  I told them that this is what had transpired.  I have asked the organisation through the chief executive to give me a response.  So I then had a conversation around that issue with Engineer, Matshela Koko.  And then it was him who was taking responsibility to respond to this matter. Now in the course of this whole programme and the time to respond, there was some delay that was occurring and I did not understand what the delay was all about. Eventually, I received a response from Mr Matshela Koko which response I then gave to the legal department and    Sumitomo.      And then I responded, signed the letter and the letter went off.  Subsequent to that ...[intervenes]      The gist of my response was that the - if I recall well now, is that Eskom would has reviewed the Sumitomo situation and would be getting in touch with them in terms of what the next steps will be including the possibility of sending someone there to go and see what is actually going on. Now what then happened subsequent to that was that one of the individuals who was involved in this matter – and I got to understand this simple because of the incident that took place – was a man called Mayisela(?) Sekasindi(?)     Now this process took some time and by the time letter gone off, I think by that Mr Matona was in the office.     Yes.  So I then subsequently heard that I was being blamed for this matter and that I had a hand in it and there was a complaint which was raised with the minister.  Now the minister did not specifically addressed this particular issue with me.     No.     No, she did not.     So when I tried to piece everything together because I have been told that this complaint was raised by Matshela with her.  It is at this point when I realised that the possibility is that the source of this particular issue is Matshela Koko.       It was the only one I could think of, Chairman.     Yes.     Yes.  So as I say, that is my piecing of what could have transpired.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do Chair.     Yes.     Chairman, I am absolutely certain she did not tell me the incident.  But deep down I knew what was going on.     Because of what I described just now.     And the irony of it is that, the person who raised the complaint to her is the very author of that letter which I was then cleared to sent to Sumitomo.  So I am just baffled.      It is Matshela Koko who in his capacity as the Executive for Commercial and Technology, he was at the time the Executive for Commercial and Technology, so it was in his area that this matter was fixed.     To this?     Chair, I think that I stand very firmly by what I had said in terms of the engagement with the Minister though I see in her affidavit she says that she cannot recall the – what the exchange was about and I also must immediately correct what I see here in her statement on 2 where she says …[intervenes]     Paragraph 102, yes.     Where in the middle of the sentence it says    In the form of transformers.  So I think …[intervenes]     That might have some other connotations, other [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Let me go back to 104, Chair.     And state very categorically that the Minister is uninformed in respect of the staff complement in my office.  I had one individual who I brought into my office as a senior general manager, I had a PA and those were the only people who were directly reporting to me.  I had the entire organisation at my disposal, so I could have had – I could have been accused of having the entire management and my behest.   But the fact of the matter is, all those people had their own reporting lines but I had access to them because I was Chairman of the company.  So I did not have 11 people, I had two people in my office.  The rest of the people were people who were availed to me through the office of the Chief Executive because that is who, in the main, the people I dealt with reported to and so whenever I needed something, the Chief Executive would make it easy and at times would simply – I would simply contact them directly and, of course, just later inform the Chief Executive what conversations I have had with these people.  So this is not correct.     I was not even an Executive Chairman, for that matter.     The other one, Chair, in 105 in regard to the media.  Well, I think the less said about that, the better because I expressed my opinion in a media interview and I would like to refer to that particular matter when we come to it, Chair, because we will come to it.     Because it has a bearing on my removal from Eskom.     Yes, I will certainly remember.     Correct.     I am page – 441, sorry?     Sorry.  Yes, 441.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Chair, the assertion by Minister Brown in item 67 where she says she does not have a recollection of a conversation with the then President Zuma – or was it 68?  I am sorry, about the cancellation of this meeting.  I cannot really speak for that but what I am certain about is that I was called by Ms Matsietsi Mokholo, speaking on behalf of the Minister.  So I think …[intervenes]     Yes, correct.     Yes.     Correct, yes.     Yes.     Correct.     That is correct.     So I think the onus is one former Minister Brown to check up on the communication between herself and Ms Mokholo.  That it is really I can say in that regard.     Yes.     Yes, we will deal with that.  The memo that I sent to her is in fact dealing with the whole question of formality that I would – I had requested her to put it down in writing that she had in fact asked that the meeting should be postponed.  That is what this memo is about.  I just – it reminds me actually now that I remember that is what I had written to her about and asked her to formalise the postponement of the meeting.     This was specifically on the advice of my own team that that is what would be required to do.  I suppose then that would be addressing what is in the MOU there.     Oh, their lawyer, so they must have known, I mean, they look after this.  ADV SELEKA     Oh, I do not know, I would not know what it is.     I would gladly share it but I would not know what it is.     Chairman, the possibility is that I would have been advised by my team to immediately write to the Minister.     You know, to confirm that she had said I should postpone the meeting.     So in all likelihood it could have been on the very same day of the meeting, that same Friday when the meeting was supposed to have taken place or whatever the date was.       Can I ask, are we back to my affidavit now or will we stay with this one?     Oh, okay.  Chair, the meeting of the 9 t h has a particular history.     Now I would have to detail how the meeting came about.     To answer your question as to what is the nature of the meeting.     Okay, so the answer to the question was it – what kind of meeting was it, it …[intervenes]     No, it was not a scheduled board meeting, most definitely.     Yes.     Chairman, what happened was that on or about the 7 t h or so of March 2015, I received a phone call from Dudu Myeni and Dudu Myeni said to me that the President, Jacob Zuma, requests an audience with me and that audience is to be immediately at his residence in Durban.  I recall very distinctly because I was due to travel out of the country to – some invitation I had the very next day and unfortunately, I had to cancel those plans in order to attend this meeting.   I would like to say right from the onset that I understood Dudu’s communication with me as that of someone who has been sent to ask me to appear at the President’s residence for an audience with the President.   I then asked her what is this about?  She then declines to discuss it over the phone and said I would hear about it when I get there.  Then I – it was fixed for – I am assuming the 8 t h, it was a Sunday.  The 8 t h was a Sunday, I am not sure.  It must have been a Sunday.     No.     Okay, so that then – I then made my way to Durban on the 8 t h and I arrived at the Presidency.      It was for around – it was in the early afternoon, very early afternoon.     Could have been around one o’clock or so. I arrived there and I found Ms Myeni there together with her son, a young man named Talent.     Yes, it was her son and Nick, a gentleman named Nick Linnell and we then were briefed by Dudu Myeni as to what the purpose of the meeting was.     To my recollection, Chairman, I am saying I found Nick there but I see his affidavit, he says that he found me there.  So I…     Ja.     Yes, but certainly the other two were there when I arrived.     Yes.     Yes.  Well, she then made the statement to the effect that there is a concern about the performance of Eskom, the technical performance and the financial performance of the company and that there needs to be an inquiry into these problems at Eskom and further to that, that there are complaints from the war room that Eskom is not providing accurate information and data to the war room, that information is chopping and changing and in the process it is advisable that certain executives within the company be suspended in order for this inquiry to proceed unencumbered by their presence. I was hearing this for the very first time, I was just totally shocked and I expressed my concern to her that …[intervenes]     The meeting had not started.     She was just briefing us ahead of the – it had not started yet.     So I was quite taken aback by this and I protested about the idea of the suspension of executives and that really was my – centre of my concern.  The idea of an inquiry was not new to me for the simple reason that I myself had at some point in the previous year mentioned it to some of my colleagues, the board.  I did not really discuss it as a board issue but we were – I think we were at some breakaway somewhere, I cannot remember, where we were sitting as board members in a social environment after the board meeting where I was saying, you know, it could be something to think about, that we need perhaps an independent assessment of what is actually going on at Eskom just so we have, you know, the benefit of someone who is not involved in the business to tell us what it is that they think is happening.  So it then says that I was not opposed to the inquiry but I was taken aback by the way the whole thing came about.  Okay, Nick made some statements, comments as well, to the effect that, if I can recall, Chairman, that – in fact it is Dudu who mentioned that Nick had supported at SAA, as she was then Chairman of – Chairperson of SAA, and he is available to do the same thing for Eskom.  So I was then at this point anxious that we should have this meeting that we were called for just so I can get a sense of really where are we, what is going on.   We then went into the meeting, the President joined us as we sat there waiting for him and then the meeting commenced.  Again Ms Myeni introduced the subject and the discussion was primarily led by her as to what are the issues that are causing the concern with the performance of Eskom.  She seemed to have some knowledge of what was transpiring at the company at the time.  Nick also came in, in terms of his experience, what he could offer in the situation and I was concerned, and I raised the concern again of the impact of having to take the drastic action of suspending the executives in a situation like this because you want them not to impede the process or at least that is the rationale. The President was not very engaging in the meeting, he asked a few things, why the call – one of the things he asked and hopefully Nick, when he comes here, will also be able to assist with the recall.  What I do recall was that the President asked if I knew who the people were or are who are to be suspended?  So I said well, the names of the people were mentioned by Dudu Myeni and she mentioned the names of three people.   At that point she mentioned the name of Tshediso Matona the Chief Executive of Eskom, who was here yesterday.  She mentioned the name of Dan Marokane.  Marokane who was the executive responsible for what we call Group Capital, that is a new-build programme and the name of Matshela Koko who, as I said, was the executive for Technology and Engineering –Commercial and engineering, sorry.   Or commercial and technology it was called at the time. Then I then interceded  at some point to say I would rather that we explore some methodology within the HR system of Eskom of recusal rather than outright suspension, because suspensions have other consequences, and perceptual issues about them, the reputational issues about them and so on, so I was very concerned that in the light of no apparent wrongdoing even at that point on the part of the people whose names were mentioned that there could be a reputational problem occurring. So, the meeting concluded with the President saying that they would like me to go and test this proposal with the Board as soon as possible and that he would inform the Minister about this and that.  So that was really the sum total of the meeting that took place at the presidency.     Chairman that comes from me.     Chairman there is something that I observed in the way the President style of communication it was not the first time that I noticed this, I noticed this in some other occasion, I think, when I was in his presence, I think, in a meeting. He normally goes through some pleasantries at the beginning, he’s a very affable person as you might know and then in this instance for example, after that, he then asked [African language].     Which say, what are we going to be talking about today…[intervenes].     Yes, which I have observed is a manner of communication that the President engages in, for whatever reason, I don’t know but it’s a style issue, I think, that I’ve noticed with him that it would be as if he does not know what it is that we are going to be discussing and I would want to think that he would not accede to a meeting unless he knows what it is that’s going to be talked about.     Correct.     Correct.     As far as I can recall Chair, as I said, he did ask, certainly if I know who the people are and as I said towards the end of the meeting he intimated that he would inform the Minister and he would request that I go and deal with this and that or test the Board’s interest in doing this exercise.  I don’t recall very much, it’s been such a long time, I don’t recall very much else of what he said, I’m hoping that the next affidavit or when he comes to present, he’ll be able to assist.     I would say – it’s not that, that meeting was an obvious Chairperson, you know, the President came in and he sat down and he did more listening than anything else.     And Dudu spoke most of the time.     Yes.     So, I can’t really say there was a specific person Chairing.     Chairman, first of all, I am inclined to think, and I don’t know what makes you reach there maybe, that the President must have been privy to this.     There’s no doubt in my mind really, that he must have been, it’s unlikely that he would sit in such a meeting not having been privy to this.     No certainly not and also, I think from Ms Myeni’s perspective I was very surprised that she didn’t know much about what was happening at Eskom and that – proposing, making such a radical proposition is something that she could have come up with, I don’t believe that – it originated with her, definitely, I don’t believe so.     With Ms Myeni?     No – well let me put it this way, the only interactions we had were the exercises that were organised by the previous Minister, Minister Gigaba, where on, once every sort of quarter or so he would call all the heads of – the Chairpersons of the and the Chief Executives of the parastatals under his, what have you, that’s the only real interaction we’ve had.     But otherwise, no, we didn’t normally have any interaction.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     When we left I had a conversation -  we were out of the meeting, I had a conversation – I must indicate also, something else that has just come to mind now.  Nick, amongst the things he was saying in the meeting was that he has the experience of having worked – assisted at SAA and that he would be ready to put together a motivation for the inquiry and that it will also contain – he would also do a resolution for the Board to resolve to carry out this inquiry.  So, I then said, look I will try the best I can to see if we can have a meeting as early as the following day which was Monday the 9 t h and when I got back, Nick had prepared these two documents we’re talking about and I then communicated with the company secretary to say, look, I’d like to invite Board members to a special meeting of the Board to deal with this matter and then he then circulated the invitation to the different Board members for the meeting the following day.  So that’s how the meeting of the 9 t h came about.     Actually Chair, I had thought of using that meeting of the 11 t h but then I realised that it will be good to at least get the Board – because my intention was, when I left the meeting in Durban was to make certain that the Minister ’s, views are heard on this matter because this is something that will impact on the shareholder.  So, I wanted to test to make sure that the Board is onboard with this so that we can get the shareholder to come and address the Board as soon as possible and possibly on that meeting of the 11 t h.  So, I thought, let me fast track and let’s meet on the 9 t h to sound the Board out and then find out if we can get the Minister to come on the 11 t h.     Chair, I think you – he’s a bit ahead of me there.     Remember that on the 8 t h, this was now the Sunday, that is the day that we circulated the documents and the invitation to this Board meeting on the 9 t h which is the Monday.  Now, what Mr Matona was talking about was what he observed had transpired in the meeting itself. Now I have not addressed, personally, what I saw in the meeting what actually transpired from my perspective, which is what I’m doing now to say, Board members came for that meeting and they were not – let me just say the overall impression Board members had was that they’d been asked to do something that is very big and very, shall I say…[intervenes].     Might have far-reaching consequences without really having adequate time to think about it and investigate it and equally importantly for them, they need to have the shareholders ‘views on this matter. Now, I was very sympathetic Chair, in respect of those views and I was one of the people who did say that when I thought about this after I’d been to that meeting in Durban, I was of the view that the first port of call should be a meeting with the shareholder to share this because this is something that was important for consideration, even by the shareholder.  So, yes indeed, there was a lot of discomfort about making any kind of decision on this matter and I accepted that because I thought it was the right thing to do so that people have more clarity and get a feel for what this may entail given the fact that they only heard about it that very morning.  So, that’s then what happened, hence the meeting of the 9 t h, was a short-lived meeting like Mr Matona said, and I agree with him entirely that, that was the sentiment.     Chairman this is a question which I did not address at that meeting but it’s something that preoccupied me for some time, to the extent that I actually decided to call her, to ask her – well actually what’s going on, where is this coming from, how do you come into this picture, what’s the deal and Dudu did not avail herself for us to talk about it.  So, I just said to myself, well I take the view that even though she was the messenger in this instance, it’s still material as to how it is because she’s not conducting herself as a messenger in the actual meeting itself. Though at the time she, purportedly, was speaking on behalf of the President to say we should come to the meeting.  Her conduct in the meeting was someone who had more of an involvement.     Yes, that logical sequence does make a lot of sense Chair.     I mean there’s a lot of credence in what you’re saying because just analysing it that way, leads one to the conclusion that she’s the architect of this.     Though I still do not believe that she is in my own…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes.    No, I’m with you there.      Yes.     “After some pleasantries, the President  enquired what was up for discussion, which I translated from Zulu, whereupon Ms Myeni began by saying that the performance of Eskom financial and technically is deteriorating to the extent that there is a serious concern that the company could fail to meet its obligations to supply electricity to the nation”.     My assessment is – it’s not a rhetorical question, I mean the President knew what the discussion was about.     Oh, from that perspective yes, I hear you okay, yes.     Chair, that is why I was saying that, I did not believe that the President did not know what was to be discussed.     I can’t say. I can’t really say Chair, because as I said that is the way I’ve observed his manner of dealing with situations.     Yes, I hear what you’re saying.  If I put myself in the President’s shoes, maybe if you came along and asked me, did I know about what was to be discussed, I turn around and say, well I asked what the discussion was about, so I did not know.  I don’t know, I’m just playing it back in my mind to say, maybe that could be the approach, I don’t know.     Yes, I hear you.     Chair I was, as I said very uncomfortable with the idea of suspending the Executives and secondly I felt that it’s one thing for me to listen to what the President has to say in this regard but it’s another for me to exercise my fiduciary duty as a Board – as a Director of the company and that’s exactly what I elected to do.  I decided that this matter has got to past the test of reason by the Board and if the Board had decided flat out that, we’re not going to have anything to do with this, that’s the end of the story, that would have been the end of the story because that’s where my fiduciary duties reside, irrespective of what someone else, including the President might have asked, to be done.     Yes.     From our Executives, yes.     Yes, I did, most of them.     No, not at all.     No.    Certainly.    Expels the idea.    She drew that conclusion yes. Yes.  Yes.  So that looks like she initiated this idea of an inquiry that she was now presenting at the meeting on the 8t h.  Am I right?    Chairperson – yes.  She presented the idea I am not exactly certain whether she – well maybe I do not understand quite the – your interpretation of initiating.    Yes.    Yes.    I hear you Chair and...    My interpretation Chair is the following.  Whilst Ms Myeni is not the architect of this idea.    She is now the exponent of the idea.    And she is communicating the idea which has been given…    To her.    So from that perspective.    She can be seen to be the person who initiated the proposals.    After all we have not heard from the original architect of this in my view.    Yes.    yes.    Chair I have – I saw this and I have been wracking my brain as to why it is that I do not recall that Jabu was at this meeting.  Because I know Jabu.  I would have known if I walked in here obviously, I would know him.  But for some reason…    Maswanganyi.    Yes I know him yes.    Chair I…    I do not recall seeing him in the meeting.    For some strange reason I just do not recall.  When I saw this from Nicks affidavit I was taken aback and I would have – I would certainly have – have noticed him.  I do not recall.  I do not even know whether he had anything to say according to Nick.  I do not know.  I have not scrutinised the affidavit just now but I do not recall that he was actually in the meeting.    Yes.    Quite.  Chair I can – looking at this I cannot – it just mystifies me that I do not remember his involvement in the meeting.  You know there could have been a situation where he was not in the meeting with the President.  He might have been in the meeting we had with Dudu – the briefing meeting outside.  So I do not know what – which of these two meetings Nick is referring to.    That I do not remember either.    I would remember yes.    Yes.  That is what vexes me I just do not understand why.   I do not.  Especially if he happened to have documents from Eskom.  I mean I would have been very curious to find out how he got hold of them.    But certainly I just do not remember.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair there is no reconciliation.  I said the same thing that I am certain that the President knew what was to be discussed.    But…    Yes Chairperson.    That is my belief.    Correct.    Indeed Chair it is – it is strange.    Indeed.    Exactly.    The War Room was headed by the then Deputy President who was the current President.      No he did not Chair.    Yes definitely.    Yes.    No.    Not at all.    I do not know why he was – he was at the meeting.  No he did not make any contributions.    No.    I think Nick must have gotten my number from Dudu because I did not have a number of his.  And I do not know about this business of – I do not recall him asking me for documents nor would I have given him in any case.  So I am not sure where he is going with the idea that – I do not recall him asking me for documents.    No as far as I was concerned I was meeting him for the first time.  I do not recall having had any discussions with him.    I do not recall him even calling me because I did not have his number.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi Mr Linnell has provided also a statement to the…    125?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    The actual meeting with the President could have been about forty minutes or so.      Something like that.    Not more than an hour.    Ms Myeni – yes.    Chair I was in a state of semi-shock most of the time.    Because I just could not believe what I was hearing.  So I – I was just flabbergasted.    To say the least.    Yes.    Yes certainly.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes certainly the first time Chair.    Yes I do recall Chair which is how I got to forward the documents to the Secretariat for them to circulate to the Board Members.    Yes.    Yes. ADV SELEKA    No, no this is not an Eskom email address.    No that was my own private email address not Eskom’s.    I did not get the beginning of your question.     No, I did not make anything of it.  What was important for me was the formal communication that I needed to make to the board.  That is what was important to me. At this point in time, Nick was merely telling what he is thinking he ought to do.   So there was no significance in using Eskom email here because he was really addressing himself to me and you know, I then would have escalated to the communication to Eskom once I was satisfied that that is what we are going to do.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct, yes.       It is Phukubje Malesela.  Malesela Phukubje.     Yes.     It would have been – maybe there is a receipt of this docket.     I would have been Chair on - upon receipt of these documents.      Yes, same day.       Correct?     Yes.     It was a rescheduling of the meeting of the 26t h of March.  So in that sense ...[intervenes]      The 26t h of February, yes.     Yes, I made contact with the minister.  Whether it was on the 9t h or the 10t h, I cannot exactly recall but I made contact.     Yes, regarding the meeting of the 11t h.     Lynne Brown.     The reason Chair was that the board surmised that the action that are being contemplated in this resolution would have had far reaching effects on the organisation and would impact on the shareholder’s role in different ways.  Primarily because the War Room was a government initiative.   So in order for us to not to conflict with the work of the War Room, we knew to be certain that the shareholder will support us doing what – not quite essentially what the War Room was doing. But certainly not of contradicting or undermining the work of the War Room but that, this was a separate but terrible exercise that Eskom wanted to undertake.   So there were those sort of, if you like, policy issues.  If I may use that word.  Or let me rather, protocol issues which we needed to...     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I am familiar with the email.     Correct.     It is probably... I think it would have been a letter, I think.  That would have been the cause of action, we want the minister come to the meeting.  We would ordinarily write.  I would have – I cannot exactly remember but that would have been the position.     I think the minister was expecting the invite.  The reason I say so Chair is because, when the minister was leaving the meeting, I accompanied her out of the billing as I ordinarily do.       Chair, there are two things that I recall that the minister herself would wanted to talk about with the board.  She took the opportunity to raise them.  And I remember very well, one of them was the security of board meetings.   Look, as our board meetings were being typed and so she made some queries around this.  I cannot remember exactly what else but the minister would tell us.  But there was one or two other issues that she dealt with before going into this particular matter.       Chair, what happened then – what was trying for that the board meeting to discuss the company matters would be the first order of the day from the morning and we anticipated that we could complete Eskom’s business by the time the minister arrives.   So we planned to have the minister come into the meeting close to lunch time.  And I if I recall well, substantive issues were dealt with before the minister arrived.  And of course, it is an in-committee meeting that the board had with the minister.     The small bundle starts at 900 and something,     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     You are talking about ...[intervenes]      Chair, I am the understanding the minister to say that in accordance with the way she understands her relationship with the board, it does not permit her to give the board an instruction.   I am not so – I do not know.  I think that is what it meant.  I cannot imagine that she would say that without trying to emphasise the fact that she does not have the authority to instruct the board.      In other words, as a prelude to what she is likely to say in relation to say this matter that she is aware of?     It could be.  I cannot really say, Chair.  It could be.  It does not give me any specific thinking that that could be the case.     Yes.  Oh, yes certainly.  She knew what the meeting was about.  No question.     Yes, I understand where you are coming from.  Yes, definitely.       The minister did discuss the establishment of an inquiry with the board, yes. ADV SELEKA     Yes, Chair the minister supported the establishment of the inquiry.     Yes, the minister did discuss the suspension of the executives with the board.     She supported the suspension of the executives.  In fact, more than just that.  She added one more executive to the list which ...[intervenes]      Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     Yes, it did not change my thinking.  I was definitely opposed to the suspensions to the extent that, I recall I wrote a summary of the discussions in the board because there no minutes that have been taken.   I asked one of my staff to make a summary of what was being discussed.  And throughout that time, we were making reference.   And this was now to circulate to the board members.  This was – we emphasised the fact that the idea is for these board members to step aside.   And in fact, the meeting that followed the minister’s meeting was really the crucial meeting in respect of the matter of suspensions which I will certainly get into if you will allow me.     The normal board meetings are recorded, yes.  But in-committee meetings are not recorded.  That has been the practise in the company.  But minutes or notes are normally taken by someone who we asked in the meeting to take notes because the normal recording infrastructure is not available for recording because people are excused from the meeting.     Chair, I am... that meeting was not recorded to the extent of the – when I say recording, we are talking about the audio recording.     A digital recording.  No, it was not.  There were just notes which I also say, as I say, I also produced of the meeting.     Absolutely.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes, that meeting was recorded.     Hold on.  The meeting after the minister had left?     That would have been the people in the governance meeting in the afternoon.     Yes, yes.     Okay that was the people in governance meeting and that was not recorded.      No.     Yes.     Yes.     Oh, so there is a recording of the people in governance meeting?     Oh, I was not aware.     Oh, I understand the question now.     I did not understand it at the beginning.  You are asking me if the meeting with the Minister changed my view about whether we should suspend executives or not.     No, it did not change my view in my recollection.  All that happened, Chairman, was I insisted on some methodology of recusal.     On some other methodology or some other process of recusal of the executives rather than suspension because I felt suspensions were not a good idea.     Yes.     Yes.     And it turns out that there is not – there was not the process at Eskom which would ensure that the executives do not have the normal access they would have to the offices other than precautionary suspension.     Chair, I think the feeling amongst board members was that there is no way of knowing whether in fact interference would have happened.     Yes.     As far as I know, the executives would expect to assist with the inquiry.     The idea was that they would be subject to some interview on specific issues that come out in the process of the inquiry.  That was the idea.     Well, it is difficult to say, Chair, what was living in people’s minds about that but there was a general acceptance that it is easier and more justifiable that they not be present at the time of the inquiry so that you do not attribute anything that you may find to them or to their having interfered.  There is a possibility that – or this is what would have been in people’s minds, I would have thought, that they could have either prevented access to certain information  or they might have interfered with their staff in terms of what the staff can and cannot say or that the staff would have felt inhibited to express themselves about what they know about the business if their bosses were there.  This is the kind of thinking I believe must have motivated that approach.     Yes.     Chair the decisions ...[intervenes]      The decision pertaining to the matter at hand were that SMS does support the inquiry to proceed and that we should seek an independent company or contractor and that she agrees with the suspension of the executives concerned.     Yes she mentioned, she also added the name of the FD.     She mentioned the name of the FD.     Chair no I did not have any discussion with the Minister.     Oh, okay in terms of requesting her to come we did make a memo to her.     Chair I know there was talk about the inquiry but I can’t recall exactly whether there was mention of the suspension of the executives.      I don’t really.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes, to me she definitely appeared to understand.    Everything yes.      It is 692.       Yes.    Chair I honestly I cannot recall ...[intervenes]      I don’t recall ...[intervenes]      I was very concerned Chair about their own personal reputations.     And the damage it might do to their careers and a lot of things around perception.     And even though we readily said that they are not being accused of having done any wrong but perceptions are perceptions and individuals suspended people will always attribute that to something even though there is no ...[intervenes]      That is the sort of thing that I had in mind.     Yes on the basis of something like special leave, but the impression I got was that Eskom does not have that sort of ...[intervenes]      So I mean I related then and it is important for me to state Chair that I relented because I had the absolute confidence that for as long as I am there, I will make sure that they return, that they are not prejudiced in any kind of way.  That was the sort of back-stop for me in my mind to say that I will make sure that nothing untoward happens to them.     Because I was convinced that – and by the way another thing that is important to note at the time when we were dealing with this matter there was no intention of even investigating the executives themselves.  This was – I don’t know exactly where this was made clear but I recall that we had the understanding that at no point is there an intention to investigate them in the course of this inquiry to stick to the terms of reference which deal with the objective condition of Eskom in terms of the issues that are problematic, and not individuals themselves.     Yes.     Well Chair in that respect let’s not forget that ultimately after I left Eskom, as a matter of fact at the time I was dealing with my departure at Eskom already the terms of reference, and Nick was out of the picture and so they then put a set of terms of reference I knew which I was not involved in at all.    So the possibility for me is that some of these issues could have then been brought in at the time when I was not involved in the consideration of the terms of reference, I never attended a single meeting because these things happened after I left.     Yes.     Okay so we – I would have made the differentiation personally between their management style in terms of what they are able – for example the decision making typically for example the head of Generation or the Chief Executive decided okay we are not going to do the maintenance for three months because there is a requirement that we must analyse on under any circumstances. Now that decision was their decision, would the one that would reflect on its capacity to handle the job.     Whereas I was talking myself and in my mind was the thought that there is no malfeasance per se in that it is just a question of not making the correct decisions.    Yes.    Otherwise I do agree with you.     Yes.    That would be part of it yes.    Yes I was aware of that.    The Board would have raised that I cannot exactly precisely say at which sitting of the Board.    Probably I just say I do not know which sitting it would have been.  Maybe it was not at the sittings that Mr Matona was …    I cannot remember right now.    Yes.    Yes.    That will be correct Chair yes.    I do not recall – I really do not recall having raised it with him.    But certainly, I agree with you the fact that the only substantive Board Meeting dealing with Eskom’s facts and issues.    Was one on the 11 March and that did not come across.    From what I understood the War Room was interested in as current information as possible.  And a lot of the stuff had to do with what is going on with the load shedding.   Now I do not know if you recall just to give you an example of the kind of complexity that they were dealing with.  The incident that occurred where the previous – most recent previous Chairman of the Board Jabu Mabuza supposedly gave information about load shedding to the Deputy President or President I am not sure and things changed and he was said to have misled the President or Deputy President.  Now it is that sort of things.   There were so many changes occurring in the organisation that when executives present information which they believe represents the true situation then something else comes along and changes so they have to go back and change the information.   So for them to explain I guess or rather for the War Room to understand which is part of the problem with War Rooms.  The understanding of the complexities of the operation of Eskom.  It was difficult – the engagement was very difficult because the majority of the people in the War Room were government officials.   There were DG’s and of course Ministers.  So there was that gap in my – in my view until they started to bring in people who were technically conversant to support the War Room.   Things got better at that point because you know the technical people began to understand what the difficulties were. But at the beginning those were the gaps understanding the complexities and the – you know the sudden changes that occur in operations in the organisation.    But I think that – that I understood where the problem was.    Yes.    Yes I understand what you saying.    Ja I understand what you say.    Yes.    Yes I – I prepared this in February so at the    Let us just see.  It would be after.  This would be the pre-MG meeting.    Chair the Board deliberated on the issue of whether the executives should not or should be away from their offices during the course of the inquiry.  And if I remember well the idea of them not being present resonated with most of the Board Members.      The idea of them not being present in their offices resonated with me but under conditions which were I think reasonable that would not prejudice them in their positions or in their work.    The Board as I said earlier Board Members were concerned that there could be influence.  There could be influence brought to bear by the executives when they are in their offices on the issues that are being inquired into.    In my view it was a concern of the Board.  Hence the Board a decision that they should not be available at their offices.    I – I cannot speak for them because they have made their views clear in the meeting.  So I – the question you are asking me I really cannot answer because they engaged the meeting and they gave their views.  I can only assume that they have had experience elsewhere where they have been of this sort of thing.  So I am not assuming that knowing the Board Members and person or maybe knowing how they work was a consideration on their part.  I do not necessarily think that could have been the case because they expressed themselves quite clearly.    Yes as I said I personally felt that I do not want to see a situation at the end of the inquiry or in the course of the inquiry where there are questions that have been raised that certain information was not available because individuals were not in a position to provide that information as a result of some influence that is brought on brought to bear on them by their bosses.  So you know when we said precautionary suspension, I understood literally that we are being precautious in terms of ensuring that nothing would be impeding the work of this – of this exercise.  The work of the inquiry.  That is – that was my understanding – my view.    At the same time I was comfortable that the executives have nothing to lose because not in terms of what may occur when they are not in their offices and that – as I said Chair that this was a temporary situation where I felt that they would be able to come back and after that and sure that they come back to their offices at the end of the inquiry.    The resolution was discussed and Board Members had very specific views about it to the extent that in the meeting the Board agreed to have Mr Linnell assist the two different committees.  The PNG committee in working on the suspensions and on the Audit and Risk committee on the Terms of Reference.    Chair I found myself in exactly the same situation that you were addressing now at one point – from a certain point onwards.    I can just – Chair if I may just quickly deal with that?    I do not know whether in this recordal there is a discussion of what happened when we – at the beginning of this meeting.    If what I saw – the little I saw reflects the beginning of the meeting then in terms of the recordal that was not the actual beginning of the meeting.    But to the best of my recollection Chairman when I arrived – what happened was this.  I took the Minister out.  She left.  I came back.  I went to have lunch and I was behind because most of the people had had lunch already.  And the meeting started about half past two and I came to the meeting a little bit late maybe about ten or so minutes late.    When I came into the meeting the meeting was chaired by it is either Chwayita Mabude or Xhosa one of the two I cannot exactly remember but in my affidavit I thought it was …    Sorry.    People in governance yes.      I thought it was chaired by Chwayita or it could have been chaired by Mr Xhosa.  When I arrived at the meeting the discussion that I found was about the executives who were supposed to act.    Now I discovered that there was a list of executives that had been produced from somewhere and these were the people who said it was said would be acting.  The first thing I did was I asked where do those names come from.  And I was told by Ben Ngubane that these names came from the Minister.  Now I protested because I said none of you people know who these people are.  I am the only person in the room who knows who the people –      Who would be in a position to act.  And I said clearly wherever these names come from the Minister would not know either.  They can only come from within the executives ranks.  So somebody in the executive must have given these names to whomever and they have ended up in this meeting.  So there was this predetermination except for the acting Chief Executive there the suggestion was that Xhosa should act as Chief Executive.    He admitted that he felt that this was – he could not handle that responsibility.  So I – I said look there is no reason why you should if you feel that you cannot do it.  But at the end he did become the acting Chief Executive.    Because the committee decided that no he will be – he will take the position that he needs to and he must take it.  So I think he relented on the insistence of Members in the committee.    Yes.    No Chair this is a board sub-committee meeting.  The meeting on the …    Was with a full board.    It was a full board meeting as well.    That is correct.    Yes.    The board meeting had ended with…    No.  Was recommending suspensions.    Yes and also mandating the people in governance committee to carry out the suspension process.    Which is what the meeting was about.    That is correct.    Yes.     Yes.     That is right.     No.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, they told me, as I said, Mr Ngubane indicated Chair to me that these are names that were provided by the minister.       Yes.     That is correct.     Ja.     Yes, I do.      Quite certainly.  That the board members would not know the executives.  They did not know it at the time.     Yes.  Thank you, Chair.     That is my voice.     Yes.     That is Ms Carrim.     [No audible reply]      [sigh]  I...     Oh, it is in the minutes.     It is an N Carrim.  I do not know whether it is...     The initial is N.     It is Carrim.  C-a-r-r-i-m.     I think so, yes.     Chair, yes.     Because the other ladies, I would... yes, there were only three ladies in the meeting.     Three.     Yes.     That is Norman?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     It sounds like Dr Ngubane, yes.      No, I just call him the Ambassador.     A lot of people referred to him as the Ambassador but... I called him that.     Sorry, Chair.     Dr Ngubane.     Yes.     Yes.     So he... that is the next voice, Chairperson.     That is Mabuda.     Ms Mabuda.     Yes.     [Indistinct]      Sorry.  As the board, I would not know because I do not believe that the board dealt with his particular ...[intervenes]      Oh.     This is a people governance committee meeting and Mr Baloyi’s objection were not raised.  He did not raise any objections during the board meeting when the issue of suspension was discussed.   I think it is the first time that anyone is hearing from him about whatever reservations he may have.  He is expressing them in this meeting.       Oh, I am sorry, Chair.  So this recording is of the board in-committee meeting.  Okay, no that is fine.     I did not realise that ...[intervenes]      It is correct.     I cannot say specifically Chair whether the board had any – took any particular – maybe it will come out as we go ahead with this.  But I do not recall there be any particular focus on his views about what should happen.  I think he was expressing his views like anybody else.     The board did not deal with his reservations.  The board just expressed... Norman must just express his own view.     The discussion continued.     As they were saying different things.     And he was one of the people who had a view.     Which was expressed to the board.     I do not recall that.  And we will find out as we go ahead what happens.     No, Chair.     [No audible reply]      Yes, Chair.     Yes. 
TSOTSI: I do not have any formal business relationship with the President.   The position would have been Chief Commercial Officer.   That would be under exceptional circumstances.  That is correct.   So the discussion was about the performance of the Executives, as against any misdemeanours so to speak. 
COUNSEL:  It is rather short, thank you Chairperson.     I have been at pains to try and avoid what I have no choice but to do now.    Firstly, we just want to place on record that Minister Lynne Brown’s statement was not provided or at least had not been received by either Mr Tsotsi, the witness, before he started his testimony, nor us.     Secondly consistent with Mr Tsotsi’s evidence so far ...[intervenes]      He is not, he was not aware that there is a transcript of recording for some of these meetings that now we are going to get into.     Let alone that neither he or I are aware that there will be a recording that is going to be played invariably where he would be asked to comment.     Now there is no issue from where I am sitting of that happening.    The only problem is that we expected that he would at least be given an opportunity to go through statements and recordings that he would be expected to comment on.     So that he does not run into the temptation on responding to an issue out of context if he had the benefit of reading the entirety of the document.     And therefore, jerk his memory properly.    So hence I am rising at this stage to say in all fairness my submission would be that he be granted that opportunity to go through and then this exercise that is intended can then be proceeded with at least with the benefit of having looked at the statements.     I am happy Chairperson for ...[intervenes]      I am happy with that approach, the only challenge I anticipate, which I am trying very hard to avoid, for me to feel the need to have to jump up and object, I hate that when it is done to me, I don’t want to do it.    I must make this point, whilst you took the 15 or so adjournment I was at pains to try and rush through the recording which my client clearly indicates not only was he not aware that it was recorded, he sees this for the first time, I could not myself finish it in that period, let alone that he had to go to the bathroom, so where I am sitting and I will be guided by the Chairperson, it could assist the  Commission’s work much swifter if he simply was given chance to read and then prepare himself and help my colleague as he leads the evidence by being just on point on the issues.     It is fine, Chairperson.  I just need to indicate, I intimated to my learned colleague that I will require with your permission to re-examine Mr Tsotsi.     And secondly that to the extent, if possible, that these statements that we have not had sight of ...[intervenes]      So that when we come tomorrow, at least he is ready.
