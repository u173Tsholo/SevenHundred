CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Soni, good morning Mr Molefe, good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    Okay, alright let us continue.  The oath that you took yesterday Mr Molefe will continue to apply.  Thank you.    One second.  I do not know whether this distance is enough.  Do you want to sit a little further?  Ja, okay.  I am – no I do not think further that side I think further that way.  I am trying to make sure that there is enough social distance.    Between us.    Yes. Yes Mr Soni.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Just one second.  I just want to check maybe both you Mr Soni and Mr Molefe you might just raise your voices a bit.    I want to check with the transcribers.  Are you able to hear everybody?  Oh, they give a thumbs up so they can hear you better than I can hear you.  But I think let us try and raise our voices a little bit ja.    Okay.  Thank you.    Just place on record again what docu – what bundle we are still on.    Okay you are speaking away from the microphone.    Yes okay and what page do you…    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Soni.  Should we not just have Mashaba’s paragraph 71 read first to hear what he says.    And then Mr Molefe can respond to that version.    I think 72, 73 I think – you would know better but I see that he – he seems to talk about what transpired in that meeting in those paragraphs.    But you can take the – the points point by point.    What – what of course can be done Mr Soni even without necessarily reading the paragraphs except or advise Mr Molefe might wish to refresh his memory is to put to him what his version …    Mr Molefe’s version was and how Mr Mashaba responds to that point by point and then he can deal with them.    Point by point.  That is another way but I will leave it to you how you deal with it ja.    Whichever is convenient.    Yes.    Or maybe – maybe let me put it differently because I think I know what Mr Soni is looking for – this might help.  The – as you understood the position at the meeting the payments that he said he had made to Similex and to Mr Nkosi Sabelo or his company were – was he talking about payments that he was making to Similex and to Mr – and to Nkosi Sabelo Incorporated personally or was he talking about payments that he was making on behalf of somebody else or on behalf of some entity?    Okay.  Okay.    What – yes.    Yes this is what was relayed to you by Mr Mashaba at that meeting.    As having been said to him by Ms Gomes.    Yes.  And during the meeting was there a common understanding between you and Mr Mashaba as to what the reference to the movement was?    Yes.    Hm.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    Is the lighting – is the lighting fine for reading purposes there Mr Molefe?    It is fine.    Okay alright.    Now with reference to that sentence in that paragraph is your version that you never asked this question in relation to him personally or is the position that you never even asked it in relation to Swifambo in case you – you said you meaning Swifambo because he was part of Swifambo and he thought that you meant him personally.    Yes.    In …[intervenes].    Okay.    Okay.  Okay thank you.    Yes Mr Soni.    Would he…    Would the – would the position be that the relevance of the – of any relationship that the ANC may have had with Swifambo would the position be that that relevance if any would have arisen once he said that the payments that he – that Swifambo had made to Ms Gomes were for the movement?  Is that when the relevance of the ANC would have arisen?    Hm.    Yes well what I mean is my expectation is that if you are in a meeting such as the meeting that you had with Mr Mashaba on that day where he was coming to I do not know whether plead is the correct word but to talk to you to say please do not touch my assets.  I have worked hard for these assets without Swifambo you know whatever investigation is done. If in that context and in the context of the fact that you and your board were conducting investigations into allegations of corruption at PRASA if somebody said part of the money that is paid to Swifambo is actually going to the ANC there might be no proof at that stage but my expectation is that that would raise – that would make the ANC and its relationship call it alleged relationship either with Ms Gomes or with Swifambo relevant because you would be saying, well is it possible that proceeds of corruption are going to my movement.  That they may be going to the governing party and therefore you might say, well I want proof of that.  I want – I want to see all of those things because maybe the ANC does not know that this money comes from corruption.  Maybe it does know but this is – this would be a serious allegation if somebody makes it.  That is my – my thinking of what you would think.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja okay.  Thank you.    Ja.    No, no, no I think…    I think we understand that.    You did not ask him. I think the question simply arose because there was the question of – because you said you agreed with Mr Mashaba’s statement that the relationship between I think either Swifambo or Ms Gomes was irrelevant and you said you agree that at that stage that was the term you used it was irrelevant and certainly I thought that what you meant was at a certain stage I had no information about the ANC possibly getting – getting paid or allegedly getting paid out of this therefore it was irrelevant.  But then I was thinking that based on the fact that your evidence is that at the same stage in the meeting Mr Mashaba did say Ms Gomes said, these payments to be paid to her company were for the movement.  I then thought at that stage I would not expect you to think that allegation is irrelevant.  I would expect that you would say, well if what you are telling me is correct then I will be very concerned so I would therefore wait to see what proof there is because my expectation is certainly that if you were to be presented with proof that your movement is being given shall I call it “dirty money” from corruption that is not – that is not what you would like your movement to – that is not the kind of money you would like it to receive.  And that is the kind of thing that if somebody makes an allegation like that that you would like to see there is proof of it.  So I think that is where I was coming from.  But when you said at that stage you became concerned but there was no proof, I was happy to – to leave it at that.  But I want to make sure that we are on the same page.    If I – if I knew another language that you knew I would say speak it but I am limited in my languages.    Accurate.    Yes.  Yes.  No I think that fits in with what I expected would be the position.  Ja, ja, okay.  No thank you.    For... I am sorry.  For what it is worth uh, I just want to say that uh, of course, at this stage uh, we have no proof that money from Swifambo was paid to the ANC.  We... we... we... certainly, I am not aware of anything.   I do not know if there are something in the documents that I have not seen yet uh, but if anybody makes such an allegation, it would be such a serious allegation because...  Not only because it would be wrong for any party but to... to... to... to receive such monies knowingly that... [laughs] maybe I should emphasise it, knowingly knowing where they were coming from. But it would be much more serious when that party is the governing party because part of the questions that many South Africans, I think, ask when they look at the levels of corruption in our country, particularly within the public service, the is SOE’s. Part of the question that they should be asking or are asking is. “who were the people who are supposed to make sure that this does not happen both within government and outside off of government within an executive and outside of the executive?” And uh... and uh, and uh, the question arises whether some of those people or some of those bodies and organisations turned a blind eye because they may have been benefiting. So those... those questions in this kind of investigation that the Commission is doing, we have got to keep our minds open to... to check. is it possible that here, so and so could have done something but did not do something because uh, he or she or his or her organisation was benefiting all because it was friends that were involved and therefore action was not taken. We have to keep our minds quite open for that.  So but I thought I must just mention that at this stage I am not aware that there is any evidence to... to that effect but once an allegation is made it is very important that we... we... we probe. Particularly because the allegations of corruption at PRASA went on for many years without one seeing any uh, um... without... without one seeing the levels going down. Um, and of course, the evidence that you have given Mr Molefe, is very clear that when your board starts to deal with this issue of corruption... I think your evidence says, “we were attacked”.   “We were attacked.  We did not get support from quarters where we expected we would get support.  We were being attacked.  We were attacked for doing the right thing and ultimately we were kicked out”. And uh... well, other people will come and give evidence and we want to know whether what they have to say about this because indeed, if this is what happened it is terrible but they must come give evidence and say whether they deny what you are saying. That in the end, if... when I make my findings, I find that this is what happened, you are right, it is terrible.  It is something very serious.  Okay thank you.  You want to say something?     Yes, yes.  Now that is what I was also emphasising.  That at this stage, I am not aware of any evidence that the ANC got money from uh, Swifambo. Uh, I have only heard evidence of what you are saying Mr Mashaba told you about what his commerce said.  So that is how far it goes. But I was simply saying, you know, one needs to have a look.  One needs to... to probe.  We have got to do the... the... the job that we have been asked to do properly.  Thank you.    At what page?    Yes, okay.  Paragraph 72.    [throat clearing]  Excuse me.  As I understand your evidence and you must tell me if I misunderstand.  The meeting was called by Mr Mashaba.    That is point one.  Point two, the meeting was called by Mr Mashaba in connection with the investigation that PRASA was... the investigations that PRASA was conducting.  That is number two.  Is that right?  The meeting had a link. MR    Yes, his request for a meeting.   ...had something to do with the investigations that PRASA was conducting.    Um, am I correct in also saying that uh, in particular, this request was connected with the investigation that PRASA was conducting that affected Swifambo?    That was correct.  And um, at the meeting, he requests you to uh-uh... uh, he requests that his assets should not be touched as a result of this investigation.  Is that right?    And uh, and he... since he is the one who called... who requested the meeting, obviously he is the one who were... who was going to tell you why he wanted the meeting.    And... and he tells you why he wanted the meeting.  His... and he says he is fearing that as a result of the investigations that um, relate to Swifambo, he fears that his assets might be in danger of being taken away.   Uh, as far as you know, he himself had no business or no business that he was uh, doing with... with PRASA in his personal capacity or though any company other than that he was chairperson of Swifambo.    So... so... so the whole meeting was really about how the investigation of PRASA relating to Swifambo was affecting him or could affect him.    Because he was the chairman.  Yes, yes.  Yes.  No, thank you.    H’m?    Okay.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.  I am sorry, Mr Soni.  I think, go to the page two hundred and...?    264.  Uh...   Un, I wonder whether uh... these documents that were in the envelope are very important.  I wonder whether we have placed them on record, apart from simply saying documents listed in page 26... I am looking at 264.    Is that right?    Then maybe we should just...[intervenes]     ...place on record...[intervenes]     ...exactly what documents were that were in the envelope, ja.    Uh, he... he... he might not need to go to each one.    If he knows... Ja, if he knows.  He has checked already.    And just confirm.    Yes, yes.  Okay.    And this could be the document uh, that we referred to yesterday.  This is the schedule of payments.    Uh, please raise your voice.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja, ja.  And... ja, that... that needs to be done.    H’m.    Yes, I am afraid I also did not pay attention because I was reading something here. [laughs]    Uh, do you want to...?    H’m.    Yes.  H’m.      Well, maybe just... just uh, articulate the question...[intervenes]     ...whether it is the same question or an amended one.    Just so that one understands it.    H’m.    Uh, I am... I... I understood Mr Molefe to say his reaction was of being concern uh but bearing in mind that there was no proof.  He was just getting this allegation.  Is my understanding correct?    Yes.    Yes?    Yes?    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.  H’m.  Ja, okay.    Maybe... maybe...[intervenes]     Let me start uh, with an earlier question.  When you met with... when you met with Mr Mashaba, had you already met with the top 6 or did that meeting with the top 6 happen later?    Okay, ja.    Yes.    Okay, ja.  That... that is fine.     Yes.     Yes, so the thrust of what you are saying about your meeting with the top six is that you spoke to them and told them in general about what was emerging from the investigations that your board was conducting at PRASA but you specifically mentioned certain important contracts including the Swifambo because it was the biggest, as I understand you.  You mentioned, specifically mentioned it and you would have mentioned many others.     Ja, okay.       Oh, okay, alright.  I take it you would have explained to him that you were simply making reference to a report that was made to you, you were not making the accusation yourself about the ANC receiving the money.     I am sorry, Mr Soni and Mr Molefe, you will come back to this question.  I just want to ask something else.  You can look at the page later.  You have just mentioned that your minister – and I think you are referring to Mr Maswanganyi, he was the minister at the relevant time, when you said your minister was member of the cabinet, member of the NEC, is that right?     Oh, Minister Dipuo Peters, oh.     Oh, okay.     The Minister of – ja, alright.  Now it seems obviously every minister is supposed to report to the President about what is going on in their departments so that the President can see whether the department is doing well or not and whether that particular minister is doing well or not because if the minister is not doing well or if the minister is not up to the challenges of the department then the President should consider whether to ship the minister elsewhere or remove her or him and get somebody else who is up to the challenges of the department. So the President would be receiving reports from each minister – he is supposed to receive reports from every minister and probe whether the work is being done properly and I would imagine that also apart from every minister reporting to the President.   So I would imagine that the cabinet has occasion to hear what everyone, every minister – how every minister is doing, what are the challenges they facing in their departments and to see what decisions as cabinet can be taken but then if a minister is also a member of the NEC of the governing party, one would expect that since the governing party talks about deploying its cadres in government and elsewhere, one would imagine that the governing party also keeps an eye on how its deployees perform because it should have an interest in them doing their job quite well because if they do their job quite well and the populace thinks that its deployees are doing a good job the chances of getting elected – re-elected next time are greater than if they mess up in various departments. Now you have been in government – certainly I remember at provincial level, you are a senior member of the ANC, do you know whether what I am talking about does happen?     Thank you.  I feel that it is cold.     I do not know, I think maybe heater here is not a very good – because even yesterday when it got better it was only slightly warmer, I do not think it went beyond that but most of the time it seemed to make certainly me quite cold.  I do not know what can or cannot be done, I do not see Stimela here.  Maybe somebody is listening.  If there is anything that can still be done to make the heater more effective please, somebody should follow that up.  Okay, thank you.  You had asked a question and I interrupted you.     I see that we are at quarter past.     If it is convenient we can take the tea break now then.       Okay, let us take the tea break, will come back at half past eleven.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     We may proceed.  Your mic, your mic.     Yes.     Centrally, yes.     Yes, okay, alright.     Yes.  Thank you.     Bundle D is the one we have been using this morning.     Page 323, hey, Mr Soni?     Yes, no, that is fine.  I see the sequence is that the one at the bottom is 16 December, the one at the top …[intervenes]     The 17 December.  Okay, alright.     I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Molefe, I think what counsel is asking, he is asking for what appears at the top where it says from T Montana and his email address to Maria Gomes and the email address, then there is some – then it says Subject.  I think that is what he is asking about when he says what was the subject of that email.     Emails, ja.     What the abbreviation stands for?  You do not know what the abbreviation that he used stands for?  Ja, no that is fine, I think that is what you mean, you mean that you do not know what this abbreviation stands for.     Yes, okay.     Before we do that…     I notice and I just want to confirm whether you notice the same thing, Mr Molefe, that in this email that you have just read the author tells Ms Maria Gomes or Comrade Sonia, as he calls the person concerned, he tells her about projects that PRASA was undertaking or was planning to undertake, what they entailed, at least in regard to two, he also tells her what monetary value would be attached to them. The one, the first one he says – and the estimate cost of the project is about R12 billion.     The other one that he tells, that is in paragraph 3, he says would be approximately R1 billion     Yes.  Yes, okay, thank you.     Okay, okay.   We you just, for the sake of completeness mention again for the record that that is the email that appears at page 2, at page 323 of bundle D, that is marked RA30 to – ja, that is marked RA30 and it is an email from Maria Gomes to Mr Lucky Montana dated 17 December 2013 at 12.25.     And you have just confirmed that the subject matter is Summary Notes.  The subject matter is the same as the subject matter of the email that came from Mr Montana to Maria Gomes, is that right?     Yes, thank you.  Yes, Mr Soni?     Ja, I am sorry, Mr Soni.  The salutation     Yes.     Yes.  So I guess what you are saying is I do not know about Comrade Happy but when I look at the two emails it is clear to me that the one is a response to the other.     Yes, okay.  Thank you.     No, that is fine.  I just want to go back to something else that we dealt with earlier, Mr Molefe.  When we were looking at certain paragraphs of Mr Mashaba’s affidavit earlier on – I do not remember in which page, but you do not need to go there for now – I noticed that he says in that affidavit that he was instructed by Ms Gomes to make certain payments to Ms Gomes’ entity.  Is that part of what he told you at the meeting that you had with him and other people, that he was instructed?     He was requested.  Yes, okay.  Okay, well, I am just wondering what relationship he would have with her or her to instruct him to make payments to her entities, but obviously you cannot help with that because he did not use that terminology in the meeting.     Ja, maybe it is just the use of language.  Well, I hope Mr Mashaba will come here and then he can explain.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, I am trying to look for Mr Mashaba’s affidavit because maybe it might be helpful for me to…   Maybe I will be able to catch …[intervenes]     I think it is 32 something.     Yes.  I think we – that is fine, we will move on but I think I did see where he seems to say he made these payments effectively – where he says effectively that he made these payments on the instructions of …[intervenes].     Ms Gomes.  But that is okay, I can check that later.     Okay.  Mr Molefe, just before tea you had indicated that you had approached the different law enforcement authorities …[intervenes]     I am sorry, Mr Soni.     I am terribly sorry, I just picked up something that links to those two – which may link and not links but may link to the two emails exchanged between Ms Gomes and Mr Montana.  So I just mention I see that in paragraph 9.10 at page 263, I think that is a – no, I am sorry, that is Mr Molefe’s replying affidavit.     But he says, that is Mr Molefe speaking      “Ms Gomes also told him that she knew the bid to supply locomotives to PRASA was worth billions and she could not understand why 10% of the value of the bid could not be paid to the African National Congress.”     So I do not know whether it is connected with these emails but we saw from the emails that Mr Montana, according to the email, was telling Ms Gomes about projects that PRASA was undertaking or was going to be undertaking and telling her even the costs involved, the value, monetary value of those projects and here you are saying what he told you and you are saying he said he said he met with Ms Gomez and he said Ms Gomez told him that it’s Mashaba, that she wanted money for the movement and Ms Gomez – Mr Mashaba told you that Ms Gomez also told him that she knew the bid to supply locomotives to PRASA was worth billions and she could not understand why 10% of the value of the bid could not be paid to the African National Congress.  You don’t need to comment, you may comment if you want to, I was just saying maybe there is a connection between how Ms Gomez gets to know information that maybe should only be known at a certain time, only by people within PRASA.  That’s what I was saying, that it may be that there is that link but it might not be that it links to this particular one, okay but as I say, you don’t have to comment on it but if you want to say something, I’m not preventing you from saying something.     Yes.     Yes, yes, no thank you.    Yes well this is non-action by Law Enforcement Agencies, well it shouldn’t take long for him to just say, bang, bang, bang.      Ja.     Mr Molefe…[intervenes].     It must have been frustrating to you and the Board to have a situation where you had to even remind Law Enforcement Agencies about what the constitution says about their responsibilities to try and get them to do their job, it must have been frustrating to have to approach so many entities or institutions and functionaries without really getting support for your fights against corruption because yesterday you told us about writing to the Minister and – Minister Maswanganyi not getting the support, writing to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on transport in Parliament, not even getting acknowledgement of receipt of your letter, writing to the Speaker of Parliament, raising these very important issues not even getting acknowledgment of receipt of your letter. Writing to the Hawks laying complaints with the SAPS and the Hawks, excepting them to do their job but them not doing their job then having to go to Court to try and get them to do their job, it must have been quite draining and…[intervenes].     H’m, h’m and it may well be that to the extent that it is said that State Capture involved or entailed paralysing certain institutions so that they don’t do their job properly, that they’re supposed to do.  It may well be that, what happened with your Board trying to get assistance might well – and not getting it and institutions not doing their job, it may well be that it’s a manifestation of that kind of paralysis.     H’m, h’m and I guess that from the point of view of anyone who may have been pursing State Capture and who may have been pursuing the agenda of benefiting from corruption, it would make sense to make sure that the Law Enforcement Agencies would not do their job, even if evidence relating to them – evidence of crime relating to them would be placed before them because whatever they did, if they knew the Law Enforcement Agencies would do their job properly, the chances that – would be that they would be caught and they would be brought to book and – so the idea of paralysing the Law Enforcement Agencies seems to be something that they would really have – that would have benefited them.     Yes, no they will be called there is a – we call them a work stream, there is a work stream within the Commission which consists of members of the legal team as well as investigators that is focusing on Law Enforcement Agencies and included in the Law Enforcement Agencies is the Hawks to say to what extent did they not do their job as part of this paralysis that we are talking about and I know that there have been consultations with senior people within the Hawks.  So it is in the plan that at some stage we are going to look at those things, what the – what I think the investigators – what I’m not sure about is whether they may have appreciated the particular special place that the PRASA cases must occupy in that investigation, namely the PRASA cases – the cases that PRASA placed before the SAPS, placed before the Hawks and said, investigate and what happened so that the information will be shared with them but the information will be shared with them but they are certainly looking at how, for example, the Hawks operated, to what extent were they paralysed who was responsible for that, how did that come about, same thing with the NPA and so on.     Ja.     Yes, yes, no that’s fine I think we – I think everyone understands that we certainly talk about the past what was – what may have happened during that time and certainly, I think, you are right that the new leadership in some of these institutions seem to be committed to fixing the problems that have been there and I think that is why, I think the Commission will be – is getting a lot of cooperation from them – from the leadership, thank you.     I just want to say, of course it was – it must have been an indictment on the executive that a Board of a parastatal, a government entity had to go to Court to get another organ of State to do its job when actually, if you were getting proper support from the Minister responsible for PRASA, once you reported these things to the Minister to say, the police are not doing anything about our cases, we have been – we have laid complaints, they are not doing anything, it would – it should have been the Minister who speaks to the Minister of Police and tells the President this is – the Hawks are not doing their job and then the Hawks should have been talked to, to say why you not doing your job and of course if Parliament was giving you support, Parliament could have called the Hawks to Parliament as well to say, what’s going on, why are you not doing this but to have a situation where taxpayer’s money now must be taken to pay lawyers in order to get an organ of state to do its job when another organ of state is saying, here is a problem it falls under our jurisdiction please do your job.  It is a very strange situation.  But of course, you – you had nowhere else to go by then that is why you had to go to court.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    To answer properly.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  They were not called back later on to say, you have just been appointed maybe you do not – you have not familiarised yourself with what has happened.  Go back, come back in a month’s time, tell us what you have identified as going wrong and what you are going to do to fix it.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Later on yes.    Yes, yes.    Hm.  Not much [intervenes]    Unless, unless.    And if you had not taken the matter to court it looks like not – nothing would happen.  Nothing would – nobody would have done anything.    It would have been business as usual.    What page in the bundle?    202?    Ja.    Ja.    I am sorry just – I just want to.    I think it is before we go there.    They did not answer the substance of your complaint they filed an affidavit taking these preliminary points but the Judge went on to deal with the merits in the matter.  Is that correct?    Did they ask to be given an opportunity if there are – if there are points, preliminary points were dismissed to be given an opportunity to file an affidavit to answer the substance of the complaint.  Or is that something you would not remember.    Yes.    Yes.  Oh okay, okay.  Okay.  Because it is quite strange.    Normally when a party who has been sued takes a – the kinds of points that they took they would nevertheless answer the substance of the allegations on the merits on the basis that if the court dismissing their preliminary points the courts should have their response to the complaint.  Now one wonders whether the reason why there was no response – there was no affidavit containing a response was that whatever they could say was going to be embarrassing to them.  In other words, they did not have a defence to the allegations on the merits that is why they did not put them up.    Yes. Yes.      It is a – it is a – it is an order – it is a very unusual or rare order for a court to make and – and it is made when a court strongly disapproves of the conduct of the party against whom the order is made.    It says   It is a – It may be – it may be a pity if person who did not do their job did not get to be the ones to pay those costs because in the end those costs come from the taxpayers it is the institution that pays.    That it is persons that fail to do their job.  So – but it reflects how displeased the Judge was with the conduct of DPCI.  Okay so I thought I would just mention that.    It reflects very serious disapproval by the Judge of DCPI’s conduct in – in the matter.    Ja.  Hm.    But you see Mr Molefe this is really very serious.  Even when your board had been dismissed nobody can say that whoever the different Ministers of Transport have been after your board had left would not know that there was this litigation that was still pending.  If they were really interested in dealing with corruption and if they were really interested in having the cases that you had sent to the HAWKS being properly investigated and the relevant Portfolio Committee in Parliament ought to have known that your board had launched an application and had since been dismissed.  They ought to have kept an eye on what would the next board do about that litigation.  They ought to have – Parliament ought to have asked where is that litigation now, why is it not being finalised?  They ought to have asked the Minister.  They ought to have called the interim board and asked them about these things if they were doing their oversight functions properly.  And if there seemed to be too much of a delay, they ought to have been interest to say why.  Why are these matters not being finalised?  These are old matters.  So it is as if – it creates an impression as if any corruption connected with PRASA was not supposed to be investigated.  Any criminal cases arising from corruption in PRASA were not supposed to be investigated by the police, were not supposed to be investigated by the HAWKS.  It creates that impression and it is very worrying.  Some of these things I am saying you do not have to say anything but it is just the impression that one gets to say you have Ministers, you have a government that almost [indistinct] says we are committed to fighting corruption.  You have got point help parties that almost [indistinct] saying we are committed to fighting corruption.  You have got Ministers who will say the same thing in – on public platforms.  Members of Parliament, everybody but here is a case from PRASA – here are cases.  Here is a board that has been trying to get these cases investigated.  Nobody comes up to say, this board has been dismissed it had reported these cases let us pursue them.  Nobody does that.  And if the HAWKS do not do anything nobody does that.  The President ought to have been interested to say to the HAWKS, how can the Board of PRASA have to take you to court to do your job?  And when your board is not there the President is supposed to say to the Minister what is happening?  Both the Minister of Police and the Minister of Transport, what is happening about those cases that were reported to the HAWKS?  Why are people not doing what obviously is what they are supposed to do?  Cabinet must be interested in these things. Parliament must be interested in these things.  The governing party must be interested in how its own employees perform their job.  Are they displaying a fight against corruption that the party says it is committed to?  Is that commitment to fighting corruption manifested in how people conduct themselves in performing their job?  It is very, very worrying.  It is very, very worrying.  You may have been doing your job what you considered to be your job but it raised a lot of things because it gave an opportunity to various institutions, various functionaries if they were committed to fighting corruption to join you, to assist you and when your board was – had been dismissed to take that baton and say we want to see those cases finalised.  And if there were people who were not doing their job get them fired.  Because you are employed to do a particular job and if you cannot do it you must not be there.  Now five years later not much has been done about these cases.  And then of course when you get reports that say certain things about certain connections you have got to prove and see whether the reason why nothing has been done has got anything to do with who are being mentioned in regard to certain things.  It is very concerning.  Okay Mr Soni sometimes I say these things that I say that you – you might feel that you have to say something but you do not need to but I think you want to say something Mr Molefe.    Hm. MR    Hm.  Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I see we are at one but I suspect we about to finish.    Is my assessment correct?    Because then we can finish and allow Mr Molefe to – to go.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  So to the best of your knowledge and uh, I accept that you say that your knowledge might not be up to date but to the best of your knowledge, those locomotives are probably sitting somewhere uh, that were delivered.  Sitting somewhere ...[intervenes]     And then those that had not been delivered...[intervenes]    ...uh, remained undelivered because nobody has um, nobody has done anything about these matters after your board had left?    H’m. MR    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.  And uh... and... and the money, I think you said R 2,6 million that had already been paid?    And that was already paid to Swifambo or to...?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    pass it on.    Ja.    Yes.  So that... that is the money that uh, you are saying you... you do not think anybody has done anything to get... to get it back despite the judgments declaring that the contract was uh, invalid?    Yes.    Ms Kweyama.    Ms Kweyama.      H’m.    H’m.    Yes.    [Indistinct 00   H’m.  Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  I mean, certainly, there should be no scarcity of state functionaries and bodies who are interested in that money being recovered uh, from the president through the minister to the relevant DG’s through the board um, to say the courts have made a declaration uh, steps should be taken to recover that money. Uh, obviously, those who have got the money might resist but the fact that they... they will resist is no ground for... for... for people to do nothing, to try and get... get it back.  H’m.    But you know, two comma something billion.  One comma... you are talking lots of money here, taxpayer’s money.   Why despite all of this being well-known to the Portfolio Committee of Transports to members of parliament to uh, uh, the executive, whether the executive at that time was the executive now, why is there no clear action that is known in the public domain is being pursued to get this money back because this is taxpayers money? So that... that is part of the worry.  Why... why do you have five years without an institution having a CEO?  Why interim boards?   I mean these things... these questions just make you think that there may be quite something big behind this whole thing.   This... how... how can... how can there be no visible action to recover R 2,6 billion lost by an organ of state from different functionaries and uh, state organs? And yet we know the people on the ground have lots of needs that they need to be... that need money.  Why does it... what... why... why have this been just left hanging?   Nobody seems to say, “hang on.  We remember what Mr Molefe’s board was doing.  He is no longer there.  But what has happened to that money?”    “Who is following this up?”  Why is it like... like everyone just wants that to be forgotten?  So the... the Commission must look into that.  Who has been doing what and why have they not been doing... who has not been doing what they are supposed to do?   Because, I mean, with the Covid-19 problem, I mean, a lot of money has been diverted from what projects that it was going to... to... to do.   Now all of that money would have been needed but without... even without Covid-19 uh, you know, if... if... if any organ state loses money illegally that should not have lost there.  There should be a clear determination to... to recover it.    Okay.  I guess Mr Molefe [laughs] you may be looking at me and maybe feeling that I am... maybe feeling some frustration that you know about.  [laughs]    Yes.  [laughs]    Ja.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    [laughs] Okay.  [laughs]  Well, I am happy if that is... ja, but if there is anything left we can... we can finalise it.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.  H’m.  H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    Yes, I remember.  Mister, sorry.  Not... do not speak too far away from the mic otherwise the transcripts to the record what is happening.     Well, Mr Molefe, you might not have covered yourself in glory by saying certain things in the eyes of certain people but I think certainly a lot of what you have said needs to be said and in the eyes of those who put the interests of the country first and in the eyes of those who are really committed to serving the public, serving the poor.  Some of the things you have said should make them very happy. Part of what you have said raises issues that I continue to be concerned with as I look at what this Commission is doing and what it should be doing and what areas it should be focusing on and I know that for quite some time I have been placing a lot of emphasis on the issue of the role of parliament in terms of oversight but it may be that part of the problem is that if a senior official within the governing party, for example, is aware that another senior member of the governing party or a leader, one of the leaders is involved in wrongdoing, he or she will be afraid to do what is right and say but you cannot do this and the organisation must take action when you, as a member of the organisation, do this because you are bringing the name of this organisation into disrepute.   He or she may be afraid to take that stand because maybe she needs or he needs that leader in order to progress in her political career or he or she needs the supporters of that leader to vote for him or her next time she wants or he wants to ascend to a higher position or next time he or she wants to have his or her name put in the list of those to go to parliament or to the legislature. And if I am in a parliament and I am member of the governing party and I see that somebody within the governing party, who is in government, who is in the executive, whether the person is President or whether the person is a minister and I know my obligation to hold them to account and I want – I am thinking about doing my job properly, I get scared because that person, if he is President, he is the person that I rely on to make me a minister or to make me a deputy minister, or he and his supporters are the people that I rely on to be made Chairperson of a committee in parliament.  If I stand up and do my job properly in parliament in keeping with the oath of office that I have taken when I became a member of parliament, which effectively says the country first, the people first,  I decide not to do my job properly because I cannot be minister, I cannot be deputy minister, I cannot be chairperson of the portfolio committee if I displease these people if I ask them difficult questions, they are going to ask me, are you a member of my party or are you a member of the opposition?   And if I am a minister and I see another colleague who is a minister, that he or she is not doing the right things, here is a board that is supposed to have enough members to have a quorum, he or she is not appointing those members, the board has to go to court in order to get a job done that is supposed to be done by an organ of state,  I do not say anything even if I am aware because I read about these things in the newspapers because I know that if I raise those things I am going to be unpopular within government, within the executive or within the governing party and I will be limiting my career or I will be without a job if I get fired either for this or for something else because I am asking too many questions.  I am supposed to maybe mind my own business, look at my own department.  I am not supposed to ask these questions. And if I am the President and I see that a certain department is not run properly and that minister is not doing a proper job maybe I will not fire them because they have a constituency that I am going to need when next time I want to be re-elected as President.   If I take action against that minister who has got that kind of support, he or she is going to go out and mobilise support so that when next I want to be elected or re-elected as President, I will not succeed, other people or somebody else will be put up. It may well be that unless these issues are resolved, whatever we do as a country in trying to reduce the levels of corruption significantly, it is not going to be effective.  It may well be that we need a President who is going to be in a position to stand up in parliament and say when members of parliament coming from the governing party do not ask me difficult questions to hold me accountable, I know they are not doing their job and they should not be here. When you do not ask my ministers difficult questions, coming from the same party, I know you are not doing your job but your party requires you to do this job, and it is not a career-limiting thing for you to ask difficult questions to ministers coming from your own party, to your own President in the interests of the country and in order to make sure that these high levels of corruption are brought down. It may be that the country needs somebody who can stand up and say let us start with me.  Start with me.  The more questions you ask me, the more I realise you are a good member of the governing party, you are a good member of parliament. Well, I am sure some will say I am just dreaming, such a thing can never happen but it seems that we need something quite drastic, maybe we need somebody who is not going to be looking at even re-election to start changing things, we need somebody who is just going to say let us do the right thing, everybody.  Let us do the right thing for the sake of the country.  The country comes first.  The people come first.  Because when there are elections, I am sure every political party will tell the voters the people come first but we need to see this in action, we need to see in action, we do not need speeches of how people say they are committed to fighting corruption.   When it comes to this Commission, we also need actions to show that people are supporting the Commission by coming to the Commission to give evidence.   You have come to the Commission, you have come here many times and you have given evidence.  I have no doubt that there are many other senior members of the governing party who know a lot that should come before the Commission who have not come before the Commission. I know there are others who have come before the Commission and we are grateful for what they have done but there are many others, I have no doubt, that have not come before the Commission.  And because they do not come to the Commission, give evidence, to give information to the Commission, they are failing to contribute to a solution to some of these problems of state capture and corruption in our country. But I thank you for the contribution that you are making.  There will be people who will come and they will give evidence and some of them maybe will say that what you have said is not true and whatever and I have made no findings about whether what you say is true or not, I will make findings later on but for the fact that you came here and you said things that you believe need to be said, you have shared with the Commission your experiences.  I am grateful that you had the courage to do that and I just wish there were more people who would come and help the Commission in that way.  Thank you very much, Mr Molefe.  Thank you.     No, thank you very much, we can release Mr Molefe now.  Yes, we are at two minutes to two, I think we will take a lunch break that will go up to three.     Ja.  But once again, thank you very much, Mr Molefe, we really appreciate your having come here and assisted the Commission, I really appreciate it very much.  Thank you very much.     Thank you.  You are released.  We will take the lunch break and resume at three o’clock.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I am sorry Mr Soni I may have missed some of what you have said, I guess you need to remind us which Bundle we are using, which Exhibit and then what page you want us to look at or did I…[intervenes].    Oh okay.    Okay, you go ahead I’ll wait for when you go to a particular page and then – ja.     H’m, maybe what you can do Mr Soni, just for, also the benefit of viewers and listeners and so on, just to re-cap what evidence and what issues she was dealing with when we stopped last time and then announce this is what she will cover today and then you start asking her.    Ja.    Just remember to, once again, just remember to once again mention or identify what the document is and in regard to what matter with reference to the case number and the parties.    You can keep your mic on Ms Ngoye.     Well I know that this is not your affidavit that you are reading from but based on your knowledge of the papers involved in this matter, namely PRASA’s application to Court, are you able to put a time when the deponent might be talking – when the time was when he’s talking about Montana and Ferreira having this discussion, which year and so on, is that something you, based on your knowledge of the papers are you able to say because it doesn’t say here when it was.     You are not able to say?     H’m it may be that when one reads your founding affidavit and reads the paragraph to which this deponent is referring to, one might be able to say it was earlier than a certain event or that kind of – so it might be important to have an idea when this discussion happened, okay.    Yes, so when was that?     Oh okay.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja okay, I think that’s helpful too, if phase one was around 2010/2011 I think that timing makes quite some sense, ja.    Hm.     Did you – did you not cover this last time?    This meeting?    Is that so.    Okay I see markings that I made so I may have made them when I was reading.  But I also thought that I had heard you speak about a meeting where the DG was or acting DG I am not sure was trying to push for the settlement of certain matters.    It did not cover this?    Okay.    Both of you cannot be wrong.  Okay alright.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Did you not earlier on give a different name for the acting DG?    No the name of…    I thought you said a name other than Chris.  I see here they say Chris Hlabisa.    You said Chris.    Oh.  Okay.    I seem to have heard something else.  Well I happened to remember that the acting DG or DG was Hlabisa but…    I heard something different.  Ja.    Oh – oh.    That – ja.  I think – I think that is – ja okay.    Is that under …    Under paragraph 1.2?    1.2A.    April 25, 2019?    Yes I remember that evidence.    You and the then Chairperson were asked by the Minister to make reports and so on.    Yes.    Yes.  But I am – what I want to understand now is whether insofar as Siyangena was concerned at this meeting what it was talking about was the money that they alleged they were being owed being the same money about which you had gone to court and – and you were waiting for them to take the next step as I understand your previous evidence.  It was after you – you went rescission.    That is Siyaya.    Ja.    Ja.    Oh is this about Siyangena?    Okay no I am now concentrating of Siyaya.    Because Siyaya is the one where the former Chairperson got involved.    So I am – so my question is whether insofar as Siyaya was in this meeting or was representing this meeting was that what they were about?    Yes.    But the ball was in their court was it not?    Because you had obtained a rescission.    And they needed to take the matter further if they wanted to.    Ja.  Okay.    Before the elections.    Yes so….    Hm.    Ja.  The new administration is a reference to the administration that would follow after the general elections.    Ja.  Okay.    Before Siyaya approached the acting DG as a result of which the acting DG called this meeting had there been any time after the court proceedings in which PRASA was involved to stop to get the money from the sheriff was there a time when Siyaya came back to PRASA and say, let us talk about this matter?  Or they just went straight to the acting DG of Transport without approaching PRASA again after that period of litigation?    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes, no thank you.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.  So – so the acting DG is effectively saying the CFO of PRASA – is that the CFO of PRASA that you are talking about?    Should settle a claim about which PRASA has gone to court because PRASA believes Siyaya is not entitled to payment?    Siyangena.    Oh this is Siyangena.    You see I have this…    Mixing them up.  Oh are we on Siyangena now not Siyaya?    Oh okay.  Okay.  I am re-orientating myself from Siyangena to – so from Siyaya to Siyangena.    I know.    Ja.  But [African language].  Okay.  Alright.  Yes continue Ms – Mr Soni.    Oh so – so when he was talking – when the acting DG was talking about the CFO verifying the amount and paying he was talking about billions?    And that is the matters which he was saying should not go to court, should not be dealt with by the courts.    Did you understand that to mean Ms Ngoye?    Hm.    So – so if one goes back to you the evidence you gave last time you have a situation where after the Chairperson got involved – well I know that the Chairperson from what you said was really interested in the Siyaya matter.    Not in the other matters.    But you said in regard to her and in regard to the Siyaya matters after she got involved as Chairperson of the Board your department, you and Mr Dingiswayo got side-lined.    And you said that Ms Mogashoa who was PRASA’s attorney.    Told I think Mr Dingiswayo that the Chairperson had said he should not deal with…    With you in – ja.    In regard to the Siyaya claims.    So here now you are talking about Siyangena.    But thereto you are saying that the acting DG of the Department of Transport which is responsible for PRASA calls a meeting at which claims allegedly owed by PRASA to various parties will be discussed but their legal department is excluded.    And yet they will be talking about whether those matters should be settled or not.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja, yes.    Well it is also like even with regard to Siyaya that when the settlements – settlement was entered into it was not just the liquidators.    Who were represented it was people who actually had no locus standi.    Because the liquidators take control of a company once it is in liquidation.    But the claims were being settled…    With people – with lawyers acting for those people.    Yes.  Yes.    Ja.    [No audible reply]     Okay.  No, that is fine.  But the suspension that you are referring to here, is that the suspension separate from... ja, it would be separate from the other one because the other one was during Montana’s time.    Yes.    So was there a second, third, fourth suspension or what?    Ja.    H’m.    Yes.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    [laughs]    Did that give you any comfort?    Ja.    Ja.  So this is the suspension with which you have not dealt in evidence, oral evidence?    Ja.  And we will deal with it some other time.    Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.    Is the reason why you cannot deal with it now because there is a response from somebody or...?    But she was the chairperson of the board at the time?    Oh, oh.    Oh.    So that suspension is related to the development then?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay but.. but I guess that the reason why you cannot deal with it is because uh, she... she must still look at um, Ms Ngoye’s latest affidavit.    And deal with it.    Okay.  All right.    Oh, okay.  And... and... and in part, that... that deals with her special leave or not?    Oh, because I am... I am trying to see why we cannot deal with the suspension part.  Uh...    Or... or the suspension...[intervenes]  ADV SONI    That everyone be complete.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.  Is that...[intervenes]     Ja, ja.  But is that still the same understanding now because I am trying to see whether... because if it is not really related, I would like us to finish the suspension uh, and so on.   If it means that uh, if there was not preparation to deal with it, that... that is fine but maybe she can come back later this week.  I just do not know how... how involved it would be so that we try and finish with that.    I am just keen to finish with that.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is fine.    Ja.  Maybe tomorrow you can let me know?    If... if... if necessary uh, depending on how much uh, Ms Ngoye will have to say on the suspension ...[intervenes]     ...that maybe later in the week, she can come back and...[intervenes]     ...complete it.  Ja.    Okay.  All right.    Yes, thank you.    But I do see that the affidavit it... the suspension is already dealt with in an affidavit that you already have, hey?    That is...[intervenes]     That is with the Commission?    Ja.    So... so the affidavit is there.  It is a question of going through it and reflecting uh, the other.  It is not like a statement must still be taken.    Ja.    Uh, so possible uh, let us continue.  Uh, reflect on it.  If possible, even tomorrow uh, she... she could come in.  I know we have a number of witnesses but those...[intervenes]     ...are supposed to be very short.    So there... there will be time.    Depending what... but later in the week is another possibility as well.    Okay.    H’m.    H’m.    Well, you know uh, the evidence of how the legal department at PRASA was being dealt with, the evidence you are giving and the evidence you gave last time as to how the legal department was being treated, yourself and miss and so on and so on, you know uh, resonates in some way and also how, according to Mr Molefe, how he and his board were treated.    Resonates in some way with how uh, Minister Nene and Minister Gordan, Pravin Gordan in... as Ministers of Finance at different times and how Mr Fuzile as DG of Treasury, how they testified as to how National Treasury ...[intervenes]     ...was being attacked.    Even by the executive at cabinet level uh, for standing for what is right and making sure that things are done properly.    So... so... so when I listen to the evidence you are giving... giving and having heard that evidence uh, I have to remember ...[intervenes]     ...what they were saying about how, on their evidence, National Treasury was being dealt with...[intervenes]     ...and they were being attacked um, even by members within the cabinet.    And I think they said even the former president was uh, um, hostile to the National Treasury...[intervenes]     ...at a certain time.    Uh, of course, I have had evidence also of what happened according to certain senior officials, how Mr McBride, Mr Koven, Mr Seshego, how they said, while they were standing for what is right and refusing to do wrong, how they were suspended...[intervenes]     ...and subjected to disciplinary actions.  They had to go to court.    They had to go to arbitrations and uh, so when I listen to all of this evidence, I have to remember what I have also heard from other departments...[intervenes]    ...which have got nothing to do with...[intervenes]     ...PRASA but similar things happened there.  Um, and of course, I have to also remember evidence that we have heard of um, senior officials at SAA...[intervenes]     ...uh, Dr Dowa, I think is one of the... Ms Moshe was one of them and um, there was uh, miss if I am not mistaken.  They also have stories that they have told before this Commission of how they were treated...[intervenes]     ...when they sought to stand for what was right.    And refused to do what was wrong.    And how some of them were... were suspended for long periods...[intervenes]     ...without any disciplinary hearing.    And uh, ultimately, they were forced into a situation where they had to settle because they did not have enough money to pay lawyers to fight for their rights.    All of these things uh, they seem to create a pattern ...[intervenes]     ...of what was happening.  And... and it is all roundabout the same years.    You know.  Even with SAA, you are looking at around 2015, you know uh, 2016/2017 but other things happening earlier on.  You go to IPAD, McBride... Mr McBride’s challenges.  Mr Koven.  So the years seems to, more or less, be the same years ...[intervenes]     ...when these things seemed... seemed to have been happening.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    Ja, I mean...[intervenes]     H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  Well uh, of course, I should not have uh, not mentioned Themba Maseko. I should have mentioned Themba Maseko as well.    You know.  Because his evidence was uh, one of the first stories that the Commission heard uh, of how he was transferred from GCIS to another department...[intervenes]     ...uh, because, on his evidence, he had refused to cooperate with the... with... with the Guptas.    Yes.  Okay.      But I guess that uh, if an associate thought there were proper grounds or any complaints by employees of PRASA against you in that you have done something wrong, he would have had all the power to take action against you, would he not?    Ja.  Or to report you to the board or whatever.    And did he ever do that?    Oh, he attempted or what?    [Indistinct]     H’m?    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.  H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.     Well, when you met them, causing problems by identifying all these areas of corruption.    [laughs]  Yes.     You did not cover that last time, did you?     You just remember that? MS     Were there no legal people in your department, legally qualified people [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes.     Who was that?     Is he still there?     Yes.  I think it would be important to get a statement from him.     As to how it came about.   How he was approached and how…[intervenes]     Ja, he dealt with matters when he had no legal qualification and so on.     The type of pressure that he may have got.     He might be prepared to speak now.     Ja, ja, ja.  Yes.     Earlier on when Mr Molefe was giving evidence, one of the matters he talked about was the fact that it would appear – and, of course, he is outside of PRASA so his knowledge might be limited – it would appears that notwithstanding the fact that the contract between PRASA and Swifambo was declared invalid, not much seems to have been done since then to try and recover about R2,6 billion that had been paid.  Do you know anything about what is happening or whether there have been any steps that have been taken in the meantime?     Liquidated.     Ja.     When was this Swifambo judgment, SCA judgment out?  When did it come out?     ’17?     2017?     2018?     Because, I mean, people who have received money, who claim that they received that money lawfully, they will do …[intervenes]     Whatever to – so PRASA has to really adopt a strategy that will match those delaying tactics.     Because otherwise if it does not adopt a strategy that will be up to those challenges, it will find after some time that anyway, there is no money.     So – and time is of the essence.     So I just hope that – because that is a lot of money.     Yes, but – ja, I guess, you know, you legal team I am sure with apply their minds also.     To the question of to what extent must PRASA be confined to getting – recovering these monies from Swifambo which is being liquidated.     As opposed to also looking at certain persons who may have been responsible in a criminal way.     For PRASA losing this money or taking this money.     Because otherwise you will have a strategy where people will establish a company, a legal entity, to use it to do business, do crime and then when they get found out they say do not touch me, go only to the company.  Then they liquidate the company.  But they have benefited from the money.     So you never get the money back all the time because you limit yourself to the entity, so I am sure that they must look at all of those things.     This a lot of money from the taxpayers.     Ja. MS     Yes, yes.     And what is holding back, as you understand the position now?  That was the other matter I was going to find out.     They are not up to the job.     Up to the challenge, ja.     Yes.     You mean even during Ms Kweyama’s board …[intervenes]     The legal department was excluded?     Had the board consulted with you before going there?     To say tell us what is the story?     So at this stage the PRASA is under an administrator.  Instead of a CEO there is an administrator.  Are you able to communicate directly with the Hawks?     To the highest level and say we are frustrated because we give information and then the next time people in the Hawks say we did not give them the information, this thing has been going on for a long time.  Do you have that freedom to communicate directly?     Yes, yes, yes.     You know, Mr Soni, I need to have evidence from the Hawks with special reference to the PRASA cases, what they have been doing.  I need to hear evidence.  I need to hear what is going on.  There is a lot of money for taxpayers that is involved the complaints of crime that have been – that I have been told about.  It should be in their own interest to come and – I know they are going to come at some stage to talk about a lot of things but I want to hear about the PRASA cases between you and Mr Harley(?) but I think with regard to the PRASA ones you can deal with them because that is PRASA but you can talk to him in terms of whatever background might be happening.   I need to hear – I need this whole thing to be cleared as to what is it that over the years they have done and what is it that they have not done and why have they not done what they need to do?  If they make out a proper case, if there are some things that must not be heard publicly because they might interfere with investigation or whatever, then appropriate measures should be taken but I want to know exactly what has been done all along about it.     Okay and Ms Ngoye obviously is a source of a lot of information because she will be able to tell you, to give all the information about what has been done.     And I think that what should happen is there should be an affidavit, if there is not one already, which just talks about this is when we laid the complaints with the SAPS.     This is when the complaints were transferred to the Hawks, this is when we had contact with the Hawks for the first time.  This is how many times we have met with them and gave them briefings.     Here is everything that they have asked for and we have given them everything that they have ever asked for.  Here is when they asked us again for something that we had given the previous year.  Here are the people who have been involved, we would be dealing with one person and then they get changed and then we are dealing with another person who then asked us for the same thing.  Let me get all of that.     Ja.     Let us get all of that because as the delays continue cases get weakened.     You know, they …[intervenes]     Yes and money dissipates, ja.  Okay, alright, so I will get a report back at some stage on that.     2018?     Okay, okay.     Thank you.  No, I think that is the question that I – those are the questions I wanted to ask, otherwise you have got nothing further?     Yes.  Thank you very much, Ms Ngoye, we appreciate that you came.     You might or might not come back but you will continue to work with the Commission.     In regard to all investigations.     Thank you very much.     We adjourn then and we will start at ten tomorrow.     We adjourn.  
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Yes we are.    Mr Molefe yesterday…    Yes.    Yes.    As it pleases Chairperson.  Mr Molefe yesterday we were dealing with your replying affidavit in the Swifambo matter, do you remember?    And you recall that we adjourned on the basis that you had not read the document in a long time and we would give you an opportunity to look at it?    Now have you had an opportunity to look at your replying affidavit?    And as far as your recollection now goes is what is contained in the replying affidavit what happened?    So to the extent that there was an indication that not all the documents were contained in the envelope given to Mr Mamabolo you confirm that that – that the documents that you name in your affidavit were in fact contained in that envelope?    Can I ask, did you check that with Mr Mamabolo between yesterday and today?    Okay right.  Now I just want to ask you did you also read Mr Mashaba’s response to your replying affidavit?    And when one looks at it is there much difference between your version and his version?    As you please Chairperson.    Yes.    Now just – just for the record Mr Molefe can I ask you to turn to page 327 which is where his response starts.    Bundle D Exhibit SS6.    Bundle D Exhibit SS6.    Page 327.    So I just look at the areas of difference very quickly Mr Molefe.  So if you look at what was crucial about your evidence is the meeting and at paragraph 65 of his affidavit in response to paragraph 9.6 of your affidavit he    And – and then in fact he hardly disputes anything in particular he says at paragraph 71 of his affidavit that you did ask him about the contributions but he says it was not in relation to Swifambo he says it was in relation to his contributions to the ANC.  What do you say about that Mr.    And what was the purpose of…    Absolutely.    Yes.      Yes.    Yes.  So let us just to put in context Mr Molefe if you go to page – keep your finger on page 328 but if you go to page 263 that is where you make the allegation about asking him for the proof of the docu – for the proof of the contributions.      Page 263.    Yes.    Yes.    As it pleases Chairperson.    Now if you look at from paragraph 9.6 on page 262 to 9.12 on page 263 this is where Mr Mashaba is asking you for assurances that there will not be any consequences for him, would that be correct?    And your response to him when he asked for those – for those assurances was what?  That you would like proof that those payments were made.    Now in the context of the conversation on the 31 August at Maslow what was the proof in relation to?    Yes.    Sorry I just want to get the context again.  That was – he needed to pay that as a result of what?    So it was the money that Swifambo was receiving as a result of its contract with PRASA and it was receiving that money from PRASA?    Alright now – now it is that context that we look at what Mr Mashaba says at page 328 paragraph 71 and can you just say more or less well I mean can you just paraphrase what he says in relation to the payment at paragraph 71.  If you want you can just read it into the record.    At page 328 paragraph 71.    Now just – if you could just stop there.  Did you ever ask that question?    The context in which this interaction took place on the 31s t was that he had called for the meeting – Mr Mashaba had called for the meeting.    Sorry the – while on that point.  At the meeting did you know or before the meeting did you know that he had made contributions to the ANC?    When he – oh sorry carry on.  He then says I did not think.    What is your reaction to that?    But he said it had no relevance.    Well I do not understand because…    Yes.    There are two issues Mr Molefe. One is he calls the meeting to say, please do not take away my assets because your investigations will show I gave certain monies to a Ms Gomes.  That was part of the purpose of the meeting.    Mr Molefe I am just trying to understand your state of mind.  You file your founding affidavit in the Swifambo matter in which you say the Swifambo contract was tainted by corruption.    Right.  Investigations are done and then you discover certain things but Mr Mashaba in the meantime comes to you and says, look man you may discover certain things, you may discover these payments, before you discover them, I want to reveal them to you.  Is that the sequence of events?    Now what the Chairperson is saying is when he says these payments were made to Ms Gomes to give to the movement that is what you must have understood.  That the payments we made to Ms Gomes allegedly to be paid to the movement.    Oh yes, no, no that is….    Yes.    And – and Mr Molefe it comes against the backdrop that you had already alleged in the founding affidavit that the Swifambo contract was tainted.    And so this just was in a sense proof of the nature of the tension.  Not only was it an irrational uh-uh, contract for... for PRASA maybe interlinked to but we also know now that funds were being diverted to somebody else which then turned out to be allegedly the movement.  Would that be accurate?    In the...[intervenes]     Thanks, Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, uh, you are quite right.  Uh, you never said that you have the proof.  You have merely said, that these were the reports you have received and... and... and that one accept.    But... but I just want to make this point though.  If we go to paragraph 72 of uh, the response to your replying affidavit.  Mr Mashaba...[intervenes]     Sorry.  At page 329 Chairperson.    Yes.  Now, he uh, he says... oh, sorry.  At    And if you look at the affidavit as a whole and you have, you see that is the constant theme that, “yes, I made the payments.  I received the payments on behalf of Swifambo.  I made payments to my own company.”  That is the crust of Mr Mashaba’s evidence.    Yes.  And that is all we have to go on an... and we must accept that as the Chairperson so... so uh, clearly pointed out that that is the only link we have, his    But what is significant at paragraph 72.  In    So the only question, as the Chairperson has pointed out is, were those pay... can those payments be linked to the ANC?  That is the issue.  Would be that be correct?    Yes.  Yes, that is correct.  Then at paragraph    And he had been asked to be chairperson by somebody else.  Who was that person?    Makhensa Mabunda?    And what company was he associated with, Mr Mabunda?    Now the S-Group is short for what company of what group of company?    The evidence elsewhere is the S-Group is short a... is short for Siyaya.    And then finally.  Can I refer you to paragraph 79 of Mr Mashaba’s response which appears at page thirty... uh, 331?      Wherein response to paragraph 9.13 of your replying affidavit, he says these... the contents of these are admitted, save that he did not provide certain documents but I can ask us to go back to paragraph 9.13 which is at page 264?      And you will see that is where you list the documents that were contained in the envelope given to Mr Mamabolo.  Page 264, mister...    Now just... just so that there is no dispute about that.  Do you confirm that the envelope that Mr Mamabolo gave you contained these documents as you list them?    Oh, sorry.  Page 264, Chair.    That is the page I have actually finished yesterday, Chair.    264.    Yes, yes.    Uh...[intervenes]     Identify what...[intervenes]     As you please Chairperson.  Uh, Mr Molefe, at paragraph nine... 9.13.1, the first document you say that was in the envelope was RA15 and that appears at page 283.      Yes, I... I could identify it.    Yes.    The next document is the one at RA16 which is at page 284 and that is a string of emails between Mr Mashaba and Mr Sabelo.    And then the next one is 217 which is a letter written by Mr Mashaba to his bank, asking them to facilitate a payment to Knowles Husain or ten million for R 100 000,00.    And you have checked that ...[intervenes]     And the next one... the next document you refer to is RA18 which is and this is the document we went through yesterday, the first invoice that Similex sent to Mr Mashaba.    And then RA19 is the second invoice.    And RA20 is the payment authorisation letter to the bank again by Mr Mashaba for a payment to be made to Knowles Husain.    And RA21 is a similar document that in relation to a... a different payment to Knowles Husain who sent for R 14 500 000,00.    And RA22 is the payment notification sent by ABSA Bank to Mr Mashaba’s company.    For R9 400 00,00.    And then RA23 is emails between Mr Mashaba and Ms Gomes.    And in these, she just refers to the invoices we have talked about earlier.    Now just finally in relation to these... this... your evidence relating to what Mr Mashaba told you, this replying affidavit and the documents attached to you, I just want to confirm that you do confirm that what is set out in the replying affidavit is correctly records what happened at the time?    Mr Chairperson, may I... may I make this point?  You have raised an important issue.    Oh, sorry.    You have raised an important issue that I... I intended raising uh, uh, bringing it up.  Clearly what one needs now is the evidence of Mr Mashaba and the evidence of Ms Gomes and to the extent necessary, Mr Mamabolo.   So those are the witnesses whom we will... well, Mr Mamabolo, perhaps an affidavit, just to confirm the correctness of this but perhaps to call him, depending on Mr Mashaba’s response and Ms Gomes.    Okay.  But uh-uh, Mr Mashaba and Ms Gomes, we will obviously have to get them to respond...[intervenes]     ...to Mr Molefe’s uh-uh...[intervenes]     ...affidavit and evidence.    Now, just... just finally on this issue.  Again, we are talking about state of mind, sir.  Mr Molefe, when you were told this by Mr Mashaba and... and remember you are a member of the ANC.  I suppose you thought “oh, but that is not...” but certainly at that stage because he says you ...[indistinct] members.  What was your reaction to how PRASA was awarding tenders if that allegation was correct?    Obviously, I... I can particularise it.    In regard to this particular tender.  No, you are quite right Mr Molefe.    Yes.    Yes, I... I will.    Ja.  Now, Mr Mashaba was with Swifambo had been awarded a tender for more than R 2,5 billion.  Is that correct?    Right.  You look at the tender documents and uh, the process and you find that dock... Mtimkulu as he called himself, had tailormade the concept to sue Swifambo.  That was your evidence and that was the finding of the supreme court of appeal and high court.    Now you are then are told by Mr Mashaba that there is this all added dimension and he mentions money being paid to the movement.  I am not saying he includes it but that is what he tells you.  What is your reaction to that?    Now when you met the top 6, was one... was this one of the matters you raised with the ANC top 6?    Mr Molefe, can I then go to page 28, 113 of your main affidavit, page 28 paragraph 113.      The same bundle yes.     Yes, page 28 paragraph 113, are you there?     Chairperson I just wondered in the interest of time because I’m also considering how to deal with this complaint beyond merely recording it as a complaint because we know from what’s contained in the affidavit that – and in the answering affidavit of the police that there’s no answer for why they’ve delayed up to now and I wondered whether it may not be an idea to get Mr Molefe to confirm the correctness of this and then get the new head of the police inspectorate to come and explain why  nothing has been done now?  It’s just in the interest of saving time Chairperson.     Yes.     So in these – in paragraphs 113, 114 and 115 of page 29 you set out the approaches you made to the police, would that be correct, Mr Montana?     And at page – paragraph 113 you refer to a letter that you wrote to the Law Enforcement Authorities including the head of the NDPP at that time?     And the head of the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation?     And that letter appears at page 192, you don’t need to go to it but I’m just asking you to confirm that, that is the letter you, in fact, wrote to the different persons?     Can I just ask, if, in about two or three sentences you can summarise what you said in that letter, no not two or three sentences but as summarised as possible.     And did you ask…[intervenes].     And can I ask you just, the extent of the details you gave in that letter, if you look at page 197 paragraph 11.4 you point out that you were annexing to the complaint, the founding affidavits in the Siyangena and the Swifambo matters, at page 197.     Page 197 paragraph 11.4.     Right and then on the next page, page 198 you set out the formal request for assistance, if you look at paragraphs 14. 15 and 16, you point out why the police and the NDPP are required to look into these matters on account of the legislation dealing with corruption.     If I could take that issue further, Chairperson, what we will do is, we will ask Mr Molefe outside these proceedings to give us details of any of those interactions so that we can pursue it with the Law Enforcement work stream. Now what was the reaction to your request to the DPCI?  This is the letter that we were looking at Mr Molefe, in other words, did they exceed to your request and pursue the matter?     So, because of their lack of response to your request for assistance from the Law Enforcement Authorities, you turned to the Courts, is that correct?     I’m going to deal with the judgment in a moment but effectively the relief you sought was a mandamus, an order that they must do their job as you had set out in your letter of request.     Now – and then you’ve explained to the Chairperson that their response was to take a technicality – a technical point that the Court didn’t have – the Board didn’t have the locus standi to bring the application because it wasn’t a quorum.     Now I just want to, Chairperson to take…[intervenes].    As you can see.  Now the Chairperson has said that it is strange that you had to go to court to get the law enforcement of authorities who are other organs of state to – to do their job.  They took a technical point.  And just ask you – Chairperson may you refer to the judgment because the learned Judge in rejecting the point made by the police that there was no locus standi raises this issue and I just would like to place it on record Chairperson.  May I ask you to turn to page 206 of Bundle D which is part of the judge – which is page 3 of the judge – page 5 of the judgment of the court?      Page – the Bundle – the judgment starts at page 202 Chairperson.    202.    And paragraph 5 is the passage.  But perhaps I should just place on record who the parties are Chairperson.    At page 202 Mr Molefe you wills see that this is a case in the Gauteng Division of the High Court and it is case number 36337/2017 and the parties are PRASA, who is the applicant and OUTA this is the organisation undoing tax abuse which is an intervening party and the respondents are the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation and the National Prosecuting Authority.  Is that correct?    Now again just as background to the judgment they had taken 2 points.  The first point is that you did not have locus standi and OUTA ought not to be admitted as an intervening party.  Is that what happened?    Now at paragraph the learned judge just gives a comment about the approach adopted by the respondents and I would just like you to read that into the record.    And in fact, again just to give it context they had not filed an answering affidavit in regard to the substance of your complaint as set out in the case. Am I right?    So at paragraph 14.1 on page 218 of the papers.    And paragraph 14.1 Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    Again, I will address that issue through the judgment Chairperson the question of what was go happen to the substantive – their response to the substance of the trial.  Again, at paragraph 14 the learned Judge deals with the question of costs and at 14.1 he again comments on the unacceptable approach adopted by the respondents.  Could you read 14.1 into the record?    And then if you look at the order itself you will see on page 219 Mr Molefe in paragraph 15.1.1.2 an order is made as to when the answering affidavit is to be delivered.  And you will see that the learned Judge gave them just 5 days to deliver their answering affidavit.      And then I just want to refer to the last paragraph of the judgment and the order and can you just indicate what the order was because it seems to express the learned Judge’s displeasure at the approach that the respondents have adopted?  Paragraph 5 of page 220.    Yes.    Three counsels.    Yes.    Yes.    Now you carry on at page 100 and – paragraph 115 of your affidavit Mr Molefe where you point out that the DPCI then filed an answering affidavit and PRASA filed it replying – sorry its answering affidavit and PRASA filed it to a replying affidavit but the matter has not    Oh sorry.    That is at page 28 Mr Molefe.    Paragraph 115 right at the end of the page.    So effectively what you are saying here is we pursued this matter.  We got it into court.  We got past the technical stage but nothing has happened since then when you say this is partly due to the fact that the interim boards that succeeded yours – your board did not pursue the matter with the required enthusiasm in zeal.  They are a public entity or a public board should do.    What happened to that project the Moloto Rail Project?    But to your knowledge it has not been implemented?    Mr Chairperson you will forgive me that I am going to go to a parallel concern that you have raised with the witness.  The Chairperson has raised…    Yes.    Yes.    The Chairperson has raised with you the following concern that Law Enforcement Authorities did not do their job.  Notwithstanding the fact that all these complains had been made to them and nobody followed up upon it.  But there was two – there were two civil cases that PRASA had been involved in.  The one is the Swifambo matter in which you were successful to the tune of R3.5 billion.  Do you know whether any attempts were made to secure the money that PRASA had paid those contractors for a contract that was said to have been cancelled?    May it please, Chair.  The second matter, again parallel to what the Chairperson raised about, the criminal issues is, in the Siyangena matter, the amount involved, if I understand it now, with interest and so on, is in the region of R 6 billion.  Would that be about correct from your understanding?    Now in regard to that, that issue, you first took to court in 2016.  There were technical points taken and you... then, after you left, the sitting review was filed and that is now to be heard in August.  Do you know why it is taken so long to get that matter in court and debated before a judge?    So what we have is probably raised yesterday.  You do not have a permanent CEO.  You only have acting CEO’s.  You do not have a permanent board.  You only have acting boards.  And for five years, effectively, nothing has been done to secure or PRASA what is it due.  To have criminals behind bars and to get the money back on behalf of taxpayers.    Yes.  But why... you... you yesterday said you would like to be given that opportunity and the Chairperson has laid the stage for you to... to connect the dots as you see it.   We may see it differently and the Chairperson differently from me but it would be helpful to have your views, you being at the core phase of one of the biggest battles that state-owned entities have had with the executive.      Would you... would you then ...[indistinct]      We finished with your third affidavit which appears at Bundle E as EXHIBIT SS7C, at page 386.   You don’t need to go to it, I am just pointing it out to you for the purposes of the record.     Now during your ...[intervenes]      It’s just for the record…[intervenes].     So, it’s Bundle E1, EXHIBIT SS7C, page 386, that’s the last document, I’m going to go back to 7B in a moment Chairperson.     You might recall that in that affidavit you dealt with what was contained in paragraph 21 in your founding affidavit in the review application in the Siyangena matter.     Yes sure.     So there are two basic matters I’m going to raise with you today Ms Ngoye, the first is relating to Siyangena’s response to the allegations at paragraph 21 which dealt with the property dealings between Mr Montana and Mr van der Walt who was Siyangena’s lawyer, you recall those four properties that you dealt with?     I know you didn’t have anything to do with the opposing affidavit but because it’s an opposing affidavit to your founding affidavit I just want to place it on record through you.  The second issue I’m going to raise with you is what you raise in paragraphs 53 to 58 – sorry to 62 of your affidavit of February 2020, that was your second affidavit.     And that’s where you deal with the attempts by the Director General to settle certain matters which has become an issue as – well you were not here but Mr Molefe raised that issue as well.  So, if I could ask you, then, Ms Ngoye to go to your review application now and those relevant pages are at Bundle B2 EXHIBIT SS3.     That’s the one.     Yes.     If you just went to page 401, I just want to alert you to the document that we are talking about – sorry it’s page 400 rather than 401, have you got it?     Now…[intervenes].     Yes, so this is case number 14332 of 2018 in the Gauteng Division of the High Court and it’s a matter between PRASA and Siyangena Technologies, do you remember this matter?     Now just for orientation sake again, you will recall – sorry what is this application about?     Now, the – just again, for orientation, this was the second case that PRASA had brought.  There was a review application in 2016 and you did deal with it, but just again, for completeness sake, what happened to that application?     And that decision was made without considering the merits of the case?     As a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in the Gijima matter the technical point fell away and you were now entitled to persuade the Court to hear your review application.     And just again for completion sake this is the matter that’s going to be heard, I think, on the 19 t h of August this year, is that correct?     Now, in your…[intervenes].     In your founding affidavit you raise a number of concerns, we’ve been through, about the propriety of the process and the lawfulness of the process but in paragraph 29 in particular – paragraph 21 you dealt with the question of property dealings between Mr Montana and Mr van der Walt, you recall that?     Now, in the opposing affidavit as it is called it starts at page 400, Siyangena opposes the whole application, the whole review application, is that correct?     Now who deposes to this affidavit?     And in his capacity as the CFO.     Can I then ask you to look at page 516 of that – well of the papers but it’s a continuation of that affidavit.  Now, in this part of the affidavit Mr Dubek deals, generally, with the allegation that the property dealings between Mr Montana and Mr van der Walt, in some way taints the award of the contract to Siyangena.     And I just want to place on record what their position is in regard to the broad allegations you make.  Can I ask you to look at paragraph 176 in regard to how the property dealings started, would you read that into the record?     Who is Mr – well we know who Mr Montana is, that’s the former CEO of PRASA, group CEO of PRASA, is that correct?     And Mr Ferreira?    No, Mr van der Walt was the…[intervenes].     Wasn’t Mr Ferreira on the Board or a representative of Siyangena and was he not the person who wrote a letter in June 2014 before the R2.5billion contract was concluded?     Okay so this is now Mr Ferreira from Siyangena who Mr Dubek says had a meeting with Mr Montana?     Okay and at paragraph 177 he goes on – Mr Dubek goes on with the interaction between Mr Ferreira and Mr Montana.     What does he say?     Now, Mr van der Walt is described as being Mr Ferreira’s lawyer in respect of property transactions.     What is your knowledge of Mr van der Walt’s involvement?     Yes, he says though, Chairperson, if you look at page – paragraph 176 it was during the IS and AS phase one.     And phase two started around June 14…[intervenes].     Yes, and then at paragraph 178 Mr Dubek goes on about the nature of the relationship, could you read that into the record.     Now you obviously have no knowledge of the dealings between Mr van der Walt and Mr Montana or the dealings between Mr Ferreira through his other holdings, for example, TMM and Mr van der Walt?     Chair, may I just point out that subsequent to all of these we are going to be leading evidence in the next two days dealing with these matters and I merely want to place Siyangena’s response in context so that when you look at that evidence you will know what the real facts are as emerge from documentary evidence not from the say so of this witness but I thought I should just  place that on record that it is important you are aware of what Siyangena is saying was the relationship and in comparing it to what the documents will show.  Then if you go on to page – sorry if you go on to paragraph 180, what does he say then, Mr Dubek?     Alright, then if you look at paragraph 185, what does he say?     That is what, Chairperson, you will be asked to assess after we’ve led that evidence.  We don’t need to go into the further aspects at that stage but later in his affidavit at page 516 of the recorded pages – oh sorry page 604 if you could go to please.     If I could ask you to read paragraph 393.3 into the record please Ms Ngoye?     Sorry before you do that, can I just say that paragraph – the heading to paragraph 393 is – are paragraph 21 and sub paragraphs of your affidavit in the – your founding affidavit in the matter.     Sorry.     Then can you look at paragraph on the following page which is page 605, paragraph 393.7.     Yes, that’s just lower down on that page.     And at 393.8?     And then…[intervenes].     Right will you just finally read paragraph 394.     Chairperson I just place that on record because I will come back to it at a later stage after we’ve led the evidence and obviously after Siyangena, Mr Ferreira and hopefully Mr van der Walt will respond to what is said in allegations that have already been presented to you.  Now Ms Ngoye can I then ask you to turn to your affidavit at Bundle E1, which is EXHIBIT SS7B which starts at page 277 but I want to refer you to page 300.     Now again, just to orientate you Ms Ngoye, you might recall on the last occasion you were giving evidence you gave evidence on this affidavit up to paragraph 52 and then we went into your allegations in regard to the property transactions.     Yes, I want to now return to the allegations you make in regard to PRASA in general.     Now one of the matters that you dealt with at paragraph 51 in this affidavit – sorry it’s on the previous page, is what you call, in paragraph 53, the interference of Ms Makhubela in the contractual relationship between Siyaya and PRASA or the contractual dispute.     Now in paragraph 53 you say, in the previous section I note the interference by the Chairperson of the Board in Management matter, is that what you were referring to?     Now just again to orientate ourselves, your complaint there was – what was the nature of your complaint there?     Now you already gave evidence on that issue…[intervenes].     But there is, just for, again orientation, who was the party involved, the other party involved?     And the amount involved – it was an arbitration a series of matters that had been referred to arbitration.     And what was the total amount involved?     Now one of the things that always strikes me as – in one of the matters you dealt with on the previous occasion where Ms Makhubela says, given PRASA’s financial dealings every year, what is R60million, was that not her attitude?    Alright but now you dealing with a slightly although connected partly to Siyaya you dealing with a slightly different issue perflated.     Now you refer in this to a meeting if you look at paragraph 54 held on the 25 April 2019.    And well firstly let me ask you were you present at that meeting?    But that means you were not present?    But you have subsequently been given a copy of the Minutes of that Meeting.    We will get to the circumstances and that that came to your notice.  But what was the meeting about in general?    Now you cannot vouch for the correctness of the minutes because you were not at the meeting.    But all we have are the minutes.    Can I – I do not want us to go through the whole minutes but the minutes appear at page 367.      And what does the first page read?    Yes.  Can I then ask you to turn to the next page and Item 1.  I am not going to go through everything.    Sorry who – you know what – how many matters were discussed at this meeting?    No.    No.    You never can tell Chairperson.  But I – my note on my file.    Tells me that we had not.    Covered this.    I just want to say that paragraph 1.1 tells you what the meeting is about.  Could you just read that into the record please Ms Ngoye?    I know what happened Chairperson.  The witness did not remember the first name.    Then she went back to check.    Now I just want you to look at paragraph A and perhaps read paragraph A into the record.    Oh sorry 1.2A yes.    And b.    And C.    So these were service providers who were going to complain to if I may put it higher authorities.    Against PRASA.    But let me ask you this.  At that stage in regard to Siyaya and Siyangena what was the position in regard to the court processes?    By the time this meeting took place had your – had the issue that Judge Makhubela raised later had that been sorted out?    Sorry Ms Ngoye can I ask you to turn back to page 368 and I know I only asked you to read three of the paragraphs but can I also ask you to look at paragraph e and what does that paragraph say?  Paragraph E.    So what is that in reference to the new administration?    Now if you then look at page 369 and this deals with the presentation to be made on behalf of Siyaya.      Can I just ask you if you look above in the block above that who represented Siyaya at these – at this meeting?    Right.  Then we do not need to look at the discussions.  I would just like you to turn to page 371 and look at the decision that was taken in relation to the Siyaya matter.  It is at page 371 paragraphs 3.1.9.    Can I just ask you to look at the top of that page and in regard to amount that Siyaya said was owing to it what figure is – is set out?    Now two years ago what was the amount that was the settlement amount?    Anyway, the DO – the Department of Transport was then to engage with PRASA and the contractors?    And then ask you in the block under that there is a presentation by Bagele Construction.    Mogale.    Yes.  Did you know anything about that – I do not want you to go into any details?    And yet the indication was if – if what was being contemplated the matter was – would have been settled with PRASA paying something or the other at least.    Mr Chairperson I am constrained in light of what Mr Molefe said to refer you back to paragraph 1.2 on    Alright then Ms Ngoye if you could look at paragraph – page 375.  This is the third presentation and the presentation is now made by Siyangena.    If I could ask you to go back to page 369 and just indicate who made the presentation on behalf of Mr Siyangena of …    Siyangena yes.  You will see it in the top block.    Yes.  So a presentation is made and then if you look at the next page 376 the decision is summarised.  Could you indicate what is said at paragraph a?    And when there is a reference to the September court date to your knowledge what does one – what was that a reference to?    So – so it was supposed to have gone to court in September last year?    And what seems to be the plan is to take it away from the hands of the court.    And leave it in the hands of the Department.    And the same Mr Dubeck who says, you do not have a case.    Is the person who goes with this request.    And then Ms Ngoye if you could just read paragraph 3 because it now comes back to you the DG asks the PRASA CFO to do certain things.    Paragraph 335B.    Yes.    Yes.  So effectively it was not going to be let PRASA’s lawyers tell us it was let the CFO who is a financial person because you do not want lawyers to make money but it does not matter if PRASA is to be paid – I mean if Siyangena is to be paid R5 billion.    And that is effectively the attitude.    And then in the last bullet point under C he asks the CEO and could you just read that into the record Ms Ngoye.    Yes the last bullet point.    Yes.    Hm.    Now, at that meeting, if you look at paragraph 57 of your affidavit, on page 301, you make the    It is the third last line of uh, on that page of paragraph 57.  Have you got that?    Yes.  Then if you look at the next page.    Oh, sorry.  Perhaps you should read that in because it gives...[intervenes]     ...because it gives context to how he reacted.    Okay.  So if you could stop there for a minute?  Clearly your attitude as expressed here and at the meeting was, we cannot settle these matters.    Uh, we have got good cases.    We have a right to do this.    What was his attitude?  You then deal with it in the rest of that paragraph.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Chair, may... may I just deal with that    Uh, in that issue... now, in that affidavit Ms Mboya deals with concerns about a possible contract between PRASA and the DBSA.   Ms Kweyama, at the end of the last week, filed a one hundred page response to that and it would not be fair to Ms Ngoye to deal with that matter. And we thought we would exercise it for now and possible deal with it on the papers or if it becomes necessary but uh, certainly it should not occupy us now because it is a completely separate matter.      It is such.    It just...[intervenes]     From Ms ...[indistinct 01   That is right.    And it appears to be somewhat related to that.    The suspension.    Yes.    Yes.    It is... it is a long, long... a hundred pages.    I do not think it deals with the special leave.    Ja.    When this affidavit was being settled with Ms Ngoye...[intervenes]     ...we understood it... it related to that matter.    And that is why we... we just exercised it from this part of the...[intervenes]     Yes, yes.    I... I must confess Chairperson uh, it has been a busy period...[intervenes]     ...because we have been getting lots of dots.  So I have not considered...[intervenes]     ...whether I should deal with the suspension separately from that.    Can I look at it and come back to you?    Uh, uh, that is tomorrow or ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, indeed she can.  Yes, Chair.    Now...[intervenes]     That is... that is...    [Indistinct 01   Yes.    Yes.    No.    H’m.  H’m.    It will be short.    Yes.    Yes.    Now, you say that another meeting was to be held.  Was there another meeting?    Now...[intervenes]     ...although you were... you were on suspension, do you know what happened to this initiative, initiative to settle Siyaya and the Siyangena matters?    Then coming back to what the acting DG said at the meeting.    He says that there were complaints even amongst PRASA staff members ...[intervenes]     ...about how legal function together with a particular law firm was treating employees.  Was he talking about from a resources point of view or was he talking about the fact that you would advise that this ought not to be done and you could not proceed with this contract and so on?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    [throat clearing]    I just want to get back to a point.  When you say when Dr Sishi says that employees complained, is it that you were challenged the validity of contracts they concluded?    Or is it that you took disciplinary steps?    In your evidence on the previous occasion you were here, you made the point that if you look at the Siyangena contract, many of the matters could not have been taken place if people have behaved properly.    I mean, you take Dr Pongola...[intervenes]     Mr Gansho.    And... and a number of them whom you named on the advocation.      Now clearly, as I understood your evidence on the previous occasion, they seem to have an investment in the contract itself.    So if... if there were legitimate... well, not legitimate but if there were complaints that were made, it would have been employees of that elk if I can put it that way.    Ja, Ms Ngoye...[intervenes]     Ms Ngoye, when... right at the outset of your affidavit one of the things you pointed out was that there were certain people who exercised undue influence at PRASA. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson.    I do remember Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    I did Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    I confirm.    That is correct Chairperson.    I did do so Chairperson.    I did Chairperson.    There is very little difference.  I think he refers to paragraph 9 – 9.4 and paragraph 10 where he says he disagrees.  But overall, he agrees with the content of the affidavit and to the extent that he says he disagrees with me.  I refuted that because I based my affidavit on the documents that he gave to Mr Mamabolo in an envelope.    I confirm it yes – confirm it Chairperson.    I deny that Chairperson.  I did not know Mr Mashaba.  At that stage I did not even know if he was a member of the ANC and I would not have asked him if he was making a contribution to the ANC.    Page 20?    263.      That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct but…    In relation to the payment?    Well the proof was in relation to what he said where monies he was requested to pay to Ms Maria Gomes.    And the monies that he said were through her company called – which was paid into the account a company called Similex.  A couple of instalments.  And the money that was paid to Mr Nkosi Sabelo…    He was not – the context was that he – he said that he was asked by Ms Gomes, Maria Gomes to pay money into those accounts and the money was linked to the money that PRASA would pay to Swifambo but she said that that money – she needed that money for what she called the movement.  So that was the context.    That is correct Chairperson.    She had said earlier that this contract is going – it is a contract amounting to billions.  It should not be difficult for you to give 10% of that to the movement.  And I must hasten to say that I do not know Ms Gomes myself.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct.    The – the common understanding – well I think he understood that as well.     But the common understanding of what the movement was and is now is the African National Congress.    That is?    It is okay.    It is fine Chairperson.    He says   I did not ask that question.    He had called for the meeting and it was about how he could preserve the assets that he had accumulated before he became part of the Swifambo tender.    I did not ask the question Chairperson.    To him.    Or in the context of him being the Chairman of Swifambo.    I did not ask.    I did not know that he made any contribution to the ANC Chairperson.  And I should just draw the attention of the commission the Chairperson to the fact that that meeting was asked for by him and I – I was listening to him.  He is the first one who told us of individuals and or companies that he paid money to which then gave rise to me saying but we would need to see the records of those payments.    He says, I did not think I am now continuing that paragraph Chairperson that is paragraph 71 and he    No he is – he is correct because at that stage there was no reason for – for us to speculate about what the relationship could have been between Swifambo and the ANC.      He says it had no relevance and he is correct.  It had no relevance at that stage.    What I am saying is that I – firstly I did not ask him.    So it did not arise but I also agree with him that the meeting was not about the relationship between Swifambo and the ANC.  But neither was it about relationship between Swifambo and PRASA.  It was about his concerns regarding what the implications of the investigations that PRASA was conducting might have on him as a person and the assets that he had accumulated.    Before he joined Swifambo.    Chairperson without any further evidence that monies given to Ms Gomes through – to the ANC.    I do not know how one could – well it will be the relevance in the fact that she mentioned – he mentioned the movement.    Chairperson at that meeting I do not know Mr Mashaba.  At best that would simply say what was your state of mind.    We should have existed in mind that well part of the additional evidence.    That we would I want to see.    Would probably prove peace order.  But it is not something that I said to him.  I want evidence.    To see whether those monies went to the ANC.    But naturally my state of mind.    I would have been concerned.    That is – well – well – well once he started talking about people, he paid monies to clearly his fear was that he would be implicated in the investigation.    That is correct.    That is correct.  That is correct.    That is correct.  But – but that is in my state of mind that is not what I asked him.    The – I - maybe I am struggling to articulate myself.    Ja, ja.  Chair – Chairperson the – perhaps to say that there would have been no relevance may not be correct.    But to say that although the purpose of the meeting had to do with his concerns about his personal assets.  Once he brought in the question of paying monies to people who said that they need the money on behalf of the movement it raises an important question of potential involvement of the movement of the ANC in matters that affect him, Swifambo and Ms Gomes.    Yes Sir.    That... that is correct.    Maybe counsel uh, if it exists anyway in the uh, the document, you will refer me uh, to that. Uh, but I agree with counsel that the meeting takes place against the backdrop off uh, investigations that were demonstrating that Swifambo was tainted. And that is detailed in how process was undertaken.  The roll off Mr Mtimkulu designing uh, the RFP’s in a manner that favours.  Their particular party changes from what was originally uh, supposed to be a lease arrangement uh, to be coming now a lease and outright patches but only that done by Swifambo. So... so... so that... that... that is correct here.  I have no recollection of uh, my evidence.  Um, as stating categorically that uh, the ANC received money.   Uh, whether it is in my founding affidavit in that matter or in public statements that I made.  Every time I spoke about it, was in the context of what Mr Mashaba said to us.  So in fairness to the ANC, I do not have evidence that says, “you got that money”.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Uh, that is correct.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Well, the [laugh] the... the payment can only be linked to the ANC to the extent that uh, according to Mr Mashaba and Ms Gomes presents herself as a fundraiser for the ANC.    Uh, that is not true.  It had nothing to do with whether uh, we wanted to put payments to the ANC.  Uh, the document was requested for him to demonstrate that when he says he paid money to Similex of Ms Maria Gomes and uh, the trust that was held by uh, uh, those uh, that... that law... law firm and... and... and uh Mr Sabelo, Ngozi Sabelo, that, in fact, those payments were effected.   That is... that is... that is what the evidence was supposed to prove for us because I have already said that I never asked him whether he was supporting the ANC or not.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Because he was the chairman...[intervenes]     That person was uh... the person who asked Mr Mashaba to be the chairperson of Swifambo was the founder of Swifambo, Mr Mabunda Makhensa.    Ja, Makhensa Mabunda.  Ja.    Uh, Mr Mabunda was associated with Swifambo.  Uh, he... he was with what was called the S-Group which had a lot of subsidiaries under it.   A consulting uh, an engineering consulting firm.  Uh, general consulting uh, business.  And then, of course uh, the other one was called Swifambo Rails.  And then I think that is the one that was supposed to then deal with the procurement of locomotives.    The uh, S-Group is short for Swifambo Group of Companies.    Oh, okay.  Ja.  Yes, Siyaya also that he is involved in.  It is also a uh, consulting business.    [No audible reply]     [No audible reply]     Yes, sir.  Uh, Chairperson...[intervenes]     I have found the page.    I confirm, Chairperson.  There is no other uh, place where I could have gotten documents.    Mr Mashaba...[intervenes]     ...outside what he uh, sends to us in an envelope.    I... I confirm, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Uh, that is correct, Chairperson.    Uh, that is correct, Chairperson.    I... I will check it, yes.    That is correct, Chairperson.    I have... I have uh, I confirm that.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct.    I do confirm that Chairperson.  That the contents of the affidavit confirms what happened at the time.    I think counsel should rephrase the question, Chairperson because uh, counsel says how PRASA was awarded tenders.    Counsel wanted to say something else.    Yes.    Chair.  Yes, it should be, maybe Swifambo was ...[intervenes]     [Indistinct]     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That... that is correct, Chairperson.    But uh, but one can take as... it a step further.    And say...    ...that it raises the question...[intervenes]     ...as to whether... as to the extent to which...[intervenes]     ...the tender process itself...[intervenes]     ...might have been influenced...[intervenes]     ...uh, by parties...[intervenes]     ...that uh, Mr Mashaba alleges...[intervenes]     ...that Ms Gomes uh...[intervenes]     ...she was raising...[intervenes]     ..the funds for...    We... we um... I... I... I think...[intervenes]     ...refresh...[intervenes]     When... when I ...[intervenes]     When I met with Mr Mashaba...[intervenes]     ...the meeting with the top 6 had already happened.    But the meeting with the top 6 uh, Chairperson would have dealt broadly with the investigations and what was mentioned and the Swifambo matter was the biggest and it was key in uh, what was imaging as big irregularities. Another one was the uh, what I refer to as the Braamfontein depot, uh, modernisation uh-uh, and the procurement of rails and turnouts as part of the preparations for the trains that were to come from Brazil.   There would have been many other smaller uh, matters that were imaging uh, like uh, a bit of Siyangena and so on because the others, Siyaya and so on.     Siyaya GP would have also been involved in that Braamfontein depot transactional advisory service, designed how the depot should look like.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson, it would become a public document.     That is correct, Chairperson.     I was not contacted by anyone from the ANC.  I recall this matter being raised pertinently by the gentleman who later became the Minister for Transport, Mr Maswanganyi saying that, you know, I have accused the ANC of receiving monies from – and that I did not even produce evidence to prove that they did not why I mentioned this matter but nobody from the headquarters of the ANC raised an issue with me.     Chairperson, he was saying it in his capacity as a member of the Portfolio Committee on Transport.     That is correct, Chairperson, and as counsel correctly points out, that allegation was published in the media as a result of the court papers, my replying affidavits there which was in court.  It was not like I went to the media just to release a media statement.     Let us start off by saying my minister was a member of the National Executive Committee of the ANC.  My minister was receiving regular reports on this investigation, and we referred to those reports yesterday, in the context of my reply to the minister ’s letter where she was asking us to close off the investigation and that letter is dated the 24 August.  Ja, 24 August 2016. So a member of the executive committee who reports to the President and the cabinet, who also sat on the subcommittees of the National Executive Committee of the ANC was privy to all of these investigations and I did say yesterday, well, it looks like it was much later, in 2017, detailed letters had been written to various institutions in parliament but at that time also – it was public knowledge that we had reported a series of cases to the Hawks for further investigation in terms of PACCA.     I am referring to Minister Dipuo Peters.     It was at the time when we dealt with the Mashaba.     My affidavit and the application of Siyangena she was, you know, the Minister.     That is correct, Chairperson, it happens and when I was in the province, I was also a member of the National Executive Committee, so I was both the Chairperson of the ANC in the province and a member of the National Executive Committee.  But in addition to all of that we had what was called the President’s coordinating council where the President would meet with all the premiers of the provinces, members of the cabinet to do a review of the performance of government on strategic priorities that would have been identified in their strategic plans.  So there was that regular report. Of course, in addition to that there would have been what was called – I think it was called the budget council or forum where premiers and MECs of finance ministers and the President would meet before the final budget was appropriated and informed in those discussions by the reports of the finance and fiscal commission which was to ensure equitable allocation of resources throughout the country.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Is it 13…?     RA…?     I hope I am looking at the right documents.  Are we in bundle A?     Bundle D, okay.     RA330, Chairperson …[intervenes]     RA30?     It is an email.     Addressed to Mr Lucky Montana, PRASA Corp.     That document at the bottom is an email from Mr Lucky Montana and it is addressed to Comrade Sonia.     It is address to Maria Gomes.     But it also says    The date of that document is 16 December 13.     That is correct.     The subject matter, Chairperson, of the email of Mr Montana to Ms Gomes is the Capital Project that PRASA will undertake.  I do not know if I have to read …[intervenes]     Oh, the subject of the email.     Summary, it says Summary Note.  And it …[intervenes]     That is correct.     The one by Mr Montana?     It says    Well, I am not sure, this may well mean – I am not sure, I am not sure, let me not answer, I am not sure who DBA referred to.     I do not know what this abbreviation stands for.     That is correct.     I am noticed that, Chairperson.     The subject matter in Ms Gomes’ email, Chairperson, is summary notes.     Yes.     That is correct, Chairperson.     May counsel repeat that question?     The email reads as follows, Chairperson    That is correct, Chairperson.     Where I am sitting now, I am not certain but it is very clear that is a response to a discussion they have.     And the notes that appear in the email of Mr Montana to Ms Gomes dated the 16 December 2013.     That is so, Chairperson.     Paragraph 9.15.10 of my replying affidavit     That is correct, Chairperson.     My recollection, Chairperson, the set of emails was found in the course of the investigations by the investigators.     He had already left.  A lot of work had to be done, imaging the laptops and computers.     He said that he was requested.     Yes, Chairperson, I do not know how she would then instruct somebody who is not her subordinate in the same business.  It is probably – is the use of language.     No, what is it, paragraph?     I am looking at it.      “Mr Mashaba explained further that Mr Mabunda  had instructed him to pay some of the money received from PRASA into a specified accounts without Mr Mashaba knowing who was being paid or the reasons for the payment.  Mr Mashaba insisted that he did not know the identity of the beneficiaries and he was merely informed that the money would benefit the movement.”     No, I would rather not comment.     Because I don’t know where it would stop save to say that there seem to be the probability of the link in the emails and what appears in this response that a person get given, the values project and the values well in advance and the person says probably that’s what they had agreed with Mr Montana that they must get 10% you know, for the movement but the 10%, as she is putting it of each one of those projects.     Is that Bundle B?     This one?     I am there Chairperson.     I do Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     That’s correct Chairperson.     I do confirm that I wrote that letter and I’ve seen it several times before I appeared here.     The essence of the letter, Chairperson, was a complaint about the fact that nothing had been done about the cases reported to the DPCI and relating to what we considered to be very serious violations of the law or criminal activities and the fact that we’d registered several of these cases, I think elsewhere, probably in the founding affidavit in the previous – in my letter to the Minister and previous affidavit, most likely, we tabled some 69 cases that we had reported.  So we were concerned that there was no movement.     And of course, I – my view was that – and the view of the Board was that it was improper for what was the organ of State charged with the responsibility of investigating crimes, offences and prosecuting, laying a basis for prosecution in that regard.     Hundred and?     That is correct Chairperson.     Yes it is so Chairperson…[intervenes].     But it relates to – we’re dealing with where we talking about Corporate Governance, the constitution obliges organs of State to support one another to collaborate in dealing with the problems and to the extent possible avoid unnecessary litigation.  Litigation is to be dealt with as last resort.     It was certainly frustrating and it was inexplicable the way it was dealt with and again these matters became public knowledge, the question that one might ask, and bearing in mind that political interference is undesirable but certainly the Minister of Justice under whom such – and the Minister of Police under whom these organs resort should have been able to say, look we see in the public domain and in the reports given to our Minister of Transport that there are these cases that have been lodged with you, give us a status report, these are very serious matters what are we going to do about them, they involve monies that could easily disappear which are continuing to be used against the tax payers interests.  So it’s a question that begs for answers.     It is so Chairperson, the backdrop to the point that is made by the Chairperson is that there was the head of the DPCI or the Hawks who appeared to be effective and committed to doing – discharging his responsibility, Mr Anwar Dramat, he was removed unceremoniously on spurious allegations which never were seriously tested in a proper Court of law and that is when Mr Ntlemeza was appointed in his place.  Our experience with this case, and I’ll try to be very brief, Chairperson, also, is that there were very – quite a number of professional Police Officers in the Police Service, the DPCI but every time those professional Officers put their teeth on the cases, they would be removed and cronies would be appointed in their place, clearly with the instruction to do nothing and there was no movement after that.  Several of them became casualties and I think one of those who became casualties would have been – but though relating to a different case would have been Major – I think Major General Colonel – Brigadier Sibiya something like that who later became head of the Forensic Unit in the city – metropolitan city of Johannesburg.  So there was a deliberate crippling of the system and what was happening in the Police Services was also happening in the NPA.     It is so Chairperson, maybe at some point we must get someone to present to this Commission what exactly happened in the interaction between PRASA and the DPCI in particular.  The DPCI – I attended a couple of meetings with them, in particular with the gentleman, I think he’s called Major General Khana, he was the deputy to Mr Ntlemeza.  When we started, and we do indicate in some of our documents that they said that they were going to prioritise the Swifambo and Siyangena matter, when we started, he said that they needed – they didn’t have forensic capacity to investigate.  We agreed with them that the capacity that we had in the PRASA investigation would be given to them with full control of those forensic investigators that they didn’t even need to give – those investigators didn’t need to give reports to PRASA because once they’re under the police, DPCI, they should account to them even though PRASA was paying the bill for that.  Several reports, many - actually were files – lever arch files were made available as a result of that investigation.  They did not want to touch them because dealing with them would have meant they have to follow the people implicated in those things.  I think at some point, Chairperson, as counsel correctly pointed out earlier on, they must be called to explain.     Chairperson maybe I should make the last point.     If allowed, lest I get misunderstood, I need to credit the new leadership of the DPCI, I think they are busy rebuilding that institution, I think General Lebeya and quite a couple of other officers with whom I had met and who are now back, very professionally attending to these cases. Show commitment that a professional law enforcement Officer needs to exhibit, so I think we acknowledge the work that they are doing including what the NPA is doing to fix a broken system.  So it shouldn’t be like all is lost they are doing nothing.     The – there was a matter that, as I indicated, which said that they were prioritising certain cases, maybe we should look for that exhibit and look at what the response is but up until my term of office ended there was no progress in this matter.  Of course, in the end, Chairperson, we had to institute action in the High Court of the Republic of South Africa to try and compel them to do their job asking them to explain to the Court, why is it that they are not doing their job.  Of course, their response to that, was to raise a technicality that says – which now links what they are doing to what the new Minister was – Mr Maswanganyi was saying, to say, you don’t have the authority to take us to Court because your Board did not have a quorum when this decision was taken.  Of course, I must say it was incorrect because I had a full mandate taken in 2015 which allowed us to investigate and to litigate on the matters arising out of the investigation.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.  But to the credit of SCOPA.    SCOPA did call them    To come and account on what they were doing.    About these cases.    General Ntlemeza was there.    And Major General Khana.    Of course, in their answers they sounded to have been at sixes and sevens because they were really not – Mr Ntlemeza had – General Ntlemeza had just recently been appointed.    And they were really not able to give – answer properly.    Yes.    To those questions but SCOPA did attempt…    To get them to address issues but nothing happened after that.    They might have been called but this particular day.    We were together in the same meeting.    Where of course they were disputing what I was reporting as being done by PRASA.    Without any factual basis for their rejection.  I do not know if they were called back later.    And what they said when they went back.    The reality of the matter is that we are sitting here today.    There is no evidence of anything much.    That has been done except what we have taken to the courts as PRASA and their matter of Swifambo which resulted in the setting aside of – of that contract it having been declared invalid.    It would have been business as usual.    Hm.    That is correct Chairperson.    That was correct.    The honourable judge at paragraph 5 says   That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    I would not remember because at this stage.    I think I had ceased to be the Chair of PRASA>    My – yes Chairperson my view is that they had no defence because all they could say is that no PRASA is wrong we are in fact intending to act on your [intervenes].    Chairperson 14 – paragraph 14.1 of the    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson paragraph 5 of page 220 it is paragraph 5 of the judgment and it relates to the order    That is so Chairperson I agree.    Chairperson that is right.    I know the page…    At page 28.  I found it and that is paragraph?    I have …    That is correct Chairperson.    Just two points Chairperson.    About corruption.  That is one point.  The second point is that yesterday the Chairperson said that perhaps there is a need to look at the record of discussions of some of these Parliamentary committee.    The – my last Minister of Transport when he was still a member of the PCOT, Portfolio Committee on Transport.    Was very much opposed to the fact that the PRASA Board was taking Law Enforcement Agencies to court to compel them to discharge their responsibilities and obligations to the citizens of this country.  Probably those records are made available that could be picked up in those discussions.  But it shows that there was no willingness.    To deal with these issues.    And that would also perhaps show that we read earlier on projects that Mr Montana was giving to Ms Gomes in his notes and one of those projects is called the Moloto Corridor. The Minister, my last Minister of Transport Mr Maswanganyi when he got into office that was one of the projects that he wanted to see happen regardless of what National Treasury had said about the viability of that project because National Treasury had said this is not viable.  But it is one of the projects they wanted to happen because all you needed is to commit capital to it.  And those who are beneficiaries of it will get what they have to get out of it.    Well I – when I left office we had said to the Minister – the earlier Minister, Minister Dipuo Peters that this project is not doable based on the study that was done by National Treasury.  I do not know what is the status of that project now.    It has not been implemented.  There was towards the last days of my office some pronouncements that there will be the Chinese investors in that project with – but I have got no further information on that.    Chairperson I – I do not know of any effort.    To secure that money – to get that money back.    And the application was that the – the contract was unlawful, it needed to be set aside and the court did so.  The second part of it was that the locomotives will be returned to the – our argument should be returned to the supplier and the supplier should pay back the money.  At the time R2.6 billion had already been paid and only 13 locomotives had been delivered when we said we do not want anymore.    To be delivered.  In the interim if Counsel allows me.    Vossloh was bought by a company – a Swiss company called Stadler Rail.    And when I was already now out of the Board of PRASA I got communication that said Stadler Rail want to talk, they want to – to make good.    Of the wrongs of Vossloh.    That they were willing to consider paying back the money but they also would not be willing to – they can leave those locomotives which are already in the country if there was any adjustment should be made for them to be usable, they were willing to do so.    But suddenly the person who approached me said no, no they have now advised that they do not want to go that route.  Obviously, I would still have referred ...[intervenes]     ... and because I would not have been able to make any decision on the matter.    H’m.  So... so... that... that money, I think uh, it is... it is one of the issues that uh, perhaps the Commission...[intervenes]     ...should ask...[intervenes]     ...the executive authority...[intervenes]     ...and the board to explain...[intervenes]     ..what is being done about it.    I know that Minister Maswanganyi when he came here...[intervenes]     ...uh, one of the things that he was saying that “no, those locomotives uh, are okay.  They... they should be used”.  And that was against the backdrop of the judgment...[intervenes]     ...[laugh] that had that uh...[intervenes]     ...that contract um... uh-uh, so... so uh, um, that... that is what we have to deal with.    Uh, the ones that had not been delivered yet.    Ja.    Those that had not been delivered are probably still in uh, uh, Barcelona.    ...as I understand it, with the uh, there was an application for the liquidation of Swifambo Rail.    ...and they were put to auction.  I do not know how many of them...[intervenes]     ...were sold in that auction.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That... that... that is so, Chairperson.    Although, Swifambo was conduit.    He said, “get the money...[intervenes]     and...[intervenes]     and he passed it on.    Most of it to ...[indistinct 00   That is correct.    And I recall that. [laughs]  I recall sending a WhatsApp message to the interim chairperson of the board uh, the last uh-uh board.    Uh...    Ms Kweyama.  Um, and... and it was in the context of an article I had read in the... in the papers that uh, a previous board would be called to parliament to account and I said but I had asked ...[intervenes]     ...for this public hearing...[intervenes]     ...and I would welcome that.      Um, and... and then I said, “well, you know...[intervenes]     ...your next step now is to get the... send these locomotives back and get your money.    ...in your country”.    H’m.  But at the end of that there was nothing more uh, that was done.    The... that is the estimated uh, amount Chair.    As I recall it again it was uh, a... a problem.  Uh, when an interim board was appointed before the interim board of Ms Kweyama.  Uh, that interim board wanted to enter into negotiations to pay money to Siyangena and not to proceed uh, with the... with the uh, civil action. Uh, and perhaps that then links uh, very well with the evidence of mister... Mr Holele, where he says that uh-uh, Mr Moodley came to demand payment uh, on the basis of what they said, the guarantees that a... that a PRASA had... had given to uh, Siyangena and we said also ballooned by that time to R1,5 billion.    Chairperson, in respect of the Group Chief Executive, yes.  For five years approximately there was no Group Chief Executive but in the intervening period there had been two uh, interim boards. And there is also now um, the administrator who is like a substitute board.  So at that level of accounting authority, there were uh-uh, people who... who should have acted.    Yes.    Yes.  H’m.    I have permanently.  [laughs]    I can... I can sense the Chairperson’s frustration.    But there is also something very interesting.  I must say to counsel that...[intervenes]     ...we had said we would connect the dots.  I think Chairperson has connected a lot of dots.     ...for us.    So we are not going to have to spend a lot of time on that.  [laughs]     [Indistinct]     Chairperson, uh, thank you very much.  Uh, the... we have traversed in a... in our evidence.    Uh, a number of uh, key uh, areas of... of what happened.  Uh, we... we spoke about, in the course of evidence uh, a report called PRASA uh, in turmoil but uh, which is, I think uh, SS6A uh, PM16, I think we said.  That... that is what it is going to be.   And in the evidence that we... we have dealt with, we have seen a lot of correlation of what... what was happening in a number of institutions or what ministers were doing uh, or what Portfolio Committee has omitted to do or failed to date.  I speak of parliament and so on. And all of it, when one looks at it and... and of course we... we go over some exhibits in the... in the... in the files here, linked to for example uh, the evidence of Mr Mamabolo.  I will not go specifically to that exhibit. When one looks at what has happened up until now, it all starts with the board of directors on November 20...    Ja, in turmoil.  But maybe I should try quickly to bring these matters together.  To say that there is a common thread that connects uh, the... the termination of uh, the contract of Mr Montana, the acceptance of his wish by the board uh-uh, his so-called PRASA in Turmoil. The series of media attacks uh, on... on... on... on the Board of PRASA, all of which are a substance uh, is informed by... by uh, this document called PRASA in Turmoil. The... the refusal by the Minister of Transport to allow the Board of PRASA to appoint a Group CEO, ignoring the process of interviews that had happened and later again that company is not ready for that. And then, enforcing on the Board of PRASA an appointee who is from her department to be the Group, acting Group CEO.  And one of the issues that the board     It is my pleasure, Chairperson. 
MOLEFE: That it was ...[intervenes] by the investigation.   Quite, you know, running out of …[intervenes]   I think quite clearly from what the Chairperson has said.  Those who sing that they are fighting corruption but not acting probably think that all that they have to do is to sing a ritual.   Uh, and those who were delivered ...[intervenes]    The PRASA in Turmoil. There uh...[intervenes]  
MR SONI SC:   Now when you filed or when the replying affidavit about what Mr Mashaba had told you was lodged in court it would have become a public document, would that be correct?     So people generally would have known that such an allegation had been made.     Were you contacted by anybody from the ANC about that allegation?     When Mr Maswanganyi made this accusation or made this – said this to you, was he saying it as a member of a committee in parliament?  I think yesterday you mentioned that …[intervenes]     And did you at any stage communicate this to any other person in the ANC except through the court papers, the allegation that Mr Mashaba had made to you?       So on that note can I ask you to go back to your affidavit which is bundle D and turn to the point at which we left off yesterday which is page 28, paragraph 113?     It certainly has got cold, Chairperson.  It is still cold, it was a little warmer some time ago.     Yes.     It would be the ideal time to take…     Yes.     As you please.     Sorry, Chairperson.  May I point out that I did raise the question of that the room is cold.     I am informed that the air conditioning is controlled centrally.     But that they are attending to it.     Chairperson, I know that I have indicated that I was going to turn to another topic but there is something that I omitted to raise with Mr Molefe.  May I, with your leave, raise it in relation to his replying affidavit in the Swifambo matter?     Mr Molefe, can I ask you to turn to bundle D page 268, that is – it says 6, page 268.  Now one of the – we have dealt with the documents that Mr Mashaba gave to Mr Mamabolo but in those documents, you refer to a series or an exchange of emails between Mr Montana, Ms Gomes, is that correct?     Now, firstly, you raise two issues.  You set out the exchange between them at RA30 which is at page 323.  Can I ask you to look at page 323?     323, RA30.     RA30, your replying affidavit, annexure 30.     Bundle D.     323, yes.  Sorry, Chairperson, yes.  Now – sorry, can I just ask you to identify what these documents are?     RA30.     Yes.     Email sent from Maria Gomes on the 17 December 2013 and to whom is it addressed?     Okay, if you just go to the document at the bottom of that, what is that document, on the second half of that page?     Well, it is Maria Gomes, am I right?     Yes.     And what is the date of that?     And the document from – I mean, the email from Ms Gomes is the 17 December, is that correct?     So can we look at the document at the bottom, the email of the 16 t h.  Mr Chairperson, I submit it is a document and I would ask the witness to read it into the record.     Is the 17 t h, yes.     So I just want to ask you, in regard to the email from Mr Montana to Ms Gomes, what is the subject matter?     No, no, I am …(intervenes) MR     Well, the importance of that you will see when your read Ms Gomes’ but I just want to point out that the subject is, according to the email, Summary Notes, is that correct?     Now can you then read the email please?     Yes.     Can I ask you, do you know who DBA is?     Alright, can we then read the email of the 17 December 2017?     Yes.     As you please, Chair.  I will want to come back to that issue as he sets it out in his – as Mr Molefe sets it out in his replying affidavit.     Now what is the subject matter again in relation to Ms Gomes’ email?     So putting it …[intervenes]     As it pleases, Chairperson.  Could you read the whole email including the manner in which Ms Gomes addresses Mr Montana?     I say could you read the whole email from  Ms Gomes addresses Mr Montana including the manner in which she addresses Mr Montana?     Now just putting the two emails in context would it be fair to say that Ms Gomes’ email is a response to Mr Montana’s email of the 16 t h?     Now in your replying affidavit at page 268 you deal with – or you comment on this exchange of emails at page 268 paragraph 9.15.10.  Can I ask you to read into the record what you said in paragraph 9.15.10 of your replying affidavit?     And, of course, the third point that ought to be made is the one raised by the Chairperson that not only are you giving details but you are giving approximate costs which are not trifling amounts.     Now where did you acquire – where did you get this document, this set of emails from, Mr Molefe?     And by the time it was found Mr Montana had left, so [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Chairperson, I just wanted to place that on record again to say that obviously these are matters that will be canvassed with Ms Gomes and Mr Montana when they come.     Yes.  Can I raise one issue?     Relating to that, Mr Chairperson?     Mr Molefe, can I take you to page 263 of bundle D and in particular paragraph 9.11.  This is still part of your replying affidavit.  Are you there?     Paragraph 9.11, page 263.     Will you read it into the record please?  It relates to the issue about the instructions.     So that is the difference between the two.…[intervenes]     Yes.     Let me just try and find the passage.     I think it is at 329, paragraph 72, Chairperson.     Ms Gomes.     Yes.     Oh, ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Molefe, after that rousing address by the Chairperson, on behalf of the PRASA stream, I just want to say to you I know how you must have agonised over whether you should make the revelations you did.  Can I just make this observation?   True patriotism is speaking truth to power in the most difficult circumstances and we hope that your coming here is going to be a clarion call for other patriots who have done so much for our country because unless patriots like you do come, we are not going to find the solution that the Chairperson has been asked to forge so that we can move the country forward. Mr Chairperson, may I say you are not the only dreamer as John Lennon said, we all are.     Yes.     As you please, Chairperson.     Now you in your affidavit in your conclusion with the same theme and can I just ask you to summarise what you say or what you said in the conclusion as contained in the affidavit?     Yes, yes.     Say that again please?     Yes.  And the type of pressure that had been put on hm.     Now concerning that, I just want to conclude it with that, Chairperson, because there has been – well, perhaps not a development but I should place this on record.  You know #UniteBehind have challenged the validity of the appointment of an administrator, is that correct?     And what is the position at the moment?     The matter has been argued, though?     Mr Chairman,  have no further questions.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Then money dissipates, Chair.     Yes.  Chairperson, may I just place on record that the Swifambo judgment in the SCA was handed down on the 30 November 2018.     2018, yes.     I have got nothing.     Yes.     As you please. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.    That’s correct Chairperson.    I do Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    Chairperson, I’ve got here Bundle B SS3 Court applications continued.    Is this the one?    Okay.    I’ve got it Chair.    I do Chair.    This application, Chair, has been brought by PRASA to set aside the contract that was concluded between PRASA asking the Court to review and set aside the contract that has been concluded by PRASA at the time that, you know, the whole deals were entered into, it involved a number of contracts, sub-contracts relating to the tenders so to speak that PRASA had concluded with the company Siyangena.  So, following the investigations that were conducted by the Board it was felt that it was necessary to review the contract and set it aside.    Chairperson the first application, the review application, in fact, was deposed to by Dr Popo Molefe as he then was the Chairperson of the Board and during that period the issue that we needed to deal with or that we were found wanting on as PRASA was the issue of the – I think it’s the 180 days if I’m correct within which to bring your own review as a state owned enterprise and because we were way out of time in relation to bringing this matter to Court, the Court found that there was no basis for us because we were out of time so that’s why we lost that review in relation to that 180 days requirement that was there.    That’s correct Chair, we didn’t go into the merits of the case.    That’s correct Chair, the Gijima case, obviously you know, decided on the basis that legality was important more than the 180 day timeframe that was required.  So, it’s on that basis, we believed as an organisation that we needed to take the matter up again and bring it to Court.  That’s why we have the second review which I have then deposed to because at the time, Dr Molefe had already left PRASA.    That’s correct Chair.    Okay, thank you Chair.    I do recall Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    The deponent, Chair, is Thomas Andreas Dubek.    He’s the CFO of the first respondent Siyangena Technologies.    I know that Chair.    At paragraph 176 of the affidavit, Chair, it reads, “During Siyangena’s involvement in Isams Phase one, Montana and Ferreira had a discussion in regard to Ferreira’s other business interests which inter alia related to investments in immovable property and construction”.    That’s correct Chair.    Mr Ferreira was the attorney involved in the transaction.    Oh, sorry Mr van der Walt was the attorney, I can’t remember who Mr Ferreira – just remind me please counsel.      That’s correct Chair, I recall, there’s too many of these people Chair, you will pardon me.    That’s correct Chair.    Yes, yes Chair.    Okay in response,  “Mr Montana noted that, similarly he was also involved in such industries, Montana enquired as to whom Ferreira used to assist him in this regard as he was always on the lookout to improve his team and in particular, was looking for a good lawyer.  Ferreira then referred Mr Montana to van der Walt whom was, at the time, the attorney that attended to the transfers of the immovable property acquisitions within Ferreira’s other interests and whom, from time to time, recommended and was a partner in some ventures which came across his table in his day-to-day activities”.    That’s correct.    My knowledge, also, Chairperson was that Mr van der Walt was also Siyangena’s attorneys.    It doesn’t say Chair.    I’m not Chair, I think I suppose one would surmise that it was during the times that Mr Montana started with his property transactions but I’ll have to be reminded of the years.    Phase one would have been – remember we had the two – the confederation cup which was 2009, phase one would have started just, you know, 2010/2011 round about that time Chairperson.    That would have been the time when the phase one of the tender for the Siyangena process started.    That’s correct Chairperson there’s quite a number of phases, if you recall Chair.    Phase one, phase one extension and then phase two.    Paragraph 178 reads this Chair, “Neither Ferreira, Siyangena or any other entity associated with either of them had any knowledge of subsequent dealings between Montana and van der Walt until November 2014 when, during a conversation with van der Walt, Ferreira became aware of these dealings.  Ferreira’s requests to van der Walt was to ensure that any and all dealings with Mr Montana by van der Walt were completely above board and completely transparent.  Van der Walt, heeding Ferreira’s request and after requesting Montana on various occasions to deposit monies into his trust account to continue with their proposed joint venture decided not to include Montana in the dealings and proceeded with the transfer of the subject properties on his own accord without Montana”.    I don’t Chair.    He says, “What is more, what the nature and extent of the dealing were between van der Walt and Montana is completely unknown to Siyangena and/or any person, particularly Ferreira related to it”.    Paragraph 185 says, “The striking absence of primary factual allegations to this effect in the founding affidavit is telling.    PRASA is challenged to produce primary admissible facts in relation to the unsubstantiated contentions levelled against in this regard”.    I’ve got it Chair.    Chair paragraph 393.3 reads…[intervenes].    That’s correct Chair.    Okay paragraph 393.3 reads, “I have indicated herein above that I cannot comment on the relationship between van der Walt and Montana save to confirm that as far as I know van der Walt is a developer or property investor in his own right whilst Montana obviously displayed a desire to become involved in the business of property development and investment.  Van der Walt and Montana conducted their business amongst themselves and I can only refer to the affidavit deposed to by van der Walt in this regard, which is an Annexure to these papers”.    393.7?    Yes, I’ve got it Chair, it reads, “There is no allegation that Siyangena paid van der Walt any benefit to use any of the alleged transaction with Montana”.    It reads, “There is no proof or allegation that Montana received any benefit since the factual end result of the transactions between van der Walt and Montana is that van der Walt asked that Montana, on their relationship and is at present the only and sole owner of these properties via his entities”.    And in 3.3.8.1 Chair it reads, “Nowhere in Ngoye’s affidavit is one single fact which could imply or indicate that Siyangena is linked to any benefit actually or even potentially received by Montana”.    Paragraph 394, “As a consequence of the aforesaid, I submit that Ngoye failed to establish any grounds on which a Court can realistically rely to assume any undue benefits from Siyangena to Montana”.    I’ve got it Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    Okay Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    Well in this regard, Chairperson, we were dealing with an issue where we believed that the Chairperson of the Board was interfering in management issues and the fact that she wanted to settle or had contemplated settling a particular matter which we, as PRASA and especially the fact that we were dealing with it in the legal department and believed that we had huge prospects of success she wanted it settled and she wanted it settled without the involvement of the legal function and had indicated that fact.    I have Chair.    This particular transaction, Chair, which the Chairperson of the Board at the time sought to settle, was Siyaya and you’ll recall, Chairperson, Siyaya is the company where Mr Makhensa Mabunda was involved and it’s one of those which was under the S banner of companies, I think it was called, S companies.    That’s correct Chair there was about five of them that had been referred to arbitration.    Roughly it was about 58 Chair, with interest it came to about 60 that we had to go fight in Court.    It was her attitude Chairperson.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I was not invited to this meeting Chairperson.    I was there Chair yes, I was not present.    Yes correct I received a copy of the Minutes from the Acting Group CFO of PRASA Ms Thobeka Mohlati at the time.    Chairperson this meeting was about various matters.  In fact, the meeting was called by the DG, the Director General of the Department of Transport Mr Hlabisa – let me get his surname Chair.  What is his name?  Mr Chris Hlabisa was the DG of the Department of Transport.  He had called this meeting Chairperson because apparently various suppliers of PRASA had complained to the Department about PRASA litigating you know unnecessarily and had suggested that their matters be settled and therefore had referred these matters to the Department and requested the Department’s intervention in the settlement of these matters.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I have got it Chair.    The first page it is on the letter of the Transport Department Republic of South Africa.  DG meeting with stakeholders that have financial disputes with    Sure.    I do Chair.  I do have roughly.  I know two of the matters and they are significant matters that were discussed at this meeting was the Siyangena matter.  The settlement of Siyangena matter as well as the settlement of the Siyaya matter.    And I know there was a Bigale [?] matter also that was referred to as part of the meeting.      No we did not Chair.    Yes.    It was not this one.    No it was not this one Chair.    Ja.    Paragraph 1.1 reads   No I said Mr Hlabisa.    Chris Hlabisa.    That is him – that is who I said Chair.    Mr Chris Hlabisa.    Yes.    Hlabisa it is Mr Chris Hlabisa.    The first name and I went back to check.    That is right.    Is that of 1.2?    1.2A Chair the – it says   B Reads   C. “Parliament noted the accusations and referred the matter back to Minister and the Accounting Officer.”    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Chairperson we had not finalised the litigation processes with both companies in fact and in fact Siyaya was in the process of having its companies liquidated and Siyangena were – I mean it has been common knowledge and public knowledge that we have been in court with Siyangena you know for quite some time.    Yes Chair what becomes interesting is that this meeting happens after – you know we have been to court to go and you know retrieve the monies that you were unduly sought to be taken…    That is right Chair.  At this time the court process of getting the money back in relation to the Siyaya matters had been finalised.  In fact, we had received the monies back from the sheriff.  So this matter comes after that and it becomes interesting that you know it is still brought back to the Department for discussion.  When in fact when we took it to court, we had to get the permission of the Minister Chairperson.  If you recall part of the evidence that I gave was that…    Ja.    To go and make submissions.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is Siyaya Chairperson.    So we have got Siyaya.    Which is the one that we went to rescission to court for.    Siyangena is the one that is still in court.    This is both of them.    Siyaya is the one …    That is right.    Yes Chairperson.  So they wanted that money that we went to go get back.    Ja through the proper processes.    Yes Chairperson.    That is right.    Ja.     So paragraph E of the minutes says   Well Chair I mean I – one can only surmise.  I mean – as I have indicated I was not at the meeting but this was just before.  There was a change between the…    That is it.  Before the new Ministers were going to be appointed for the different portfolios and so on.  And so this meeting was just before that.    It is interesting that the minutes record that it was important that these decisions were to be made before the new administration.    You know came into effect.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chair.    Chairperson Siyaya was represented by Mr Makhensa Mabunda together with Mr Prince Paweni.    Yes Chair I have got it.  It reads at a it reads? “The DOT will intervene to address the litigation issues and see if government was not unnecessarily losing money through this process.  Siyaya DBI to assist the panel – this is b. by availing itself when requested to clarify additional facts in their submission should any of the submitted information be unclear.”    Chairperson in paragraph c of the minute what    It was interesting Chairperson because we are talking about the figure of about 60 million – 58/60 million so it has gone up now.  In this meeting we talking 87 million Euros so it is interesting.  But now it is plus interest.  I mean 82 million plus interest it is about 111 million.  It is almost double the amount that was initially the amount in dispute.    That is correct.  But Chairperson may I say this?  I have – you know I find it very interesting that this matter was dealt with in this manner.  This matter was not coming to the Department for the first time.  The Siyaya matter.  As I indicated Chairperson when the Minister at the time took office, Minister Blade Nzimande we brought this matter to him because we were – we did not know where to go as I indicated previously in my evidence.  And we raised this matter with him to say, Minister we need your help, can you please assist us in recovering this money for PRASA?  It becomes interesting that the very same Department that you know had knowledge of this meeting – of this meeting and of the reports that we had given is dealing with it again as though it is a new matter and they did not know about it.      It is Mogale.    Mogale Construction. Yes Chair.    Ja.  I knew about the Mogale matter.  Chairperson this was one of the matters that we were dealing with as the legal function within PRASA.  We were once again in dispute with Mogale.  It started a while ago it was a 2010 matter that related to the consultancy agreement that we had.  And it is interesting also if I may Chairperson to indicate that in fact not so long ago PRASA was successful in this matter where Mogale was claiming about R36 million from PRASA that the matter was finally decided through an arbitration and we were successful and defeated Mogale in the matter.    That is correct Chairperson.    To my knowledge Chairperson – I mean unless they approached the Group CEO I would not know.    But to my – in fact if that was the case I would have expected to have been asked.    As the Group Executive responsible for legal but to my knowledge there was no such interactions between and Siyaya at the time.    That is correct Chairperson.    Siyangena.    Siyangena – yes under 2.3 of the minute    a.  At 3.5 paragraph a says   They were supposed to have gone to court.  Chairperson the – the Siyangena matter there has been quite a number of postponements you know in the matter.  I mean we have now even postponed from January this year to now August this year so it obviously would have been a date where we were supposed to have gone to court with Siyangena.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is right.    That is correct Chairperson.    Ja.    That is correct Chairperson.    Which – sorry which paragraph Counsel?    B.  B reads Chair. “The DG requested the PRASA CFO to check the submissions that are going to be emailed and describe and verify the amounts that are owed to them.”    That is correct Chair.    Siyangena Chairperson.    That is right.    This is Siyangena Chairperson.    That is it.    We are on Siyangena now Chairperson.    Ja Siyangena remember you said Siyanbenga the last time.    Chairperson.    That is correct Chair.  That is the nett effect.    That is the nett effect of what was happening here.    Billions Chair.    Yes – Yes Chair.    Under C Chair.    The last bullet point. “The DG requested the CFO to have both Siyangena and PRASA lawyers in one team however the DOT will initiate the meeting.  PRASA CFO would instruct its lawyers to work with Siyangena’s lawyers.” I do not know whether it is Chair I mean.    It is – look Chair I mean it does not make sense to me.    You know first and foremost I am the Group Executive Legal Risk and Compliance in the matter I do not get invited to this meeting and then they giving instructions to the CFO who is not even – who is not you know dealing with these matters on a daily basis and they are instructing the CFO to then get the lawyers of PRASA and the lawyers of Siyangena together.  The whole to me just does not make sense.  I do not – I do not know.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is right.    That is correct Chairperson.    Diale Mogashoa Attorneys.  That is correct Chair.    Yes.  He is barred.    From dealing with the people.    That is correct Chairperson.    It is the same names.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I mean I think Chair if I may the whole thing – look I suppose you know some things are designed that is my view, they are designed and – and the one thing that always comes to mind if that I would have obviously raised a lot of objections.    At that meeting.    To having these discussions.    You know and I guess they did not want that.    First and foremost, Siyaya was in liquidation.    One would say where is the liquidator.    Because Mr Makhensa Mabunda you have got no authority to be here.    And those are things that the CFO nor the Group CEO of PRASA would not have known to raise you know but once again you know it is that thing that says that that legal department is problematic.  In fact, they should just be kept out of these things.    No.    That is right Chair.    That is correct.    By the lawyers elsewhere.    Ja.  That is correct.  It goes to the conduct of those lawyers as well in my opinion Chairperson.    Because honestly, I mean if you have to look at it you really cannot be conducting yourself in that manner.    Also, in the legal profession he speaks about this meeting which they had with the DG and... and about these uh-uh-uh, service providers that were owed by PRASA.  And obviously, my ears, you know, uh, were very keen to share what... what is this about now. Um, and that is when I got to know about the meetings and I got to share who the service providers were and... and I took issue at exco, you know, with obviously what he was... what... what... what he was reporting to exco.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is right here.  “He alluded to the possible settlement of these matters”.  Yes.  I made it very clear to Dr Sishi that the suppliers that he was referring to were all in litigation with PRASA and thus PRASA... as... as... as PRASA we were fighting these cases accordingly.    H’m?    Ja.    “I also indicated that as the legal function and having consulted extensively with business on the various matters, we believed that PRASA’s prospects of success were good um, as the evidence in the CI Rescission matter which had saved PRASA some R 16 million which he had uh... which had been attached by Siyaya”.    Ja.    H’m.    H’m.    Ja.  When I said that Chairperson, Dr Sishi state um, that there were complaints even amongst um... I    “I was surprised and asked him to provide details after the meeting.  He suggested that a separate meeting would be held on the 9t h of May 2019 to discuss these matters.   However, to date this meeting has not happened but on the 22 n d of May 2019, he placed me on special leave”.  And I have dealt with being placed on special leave in another portion of the affidavit which I believe Chair, is going to be... a matter dealt with on papers.    Montana’s time.    Yes, Chair.    [laughs]  Chair, it was my fifth but I lost count of how many suspensions I had.  Probably it was the... it is the probably the second, third one...[intervenes]     ...suspension because remember, I was dismissed.    I was dismissed.  I was suspended.    This time it was... there were threats of suspension by the... by the chairperson.  She... she left before having done that.    And then here uh, I was placed on suspension.    It was... it was special leave.  It was not called suspension.    It was called special leave.    Whatever that meant.    No, it did not Chairperson.  [laughs]  Because bottom line is that my name was out there tainted under the guys that I was corrupt.    You know, that was the... the... the... the message that was sent out there.    I have not dealt with suspension in this.    Ja.    Ja.  Chair, you know, I... I think it... you know, one can... it... all these things happened roundabout the same time.    You know, this... this one happened in May.  The development of bank issues happened in May.    I mean, I raised these issues in this meeting ...[intervenes]     ...towards the end of April.  So, you know.    [Indistinct 01   Ja.    That is in order Chair.    Yes.    That is right Chair.    H’m.    H’m.    Yes.    It was never held Chairperson.    Well, I do not think any... anything happened Chairperson because uh, the one thing that I must state is that the Group CFO, the acting Group CFO at the time, after the meeting came to my office and said, “listen, I was very uncomfortable to deal with these matters because I do not favour them and unless you as the Group executive of Legal are involved in all these matters, I am not, you know, to continue with these matters”. As far as I know Chairperson um, these matters really effectively died an assured death and... and um, for as long uh-uh-uh that... the Group CEO, acting Group CEO was around at the time.  So I do not think anything happened of it.    H’m.    Ja.    Chairperson, a... as the legal function, we have been under siege ever since uh-uh Dr Pop Molefe initiated the... the investigation process and PRASA.   And unfortunately, the role that we played within the organisation, I guess everybody assumed that we were the enemy, you know, in dealing with the matters. Our role was to deal with the matters as... as... as they happened and uh, obviously, we were not necessarily involved in the investigations per se because they were run by the board. But when it came to litigation and in disciplinary matters, the legal function was quite involved.  And... and if you... if you recall Chairperson, the second affidavit of Siyangena was deposed to by me. Now, I... I... I am a colleague and... and... and, you know, I sit with these colleagues within... within exco and uh, clearly people complaint about me uh, and they took it that I did what I did in my capacity as Martha Ngoye and not in my capacity as the Group Executive Legal, Risk and Compliance on behalf of PRASA. So a lot of people because they found themselves to be found wanting as a result of these uh-uh investigations and the outcome thereof.  They took issue with me personally and reported me, you know. At one instance, two of my colleagues reported me to the chairperson to the... uh-uh, to the... to the Judge Makhubele... uh, Chairperson Makhubele. And that too became such an issue within the organisation that I did not even have authority, you know, to deal with these matters on behalf of PRASA.   So, you know, all these investigation and all these litigations that required us as a legal function to deal with uh, stood us in negative effect with the organisation. And I guess uh, the powers that be also, you know, would use this when they found us being a nuisance of some sort to relation to matters which they wanted to do with.   So they would bring it back, you know uh, ever so often as to how, you know, the legal function has conducted itself.  And I guess for me Chairperson, the law firm that... that... that was referred to uh, by... by... by Dr Sishi there.  For me it could only be one law firm and that was the Werksmans Law Firm, you know. I mean, I... I think I have been accused of many things as far as the Werksmans Law Firm is concerned.  And when I stepped back and think about it, I think [laugh] when the board decided to... to appointed the... the... the law firm, I was not even there. I was on suspension but they forget about that.  But because it had to deal with the legal uh-uh, firm, Martha Ngoye is involved and... and therefore... So I... I mean, I must say, I... I guess I was state enemy number one in... in... in PRASA as far as these matters were concerned and that is why I think he felt bold to bring this up because I guess he... he just also probably felt that uh, these matters needed to be dealt with in a particular way and we were being difficult.  This the Group CEO at the time.    H’m.    Was dealt with.    Ja.    H’m.    H’m.     H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    From other...    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    What was right.    H’m.    Ja.    Ja.    H’m.    Ja.    H’m.    Ja.    Ja.  But also Chair, I think what... what comes to my mind and... and what... what is troubling is the fact that in almost all instances the people that behave in this manner are the people that say they are fighting corruption.    And... and fighting corruption.    We can unpack that.    To say, “what is that you are fighting?”    You are removing the people that you know are a nuisance...[intervenes]     ...and will stop you from doing what you want to do under the guys that you are fighting corruption.    As I say and I am... I am happy to deal with my... my special leave Chairperson.    I was painted and tainted as this corrupt official.    Only to be brought back...[intervenes]     ...to PRASA without even being charged.    Chairperson.    But when you go to Google...[intervenes]     ...you will not find Martha Ngoye.    The first thing you will find under Google is.. is corruption and... and so on.    Allegations which were never proven.    Now as an employee, I do not have the powers to go after the... you know...[intervenes]     ...to go to the media and say the Board of PRASA together with the Group CFO of PRASA have tainted me.    You know, I fought internally and nothing gets done.      In fact, they just disregard the issues that I raised.    Even referring to the policies within the organisation.    It has been a nightmare Chairperson.    If one must say.  Um, but the reality is, I guess, if you believe in what you are doing...[intervenes]     ...you will continue to do so.    But um, it... it is not fair.    And... and I must state it ...[intervenes]     ...that the manner in which some of this has been conducted...[intervenes]     ...has really caused um, us um, a lot of funeral... heartache.    But we are there.  And I guess for me, it is always been about the... the... the... commuter Chairperson.    And I always ask myself “why are you still at PRASA?”    And when I think about the plight of our people out there...[intervenes]     ...is to say somewhere somehow maybe, you know, some of us will remain to... to get this organisation right.    For the sake of our people.    Because nobody speaks for them.  They are not an ...[intervenes]     You know, it is just... it is just for me.  It... it... it... it is one of those things Chairperson that... that really has... it... it lives with me on a daily basis.      To say, I do not know what it is that I am doing wrong.    Or that people detest me in the manner that they do...[intervenes]     ...to have me be subjected to what I have been subjected to within the organisation.    But be that as it may Chairperson.  I mean, you know, I believe in what I believe in.    H’m.    H’m.    Sorry, ja.    H’m.    Well, Chairperson, you know, it just did not make sense for me, actually, what he meant because especially in relation to these matters, Siyaya. I had dealt with the executives um you know, responsible for... for those specific areas where Siyaya was owing all the money.  And those executives were right here.   They say, “we do not own Siyaya money”.  I... so I did not know what he was talking about to uh, as far as that was concerned.   And I was very clear in my mind to say, at the end of the day, as the legal function, we do not also just attend to matters where we do not have uh, where our prospects of success are not... are not there Chairperson. We engage with the business quite extensively.  The only understanding that I had where he speaks about employees not being happy, for me were those matters were those employees who were found wanting within the organisation, were being dealt with. And what was interesting Chairperson was that in those matters and Mr Dingiswayo can speak to this, he was the... the... the witness of PRASA who managed to have those employees, you know, being dismissed but obviously, that is not been spoken about.   It is always, you know, the powers that be that... that are fighting corruption.  So the work that the legal function did was never recognised as far as these work... this work was concerned. But those people that felt that they needed to complain about us, you know, would use that opportunity when they realised that uh, under the powers that be, also did not necessarily support the work that we were doing. So if you unpack it Chair, I just listened and I thought “okay, it is just one of those again but be it as it may”.      That is correct Chair.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja..    That is correct Chair.  I mean, I have just proven.  Mr Gansho is out of the organisation today because it was found that in the Siyangena matter he benefited with the property in Durban.   You know, I was not there, you know, when these things were happening but I mean, the fact that now it was the legal function that was running with this matter, just it was the legal function that... that had a vendetta against Mr Gansho.  It is always absurd things.    It would.  And also those Chair, those that were still around whose matters had not been finalised because obviously, some of the matters are still happening even now, you know.  Um, so they had not been finalised.    He would.    Yes, Chair.    Well, he... he... he... no, he had not done that Chair...[intervenes]     No, not actually that he attempted to... to do it but... but uh, the CEO before him uh, mister uh...[intervenes]     Mr Sithole.    Sithole.  Uh, Chair, I... I... I have been taken to the cops.  I have been, you know, subjected to arrests.    Because of the work that I did.    And as the CEO at the time, he believed that it was necessary for the board to deal with me in a particular way.    Let me say, I stood my ground Chairperson.    And... and nothing came of that.    Because, once again, you know, I had identified an area within the organisation.  This is not part of my evidence Chair but I am just saying.    I had identified an area within the organisation     ...organisation where there was corruption of the highest note.    Uh, in relation to us dealing with um, components...[intervenes]     ...within the organisation.  At the time, I was the acting CEO of PRASA Rail Chairperson.    And this issue had come to me.    Then I was accused of assaulting an employee.    One of the things that I said to the board Chairperson, I said, “Chairperson, if I in my capacity as the Group CFO of... of... of... I mean, C... the acting CEO of PRASA Rail and the legal person for them, had done so, I would have handed in my resignation”.    I would not even, you know, uh-uh-uh oppose to this thing.    I had the cops come to fetch me there at PRASA...[intervenes]     ...because of this allegation.  The Group CEO was pursuing this issue with a particular employee that was there...[intervenes]     ...that had alleged that I assaulted her in a meeting filled with eight people Chairperson.    Who came back and said there was no such assault.    But he believed that I did.    Because I had clearly pinned something that he possible was involved in.    But because I had found that, I... I was really a nuisance.    So all these... all these things Chairperson come and... and I reported these things to the board.    I... I made reference to these things to the board.    In fact, the person that was prosecuted was me and not necessarily the person that I had indicated to have possible been involved in the corruption in relation to those matters.    To that person, that nothing was done.    But I was somebody who was vilified within the organisation and... and... and treated as though as I am the one that is causing problems within the organisation.    That is correct, Chair.  Ja.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Can  read it, I think it is – let me read it,     “This cannot be in the best interest of  PRASA, for our experience is that the settlement route is adopted not only when influential persons are involved but is extended to others as well, to PRASA’s grave prejudice.  Allied to this is the pattern of appointing people in acting capacities and such persons are easily manipulated.” People get scared, Chair, and we have seen it.  You know, I mean, when Mr Montana fired me he appointed a guy who did not have a legal experience to head up the legal function.     When I was fired in 2015 by Mr Montana, the person who acted in my stead was actually a gentleman who reported to me and had no legal background.  He was petrified.   He was petrified.  I mean, because immediately after that what he was required to do was to sign invoices of law firms that they knew, Mr Montana knew, were not agreed to sign.  So the unfortunate, you know, gentleman, was subjected to that and found himself signing, but petrified.     No, I did not, I am just saying, you know, as just as an example of …[intervenes]     There were, Chairperson, but he went and got somebody who was not a lawyer.     To come and head up the legal function.     Mr Thokolo Mohlake..     He is still there.  He reports to me.  He is the general manager responsible for insurance.     At the time, yes.     Sure.     How he felt and that.     Ja.     Sure.     And then I say, Chair    They have, Chairperson, the matter is in the Cape Division and it is before Judge Erasmus.     Well, they are waiting for judgment, Chairperson, my understanding is that we are waiting for judgment.     Yes, that matter has been argued.  In fact, the judge had requested the parties to go and settle the matter but I understand that there was no settlement reached, so one does not know where it is now.     Yes, Chair.  In fact, we are currently dealing with that matter.  Mr Mashaba brought obviously a liquidation application to have Swifambo Leasing and some of its companies …[intervenes]     Yes, liquidated.  He wanted it to be a voluntary liquidation.  So we joined as PRASA and said no, it cannot be voluntary, it needs to be compulsory.     So we intervened there and the liquidator was appointed.  So the liquidator is in the process of dealing with getting monies back for PRASA.  In fact what has happened is that about six, seven locomotives were sold as part of the liquidation process but obviously, Chair, if you look at the amount of money that was paid by PRASA, 2.6 billion, what the liquidator has in his account right now is only R65 million in relation to the six locomotives that he has sold.   There are others obviously that are still in Spain that did not come through because we only received 13 of the locomotives.  So there are seven that is here, that must still be dealt with and there was one that was involved in an accident. What is actually interesting with that matter, Chair, as we speak, is that we still have attorneys on board that are representing PRASA on that and obviously we cannot let that matter go, Chairperson.   What we are dealing with currently is the fact that Mr Mashaba – this is also a Mashaba – is busy bringing application after application to try and prevent this matter from – the liquidators from actually, you know, carrying out their function. The latest is that initially obviously our claim, he opposed the fact that we, as PRASA, were entitled to bring a claim.  We are the biggest creditor, Chairperson, you know, for that amount of money.  We had to fight that and so we are in the process of dealing with those matters and it is preventing obviously the liquidators from continuing with their work in relation to dealing with that and coming – and finalising it because they have to deal with all these various applications that Mr Mashaba keeps bringing. In fact, right now one of the matters that we are dealing with is him challenging the appointment of the liquidators themselves.  It is very convoluted.  You know, one minute he is challenging the appointment of the liquidators, the next minute he is saying to PRASA you are supposed to join forcefully in the proceedings and so it is so – it is a delaying tactic that is there but I think from a PRASA perspective, Chairperson, we have not let that matter go, we are dealing with trying to get our monies back.     SCA was 20…     ‘17/’18, ja.      ’18.     Ja, 2018, I think.  Ja, ’18, I think, Chair.  So there has been those delaying tactics.     Whatever it takes, yes.     Yes, ja.     That is right, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     It is, Chair.  You know, we have had a challenge, Chair, and I am sure you would have known where our lawyers withdrew for non-payment issues and it is a known fact that PRASA has struggled with finances and one of the law – the law firm that is dealing with this matter pulled out because their fees were not paid.  But we have since managed to sort those issues out and, you know, we have made it clear that these are the matters that we cannot afford not to deal with, within PRASA. So there is a cage management process that has been dealt with also by our senior counsel, you know, with the liquidators to ensure that all these, you know, little matters that are brought by Mashaba can be dealt with in one so that we do not have to waste time.     Sure.     Sure.     Yes, Chair.     Ja.     That is right, Chair.  Ja.     Yes, Chair.     Sure.       Because it has been frustrating for so long where the evidence has been there.     Chairperson, you know, it has been so frustrating dealing with the Hawks because they come back with the same issues all the time and you just do not understand what they want.  For me the experience has been, you know – and it is with the greatest respect that one has, that we have in certain instances been given people where you can see this …[intervenes]     No, they are not up to it, Chairperson.      We have given information and they come back and they say we have not given information.  But, you see, the other issue that we found at least as a legal function to be problematic is that since the Chairperson, Popo Molefe’s board left, everybody that has subsequently come in has come in and they have excluded the legal function when they deal with these matters. We were the ones that would go to the Hawks and we would know what documentation was given to the Hawks.     So naturally when we are not there they will tell whoever they tell, who is meeting with them, what they want and they would not be, you know, countered on the information that they are given.  So those delays have been there within the organisation and they have been frustrated to say we are there.     Even during Ms Kweyama’s board.     They want to meet the Hawks to the exclusion of the legal function, I mean – and when we met with the head, Hermione, and told her what she know, she was astounded because she said in a meeting that she had with the board, it is like they did not know what they were talking about.  You see, they would not have known because they were not there.  We do not understand why they left us out.     No.     No, Chairperson.  What we offered in all respects, if anything, was to say to the board these were the investigations that were done.  We would then invite the law firm, Werksmans, to come and give the board a summary of what had transpired because obviously it has been a subject of a lot of interest to say what has happened but what you found, Chairperson, is that as they met with, you know, the senior people with the Hawks, you know, General Khana, I remember they met – they went to a meeting with General Khana and we have met so many times this General Khana and we know what information General Kana is saddled with but he in that meeting told the Chairperson of the board that we had provided nothing, no information to them about the Swifambo and the Siyangena and they could not obviously countenance that because they were not there to say no, but that is not true, that is not what we know. So when you find that these things are happening what do you do, Chairperson, you know, you just suppose, leave it.     Yes.     Well, in fact, Chair, I have insisted that I be allowed to do that because it has been frustrating and the administrator has arranged a process internally that he has given the head of the human capital, the executive responsible for HR within the organisation to be the person that deals directly with the Hawks.  So if the Hawks want to talk to any of us they would via through them. So I made it very clear that I am not meeting with these people, I want the senior people within the Hawks because I have been here before.     And I met not so long ago, about last month, I think, Chairperson, I met with the Brigadier General, Makinyana(?) who we had met with then when Dr Popo Molefe was the Chairperson.  I said to him, I said but Tata Makinyana you cannot come to me now but what I found interesting, Chairperson, was the fact that when the State Capture sat and they heard the evidence that I had given around Siyangena, they came back full force to say no, Martha, we want to give – we want to meet with you, we want to – we heard your evidence at the State Capture.  And I was saying guys, this is not acceptable, you have had this information, what has happened?  Why have you not dealt with these matters? I mean even last week Friday I had a meeting with Colonel Trollip and I said to Colonel, Colonel, I am here to help, you know, I know the information, should you need anything, let us talk, these things have been outstanding for a while.  He has given one assurance that, you know, something will be done but one must see it happening, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chair.      Yes.     We can do that.     Will do that, Chair.     Will assist.     Ja.     2018, yes.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.     Sure.     Will do. 
MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION:  [01
NGOYE: Ja, of this thing, you know, and …[intervenes]   And we have pushing the Hawks, Chairperson, to do their work as well.
