CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Chaskalson, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes we will continue to use Bundle 7    And 8 okay alright.  Good morning Dr Weiss can you hear me?    Okay thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you very much.  Mr Chaskalson.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes ja please do it again.    Thank you very much Mr Van Zyl.    Thank you very much.  Mr Chaskalson I wanted to say either this lamp is not positioned the way it is normally positioned or the screen has been moved.  The – so I am trying to manage that so I can see him.  I am looking at the technical people I think they know what they need to do.  Is it fine like this?  Oh okay alright.  Okay thank you Mr Chaskalson.    Oh you cannot see us?    Oh.  Okay.  Shall we – shall we adjourn for five minutes?      Well we can see you so – and we do see your counsel.    When he stands up as well.  Okay alright.    Mr Chaskalson.    Do you know whether whatever the delay is may – we might see – he might see us while we – he is giving evidence or is it going to – to take too long?    Oh okay no that is alright, that is alright.  Let us continue.  If it is going to – if it is able to come in as we continue let us do that.  And if there is going to be a need to adjourn for whatever that might need to be adjusted we will do that.  So Dr Weiss at least I – we are told that after five minutes or so you should be able to see us.  Okay alright.    I see Mr Chaskalson wants to retort.     I am sorry Dr Weiss and Mr Chaskalson ...[intervenes]      Sorry, mister...  Dr Weiss.  I think the two of you knew what Mr Chaskalson’s question was but he did not finish it and Dr Weiss responded.  [laughs]  You were asking Mr Chaskalson whether – when they started the work at the beginning of the year, they started it on a certain basis but you did not finish saying what the basis was. ADV CHASKALSON     The two of you forgot about me.  [laughs]       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  That is what you were confirming Dr Weiss.  Is that correct?     Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  I have also looked at that letter at page 898.  So.  Okay you may continue Mr Chaskalson.     That is bundle 8, hey?  Mr Chaskalson?     Oh, bundle 7 and what is the page?     Yes.     Okay, bundle 8B, the page is 185?     1185. We are at quarter past eleven, Mr Chaskalson.  One thing, we could take a tea break now but if you are close to finish we could take the break after you are done.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, let us continue.  Okay.     Yes.     Well, it is writing [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     08/1185 but we just say 1185, we do not call FOF08.     That is 1200?     Oh, only 1200.  Okay.     And 3 point?     Ja.     Mr Chaskalson, I know you may be left with a few questions but there is a reason for us to adjourn for a short time, only ten minutes.  Let us adjourn for ten minutes and then we come back and try and finish.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you very much Dr Weiss, let me ask whether Mr van Zyl intends to re-examine on anything.     Okay, alright.  No thank you very much, then it remains for me to thank Dr Weiss for availing himself and thank everybody, I will now excuse him and I will excuse you Mr van Zyl as well.     Yes Dr Weiss?     Yes, yes.     Thank you very much Dr Weiss, you are now excused, thank you.  Mr Chaskalson that is the only witness you had for today?     Yes, we are going to adjourn for now, just for the benefit of the public I will return at two o’clock to listen to the evidence Mr Zwane at two o’clock, who did not finish his evidence previously and he will come back to finish it and then later in the afternoon, or early evening I will listen to the evidence of Mr Koko from Eskom who did not finish his evidence at least we will deal with the evidence relating to the suspensions.  We might not get beyond that and he might have to come back some other time, so we will resume at two o’clock. We adjourn.     Good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good afternoon everybody.     Yes, good afternoon Mr Zwane.     Thank you for coming back to complete the part of your evidence that we must deal with today, I think you will still come back for other parts of evidence on other matters, okay.  I think registrar let us just administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you.   Is Mr Zwane legally represented today?    Okay his counsel/attorney can place himself on record just from where you are will be fine.     Thank you very much.  Okay, alright.  Mr Zwane we will try and use the time we have optimally and that might mean me being a little stricter than I was last time on answers so obviously important things feel free to articulate what you need to articulate but because of time we must just try and make sure that answers as far as possible are straight to the point but nothing I say now means you must not make points that you feel are important to make.        Yes, yes, no that is alright.  Mr Pretorius?     I am sorry Mr Pretorius maybe for the benefit of the public you could start by just saying where we are with his evidence and what it relates to just so that they can follow.       Yes, no that is fine.     Is your issue simply that you asked a question and you did not propose even though your question may have suggested that that is what you had in mind should be done?         Yes, I understand what you mean I just want to make sure.         It seems to me that your issue might just be that you did not put it as a proposal.      But in substance you may have put a question that conveyed to them that you were thinking that that is the way to go.  Would you accept that as fair, as a fair interpretation of what may have happened?     Yes.       Yes, well at least I think that clarifies my own mind because I was thinking if I say to Mr Pretorius why do we not adjourn now obviously he will think I am thinking that we should adjourn.        I leave it at that, Mr Pretorius.      Just to put some context in regard to that last question from Mr Pretorius he said you said this namely that he would walk next to his shoes.  He said you said this in the context of saying if he did not, if he was not prepared to implement the plan or to go along with the plan he would need to resign and obviously he would be without a job and he would then find himself walking next to his shoes.  You understand the context?  Mr Pretorius is my recollection is it correct?       Yes, you never said anything along those lines?      Okay, Mr Pretorius.      Okay.      I think he is reading from his notes.      The 18 t h of November.      Okay he says it deals with the 18 t h of November Mr Pretorius.      Yes but I am not sure that I understand what point you wanted to make.    MR     I just want to make sure that I know if there is a particular point you are trying to make.      Okay, okay.  Mr Pretorius.    But he said when we told you that he had already made arrangements I think for a holiday I think from last time, you, you – I thought you said you understood.  So you had no issue with the fact that he was not going to be around because the arrangements for his holiday had already been made.    Mr Pretorius.    Ja.    Ja, no, that’s fine.    In?    Okay.    Ja, Mr Pretorius, I then note there against that paragraph which says the witness, which would be Mr Mokoena, says reference to document is a mistake.      I am saying …    Ja.  I think you are, you were, you were basing your question to the second paragraph under paragraph 27, at page 348.  Is that right?    Yes.  I am saying that I then note, a marginal note that I made when Mr Mokoena was giving evidence which says in relation to that paragraph, that witness says reference to document in that part of the paragraph is a mistake.  Did you recall anything along those lines?    Yes.    Maybe your team could just check.  I, I certainly have a note.  Initially I think before the witness said anything, I put a question mark and then I have a note that says, witness says reference to document is a mistake.      So, so I just mentioned that in case that is what the witness may have said.      Yes.    Yes.  Of course, even afterwards once the position has been established a question could be put to Mr Zwane but put a supplementary affidavit and deal with a question on that paragraph if necessary.      Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Well of course if the advanced payments were stopped after that meeting with the national minister, that could have or would have interfered with the plan to ensure that by the end of the financial year a certain amount of progress had been made in the building of houses and the spending of the money on housing, is it not?    I’m going to stop you.    Because my question was simply whether you would accept that if the advanced payment was stopped, that would mean the building of houses further would have to stop, because and that the spending of the money allocated for housing would also – it would mean that by the end of the financial year the department might not have used all the money that had been set aside for houses.  But I think your answer is, you are simply saying well there is correspondence that the, there was a decision to take the money away.  But I thought you could say yes, that would be the, that would be the effect of stopping advanced payment or no, that would not be the effect.      Yes, yes.    Okay, alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay, okay.    Alright.    Well do you know, even if you don’t know that he may have been the sole director, do you know him to have been part of that entity.    Oh but you do not know him to be connected to any particular company or entity?    Ja okay alright.    Okay.    On that list because I would have assumed that it had gone through processes and it is correct for them to be there.    Of course you did testify that although you might not when you came to the department you might now have known about the Housing Act.  You did know the – you did know about the PFMA and you did know about – ja you did know about the PFMA and you had an understanding of that, is that correct?    Is my recollection of your evidence correct?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja okay.      You are saying that your last evidence was that …    You corrected yourself and you said you knew about the Housing Act.    Is that right?    Okay and you had an understanding of it or you just knew about it?    Housing Act.    You understood it as well.    Oh okay alright.  But you – my focus is the PFMA.    You – you – am I correct in understanding that what you said last time was that you had an understanding of the requirements of the PFMA?    Yes.  Now was it your understanding that if there is a data base – if there are companies who are on the department’s data base there is no need to go on open tender or was your understanding that the two are not inconsistent with each other.   The fact that you have a data base of companies does not mean – does not exempt you from going on open tender when you are supposed to go on open tender.  What was your own understanding of the position?    That data base.    Yes ja.    Ja the list.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Open tender process.    Okay just to – to summarise that.  Am I correct in saying what you are saying is after talking to them about this data base of list phenomenon.   Your understanding was that once companies or entities had been included in the data base or in the list one that would be for five years.    And two there would be no open tender process in respect of each project that might come up.    Within the five years and – but your understanding was that before a company or companies were put onto the data base there would be a competitive process.    So therefore your understanding was that in respect of the building of houses during any particular term five year term it is in order for companies that are on the data base to be given contracts to build houses without any further open tender process, is that correct?    Ja okay.  Mr Pretorius.    Sorry Mr Pretorius maybe we should take a short adjournment I see it is four o’clock.    Ten minutes and then we can continue.    What is your estimate?    I am not putting pressure I just…    Ja no, no that is fine – that is fine.    Okay we will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.     Yes.     Okay.       Yes, Mr Zwane.       Well, thank you very much Mr Zwane.  On all the information that I am aware of for now in the dealings between the Commission and yourself, the information I have is definitely that you have been cooperating.  That you have given this Commission cooperation.  So on the information that I have, certainly that appears to be the position.   And you are right that you were meant to appear only later and you were called and asked whether you could come earlier and you and your legal representatives agreed and we are grateful for that.   Because there was a challenge which had happened but because you were able to come earlier, we are going to be able to also – I am going to be able to hear another witness.  And if you had come at four o’clock, there might have been a clash.   So on the information I know, you certainly have cooperated.  And we appreciate that you express – you feel free to express that you feel that you have been treated properly by the Commission.  We will always try.  Maybe we will not always be seen to be succeeding but certainly we will always be trying.   Thank you very much.  As you say, you will still come back because there is still some outstanding business and ...[intervenes]      [laughs]  So.  But thank you for all the compliments you have given to the Commission.  And we also wish you an enjoyable festive season.   We will try and make sure that we do not remember you on the 23r d of December or the 24t h and call you to come and finish the outstanding business.  We will try and remember you in January or beyond that.  [laughs].   Okay thank you.  And we – I take it that your legal representatives do not intend to – do not wish to re-examine? RE-EXAMINATION BY THE LEGAL     Yes, thank you.  So you are now excused.  Thank you very much.       I think I must adjourn to allow the new evidence leader for the evening session to set up so that then I will come back and hear the next witness.       Yes.  Otherwise, from your side, you and your team are also excused.     And Mr Zwane’s legal representative is also excused.  Okay.  We will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon, Mr Seleka.  Good afternoon everybody.     Yes.  Are we ready?     Yes.  Please administer the oath.  Good afternoon Mr Koko.   Administer the oath, registrar, or affirmation.     Yes, please switch on your mic Mr Barry.     Yes, okay.     Is it not the secretary the person?     Is it not the Secretary of Commission?     H’m?     Oh, what does it – do you remember what it says?     Yes.     I ...[intervenes]      I have no recollection of seeing them but that does not necessarily mean they have not been placed on my desk?     Especially if they are not recent, they may be on my desk and still to be seen but it is good that you have said now.     Ja, ja.     Yes.     Well, as I said the other time.  If it is information that we do have and it is relevant and there are no grounds why you should not be given, such information should be made available.  It, ordinarily, should not even be necessary to resort to the act but I am not criticising you for resorting to it for the reasons you have.   But there is no reason why, in principle you should not be given any information that is relevant to your client’s evidence if we have information.  Unless there are special grounds.     And if there are special grounds, then one can deal with those.     Okay, no fine.     Yes. ADV BARRIE     Yes. ADV BARRIE     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Just one second Mr Barrie.  The aircon is quite noisy but I do not know if it is without it, it might be too hot.  How is the...?  Is it hot?     You are fine?     Maybe if you do not switch it off completely, at least if you – can you down it a little bit.  That would help.  Before you continue Mr Barrie.  Registrar, give these documents to the secretary and say he must discuss them with me.  Okay.  Yes?     Yes.     No, no.  That is fine.  My understanding, given the time that we are commencing, is that we will try and finish evidence at least relating to the suspensions today.  It appears from what I have been told that there is someone to have said Mr Koko must come in the morning at ten o’clock but it said he must come at four.   The witness that I was hearing earlier on, Mr Zwane, was the one who was arranged to come at four o’clock.  So it looks like...  Well, Mr Seleka is the one who knows.  It looks like some problem happened.  And if mister...   If the summons had said ten o’clock, it may have been possible to cover more than the issue of suspensions because we would have had the whole day but now we do not.  But the – an arrangement will be made for Mr Koko to come back in due course to cover whatever else we will not have been able to cover today.       There is no reason why they cannot – they should not be dealt with at the same time, as far as I am concerned.  I see Mr Seleka nods.  So I think that is the idea.     Ja, ja.  Okay.       H’m?     Yes.  You confirm that you nodded?     [laughs]       Okay alright.     Okay let us proceed then.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, I got it.     Ja.     I am sorry Mr Seleka.  There was something I wanted to say while Mr Barrie was on his feet which I forget.  I just want to...     Mr Barrie, I just want to confirm that I did read the letter that you handed up last time.  Remember the letter that you handed up?  I did read it.  I did ask the legal team to ensure that they respond to the letter insofar as anything that relates to them.   But it would help – I know that in the letter you talk to your client through your attorneys, talks about the various matters or things that he would like to be done or he wish to be done but he says they have not been done and so and so on.   I – it would help me a lot if there was a chance that a separate document would be prepared that gives – say there is a clear list of the kind of things that we are asking for.   Probably, if one goes through the letter – it is just it is not a short letter, it is quite lengthy – one can get them.  But     You know, if one has that list, then one     If there is a chance that we could get something like that that would be helpful.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, ja.     Ja, ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  No, if we could get that.  But also it will help me because then I can just look at the list     H’m.     Yes, yes.     Okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.       No, that is fine.     Yes, yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  Certainly, we may – certain things might not happen or might not be done at a certain time, but as far as I know, there is no reason to say we are not doing this because we have a certain narrative.   In 2018, there is a clear letter or memo that I sent to the Head of the Legal Team and the Head of the Investigation Team and that memo, amongst other things, said the Investigation Team and the Legal Team must make sure that they follow evidence.   It does not matter who it leads to.  No matter what his position was before, what his position is now, what his position is likely to be in the future.  If the evidence leads to that person, they must do that.  And nobody must be spared.  There is a specific memo that says that.       Okay thank you.  I am sorry Mr Seleka.  I interrupted you.       [No audible reply]      H’m.  Yes, to the extent that he may have said that, Mr Seleka, he might have meant it was raised during the meeting of the 11t h.     Not when the minister was there but maybe the one that came after.     But of course, that can be checked with him.     Yes.  No, but what I was saying was something different because you have made that point.     What I was saying is.  To the extent that you may have said as Mr Seleka was saying.  You may have said that issue was raised during the meeting of the board on the 11t h.  You may have meant during the meeting of the board after the minister had left.     Ja.     But I was saying, he could check with you whether that is what you meant.     Okay.       Well, I must check whether you heard evidence that said that she did not instruct or whether you     Yes, did you hear evidence this week of Mr Khoza who said the minister – I think he said something like he wanted us to read between the lines.     And I asked him whether he could say that by implication the minister was instructing and he said yes by implication.  Did you hear that evidence?     Okay.     Ja.     Busy.     Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.  But certainly, there has been a lot of evidence to the effect that the minister made it clear that she cannot – she could not instruct the board.  And then of course, what each member of the board would make of what she said is another matter but that line was there.     Yes.     Ja.  No, that is fine.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes, okay.   I think what Mr Koko has been emphasising, whenever you have raised that question.     Is that, he did not raise it on the 11 t h.     But he raised it later on.     Ja, so ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja.     Okay continue Mr Seleka.     What page?     Yes, I found it.     Let him finish, Mr Koko.  That statement is unqualified, there is no qualification to the statement.  You understand what I mean?     Just before you proceed, Mr Koko – do not forget the point you point you want to make.  Mr Seleka, do you know whether prior to paragraph 1.4 Mr Tsotsi in his affidavit has indicated what he believed the reason for his suspension was?     Where do we find that?     Paragraph 79?     Okay.  I just want to…     Well, I will not need to – I just want to quickly – 26 you said?     In effect does he say that he believed that it was Mr Tsotsi?     I am sorry?     We are Mr Koko’s affidavit, I have asked whether prior to paragraph 154 of Mr Koko’s affidavit, which is the paragraph on which Mr Seleka is asking him, whether – you follow now?     Oh, no, no.     No, no.  So, Mr Seleka, in those paragraphs does Mr Koko say he believes that he was suspended because of Mr Tsotsi?     Page 35?  Yes, 114.     “This was only a ruse, Mr Tsotsi wanted  to get rid of me because I suspended Mr Sikhasimbe”   Yes.  Okay, alright, I wanted – I think, Mr Seleka, you are free to pursue the line you pursue and Mr Koko will explain or defend what he said or the way he was.     But maybe there is a possibility that when the paragraph is read in context it may be that having said what he believed the reason was for his suspension in earlier paragraphs it may be that he was saying well, if what has been officially said as the reason why we were being suspended is true then maybe blah blah blah blah.  But I am just saying, you know?     But you must feel free to pursue but Mr Koko was answering and I interrupted him.  Do you want to finish your answer?     Just hang on one second because you mentioned that point even last time.  If you team, Mr Seleka, or even Mr Barrie, if they are able to – if somebody is able to go to that part of Mr Linnell’s evidence where he says what Mr Koko says, I would like to look at that but not necessarily now.     But in due course.  Continue, Mr …[intervenes]     Yes.     In Pretoria.     Yes, yes, Mr Linnell.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, yes.     No, no, not at Nkandla at the Durban official residence of the President.     Durban, ja.     On the 8 t h.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Ja, just repeat what position so that it is clear.     Okay, no, I think that is confusing.     Yes, okay …[intervenes]     Okay, ja, no, that is fine.  Let us just get it clear …[intervenes]     Which position, appointed from when?  And when position appointed from when?     2015?     Okay, alright.  And then the other position?         Okay, alright.     So part of the point you make is that to the extent that at the Durban meeting on the 8 t h only three areas were identified that were to be investigated.  The area of which you were in charge was not one of them, is that the one?     But in March 2015?     Yes.     But the – you see, when you made the point that you made about when you became head of Generation and when you were head of the other portfolio …[intervenes]     I thought that the point you sought to make was that your portfolio that you occupied, which you were heading in March 2015 when this meeting in Durban took place was not one of the portfolios that were – one of the three portfolios that were mentioned and that may be – that is what I thought – that is where I thought you were going, that Mr Tsotsi brought it in because of your issues with him but from what you are saying, it looks like you accept that your portfolio which you were heading in March 15 was one of the portfolios that were mentioned, am I right?     It may be that you might say wrongly, it should not have been mentioned, but do you accept that factually it was mentioned or you know nothing of that.     Investigated.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, no, no, I understand that, I was simply saying I was not on another point which I thought you were pursuing, I was wanting just to have clarification that whether rightly or wrongly your portfolio was one of the three that were mentioned.  I think from what you are saying is they provided a wrong basis as far as you are concerned.     For including it.     Ja, okay.     Yes, Mr Seleka?     Sorry, what is …[intervenes]     Let me just hear the question, why…?     Oh, okay.     Yes, there was a recommendation by an independent chairperson.  There was a recommendation by a senior counsel who says guilty, dismissal. I …[intervenes]     You implemented that.     IMC or …[intervenes]     The Investment and Finance Committee.     Yes.     You said it is February 2015?     Ja.     Ja, okay.      Mr Seleka?     Mr Seleka, I am not sure that we should be really going much into …[intervenes]     The merits of whether Mr Sikhasimbe should or should not have been suspended or should or should not have been dismissed, so …[intervenes]     H’m?     Ja.     Ja please I think try and – ja because I do not want us to - because whether I think Mr Sikhasimbi should have been suspended or should not have been suspended or should have been dismissed or should not have been dismissed, I am not sure that it is something that has much bearing on anything.     I do not see his point.  Ja, I mean he may be quite interested in that because he was involved in that, but the Commission is really looking at other issues.  The only reason why his issue comes in is because Mr Koko says Mr Tsotsi sort my suspension because of that.     But Mr Tsotsi has not said because Mr Koko unfairly suspended Mr Sikhasimbi I wanted him suspended that is not suspension, ja.      Well I am sorry can I ask this Mr Koko following upon what you said earlier on in regard to Mr Mosongaai and with regard to Mr Linnell if…[intervene]        Mr Linnell and Mr Mosongaai.       Yes, based on what you are saying Mr Linnell’s evidence was which I think Mr Seleka confirms you are right that he mentioned to Ms Myeni at the Pretoria meeting something along the lines that he could not see how the investigation could be done without the heads of the particular portfolios being suspended which included your portfolio.   Number one if at the Durban meeting the person who  gave certain reasons why your portfolio should be investigated was not Mr Tsotsi but Mr Mosongaai does that not, don’t those two points suggest that the inclusion of your portfolio among the portfolios to be investigated and the idea that you should be one of the three executives mentioned or rather one of three executives whose portfolios were mentioned in Durban that should be suspended don’t those points suggest that the idea that you should be suspended did not originate from Mr Tsotsi.         That is the audios of the meeting.      The Durban meeting or?     Oh the 11 t h of March.      Oh yes, okay.      Yes, no we can come to that but do you accept that if you do not look at what was discussed at the meeting of the 11 t h if you just look at those two points you made.  Do you not accept that they seem to suggest that your inclusion or the inclusion of your portfolio among the portfolios to be investigated did not originate from him?       Ja.       Jut repeat at Mr Zola Tsotsi’s house.       Ja.       Okay but when you say that, when you say you cannot rule out I understand that to mean I cannot assert it as a fact but I cannot exclude it as a possibility that they conspired.  Am I correct to understand you that way?         No I am not I just want to make sure that I understand you correctly.       Yes, okay but as you put it now it might be – you based that more on what Mr Tsotsi said on the 11 t h plus what you have testified happened involving you Mr Matona and Mr Tsotsi prior to the 11 t h.         Ja, okay alright. Mr Seleka.      Ja.      Okay.      Ja, I will give you a chance yes.     Well you had just said it is a matter that we are not aware of the matter.      That is the Koko hunt?                    Okay well the fact remains that that judgment was decided on local stand that remains it did not go into the merits.  There was a Mamelodi judgment which went into the merits so that part is factual, okay.          Yes.       Yes but Mr Koko all judgments of the Constitutional Court are public so that minority judgment is known.  Mr Seleka.        Ja okay, Mr Seleka.      Just raise your voice Mr Seleka.     Ja.     Page 46?     Hang on before you referred him to the paragraph he wanted to say something.     Okay, now it is important that we understand exactly what you say yes.  Ms Dlamini testified that she is the one that told Ms Molefe about the content of – well about the fact that you had called her to about the content of the discussion that she said happened between the two of you, so are you saying that to the extent that Ms Dlamini conveyed this to Ms Molefe Ms Dlamini is not being truthful or is mistaken or are you simply saying that well the fact that there was such a conversation between the two of them about this is rejected, or ...[intervenes]      Yes, but what I am saying ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.     Okay, no that is fine, yes, I think you made the same point last time about that ja.     Okay, Mr Seleka don’t forget the point you were pursuing please.      Well what you say Mr Koko with regard to your assertion that Ms Dlamini was mistaken to hear to say you had called her to a meeting at Melrose Arch, what do you say to this proposition that how come Ms Dlamini tells Ms Molefe something that is consistent with what Mr Masango tells Ms Kraai about in regard to him and tells Mr Marokane about and how come Ms Dlamini is mistaken about something that is consistent with what unbeknown to her from what I understand her position Ms Daniels tells, told somebody, I don’t know whether it was Mr Marokane or ...[intervenes]      Marokane about on the same day, so what you have is Ms Daniels says on the 10 t h tells Mr Marokane on the 10 t h of March 2015 Mr Koko called me to a meeting at Melrose Arch, where I met him and Mr Salim Essa, or maybe doesn’t go to the details of Salim Essa but he told – I was told, he called me to a meeting in Melrose Arch where I heard that four executives are going to be suspended.   Mr Abram Masango also testifies and says on the same day I got a call from Mr Koko as well and he called me to Melrose Arch and there in that meeting I was told that four executives would be suspended.   All of these people, as I understand the position, are acting independently of one another.   Ms Kraai says indeed that is what Mr Abram told me either it is the same day or the following day reported to me, Mr Dan Marokane also says I don’t know if it was a week or whatever later or two weeks that’s what Mr Abram Masango told me as well.     On the – okay ...[intervenes]      Okay so what do you say to the proposition that it looks very strange that Mr Marokane, that you spoke to her and you were at Melrose Arch on that day, you admit that you spoke to her, you called her, you admit you were at Melrose Arch but you are saying that in terms of the content of the conversation she is mistaken about you having said she must come to a meeting at Melrose Arch, but it so happens that there are these two other people who independently tell other people that same things, same calls were made to them and same discussion happened.  What do you say about that?     Yes, no, no, you must tell me, I am just saying from what I have heard or not heard that they ...[intervenes]      Ja, you must come to that ja.     Okay, I am sorry, I am going to ask you to repeat that, I don’t think I heard clearly.     Oh you mean you told her you were at Melrose Arch?     Yes, yes.     Okay, you still keep on saying Megawatt Park, Melrose Arch.     That is now Ms Daniels?    Yes now of course we dealt previously I think with the question that as at the 10 t h and 11t h March 15 you were still close Ms Daniels, you were still close to Mr Masongo.  So with regard to Mr Dan Marokane saying yes Mr Masongo did tell me.    Hang – hang on one second we will need to check up.  I am under the impression that he does.    But we need to check.  To the extent that he confirms that Mr Masongo did tell him during 2016 then we would need to look at why he would say that.  Mr Seleka is my recollection incorrect?    Ja.    Okay.  Mr Seleka.    Maybe I am mistaken.    Did he confirm that he was told by Ms Daniels.    He confirmed that.    What he did not – but was he asked about Masongo’s version that is Mr Dan Marokane?    Yes okay.    Okay.  Okay.  But he confirmed the one relating to …    Ms Daniels.    Yes.    So I think maybe the – what I would put – what I would want you to comment on that is limited to Ms Daniels and Mr Marokane.  Would you have a reason why Mr Marokane would confirm that Ms Daniels told her something in – on the 10 March if she actually did not tell him?    Did he have the reason?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay no that is fine.  Continue Mr Seleka.    Ja.    Ja let him finish ja    Yes.    Ja.  Okay Mr Koko you wanted to say something?    Yes let him finish – let him finish. Let Mr Koko finish.    Yes Mr Seleka.    Yes. Okay.    Well I am not saying ask the last question I just want to make sure that we are all on the same page.  We have – all have the same idea of how much time.    Still – you still need.  We are at twenty eight minutes to seven, what is your assessment of how much more time?    Yes.    Sorry.    Yes.    No hang on…    I did not take it seriously.    Ja.    No, no.    No, no, no.  What – no, no I do not think he meant it seriously.  The position is …    Ja, ja no.    No, no, no.  Let us talk about what your…    Ja what your assessment is of the time you need.    Okay no that is fine.    I just wanted to have an idea so that we all we know.    It might be a little more or less.    But I just wanted an idea.    Okay alright.    Okay alright.  Okay let us take ten minutes?    Five minutes will do.    But walking to where you might walk and coming back.    Ja okay.  Let us take a five minutes break then.    We adjourn.     Well, on my bundle there is not a 157 at page 46.  There is 167.     That is the one.  You said...     Oh, no.  I am terrible sorry.  This is page 46 of the affidavit, not the bundle.     So you mean the paginated pages?     No, that is fine.  That is fine.  Yes, okay I am there.     What bundle?     I have got paragraph 27.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Of the same?     Yes?     Page 37?     But before we go there.  I just want to ask.  Ms Molefe says that ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Hang on.  Let me say what I want to say first.  Then I will give you a chance.     Ms Molefe says at paragraph 28 of her affidavit that she received information from reliable sources or that she says that four of the general managers were called to Mr Essa’s office in Melrose Arch and that there they were told – informed of the suspensions that would take place the following day and that they should be ready to act in our stead.   Has somebody investigated this part, talked to those general managers, got more information? ADV SELEKA     H’m?     H’m.     But all I want to find out is whether this has been pursued to check with Ms Molefe who those managers were and talk to them to find out there is any truth that they were called to ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Okay.  You will, at some stage, draw my attention to where I must check if there is material here, arising out of that in this ...[intervenes]      Yes, ja.     But she should be able to...  Well, I...  She should be able to say ...[intervenes]      Or if she cannot tell you what the – who the reliable sources were ...[intervenes]      ...at least she should be able to tell you whether the four general managers are the people who ultimately acted or it is different people.  And they should be asked whether they were called to such a meeting.     Ja, okay alright.  Mr Barrie, what ...[intervenes]      Sorry?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.  Mr Barrie, you wanted to say something?     Ja.     Okay?     Mr Seleka, what do you say to that point?     But he says that they changed that.  He says that they ultimately said electronic is fine.     But his complaint is that you are now referring to a bundle that has not been provided to him.  That is his complaint.     [laughs]  He is saying it should have been provided earlier.  That is what he is complaining about.     Yes.     No, no.  He is complaining about now.  He says you are referring to Bundle 11.  He says Bundle 11 is not amongst the bundles that you made available to him before.       H’m.     H’m.     Well, but ...[intervenes]      But the principle that he is talking about is.  There is an agreement – at least he – they made the point and ...[intervenes]      ...they thought you had accepted the principle that they should be provided in advance ...[intervenes]      ...with the bundles that will be used in questioning their client.     And he says the use of Bundle 11 now ...[intervenes]      ...to question his client ...[intervenes]      ...when Bundle 11 has not previously been given to them, is unfair to them.     That is the point he is making.     Sorry, your voice is low again.     Yes, but he says you may have given that at some stage or the Commission might have done that at some stage.     But there comes a time when you inform him or you give them notice ...[intervenes]      ...we are going to use the following bundles to question your client.     So even if that affidavit may have been given to them at the stage of the 3.3 Notices, if you do not include it in your list when you say these are the ones we are going to use on that day, it is unfair that you know use it without them having had a chance to look at them.  It seems like a fair point to me.       Yes.     [laughs]       Well, if it is a fair point, it seems to me, you should not question Mr Koko using a bundle that they     Ja.     Ja, you can explain.     Yes, but you remember I said the point is.  You might – I might have 100 affidavits that you have given me in terms of 3.3 Notices.     But closer to the date when my client is going to be questioned, you give me notice that you are only going to use ten out of those 100 affidavits.  And then when I am at the hearing, having prepared only on the basis of the ten affidavits, you then go back and take – use another affidavit that I have not notice about.  Then that is the point.  So I might have that but I did not bring that because you did not include it as one of the literary you are going to use.     Okay I am not sure [laughs]   [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     H’m.     Ja.     H’m.     Yes.     Ja, ja.     Ja, but for ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     No, no.  That is alright.     Okay.  So I think Mr Barrie says okay for purposes of today, that is fine.     But for future, please give them the ...[intervenes]      ...all the materials that you use, ja.  Okay alright.       We are at seven o’clock.  I think we should try and wrap up if we can.     37.  Yes, continue.     Okay.     H’m?     Just say that again.     Okay.     Ja, I am not sure.  I think you are confusing me.     You said page 37 and I went there.  Then you said page 20.     Okay.       Paginated page 20.     Ja.     Ja, I am there.     Okay.     Ja, just ...[intervenes]      You can skip that.     Ja.     Sorry Mr Seleka.  I quickly have gone through ...[intervenes]      I am not sure what is different in that passage.     She says from what we have read in her affidavit.     The point that ...[intervenes]      ...is being made Mr Koko by Mr Seleka is that.  You said that miss...  Was it in regard to Ms Molefe or ...[intervenes]      Ms Molefe.     She gave – in reaction to her version, you said well you think she must be precognise by the investigators of this Commission.  I think Mr Seleka is saying, but here before this Commission was established, she was given the same version.  So how come you say she is giving this version because she has been precognise?     So are you then suggesting now that she gave that version to – in parliament because somebody, whether they were investigators or whatever, that they have dealt with her, also precognise her?     To...  So the investigators of this Commission and whoever was – may have been involved in regard to her parliamentary appearance, also did the same?     Ja.     Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.       Okay alright.  Mr Barrie, it may well be that you would want to re-examine at the end of everything or did you want to – do you have some re-examination for this evidence?     Yes.     Yes.     Handed up.     Oh.     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m?     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Ja.     Okay.     Yes.     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Well, I assume you have given one to …[intervenes]     Or you say the Commission already has?     Oh, okay, no that is fine.     Ja.  No, that is fine.     Okay.     Okay, thank you.     Okay.  No, that is alright.  Thank you very much to everybody.  Thank you, Mr Koko, thank you, Mr Barrie, thank you everybody, thank you Mr Seleka and your team and the staff.  We are going to adjourn now.  This is the last hearing of the Commission this year.  The next hearing will be next year in January and the date will be announced.  We adjourn. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Morning Chair.    Our witness this morning is Dr Weiss.  He is joining us from Germany remotely.    His statement is BB8 but before we admit it maybe we should swear him in and ask him to confirm the correctness of it?    7 and 8.    Thank you Chair.  Dr Weiss good morning.  Can we first confirm the correctness.    762.  There should be black numbering on the top left.    Okay Dr Weiss apparently if there is a delay in the commencement of the live stream are you happy to continue without seeing us but just hearing us?    Far from it Dr Weiss.    I am told it – five minutes I am told.    Dr Weiss before…    No I do not want to retort at all.  Maybe if we can get going by – could you briefly describe to the Chair who you are and what your role at McKinsey was in relation to projects in South Africa?  And I am thinking here of what you set out.    In paragraphs 1 and 8 of your statement.    Dr Weiss if I can just take you out of the – the train of your statement briefly and to ask you to answer a question which I also asked Dr Fine yesterday just to get out of the way.  Did you in any of your dealings relating to Eskom have any contact with Salim Essa?    Thank you Dr Weiss and with that out of the way can we address the first topic that we would like you to speak to today which was the process of on-boarding of Mr Anoj Singh when he moved from Transnet to Eskom and it is a topic that you address at pages 13 to – sorry paragraphs 13 to 15 of your statement.  Could you tell the Chair.    What happened in that regard.    Sorry Dr Weiss.    Sorry to interrupt Dr Weiss if at any stage you want to add anything beyond that which I am inviting you to say at this point please feel free.  This – this process to begin with is really getting you to put your statement on record and I do not want to determine what you do and do not say in that regard.  So do not feel constrained by a focus on my questions that you may regard as too narrow.    And can I ask who – who made the approach to Mr Singh in particular?  Did it come from McKinsey or did it come from Regiments?    Sorry to dwell on this point but you have mentioned Dr Fine and Mr Durr would Mr Sagar have been part of that client services team as well?    That may well have been my mistake not yours.  If it was I apologise.  Please continue.  Is that what – is that essentially all you would say by way of introduction to the topic of the role that you played in on-boarding Mr Singh?    No problem.  Then the second topic we asked you to address was the top engineers program or the turnaround program.  Can you tell the Chair first of all about the original top engineers program and then we will deal separately with the attempts to extend that program in 2015 and 16.hair first of all about the original top engineers program and then we will deal separately with the attempts to extend that program in 15 and 16.  Sorry can you speak to the Chairperson.    And Dr Weiss can you – I understand that in the course of 2015 there were formal negotiations between Eskom and McKinsey about an appointment for a new top engineer ’s contract between McKinsey and Eskom.  Can you tell the Chair about those negotiations and when they started and how they progressed?    And as I understand those negotiations commenced around July 2015, is that correct?    So in November 2015 even if the negotiations had been completed you did not sit with the signed document in your hands confirming that you had the appointment?    Was there any talk within McKinsey about going to Eskom leadership or to setting up a meeting with Eskom leadership to push through the signed appointment letter that McKinsey was looking for at that stage?     When you got your letter of instruction in December 2015, did you understand, at that point, that the issue of National Treasury approval was still pending?  That Eskom was still seeking National Treasury approval or that they had already been given National Treasury approval?     And then you start at work in January on essentially this basis that with Treasury approval the ...[intervenes]      Can I just ...[intervenes]      Can you talk briefly about the work that you did and the impact that that work had?     I am sorry ...[intervenes]      [laughs]  Sorry Chair.  I was asking Dr Weiss when they started in January, it was still on the basis the Treasury approval was pending and hopefully Treasury approval would be obtained, in which case, the risk based arrangement would be implemented.     But if Treasury approval was not obtained, then the fee structure would have to be revisited within the parameters ...[intervenes]      ...of what Treasury allowed.     Dr Weiss, can you tell the Chair a little about the nature of the work that you did and what impacts you were able to achieve within the time that the project ran?     Dr Weiss, certainly from my side.  I wholeheartedly accept that.  I cannot see many evidence to suggest that you did not do real work on the ground.  Can...  and those results that you have cited, speaks for themselves.   Can I take you to the next topic which is the engagements between McKinsey – or that McKinsey had with Regiments and Trillian.  It is a topic that you address from paragraph 37 of your statement.  Can you ...[intervenes]      Can you tell the Chair about that?     Can I just ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear.]     Sorry, Dr Weiss.  Can I interrupt at this point?     Am I correct in understanding that the first work that you did with Regiments at Eskom was not on the Top Engineers or Turnaround Programme.  It was actually on the, I think, the Corporate Plan or Business Plan as it is sometimes called.  Is that correct?     And when did the work on the corporate plan finish?     And am I correct that the Supply Development work that was done on that Corporate Plan was work that was done by Regiments, not Trillian?     Dr Weiss, can you then talk about the process that led to McKinsey terminating its relationship with Trillian?     Dr Weiss, you focussed on the BEE issue in relation to the termination and I accept that it was a very important issue along with the issue relating to ownership but it seems to me that there were other issues as well.  And can I take you to a series of letters that were written by McKinsey and in some places you?     It is starting with AW-11 at 927 because I would like you to explain to the Chair what those issues were because they seem to be quite important.  Page 927.       Sorry, Dr Weiss.  If I can just come in, to clarify what you are saying?  So they are assisting you or they were planning to assist you to oversee that procurement in the interest of Eskom.   At the same, as they were in a relationship with the Supply Development partner of one of the bidders in that relationship.  Is that a fair assessment of what you are describing?     And can I identify this sub-contractor that was the, potentially the problematic sub-contractor in relation to the procurement?  Was that E Gateway Global Consultants FZC or FCD, E Gateway?     And did you ever establish who E Gateway were or who the controlling party or who held the controlling interest in E Gateway?     We will deal with that separately in the Commission then.  Can I ask you also then to go to 932, AW-14?     Is this the letter that you were referring to where you placed on record your concerns about this conflict with Eskom?     And they never came back to with any clarification in this regard?     And do you know if ...[indistinct], who were the primary contractor on involved in that Duvha procurement issue, if they did work for Eskom – continue to do work with E Gateway for Eskom?     Then you talk...  Well, let me take you to a statement of Mr Sneader who was I think the CEO of McKinsey or held the most senior position of McKinsey, is at page 40 of this bundle, it is an annexure to Mr Mieszala’s statement.  Do you have a complete file number 7?     Bundle 7, bundle 7.     40.     Yes or 41.  41 in fact is the passage that I am interested in.     Dr Weiss, it is not necessary, it is literally a sentence that I want to refer you to and I can read it out to you.     So it is from the speech that Mr Sneader(?) made at Gordon Institute of Business Science, I think it was in 2018 and he is talking about mistakes that      “…as we wound down at Eskom in mid 2016 our client team continued to interact with Trillian at Eskom even after they had failed our due diligence and no contract existed between McKinsey and Trillian.  They should not have.” So what I want to ask you is why did McKinsey continue to interact with Trillian after Trillian had failed is due diligence and after Trillian had sent this March letter.     Was there any discussion about this at the time after the due diligence had failed and after the letter had been sent terminating the relationship?  Was there a discussion of how you were to proceed at Eskom?     Can I take you to two documents in relation to that new SD & L concept that you prepared and these are in file 8.  In fact, Chair, it is file 8B.  The first one is at 1185.     1185, Chair.     Chair, I am close to finishing.  I know also that Mr van Zyl has a commitment that he needs to get to at twelve.     But I do not propose to be much longer, would it possible to simply proceed?     Yes, that is correct and it is an email you address to Prish Govender at Eskom on 4 May 16.     Do you recall – if you read that email, do you remember sending it to Prish Govender?     And, as I understand it, this was your attempt to – I mean, at this stage there were two separate processes going on.  The one is that you had – you wanted to give expression to this new SDL idea that you had come up with to be incorporated in the contract.     And the other, of course, was the contract …[intervenes]     The contract had not yet been signed and until you could reach agreement on this new SDL annexure it would not be possible to sign the contract because this was a necessary part of the contract.  Is that correct too?     Can I take you to – and this is a draft you are presenting to Eskom as a proposal for inclusion as appendix 4 of the contract.     Can you go down to 1189 and there you set out context for the need for a new model and     So in this draft you set out the context which, to put it crudely, is that Trillian failed your due diligence, you have come up with a new model which is your fund supply development and Eskom will disburse from that fund to a range of BEE companies who will be brought into work alongside McKinsey. Can I take you then to page 1192 which is another email you sent to Prish Govender but this time it is about – it is just over ten days later, it is twelve days later on the 16 May, 1192.     “Dear Prish, dear Edwin..”      And can I take you to material revision which is at 1196.     And there you say    And then you broadly repeat what followed the original draft.  That is to be read also with your memorandum to the board at page 1200 or your draft memorandum to be submitted to the board which essentially repeats the extract that I have just read.  If you     1200.  1200, Chair.     1200.     Well, 3.1.6 is where it is repeated.    “McKinsey executed on its BBBEE obligation from the start of work in January 2016.  Early in the execution phase practical insights were gathered and discussed with Eskom’s management team.  For instance, the ramp-up of the envisaged BBBEE partners were much longer than anticipated.  The key insight was that a multi-partner approach may potentially better fit the complex requirements of the programme.  These insights and discussions led to the suggestion of a range of modifications with regard to the execution of the BBBEE partnership model.  These changes will fully maintain the aspirations to the original BBBEE partnership model as the old contribution was significant easing the practical implementation. Critically these modifications will enable Eskom to have far great flexibility to achieve its own SDL targets.” When I read these documents, what I see is that in your first draft you say fairly frankly, Trillian failed our due diligence  - you do not mention them by name – so we need to come up with a different model, here is our model. But in the second and third  - the second draft together with the board memo that goes with it, you do not – you back off from that, do not mention it at all and instead talk about practical insights and a multi-partner approach and problems with ramping up.  Why?     I do accept that, Dr Weiss, but, I mean we can give you the original files.  What you will see on the original files is that these sections that I am reading to you, these which are fact change sections were inserted by you yourself, they have A Weiss or AW, I forget which, they are identifiable as having been inserted by you.     And what concerns me or what I want to understand is what was going on at Eskom, what was going on at McKinsey that would have persuaded you to produce a first draft that says frankly Trillian failed our due diligence so we need a new model. And then a second draft that, in my respectful view, touches that issue.  So are you able to answer that?     Ja, I fully accept that there was no prospect of McKinsey taking Trillian on as a supply development partner whatever this draft memo said or draft appendix said.  But can I take you back to the covering email on the second draft?  So that is 1192, the covering email on the May 16 draft and the parties to whom you address are Prish Govender, Edwin Mabulane, Vikas Sagar and Ageson Rajagopal and Claud Gell(?) at McKinsey and     Then I – if I can take you back – well, let me raise a slightly different issue before we go back to Mr Sneader ’s statement.  You candidly indicate in your statement that the MSA contract that you ultimately signed with the date of 11 January 2016 was in fact only signed in September or October and you explain in your statement …[intervenes]     You explained that Eskom had actually – that you understood that Eskom’s preference was that the SLA be signed as of the effective date, not of the actual date on which it was being signed and it was for that reason …[intervenes]     …that you dated your signature January 11 when in fact it was appended to the document sometime in September and October.  Can I just clarify, as of September and October – sorry, as of January, of course, there was still not agreement on some material terms to that contract including for instance the supply development partner annexure that you were exchanging drafts on in May.     2016, yes.  So let us just get …[intervenes]     And on the main contract after Trillian failed your due diligence you at that point materially changed what was the then draft of the supply development partner annexure on the main contract.  Those are the documents we have been looking at a few minutes ago from May 2016.     My concern with your signing with the date of 11 January when the actual date was …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.     I just want to put to you a problem with signing the document January 2016 when it is actually signed in September or October 2016, it is that Eskom’s own procurement policies precluded from issuing orders or paying for work before a contract is signed, but I presume you were not aware of that at the time?    But what that meant is that if the contract had been signed with its true date, not backdated, that would have flagged something that would have come out as an irregularity that may have triggered greater scrutiny of the contract by internal or external auditors, because payments had already been made on that contract, is that not correct?     Earlier on in your evidence when you were talking about the due diligence of Trillian and what you expect from Trillian you said – not your exact words – but essentially you were saying I am a German if you say you are a BEE company I want to see a certificate.  Can I ask you if you were signing a contract with a German counterparty would you contemplate putting a date on it that was seven months before the date on which you signed?     Sure.     Can I come back to something else that Mr Sneader said on page 41, again I – you may not have the document but it is literally only one paragraph, short paragraph.     He said on page 41    Can you say why you did, what was it about the situation that made you put the sort of reliance on Eskom’s representations at a higher level than you would ordinarily do, or would ordinarily be appropriate?     Can I tell you where it is heading, I mean my – if I look back at those six months, McKinsey had devoted very substantial resources to Eskom, had done so without a written contract and certainly without payment and was there not a real concern that was driving McKinsey at that stage that you needed to do what had to be done to get paid for this work.       No, no that’s in – sorry that is obviously by the time you had – I am not talking backdating now, I am talking other issues, like the supply/development annexure, like continuing to work alongside Trillian and so on.        Thank you Dr Weiss, I don’t have any further questions from my side.     That is correct Chair. 
DR WEISS:  Good morning Chairperson yes I can hear you.    My name is Alexander Weiss.    No I do not.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    Good morning. ADV CHASKALSON    Wait a second because I was on my bundle.  So which page did you say 700?    62.  This is – I am sorry I may have the wrong file.  I have a file Flow of Funds that is Exhibit VV8 and therein my statement is included.    Okay.  Ah okay, okay.  Now I get you.  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Van Zyl.  Ja this reads as my statement absolutely correct. ADV CHASKALSON    As far as I see it here this statement is correct and also my signature dated 25 November is correct Chairperson.  By the way I cannot see you.  I only see a    That is correct Chair.    I am absolutely happy to continue without seeing you.  I guess it would be you know very attractive seeing you but…    I can also do with the black one.    Excellent.    It is excellent.    Thank you.    That is excellent I am looking forward to that moment.    Yes.    Okay perfect I am very happy to provide this information.  So Chair my name is Alexander Weiss I am a senior partner with McKinsey and Company.  I am working here it was my 21 s t year now with McKinsey.  Some education I have a combined diploma of civil engineering and business administration and after that I first did a PHD in Civil Engineering and after that I did another PHD in    Chair no I can confirm that I did not have contact to Mr Essa at least not that I am aware of.  I did not have contact with Mr Essa.    Ja.    Ja absolutely.  And Chair please allow me to also provide some additional background information and context information here?  So to end off here.    To end off here.    Thank you Chairperson I – that it is an absolute pleasure that you provide me this freedom.  So in 14 we had the situation that Eskom was in a very difficult situation.  There are multiple years before cost escalations they are actually way above the inflation rate which then resulted into electricity tariffs hiking way beyond inflation giving some strain to the country. And to make things worse they also had a situation where especially by the end of 2014 we experienced quite significant load sheddings. Both of these things are obviously challenges to the people of South Africa.  Then there was a period that you are referring to that where Mr Singh and Mr Molefe actually got announced as the new CFO and respectively CEO of Eskom at this time.  And that was unfortunately not an unusual situation so in the time I would say in the decade before that I served you know Eskom as a consultant you know with interruptions I had experienced quite a number more than a dozen of new CEO’s and CFO’s at Eskom. And if you have that frequent leadership changes at such an important and proud organisation you could imagine that everybody who comes in has only a very, very short time for getting up to speed and please apologise for this words ja basically you know getting into the business. So since we as McKinsey as an institution have done significant work over this time we felt it was our duty to you know collect the information and the experience that we had and presented that to the incoming leadership team. We also provided that to the predecessors of Mr Singh and Mr Molefe.  So we had a standing if you want    The – the approach itself you know perhaps a little bit more context.  We had a client service team and Mr David Fine my colleague that testified yesterday among others were part of this client service team.  There was    I thought I mentioned him as well.  If I did not then please take it to me being old ja.    That is correct.  So that was the first on-boarding.  I am sorry Chair.    Thank you Chair for that opportunity yes.  Yes.  Chair the tope engineers program started indeed at around 13.  The intention of this top engineers program was really empowerment. So the – we had discussions with the leadership team back then and we were thinking how can we support the development of young black talent not only in the form of you know giving away a share of our fees but beyond and on top of that doing a contribution of developing engineering talent within Eskom to gain capabilities that we as management consultants had. So there was a selection process and you know kind of the leadership team of Eskom back at that time really appreciated this idea.  I personally must say I also truly bought into this idea still.   We had then selected these engineers and you know for the program it was a very professional selection process.  I think in the first year we advertised across Eskom for talent to apply.  We got if I am not mistaken something you know 400 to 600 applications then ran a full-fledged McKinsey interview process on them and we find new talented people.  So we took the first cohort we call them into the – into the program and then they ran alongside us as additional resources at McKinsey projects. This had benefit for everybody.  It said – it has – had benefits for Eskom because we had to offer only smaller teams because you know Eskom then you know filled additional resources by these top engineers.  It had a super, super kind of impact – a very positive impact on these top engineers get them later on some stage at Eskom some went outside and got really good positions.  And it also you know had an advantage for McKinsey because you know we were not only able to provide textual advice by via these top engineers that you know had natural relationships within Eskom they also made implementation happen and much better happen than we could have done this on ourselves. So we trained the first cohort.  This has proven successful.  Then we trained a second cohort and we hired and trained the second cohort.  Again the same thing you know we did then you know a festive function where we basically graduated them and you know this was – this was like deeply, deeply they got access to McKinsey IP, they were trained at McKinsey training events. They had access to our knowledge data base so it was a real cooperation and real talent building beyond this black economic empowerment contribution that we had. Then at around end of 14 when we were discussing about the third cohort the discussion came up and here funding for such a program given the dire financial situation and also the dire performance situation that I just was talking about did not allow Eskom to fund for this so in the discussion with Eskom we came about to be kind of you know have find another funding mechanism and we offered to go for a procurement program to actually realise procurement savings and then from that share of procurement savings we would pay the costs for the programme and you know in parallel also had the opportunity to train the third cohort on this program. So that was the origination of the top engineers program and if I look at this from today I can also see with quite some pride how the – some of the participants in the sub-engineers program are now you know now really made a career inside and outside Eskom.    Chair you are correct.  So where I just stopped you know on this offering on the third cohort that was – it only included procurement ja.  It was never sight nor exercised at this point in time.  Because you know then    They started at July 2015 and ended at around November 2015 that is correct. ADV CHASKALSON    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair we – I am not pushing anybody or you know trying to put pressure on anybody.  The reason for     You are exactly correct Chairperson.  We were under the impression that we would still – that they are still underway, obtaining National Treasury approval.  And you know, if we go to this – if we go to this Letter of Acceptance.  It is somehow here in the annexure.  It is Annexure AW-6 Bundle, page 898.  Let me pull that up.  It also specified – also specifies exactly – it is specified that same way.   Ja.  It is a condition of the – second paragraph.  It is a condition of the acceptance that in Eskom considered opinion of the National Treasury’s instruction were all through the life of the contract.   In an unlikely eventuality that the said opinion is conclusively altered, parties should agree to review the contract payment basis to an electoral(?) revised(?)     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Absolutely Chair.  I can.     [laughs]       Yes, that was exactly what I was confirming.  And this is also how I stand – understand Annexure AW-6, the Letter of Acceptance.  That was my full understanding ...[intervenes]      Exactly.     Absolutely.  Chair, we ran through this entire period..  You know, and it was not only me.  Ja.  I would like to give credit also for the wonderful staff here at Eskom.  They really have qualified guys there.  The top engineers.   But also the team that was not on the fleet and it were really guys and...  But one thing that I also wanted to say.  Remember, this was all a hundred percent at risk.   So we sent our entire team there not knowing whether we are getting paid in the end and whether we are able to achieve the impact.   We had a number of work streams.  One was actually in power generation.  We were given as a project basis, basically, the Majuba Power Station, where we very well cooperated with the Majuba Power Station Team back in these days.  And you know, the loss was remarkable. You know, I think we got – we took the power station at a viability of 63% in the beginning of 2016.  When we left the power station we had the viability of 84%.   And you know just to – this is basically – the fixed unit power station, it is basically as you are adding an additional unit, right?  And you need this increased viability to prevent load shedding.   And so, I am also personally very sad that we could not continue the work and supported Eskom in significantly increasing the viability factor for the entire fleet thereafter again.  The measures are still there, you know, but we were interrupted there.  So that was one thing.   Then the second work stream was the coal work stream.  On the coal work stream, we had historic costs escalations up until 2016 at 16% per year.   You know, for that year that we were there and worked with the primary Energy Team, we managed to get the costs escalation down to 3.5% only.  Ja, from 16% to 3.5% only.   And this is – you know, we – you know, also new contracts that we were striking then..  You know that Eskom was striking then.  We reduced the new price on, you know, from between 5% and 15%.  And at the cost, plus mines by the end of the year, we managed to get one million additional tons of coal out of there.   And we worked on claims.  I think we reduced the claim     Yes.     Absolutely, I can do that.  Wait a second.  I am just trying to get the statement.  Ja.  So on – let us see that.  So as I alluded to before.  We had – you know, we were in the process of on boarding Mr Singh and Mr Molefe.   And in this context, you know, we came with the business leaders but it was also clear that there was a financial restructuring required at Eskom.  And from the work that my colleagues, the Client Service Team at Transnet did.      [Indistinct] [00    Ja.     Chair, you are correct.  And that started at around September 2015, where we also intended to have them there as our Supply Development partner.  I would have gotten there in a second but we will – it is fine.  Because what happened then.   We were informed by Regiments in the form of Dr Wood that he is going to or he intends to buy out the management consulting activities of Regiments and put them into the – into a separate entity into – that he called Trillian.   And also that made in terms of the way how it was explained to us and also confirmed by colleagues as Regiments had like – I mean, we also heard from earlier evidence, several activities.   There was financial wing.  There was like a real estate wing and there was also management consulting wing.  And he felt that the management consulting wing then did not get appropriate attention.  So they wanted to have like one management consulting company.  At least this is what, you know, was explained to me at that time.       The work on the Corporate Plan finished as planned in March.  I think we - that was in March 2016 to be precise but I think there were some, you know, additional work where we then kept a team I think for three, four weeks on top of this without payment.     Chair, I would love to give you a razor sharp answer onto this question.  I am afraid I cannot.  The – I can just tell you what I experienced back in that time.  Back in that time, it was very opaque.  You know, it was planned that Regiments Management Consulting talent would go from Regiments to Trillian.   We also saw the list of people that went over because we also supported them later on with training and hiring of people.   I received during this time period until we terminated the conversation between Regiments and Trillian, multiple emails at times from Regiments’ email addresses, at times from Trillian’s email addresses and who was what and where.  It was almost impossible to determine at that time.     I can very well do that.  And it may come across that I am a little bit naïve here but I am, you know, I am a German national that you know that did fly in and fly out to South Africa, you know, during that time.   And I – you know in my capacity, you know, I...  Ja, I hear things and I understand things and also what was kind of going on in South Africa.  Yet my focus for assigning our     Yes.  Yes.     Jip, I am going there.  Ja, this is the Doha boiler issue.  And this was something again, you know, super unacceptable to us.  You know, while running the boiler work stream Chair, there was procurement.  So there was a boiler work stream.   We procured negotiation on a contract in order or achieve procurement savings and we found out or at least we got an indication that Trillian is both involved in Supply Development for – the supplier in question of – one potential supplier in question for the Duvha boiler as well as starting the procurement work stream.  In our standards, that is not acceptable.     Yes, that is a fair assessment.  I am not saying that they intended to negotiate that but they were close enough because remember Trillian worked with us at the procurement work stream and so – at least my affects do not allow, you know, to be on both sides of the negotiations.   I decided to be either on the side or I am going to be the other side of the negotiation.  And hence, we waived that instance with Eskom and with Trillian.     Ja.  E Gateway were – was sub-contracted by Trillian, as I understand it, for supporting on the procurement work stream and they cut down the work, whether – you know on the procurement work stream, right.   Whether they then also were involved in that specific negotiation, to me it does not matter.   Alone the fact that I am supporting a procurement work stream while I am at the same time supporting a supplier, that does not help too much from my perspective and that is...  It means it goes against our ethics and hence we reported it immediately.      I did – I do not have this knowledge.       Ja.  Ja, I am there.     That is certainly the letter with which we explained our concerns with Eskom.  Again, you know, we do not know whether there was improper dealings, right.  You know, perhaps both of these teams had agreement on the Chinese Wall and you know two separate servers and we are...  ja.  We may as well be.  But the fact that they did not talk to us about it, that raised our concerns and so we felt it is our obligation to raise the issue to them to be clarified.     In this regard, I do not recall clarification.     I have no information around this.  I am afraid, you know, Eskom needs to be asked who then in the end was selected for the Duvha boiler replacement.       I have…     Four zero?     No, unfortunately I have  - sorry, I have – I am not so sure whether I have that.  Let me go onto the other one that I have, four zero…     Okay.     Yes.  No, we had sent this March letter, so I am absolute happy to speak to this.  So first of all, it is a very fair question, I think in hindsight I am asking me as well, and what meaning - you know, what does cooperation mean, right, you know?  And that is the work package, the work package, so I think, [indistinct] 02.52 Gateway and the procurement consultants of Trillian had a very separate work package.  We – you know, they did on data cleanup, we worked on category work.  Ja?   You know, to continue working on category work, as we did after this letter, did not require any interaction with the Trillian folks on the ground.  In the event of the Medupi Power Station they had several engineers.  We indeed continued our work of the McKinsey work even though the contract was cancelled until August 2016 and they were there and then over time disappeared.  Ja?  We did not actively reengage with them to teamwork there but making with the benefit of hindsight, I agree, Chair, that was a mistake.     Ja and, you know, we are forced by the steering committee who had the discussion.  Remember there was - you know, we sent this letter to both parties meaning Trillian, you know, on the 15 March 2016 and Eskom on the 30 March 2016.  So it was super clear these are not going to be our supply development partners.   We had to make Steercom, a steering committee and the steering committee where the members are asking [indistinct] 04.52, it is all minuted so, you know, it is all on record, were asking in terms of the [indistinct] 04.57 how do you now fulfil your supply development partner, you know, obligation and are you continuing to work with Trillian?   On that steering committee, I made the presentation and said no, Chair, we cannot continue, we are going for an alternative, you know, SD & L contract, that then I also presented.  And why I said no, we are not going to work with Trillian going forward, it cannot be our supply development partner and I have a completely different concept that does not include Trillian for SD & L.   Trillian representatives were in the room. So Eskom was clear, Trillian was clear, we were clear, we have declared this.  After this Eskom decided obviously that they still wanted to have Trillian around and continued to work with them because it is not so easy to get into a power station side, there are access cards that you need in order to  get in and so on and so on, right?  So this was not revoked, we worked further there and, you know, we meanwhile then, you know, we were busy on trying to fill our new SD & L concept [indistinct]06.23.     I am afraid I cannot find the document that you are referring to at any of my files here.  So my file goes to …[intervenes]     Okay.  VV9, I have that.     Appendix to negotiation of key financial parameters, is it that?  No?  1125, SD & L proposal.     1185?     Sorry, I am scrolling.     Ja, okay, okay, I have that, ja. ADV CHASKALSON     Ja, I have that, it is an email, right?     Ja.  Ja, accept, okay.     No, I do not know the day, but, you know, it seems to be correct that I sent that to Mr Prish Govender, yes.     Correct, ja.     Correct, ja.     Correct, Chair.     Correct so.     Chair, that was a fair summary of what that document says.     Ja.     H’m.     Ja.     H’m.     Let me first of all say, Chair, we have not been able to be more brutal and crisp and say we are not working with Trillian as a supply development partner and we did not do that in 2017 or 2018, we did that in March 16 and we did not do in, you know, just like a side conversation or something like that, we did it in writing to every party.  Eskom was clear, Eskom knew why we have terminated any talks of Trillian.  Trillian knew why, you know, we have terminated these – there any talks about them being a potential supply development partner.   Why the facts that, you know, that we had in the beginning did not trickle down to what eventually was presented to the board, I cannot tell.  And, by the way, I am also not sure whether, you know, these documents, you know, are the final version where we gave input to or whether the input letter was kind of modified.   I think yes, it lacks a level of detail, I am completely clear with what you are saying or I heard what you are saying.  Yet, the decision has not been softened or anything, none of that happened.     Ja.     But it says – it comes to the same result.  It comes to the – what, you know – I am sorry, this is indeed some years ago so I am surprised that I was [indistinct] .22 Chair, but it says exactly the same thing and it did not change anything in our behaviour and the – for sure, you know, people, you know, were wondering, you know, what is going on there?  Ja?  You know, this was – I do not know – I know I am now in front of the Commission but this was also for us a pretty kind of material step to take to go there and say this is not our supply development partner because we cannot contract with them for these material reasons.   And, if I look at this, it, you know, says nothing different.  It does not say that all of sudden we have now decided, you know, to list all our reservations and, you know, go ahead as planned.  No, it does not say that.  I does not say exactly, you know, what was there.  It says it  disregards, that is correct, I cannot give you the reason for that because I do not recall them right now but it gives exactly the same position that I am also standing with today.     [indistinct] 23.00 decided that he did not want to destroy the prospects of Trillian going forward.  I do not know, quite honestly.  And it would be speculation, I simply to not know.  Obviously we have discussed then as indicated also by the earlier email that I sent, but as a matter of fact, Chair, we did not deviate in any way from our decision, neither in this letter or in the formulation there, nor in the actions that we took later.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, what January do you mean?  January 16?     Chair, you are correct.  In January 2016 we did not have a supply development partner confirmed.  As you know there was a draft supplier – a subcontract for a potential supply development partner negotiated yet not signed because we were lacking ownership and BEE information.     That was the only modification that was done later on, you are perfectly correct, Mr Chair.     No sir.     I cannot talk about these consequences; it is not our world so I don’t know.     So let me allow a little bit of context, by the context and I am going to answer your question.      The context as it presents myself is that we had a pretty long negotiation and that accumulated with us basically aligning on the final contracts and then I signed on 17 t h of September, sorry December 2015 the letter of acceptance.  This letter of acceptance is giving effect to the contract because it directly refers to what has been negotiated there, the result of our negotiation.  In Germany indeed I wouldn’t even need a signature on that ...[indistinct] ja, but indeed it will be binding, so I found myself bound to this contract.  Then thereafter I think that was minuted several times, and basically on a weekly occasion asked to get the signed contracts from Eskom and ...[indistinct] to this, this is not the first time that I get a task order or anything that is informal way beyond the start of work, ja, unfortunately that is the truth that we don’t, you know that the task orders are not issued on time, so I keep on asking, I keep on asking. We eventually then on 6 t h of June 2016 or I don’t know what day – let me say beginning of June 2016 I informed by Eskom that our contract gets terminated.  Then at around August 2016 we settled on an amount to be paid, we wrote an invoice only for the McKinsey ...[indistinct] not for the ...[indistinct] and you know got paid and only thereafter in September 2016 I received you know a  printed version of a copy that was signed 7 t h of January, so what I intended there – or not intended – what I understood there was that you know since the contract wasn’t there any more it was already cancelled and paid and so on and so on, that you know I was required to sign the contract on that date when it actually started.   My very first day in South Africa in the year 2016 was 11 t h of January hence I put 11 t h of January on that contract because I was anyhow bound by the 17 t h December 2015 letter of acceptance and I really apologise in front of the Commission if that has confused anybody in here but to come back to your question that originally was you know would that be sufficient in Germany, yes it would be sufficient in Germany.     Ja.     Yes.    I don’t know where this question is heading but I am you know indeed quite a lot of these colleagues at Eskom that I worked for a long time ago and perhaps that led me to that behaviour.       But I had already been paid for this stuff Chair, I don’t understand the reason that you are putting here.      But Chair with all due respect you know we started this process, we actually did a due diligence, I think what is fair to say is that you know we shouldn’t have worked or started work before this due diligence was closed.  They will be working slow most likely ja and you know as also Mr Mieszala and Mr Fine referred to yesterday this is a process that we have changed, but we came to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to go with Trillian as a supply development partner and despite that you know causing a risk for us not getting paid or not ever work at Eskom again, we were vocal not only saying but wrote on paper that this couldn’t be our supply/development partner, so I understand your frustration that we could have done this earlier and I agree to you this is a mistake that we have done but without external pressure we ourselves did that and you know they are crystal clear in the way you know how we have communicated it.      Chair.     Chair is there still a minute to say some kind of words from me?     Because first of all as you know it was ...[indistinct] I first of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity that you have given me and also my colleagues to present ourselves and the fact as we see them and also to answer your question ...[indistinct] this is really helpful to also get kind of these perspectives out and what I also would say we really intended to help the people of South Africa and especially considering in what dire situation Eskom was at this time.   It was a heartfelt you know need for us to engage and also to engage together with developing black talent in this country. What I you know I think we discussed about we did real work on this and it was not always easy because it was 100% of this contract, ja, because we achieved impact ...[indistinct] what I learnt through this process is that you know our support to Eskom may have laid grounds for corruption and you know I think therefore it is really important the work that you are doing at the Commission and that you are also asking the questions that you are asking, that at sometimes you know feel uncomfortable.  I think you are doing the right thing and thanks again for actually given me the opportunity to speak in front of this Commission here.

ADV VAN ZYL SC:  Chair good morning before we start it is Francois Van Zyl.   I am representing Dr Weiss.  I placed myself on record yesterday.     But perhaps I should do it again.    My name is Francois Van Zyl I am an SC Cape Bar.  I am acting for Dr Weiss with Mr Jason Mitchell of the Johannesburg Bar as my junior.  We are instructed by Nortons in Johannesburg and we act for Mr Weiss in his deliberations with the commission.     Thank you.

ADV VAN ZYL:   Thank you Chair, we don’t have any questions for Dr Weiss either. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Afternoon Chair.        Thank you Chair.  For the record Mr Zwane there are two affidavits that we may refer to later this afternoon.  The first is a second affidavit filed by yourself…[intervene]      Yes, the evidence that Mr Zwane has given on two previous days and it is to complete hopefully today deals with his participation in or knowledge of a housing - a series of housing matters that occurred during the years 2010 and 2011 in the Free State Province. We have dealt to a large extent with Mr Zwane’s knowledge of a participation in certain events during the course of the year.   The first involved the abandonment of an open tender system and what occurred during the first half of that financial year and the second involved the devising of a prepayment scheme an advanced payment system and it is in relation to the advanced payment system that we will ask questions today principally.            There are two affidavits Mr Zwane that may become relevant later and certainly is relevant overall in relation to your, are relevant overall in relation to your evidence.  The first is the second affidavit filed by yourself that appears just for the record in Bundle FS12 at page 623.   The second is a second affidavit filed by Mr Mokoena and that appears at Bundle FS12, 372.1 to 372.47 it is not a long affidavit but there are a number of annexures to the affidavit.  You have been provided with a copy of that affidavit and you may wish to comment later on and I will ask a few questions later on.  Mr Mokoena was the head of department during 2010/2011 Free State Human Settlements.   The first task for today Mr Zwane is to put to you certain versions in relation to the origins of the advanced payment system during October 2010.  We dealt with it briefly certainly your evidence in regard there to during the last hearing when you gave evidence here and you will recall that you said at a meeting with officials in the war room after the Welkom meeting you raised a question as to what could be done.   Mr Mokoena’s version is different he says that you called him and other officials to a meeting in what colloquially became known as the war room in October 10 and you proposed the advance payment system.  Do you have any comment?          Right that evidence Mr Mokoena’s evidence is confirmed by Mr Matchatwa and Mr Tsometsi who also attended that meeting they both say that you proposed the advanced payment system.       To an extent that there is common cause between you and the other witnesses we will get there.  I just want to put to you what Mr Tsometsi said on the 28 t h of September before the Commission.  He says      I will take it a little bit more seriously.       So in summary then when you distinguished between a question and a proposal you are saying that you may well have raised an issue for discussion and further debate but in doing so you would have conveyed what your thoughts were.        So it does not seem that we are too far apart on that issue.  What you stressing however that it was not a formal proposal for acceptance or rejection.         Then there was it is common cause a discussion about the idea let us settle on that for the moment the idea for further discussion and one of the issues arising was the legality of what was to be considered, correct?       Mr Mokoena you will have seen in his affidavit goes further, Mr Mokoena raised his concerns about the idea and I use that word advisedly for the moment and indicated that he did not support it.  Do you recall that?        Right, he says that the issue between yourself and himself in a discussion between the two of you, I think it was after the meeting.  He says that you said to him that if you do not want to implement this plan you should, you Mr Mokoena should tender your resignation.  Do you recall that?        Did that happen in a formal meeting?      Did Mr Mokoena at any stage during the meeting, shortly after the meeting or at any stage thereafter say to you that he objected to the idea or the plan?       He goes further to say quite expressly that you used an expression in Sotho saying that he will walk next to his shoes meaning he would remain poor.  Do you recall that?       Correct Chair.       When you refer Mr Zwane to advance payments having already been done are you referring to a period before October 2010?       By the 18 t h of November 2010?      The period that you referred to earlier 2007/2008 that would have been before you came to the Department of Human Settlements?        Is that what you referred to earlier as the Nercha scheme?      Well we will come to that meeting of the 18 t h of November the MINTEK meeting and the meeting that followed the MINMAC meeting.  But for the moment we have done some investigation and research into the period prior to 2011 and we have found no evidence of any prepayment system that mirrors the prepayment system that was implemented in 2010/2011.         Where are you referring to now?      F20 age 370?  Are you referring to black number or red numbers?      FS20 page 370 you say it is at slide six?      Yes, well I do not think that there is anything here firstly that deals with 2007 and 2008, correct?      Nor does it deal with anything before October 2010.       Yes so let us…[intervene]      …read the last paragraph on that page.        Yes, exactly so that is what I want to put to Mr Zwane.  Firstly, if you look at paragraph 7.1.6 that is a departmental presentation made on the 17 t h of October 2011 not 2010.  So this was a year later 17 October 2011.  Do you see that?        And this presentation dealt with the Free State Department of Human Settlement expenditure and the delivery for 2011/2012 financial year.  Do you see that?        Yes, I will come there we are just going through the whole of the presentation that you have just put before the Chair.       No we will get there.       Let us take it step by step.       So slide – before we get to the      Yes, FS20 page 371. Ms Rangarta will help you.  Do you have it before you?        You will see then at the top of the page paragraph 7.1.6 of this document deals with the departmental presentation dated 17 October 2011.        I have dealt with the next two lines, slide three of the presentation” “Introduction and background reflected that December 2010.” It is now referring to the previous financial year.   “As a result of strategy to expedite housing delivery department exposed to risk due to advanced payments made to material suppliers amounting to R481million.” That is a matter of record there, correct?       The next insert says that slide five      Then slide six of the presentation     And then there is an asterisk      Okay so I do not think we differ very much on this point.    We know that Mr Mokoena signed that document, prepared by Mr Tsometsi on the 25 t h of November 2010.  You are perfectly correct and you raised the issue why wouldn’t he sign it.  His evidence was that he signed it because he feared that he might lose his job if he didn’t cooperate.      Thanks.  Well perhaps we can wrap this up just concerning that you have no problem with the facts set out in the document we’ve just referred to at FS2370, correct?    Thank you.  Like to move to a new topic and that is what you were told Mr Zwane of the legality or otherwise of the advanced payment scheme.  Mr Mokoena says and we’ve touched on this that he actually objected to the plan at war room meeting in October.  And he says that your response was that you had been advised that the plan was in fact lawful.  You recall anything like that happening at the October meeting?    Alright.  Mr Chainee, do you recall who he was C-H-A-I-N-E-E or is?      Chainee?  A member of national treasury, do you recall that?    In fairness I must just put something to you.  For your comment if you know anything about it.  Mr Chainee gave evidence before a disciplinary inquiry which took place in the following years and as a result of which five officials were dismissed for participation and the advanced payment scheme.  You know that there was a disciplinary inquiry and officials were dismissed.  Correct?    In fact Mr Chainee said in the evidence and that’s part of the bundles, that you have before you, that at a Tech MinMech meeting of the 29 t h of October 10, the Free State representatives were informed that the advanced payment system for materials was now allowed.  And Chainee said that although it does not appear in the minutes, he said this at the inquiry.  That he raised the wrongfulness of the advanced payment system at that meeting and also that it was non compliant.  Now you weren’t at that meeting.  You’ve said so already in your evidence.  But one would have imagined that had such strong sentiments been expressed by an official of treasury in regard to an issue that was already on the table as it were at war room meetings or whatever, at least one war room meeting.  That would have been reported to you.  Was that reported to you?      Did Mr Makatshwa report to you on the content of Tech MinMech meetings and MinMech meetings?      And did the HOD then report in turn to you.    I think you said reviewed or revised.    Because …    That was the expenditure recovery?    Alright.  The evidence of Mr Makatshwa continues. He says that when he heard about what had happened at the Tech MinMech meeting, and where advice had been given that advanced payments as contemplated, it says by the MEC would be unlawful.  He phoned Mr Mokoena and he asked Mr Mokoena to discuss it with Mr Tsometsi and with yourself.  Now you would not have been party to that call, but I just want to put it to you that in all the circumstances, it is probable that this report would have been made to you.      There was another meeting on the 18 t h of November, you have mentioned that.  Also of Tech MinMech.      And – you nod your head.  You must say yes, please.    Don’t have to say please, just have to say yes.    At that meeting it was mentioned that the Free State Department of Human Settlements were looking to use the advanced payment system, in particular the tripartite agreements, tripartite agreements and the session in order to make advanced payments.  And the response from the meeting was a warning not to implement the plan.      Right.  I must say that that evidence goes further than what the minutes show.  But the minutes of the meeting held on the 18 t h November, show that there was concern expressed by the meeting in regard to the expenditure recovery plan.  Were you aware of that?    Also FS12 page 300, you can go there if you like. But I will read it to you, it’s not a long    Do you recall being at a meeting at the National Council of Provinces in Qwakwa during 2010 with your head of department Mr Mokoena?  Because it said a report was made to Mr Mokoena at that meeting at which you both attended, saying that the, both the ERP and the advanced payment system were questioned and in fact not accepted at the TechMin Mech meeting.      Well the report was made to Mr Mokoena in Qwakwa and the inference, the probable inference that we would seek to draw is that he would have spoken to you about it.      We had agreed it wasn’t an opinion.      Yes.  There remains the issue of accountability.  I was going to raise that at the end of the day that we have done some research into the Public Finance Management Act and into certain instruments introduced by cabinet in 2013 and 2011, after these events that talks to the power of MECs and ministers to delegate.  That also deals with their residual accountability.  Notwithstanding that delegation and their duties in that regard.  It seems to us and we’ll do further research on that, that there was a gap in the question of what accountability MECs have when they delegate tasks to heads of department.  And you will know that that is particularly relevant in terms of the Housing Act which you have now studied and we’ll deal with in a moment.  So Chair that is a matter that may have to be addressed further.    It may be a lacuna that requires attention.    Because it seems that approach adopted here is that once there is a delegation from a MEC to a HOD, a line can be drawn in relation to accountability.  That’s your approach, isn’t it?    2018.  And earlier …    In 2013?    Alright.      But quite apart from the formal steps taken it would seem a matter of common sense in responsibility that when a MEC delegates a task to an executive official, or to an official, that there should be a degree of supervision compelled and an accountability which remains.  Makes common sense and it seems to me that that has now been recognised.      Let’s go on to deal with the warning about the legality of the advanced payment system that came to the fore in February 2011 from National, that is the National Department of Human Settlements.  The evidence is that during February 2011, this was Mr Mokoena’s evidence the then minister of Human Settlements Mr Sexwale and the DG of Human Settlements Mr Zulu called the Free State Department of Human Settlements to a meeting to explain why these advanced payments had been made.  And that meeting was attended by yourself, Mr Mokoena, Mr Tsometsi, and Ms Debbie Hattingh, the new CFO of the department.  You recall that meeting?    Who attended?      Well Mr Mokoena goes on to say at this meeting the minister instructed the department to stop making advanced payments.  And that you at the meeting then referred to Mr Tsometsi’s document and you showed that to the minister to say that the payments were legal.  But the minister then insisted that the payments be stopped.      I am sorry Chair.    I didn’t follow your question, your statement.    Yes Chair.    I don’t recall that Chair.  And in fact this, this proposition is based on the contents of the statement.      Might be evidence.  So stand to be corrected there.      Yes.    Yes, I’ll check that because it may have been and I seem now to recollect that the distinction may have been whether the document was put before the minister as a document, or whether it was referred to in the abstract as having contained issues as to its legality.  But before I put anything on the table Chair let me just …    Let me check.      Yes.    I – it may be a matter of detail because as I recall the position Mr Zwane, his version is that he did not attend such a meeting at all.    So would not recall the contents.    Whether to that extent of detail or not, am I correct Mr Zwane?    But Mr Mokoena goes further to say he gave an undertaking that advanced payments were stopped, would stop and he did put a stop to them by the end of February 2011.  That’s what he says.  It goes further and perhaps I should go further to complete the sequence of events.  Mr Mokoena says then that on their return to Bloemfontein and after the meeting with national, you insisted that they continue to pay the contractors.  What do you say about that?    There is evidence notwithstanding that background that the payments continued.      Thanks, and you yourself confirm that? Let’s move on.  That was dealt with thoroughly at the end of the last hearing.      And at the last hearing we dealt with that letter of January and the response by the department and the press statement, we dealt with that at some length you will recall Chair.  And its common cause that the program was called to a halt in January, is that correct?  We know it continued after that, but there was an occasion in January where the program was stopped.  Is that correct?    Well we’ll look we’ll look at that. END OF RECORDING INQUIRY RESUMES    … in that regard and …    In our summary for the Chair we’ll deal with that issue.      Chair page 178 of the transcript of 22 September 2020.  It is correct that Mr Mokoena corrected his statement.  I was referring to the statement.  And said, he did not mention the document.  He just spoke about his plan without mentioning the document.  So he mentioned neither, he neither presented the document.    Nor referred to the content of the document.    It spoke about issues that would have been contained in the document.      The disciplinary proceedings that followed as a result of which five officials were dismissed and not Mr Mokoena.  Heard the evidence of Mr Sisha, S-I-S-H-A from national treasury, who testified that the Division of Revenue Act, Section 50 which we’ve dealt with in evidence here and the Treasury Regulations prohibited advanced payment for goods where they had not been delivery of those goods for the benefit of government.  And those, that evidence was confirmed and the disciplinary inquiry findings by Advocate Van Graan.  The proposition I want to put to you is that a fully informed official or MEC ought to have known that the advanced payments system was unlawful.  As at least being in contravention of the Division of Revenue Act and the Treasury Regulations.  What do you say to that?    There was a judgment of the full bench of the Free State division which went further in commenting on the tripartite agreements.  And the session agreements that were part of the advanced payment system.  There the presiding judge who wrote the judgment said the material supply session agreements were and I    Now you’ve been through the session agreements, their implications and their import.  I don’t want to repeat that now.  We’ve been through it exhaustively.  But I just wanted to put that finding before you.    The auditor general found and I    Yes, well we know that during 2010, 11 and in respect of the expenditure for 2010, 2011 there was no competitive bidding process that was completed.  Correct?    And there was no other competitor bidding for ...[indistinct].    Yes.  The disciplinary inquiry reviewed the evidence of a number of witnesses as a result of which those five officials were dismissed.  It was found in those proceedings by Advocate Van Graan that the advanced payment system, particularly the act of paying on session was introduced through a decision of the MEC, yourself, the former HOD Mr Mokoena, and the former chief financial officer Ms Dlamini.  You have a comment on that?    Right.  Certain adjustments had to be made to the housing subsidy system to accommodated these advance payments.  Do you know about that?  And we’ve discussed the retention clause.  Do you recall that?    Oh.  Those were removed.  Did you know about that?  Did you give those instructions?    Notwithstanding your participation in the advanced payment scheme and the participation of Mr Mokoena, we know that there were no consequences that you face disciplinary or otherwise in the ensuing year, am I correct?  The only people to be disciplined and dismissed, lose their jobs were the five officials who were subject to the disciplinary inquiry.  And they were found guilty of participating in the war room meetings and in the advanced payment system.  That was what they were found guilty of and fired for.  Is that not somewhat unfair?      Yes, well an observer might remark that the more junior officials were targeted as escape goats for the decisions of more senior officials.      Alright.  You’ve gone as far as the HOD, what about the MEC Mr Zwane?    I hear your denial and let me put the proposition to you.  Well let me put another proposition to you because it does seem from the evidence that a legitimate argument can be made that the law was deliberately ignored for the purposes of spending the money before the end.  And in fact that was said by the department in its founding affidavit in later review proceedings.  But let me not tax you with that.  You were not part of that drafting.  That evidence is before the Chair and your evidence will be weighed up against that evidence, including the evidence that we’ve dealt with over the last three days.  Court will bare with – I’m sorry.  Chair if you would bear with me for a moment.  Given our discussion before we started with evidence Mr Zwane, we over that hour.  So if I may say you lose the bet, but hopefully we can speed up.  I want to put certain different propositions to you and I dread asking this question or raising this topic again and that’s the list of the 106.  You remember we spent a day discussing that and other lists.  That evidence is on record and I hope we don’t have to go down that route again.  But I need, I need to put to you certain things that Mr Mokoena said and Advocate Van Graan found about that list.  Mr Mokoena says that he was given a list of contractors, 106 contractors by yourself and he was told by you to appoint those contractors.  What do you say to that?  It seems to be reasonably consistent with your evidence.    Alright, well he might have known where it comes from, but we know from your evidence at least that you approved that list.  And signed it, in September 2010.      Well you might have signed other lists.    But you signed that list and we know that that was the list which formed the basis of later appointments of contractors and suppliers.      Alright.    We’ll come to that in a moment.      But for the moment you signed the list.      You approved the list.    That is your evidence.    We’ve been through that.    For hours on end.      And that list was the list from which suppliers and contractors were chosen in November and December and part of January 2010 and 2011.  Correct?    I was hoping we wouldn’t have to …    Go down there again.      No, I can’t stop you if you wish to go down there.    But all I can say …    Well let me, let me stand back.  You give your evidence.     Yes, alright.  I will try and help.  But it’s not very helpful.  We’ve studied the evidence of that day closely.  And there is not one consistent version, but there on our calculation varying versions that total about seven in total.  And I’m not going to go through that because we would spend weeks here.    The evidence that you gave understandably as evidence from your own recollection 10 years ago.    And I think you will concede that during the course of the day it differed from time to time.  You corrected yourself, different explanations were given.  But what – you agree with that, because you nod?    Yes.  That list of 106 we eventually learned from your later versions that it was not the list presented to Exco on the 30 t h of January, oh 30 t h of June 10.  It was a later list compiled and signed by you in October.  Let’s can we settle for that at least?    Well whether it did or not there were 23 of those contractors …    That we know from the open auditor ’s report.    But there were 83 others that came from various sources and I’ll give you some detail in that regard in due course.    But what I wanted to put to you for the moment is not the chequered history of that list, to put it at its lowest, but simply to tell you what Mr Mokoena said and asked for your comment.    Mr Mokoena said that he queried with you that on that list were many companies or contractors that he was seeing for the first time.  And he asked, why are there so many new contractors on this list.  And he resp – you responded according to Mr Mokoena by saying, this is my list or this is my plan and I have the power to allocate.      And he said that after the war room meetings that you made allocations of contracts to contractors and suppliers.      That was also a finding of mister, Advocate Van Graan after reviewing the evidence put before him.  That, that evidence was confirmed by Mr Mkhatshwa who said that you chose contractors that would be allocated unit to build.      We dealt with this last time very briefly and I think your response to the proposition which is important now to raise in respect of questions I’m about to put was that on that list there were a number of contractors who had not been part of the group of contractors that submitted bids in the open tender process in April 2010.  You said you didn’t know about that, do you recall that?    There were also a number of contractors who had been disqualified during that process.  Do you know anything about that?    Well we’ve compared the bidders list and the documentation relating to that process, the bid evaluation committee documents and the bid adjudication committed documents, and we’ve compared that with the list of 106.  Not going to go through those lists with you but merely to say there were, there was a material number of people who did not partake in that process who found their way onto the list of 106.  And there were in addition people who had been disqualified.  There was some discussion – you nod your head. We’ve established that.  We’ve established that you don’t know anything about that, can’t contest it.  But there, there was a discussion at the last hearing that perhaps that list of 106 comprised those people who had passed the threshold of acceptance in the tender process.  And I just want to put to you that’s not correct on our research.  And we’ll put the detail in our submissions.      Yes.    Alright.  Well an examination of the list will show what it shows.  And that in fact is confirmed in the open waters report and just for the record if I could give a reference, it is at best there is 15 page 537 and following paragraphs 7.6 where those particular bidders are listed for people who didn’t bid are listed and people who did bid and were disqualified are listed.  Now according to the investigators and the evidence leader ’s examination of these various lists, we found a number of contractors who found their way onto the list of 106, but did not tender at all in the open bidding process.  And two of those were Rob’s Construction and Thuthella Logolo(?).  Do you know of those entities?    Alright.  Mr Mokoena in his statement said that on that list of 106, he did not recognise the first six contractors that were recorded on that list.  He remembers the names of three of them.  That Allatory, Koena Property Developers and Raloto Properties.  Do you recall the names of those contractors?    Mr Mokoena he put it as a belief he had no, more than a belief based on what I will put to you.  But these contractors were close to you Mr Zwane because you called Mokoena personally to expedite their payments.  What do you say?  You have read Mr Mokoena’s evidence, what do you say about that?    He also says, well Mr Makesi(?) said in the founding affidavit, in the review proceedings, that it would have been irregular for a MEC to be involved in the appointment of contractors.  You would concede that?    Yes.  Let’s just deal with Rod’s Construction for a moment and I want to put to you what the investigators have found during the course of the investigations.  Rob’s Construction with that name appears on the list of 106.  I presume you don’t contest that.      And they do not appear on the bid evaluation committee minutes which is a full list of all those who tendered.  So the allocation list reference Chair is it is for 14.224 and 225.  That’s where Rob Construction name would appear on the list at those pages.  And the bid evaluation committee minutes appear at FS20 page 63.  All this will be summarised in the work yet to be done by the legal team Chair.  The investigators go further in their report to say that Rob’s Construction appears to be a trading name for Rob’s Investment Holdings Pty Ltd.  Do you know anything about that?    Alright.  And the reason they say that is in a later tender Rob’s Investment Holdings Pty Ltd including, included housing allocations given to Rob’s Construction as part of its own experience.  So it cited Rob’s Construction as part of Rob’s Investment Holdings experience.  So they related companies according to the researchers.     You understand the proposition?    Rob’s Bricks received a payment of seven million rand.  It’s not clear whether that was as a material supplier or not.  That payment is shown in the investigator ’s report at FS20 page 203 to 205 Chair.  So the investigators have concluded that Rob’s Bricks and Rob’s Investment Holdings are associated as and part of that association would include Rob’s Construction.  Do you know a Mr Blackie Seoe, S-E-O-E?  Seoe?    Do you know that he was the sole director of Rob’s Investment Holdings at the time?    The relevant references just for the record for the moment Chair appear at FS21.827 and FS21.832 to 3.  That by way of background we know from the researches of the investigators that Robs Construction received housing allocations towards the end of 2010 -2011 – beginning of 2011.  Do you know that for a fact or not?    No they were on the 106.    No and as a result of being on that list they received housing allocations.    Right so you would not have a problem with the fact that if Robs Construction were on that list they received allocations?    Yes.    Well we know that they did not go through the open tender process and they were not on that result and data base but let me just put that to you as a fact I do not want to go back into the data base the 106’s the journey enough for the moment unless of course you want to go there of course you are entitled to do so.  But anyway let me just take this story a little further.   Lucky Seoe and Mr Magashule were co-directors of an entity called Sambal, S-a-m-b-a-l Investments, did you know that?    Yes.  That evidence comes from the transcript of an interview that the investigators had with Mr Seoe he is since deceased recently deceased.  So it is a transcript of an investigator interview for the record again FS13 3AA 389.  So the CIPC the official record show that Mr Magashule and Blackie Seoe were former directors in a company together.   But we know too from FS12 391.31 that a payment was made from Rob Investment Holdings to Ms Cholota in the Premier’s office and that receipt was acknowledged by Ms Cholota.   So we know that without a formal process a company received a benefit as a contractor towards the end of 2010 that there was some association – business association between the rector or that company although you do not know that and Mr Magashule and that subsequently a payment was made from Robs Investment Holdings to the office of the Premier.  Do you know anything about that?    Really.  And interviews have been held with the person of Robs Investment Holdings who made the payment Mr Mtwentula, do you know him?    Mtwentua – M-t-w-e-n-t-u-l-a    Alright.  Chair all that information is contained in the Investigators Report in some detail.  You recall that at the last chairing we spoke about a person Rochelle Els, do you recall that?    Yes.  Do you know who she was?    Yes she is a member of the Thuthela  Bogolo Trading Enterprise CC an entity which also appeared on the 106 list but did not appear on the bid evaluation committee lists as a tenderer. She received a housing allocation and Mr Mokoena’s evidence is that he believed that Rochelle Els was close to Mr Magashule.  We have dealt with that you recall?    Right.  And the reason given by Mr Mokoena for that evidence was that because you Mr Zwane used to tell Mr Mokoena that Mr Magashule has said that Els should be appointed and her claims should be expedited.  What do you say about that?    We have also since obtained a second affidavit of Mr Mokoena and again I must put it to you although I do not want to revisit the evidence of the last hearing but if you wish to do so of course you may.   Mr Mokoena says yes indeed a data base of eligible contractors was kept.  That there was a data base that was kept.  But he said it was never the position that someone could just be given a contract because they appeared on the data base or that one’s presence or listing on a data base entitled one to receive an allocation of houses to be built and the like. The purpose of a data base was to notify people on the data base or to notify entities on the data base that a tender was going to be issued and that they could then tender in a formal process.  Have you read that affidavit?    What do you say about that?    Well…    Well the fundamental difference between you and Mr Mokoena on that because what Mokoena says in his affidavit is your – you could be invited to an advertisement process to express interest in appearing on a data base but thereafter the allocation of work would depend on a fair procurement system.      Yes well let us from our point of view just summarise that because your most recent answer does not accord with the law but I think you have foreshadowed that by referring to the amounts contained in Treasury Regulations.    On the limits imposed by that.  But the first proposition is pressure of time for the completion of a particular project is no reason for departing from the prescripts governing procurement. There are some provisions that allow emergency procurement processes to take place but they are very strict.  Time alone is not sufficient.  You – are you aware of that?    Right.  Secondly the Treasury Regulations deal with data bases but they specify that above a certain amount I think at the time it might have been R500 000, I am not …    You still have to despite your presence on a data base be subject to a competitive bidding process, do you know that?    And many of the allocations that we are dealing with here exceeded that amount.  Correct?    Right.  So despite your presence or listing on a data base and perhaps I should not use the word list because I will come to that in a moment. A competitive bidding process may yet be required in relation to a particular contract over R500 000.00.  For those under R500 000.00 different provisions apply.  You are aware of that?  You mentioned it.    Yes well a data base is a legitimate tool in the procurement process.  The establishment of a data base is governed by law and particularly Treasury Regulations. But even one’s presence on the data base does not entitle one to be granted a contract over R500 000.00 if that is to happen there must be a competitive bidding process.  That is what the law says.    Your understanding of it we can look at in the course of time and assess it.  But what I do want to put to you is that there appear to be two issues that may have been conflated or confused. The first issue is a list.  That is an established list from which you believed as a department contractors could be appointed.  A data base says Mr Mokoena is something that precedes the compilation of the list.   There would be an advertisement and I will give you an example in a moment to contractors that advertisement would say, please give us any interest you may want to express in getting work.  We will then put you on a data base and when there is a need to allocate work we will contact you and invite you to bid.   And if you would look at page FS12 372.23 you will see an example of such an advert.  Okay.  You do not want to go and trust me on it.    You have seen it.    Alright.  In fact that is what the department went to court to establish in order to review the contracts given.  You know about that.  There has been extensive evidence. But perhaps that comment is unnecessary the evidence is on record.  It does not require your comment. I would like to move to another topic.  The     Yes Chair.    Yes we will be finished …    Well…    I think we would like to be finished by five but I think we may be finished by half past four.    Thank you.     Chair, I would like to place something on record.  It seems I may have, in fact probably did, put a misleading proposition     And it must be corrected.  When dealing with the Robs Construction payment.  The payment by Robs Investment was made to an entity called SUD Trade, s-u-d t-r-a-d-e.  This may have been on the instruction of the premier’s office.  We do not know that.  That may be an inference that might be drawn.   But that payment was copied to the premier’s office and to Ms Cholota.  And acknowledgement of that payment was noted by Ms Cholota in the premier’s office.  So that is the correct sequence.     You will recall evidence concerning the meeting of Exco on the 30t h of June 2010.  And we have dealt with the minute of that meeting.  You recall that?       Mr Mokoena says in his additional     Is that a correct statement?     And not only that but that the head of department would have been invited to the Exco meeting. Is that correct?     Right.  The Exco Resolution which we have dealt with refers to a report from the department but Mokoena says he did not sign off on any such report, nor was he invited to the meeting.  Can you confirm that?     Well, we know that the minute mentions a list given to the Exco for its consideration, correct?     ...mention?     What Mr Mokoena says further that he never, at that time, knew of any list, whether for new or existing projects that had been sent to the MEC.  That is yourself, and by implication. Exco.     You were the one who attended that meeting and made that report.       You attended the meeting of Exco on the 30t h of June and made that report to Exco referred to in the minute.     Right.  Well, we have been through the list, how they were comprised and the existence or otherwise of competitive bidding processes preceding the compilation of the list.  I do not want to go there.  I do want to deal briefly, finally, with the affidavit you submitted to the Commission regarding the Housing Act.       No, I want to deal with it.     If I may?     The procurement policy required in terms of Section 3(2)(cA) of the Housing Act was, according to our researchers, introduced by the minister with effect from April 2002.  It was – that is Chapter 3A of the 2000 Housing Code.  That is simply for the record.  Those references.  But did you know, at the time you were MEC, of that procurement policy?       And then I would like to deal with this issue of delegation because it may be a matter of concern to the Chair to consider certain recommendations to tighten any loopholes that might exist.   The earliest reference that we could find and in the short time available to us – perhaps our researchers need some further work - but in 2013 there was a document entitled Principles of Public Administration and Financial Management Delegations, approved by Cabinet which stated     Is there anything you wish to add Mr Zwane?     And finally and in summary, let us – the legal team gives the wrong impression Chair.  We would still rely on the allegations made in the review affidavit submitted by Mr Mkhize as to the nature and intent behind the Advanced Payment System but you know about that and we have put it.  Chair, those are the questions.       Yes, thank you Mr Zwane.     And we reserve our rights.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair. 
MR ZWANE:   Afternoon Chair.     Good afternoon Chair.     Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane.     No.     I truly affirm.     Thanks Chair, I am here to try and assist you as much as I can.     Yes, Chair my comment is simple I did not propose, I asked a question why can we not help the contractors in terms of materials as that issue was raised in a Welkom meeting that is my story and I deny that I proposed.      Well I have gone through both statements and I agree with you Chair and Mr Matchatwa is agreeing with Mr Mokoena but the version of Mr Tsometsi is the version that I put here that there were discussions after I had asked a question and after those discussions a decision was taken that there should be a broad research in terms of this.       I said when I was here I asked a question that why can we not help the contractors with the materials as that will actually enable us to do what we are supposed to do to deal with the problem that had been raised earlier on by the Minister.      Chair I asked the question that is why there were debates around this matter.  My understanding of a proposal is that if you put a proposal on the table that proposal will be accepted or rejected.     Yes.     Yes.     I would accept it Chair as we together in the very committee when that issue was proposed.      It is not an issue that I came with from somewhere it is an issue of the very committee and when we called a meeting we had to try and address that issue out and see whether it is workable or not.     Well it may have been taken so by other attendees of the meeting but the fact of the matter in all the affidavits they agree with the fact that that matter was debated in that meeting.        That is correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.      I do not recall him saying he does not support.  I recall one of the concerns raised in the meeting was the legality of that process.        There was no meeting between me and Mr Mokoena outside the formal meeting which everybody was there, Chair.       No, there was no such a comment from me because if I remember well the end discussion of the meeting was actually in Mr Mokoena’s favour.  There was no conclusion that the question which has been interpreted as an idea is what we must actually implement.   The resolution was that the DG Mr Tsometsi should go and research broadly about all the issues which were raised in the meeting and report to the HOD which was Mr Mokoena and in that process it is my belief that Mr Mokoena would have then addressed whatever matter that was a concern to him.         No, Chair.      No, Chair.      Chair I never said anything of that sort in fact if we refer back to the investigations you would actually realise that the issue of advanced payment was actually implemented even before this document you talking about was finalised.  In the meeting of the 18 t h on November as per the investigations.  Mr Mokoena in a report to the investigators actually exceeded to the point that a meeting, when the meeting was discussed on that point advance payment had already been done it is here on black and white.   So we continue to have a good relationship that is why I could understand even when I had said everybody should be working during December Mr Mokoena did not avail himself and I did not have an issue I understood.     In fact if you look at the investigations they will indicate that the issue of advance payment in the Department of Human Settlements started in the year 07/2008 there about but on this matter of 2010 Mr Mokoena as he was asked he indicated in the report to the investigators that by the 18 t h of November when the MINTEK meeting was organised advance payment had already been done.       Yes.      That is correct Chair.      The Nercha scheme was reported in the meeting in Welkom when I raised this matter.  I did not know about this matter Chair at that point I must clarify that matter as I was going through this documents by the investigators.  They actually indicated that the problem of advanced payment in the Free State started around 07/2008 and they further discovered that when it was put to Mr Mokoena that why would he not have listened to the MINTEK meeting of the 18 t h of November 2010.  He actually acceded to the point that advanced payment had already been done before that meeting.         I can actually try and help Chair with a page if I be allowed.      It is paragraph 7 Chair 1.6 departmental presentation dated the 17 t h of October 2011 slide number six of the presentation and that is found in FS20 page 370.      The black numbers.      It is paragraph 7.1.6.  In his presentation it is slide six but FS20 page 370 is paragraph 7.1.6.         That is correct Chair.      According to my understanding Chair it deals with the 18 t h.      Yes.      Yes, Chair.      Well can we read that paragraph Chair so that…[intervene]      Because to me it says delivery in December 10.      Okay.      Okay.      FS20?     Yes.      Yes, Chair.      Yes, Chair.      Yes, Chair.      Yes, Chair.      That is what I was – that is the picture that I was painting Chair.      The point I am making in terms of this information, when it was asked that why was the advanced payments made and that was put to the actual the Mr Mokoena.  My reading is here is that he admitted that when, when he was told that he should not continue with the advance payment, that advance payment had already been paid.  And I want to say to this Commission the issue of the advanced payment, if it was raised in a meeting of MinTech, subsequently MinMech which was the 18 t h and the 19 t h of November 2010.  If he admits that that particular time when that decision was made, the advanced payment had already been made.  The, the document that we are talking about here which was as a result of the question I put in the meeting, the war room meeting was only signed on the 25 t h of November.  Not the 18 t h or the 19 t h.    I deny that is the truth and the sole truth Chair, because if he was so scared of me, he would have listened to me even when I said he should not go on holiday.  It’s on record that he did, did go on holiday and I left in that department as an HOD when I left the department, I never dealt with him or did anything that was indicative of the fact that I was a monster in that department.      If I understood that Chair, which is true, why would I fail to understand and give him an opportunity on a document that I have given him and Muso Tsometsi?  An opportunity to go and work on?    Yes Chair.    I deny that Chair.    Chain?    When made to time lapse and the fact that Mr Mokoena was the one would deal with officials at the level of MinTech.    I, I read that in the media and as I followed up I got to learn that that was a fact Chair.    No it was not Chair.    No Chair, Mr Makatshwa reported to the HOD.      There is a report I call, I recall and I think I had said that in my earlier affidavit, that at some point the HOD approached me to say National had said there were issues that needed to be corrected in the recovery.    Ja.  Yes.    And that, I accepted that whatever needed to be revised or reviewed or …    Yes.  That is the only thing I remember and for the purpose of the Commission Mr Mokoena indicated that we were supposed to report on weekly basis to national in terms of the progress we are making in terms of these recovery plan.  And I was even shown the reports that were going to national.      Chair, the report was not made to me.  If the report was made to me I would have endeavoured as I did earlier on when I got an indication from the office of the Minister that we are lagging behind.      Correct ja.    I said, correct yes.    I have said correct Chair.  Yes.    I did not get that indication Chair.    I would, I would say on the hindsight that could fall within what I have already alluded to that HOD Mokoena reported that there were issues that needed to be corrected.    Before this Commission summoned me not, I only learned when I was here in this Commission.      In Qwakwa?    No Chair. ADV PRETORIUS    In the discussions Chair of that war room meeting, there is, the resolution or the end product of the meeting was that the officials must go back and research broadly on all the matters that were raised in the meeting.  And come back with a document which I called a legal opinion at that time as a layman.    After the explanation by you Chair and explaining the details of what happened behind the scenes which I would have not known, we agreed that a legal opinion was not sought.  But at the time where I was I had given the HOD, the head of the department and the people who knows law to go and research about their concerns that were raised there.  And I thought as an oversight person, I had done my work.  When they came back with the document which is signed by the HOD, I took it for granted that all the issues that were of concerns in the meeting were addressed.      Well Chair I want to agree with the – your statement you have just earlier put.  I think because of the challenges in terms of the clear line of delegation, that is why some steps to try and close the gaps that were existing were then taken around 2013.      Ja.    Yes.  So I, I do understand Chair.    That is correct Chair.    No Chair.    I don’t recall attending a meeting in February of that nature and I have said in this Commission that I was reshuffled from that department the second week of February.  So I do not recall that meeting.    I don’t …    You are correct Chair.    Chair, I, I deny that strongly.  And want to say to this Commission even if by chance I would, I would have said that, I had said to this Commission I left the department the second week of February.  Meaning I would not have been a stumbling block for any means for the officials to stop that kind of an exercise if it was illegal.  I was no longer there.  But I don’t recall me insisting on anything that national had actually said it is illegal for us to do.    That’s correct Chair, I’ve seen that evidence when I came to this Commission.    Chair the information in front of this Commission that we all know is that finally money was taken.  A resolution on the 12 t h of January 2011, a letter was written by the DG to the HOD indicating that their seven days have lapsed, lapsed and so money will be taken.  And we all know the response by HOD with end that he’s ...[indistinct] the slate, he thought we were progressing well.  So there was a decision that money would be taken.  Why would the department continue with advanced payment if money was taken?  Because that would have created a situation for the financial year.  I must say Chair that it is correct that for all intents and purposes we had tried our level best to build houses.  And that information is here.  I don’t want to dwell in it.  And to a certain extent we succeeded.  But the control or oversight, administrative oversight, because from where I’m standing, where I am seated, I should say the issue of advanced payment or tripartite arrangement has been done by a number of provinces.  But the how that issues monitored, I think becomes a problem and we must …    Okay.    That would have mean a project which was linked to that money which was taken was going to suffer.    You are correct Chair.    I can’t remember Chair.  I remember that they were discussions with national in January that continued.  And finally I …    Okay.    I would say, I said in my earlier evidence that in terms of DFMA and Treasury Regulation 8.2.3 advanced payment when there is a clear contact of what is going to be paid in advance is not illegal.  I have said earlier on, today that on the hindsight one must admit that the, the administration of the whole process had the loop, loopholes in terms of mitigation, risk, mitigation controls, internal controls and things like that.  But the scheme itself Chair, in terms of this facts I’ve mentioned, even at that time nobody brought it to my attention even when I have said they must go and research, that this could be a legal kind of a scheme.     No.      Okay.    I think without really going back Chair we have dealt with that matter earlier and I have expressed my understanding.    The open tender was abandoned.    And that ...[indistinct] were taken, yes Chair.    Through, I would say through a decision of the executive committee which was researched at that particular time.  And finally brought to me when it was signed.  And I agreed with that.      I remember the retention clause and the guarantees that were supposed to be there.      No Chair, I wouldn’t give such an inst – in fact I did not tamper with the, the legal means of instrument in running this scheme.      Well Chair as I went through this document I think there were other matters that were also put as charges to those officials.  But when it comes to the specific matter, I think it would be, it would have been unfair that the junior officials under the accounting officer would be called and faced the music for the documents that was researched and produced and signed, or approved by the accounting officer.  I think it is unfair that that process had to be dealt with the way it has been dealt with.  I always carried a view and as I read here that some of these officials had other issues like giving contract out of the signed allocations and other matters.  Otherwise I would agree with the Chair that pertaining to this matter it would have started at the head.  And if there is any issue that the, the team, the disciplinary team wanted to raise or find out at least, I would have been gladly wanted to cooperate with that process to say the least.    Well Chair, it, it seems like that publicly as, as it happened.  I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t blame the HOD who took that decision that if there’s something untoward what was supposed to be the normal running of things, that issue should be corrected.    Well Chair the – to be fair with this Commission I had not committed any wrongdoing knowingly, or any – I have not rejected any proposal as the MEC by then that was brought to me by my team.  Even when we were at the meeting where issues were raised, I gave them a chance to go and research and make sure that we have a sound document that we can work on.  During December the minutes will, will tell you.  30 t h Of December.  A concern was raised.  I called the meeting in Bethlehem where the CFO had raised issue in terms of the controls.  And I requested that those controls must actually be addressed.  So from where I am seated, I have done everything in my power to ensure that any wrongdoing should be eliminated.  And there is proof to that effect.  I wouldn’t have participated in any way, in any wrongdoing, knowingly.      I deny that issue Chair.  I have earlier on indicated how the process was run in that department and I never interfered that process.  There would be a time where the officials lead by HOD, that will after following processes, due processes in terms of procurement will then approach the MEC to say we are ready, this is what must be done in terms of allocation and the contractors.    So I deny that I, myself gave him a list that he does not know where it comes from.      I did not sign only that list Chair.      Yes.    Even in my evidence I have not denied knowing the list Chair.  My issue has always been how the list was developed.      The list I know.    Okay.    That is correct, ja.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is the list that came as a result of the earlier dispute by contractors when we had actually said the work must started earlier in August.  Exco gave that decision.  And there was a dispute declared by this other contractors, so the whole process had to, had to be stopped.    Okay.    Oh okay.    No.    I’m saying …    Maybe it would have helped me to hear what the leader of evidence wants to say.    Okay, okay.    Yes.    No, I do agree Chair.    We can settle for that provided it would say it also contained some of the contractors that were there in the list of June.      Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Okay.    I deny that fact Chair.    I deny that fact Chair.    Mr Mkhatshwa would have never been with me at any moment as I have indicated our interaction was with HOD.  I would not understand how, how would he know at least to say the least to what he is saying.      That is correct Chair.    No Chair.    That was my assumption as you will remember Chair.  When I was asked my understanding of the list I had signed.      I’ve said those lists should have been composed of all the contractors who have passed the test.  That is what I said in this Commission and I want to stand with that.      No.    No.    I deny that evidence Chair.      That’s what I’ve been saying all along Chair.    I would not contest any name appearing on the list that I have signed.    No Chair.    Okay.    I understand Chair.    Yes, I know him Chair.    No Chair.  ADV PRETORIUS    I know him Chair as somebody who was very close to sports especially boxing.  If I am not mistaken I think at a particular time he participated because I used to see him in that kind an activity.  I know he is from Free State also.    No I would not know all his companies.    I would not.    Outside – outside the 106.    And then they received other allocation.    My recollection is that all the 106 contractors should have been allocated.    I would not have had a problem with any contractor Chair.    No I do not Chair.    No Chair.  I only saw the transcripts in this document but prior to that I did not know anything.    Mr?    No Chair.    Rochelle?    I have met Rochelle I think when we were expecting some – inspecting some houses.    Yes I recall Chair.    I can put it in this commission that Mr – the HOD Gift Mokoena was more close to the former Premier than me.  I think if there was issue of that nature that issue would be communicated with him not me as he have indicated in this commission of how far they come both of them.    Yes I have.    I find it very strange Chair.    In fact other evidences including Mmuso Tsoametsi’s evidence would say they will call it – they will go out for tenders and those tenders will be adjudicated and become a data base where it could be allocated for the next five years for those contractors that appear on the tender and that is what I was told.    Well Chair that is not what I was told.  That process lies with him when he was a HOD. Mr Mokoena was there in 2004 when this other process did take place.  So I would not do – I would not delve much in terms of how they administered administratively because that was not my space and I have never interfered with that space.   If an open tender was called for I had all supported it.  If they came back with the data base giving me reasons there is people who have been there I have never given them a problem but I am saying officials who have been there longer than me are giving different versions of how the department used to perform there.    I did…    I corrected myself Chair.    On the 12 October.    That I had seen the Housing Act.    And I knew about it – I was told about it.    Although I relied more on the PFMA.    Because I was from the municipality.    Yes.  The – Section 6.3 I was taken aboard on those sections where the MEC administered and so forth and so on.    Yes.    I corrected it.    Yes.    That is – yes Chair.    The – I understand it.    I understand it Chair.    Yes I understood it.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    I think it will help us Chair to separate the data base as it appears on the PFMA because it will have limitations in terms of the amounts and so forth.  Maybe try to understand how the data base used by the Department of Housing at that particular time used to be done.   A competitive process would be entered into like the constitution and other relevant acts would want.  And out of that action instead of looking for ten contractors that are going to get a job for that particular year you go and look for 150 and then you come back and put all these contractors that have undergone that competitive process to be on the – on your list which is famously     Which has famously gone to data base.    But…    The list.    This is the list that even the evidence of some of the people who were here was saying for the next five years that list will be used.  Maybe for the purpose of this commission let use the word list.    And that list will be used until it expires.    In the next five years.    And – so because that had followed a competitive process Chair that is how things were happening when I came there and I expressed at some point a view I must say which is not in my evidence that – why is that so?  Why can we not every time when we have a project go through this process?    Yes.  They said there is no time when we are not building houses in this department whether unfinished houses or new houses.  Now if you are here after you are going to be entering into this process it takes time and you are not going to finish.  So this is how we are doing it here and well I – I then understood what they were saying and that is what I aligned myself with when I was there.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Within the five years.    Process yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes sure.    Yes I am aware Chair.    Yes that is correct.    I know that Chair.    There are those who exceed yes.    I thought I had clarify myself that my understanding of this process is that let us take a company who will tick all the boxes of being able to be awarded well beyond 500 the company who will tick all those process during an open tender as this is explained.   The difference will be instead of looking for ten companies that are going to build 100 houses there will be 150 companies that have gone through the same process that the ten companies have undergone.  Meaning they tick all the boxes.  They then are as reserves of any project that comes.   That is the explanation I got Chair which – which to me as I am seated here becomes slightly different from a data base.  Because a normal data base as described by the law can only be compiled with a particular amount as the leader of evidence is saying, that I know.    Yes.    I have seen it Chair.    But the question becomes in this commission let us take the nearest.  The tender year 204 and 2009 was such a process of the expression of interest used.  Even in terms of the evidence given here by other people who were called here I think this issue we must in my own understanding Chair is an issue that seeks to address the inadequacies which were there – which we must accept in this commission that in terms of the law there were issues that were not followed properly.  And at a particular time these issues they were an endeavour to try and correct these issues.  I would accept that.     Yes, sir.     Yes.     That is correct Chair.     Yes, that is correct Chair.     Well, Chair.  I think I must say what I have     The...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Yes, Chair.     The question...  Then the question becomes    I was the one who did what Chair?     I made that report Chair and there was presentation.  In that presentation and the presentation, if I am not mistaken, it is part of these records.  It even says the department has gone into a vigorous process to ensure that all the participants that were in that list are correctly there.   They had been vetted and so they qualify.  That was the presentation according to the minutes and I could not without the help of administration knows those issues because I do not vet any people.  I do not do those issues.  They are administrative issues.     Yes.  Do I want to do what Chair?     Okay.     Okay.     No, Chair.     If I may just comment Chair?  I think this issue gels in with what I have said earlier on that due to some development, new acts were introduced to try and deal with those developments and I think it is a good example of that kind of – an issue that I have raised earlier on.       Chair, I think I agree that with the - with the answering of a democratic government.  A number of things had to be taken care of.  And the issue of tightening the act, coming with new acts, could try and look at the situation that was prevalent at that particular time.  It became a big issue.   And over time, we were able as government to plug the holes that seemed to be there unchecked because of legislation.  I think that is what I want to put on this issue Chair.     Chair, I just wish to quickly express my appreciation for the commitment that this Commission has shown.  Under normal circumstances, we would have been given a chance to go and be with our family.  It is Christmas time and we have many other issues.   But this Commission has taken its work seriously.  And I want to say on my part, as I have said earlier on, I want – I wish to cooperate with this Commission and I think I have displayed that.   Even this morning, I was supposed to come here at four.  I was called earlier and I availed myself.  I will continue doing that even for future if I am needed.   I did say the last time, I feel very comfortable in terms of how this Commission has treated me up to this part.  I also want to thank you for having made this time for me to come and clarify those issues that may remain hanging in the minds of people.  I have indicate that I did not have anything to do with the Rochelle or Blakey.  I did not take any instruction from anybody.   And I will try in the future to ensure that whatever information I have, needed by the Commission, will assist the Commission.   Otherwise, a blessed festive season for all of you.  I hope I will be called in January [laughs], not in December.  But should it happen that the Commission remembers me [laughs] during December, I am still committed to assist this Commission.  Otherwise, thank you very much Chair and the evidence leader and everybody.       [No audible reply]

REPRESENTATIVE:   [Microphone not working properly] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Good afternoon, Chairperson.     We are ready Chairperson.     Chairperson, shall we proceed?     May we proceed?     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.  I do Chairperson indeed.     Yes.     Yes.     Exhibit U-27.     Mr Koko’s affidavit appears on page 5.     It has already been admitted as Exhibit U-27.1.     Thank you.  Ja.  Mr Koko, the Commission is trying to – its endeavour is meant to achieve the truth about what transpired in matters that it is investigating and we try to get to what is the truth.  And in this matter of suspension, we know that you have in your affidavit set out what you believe are the reasons why you were suspended.  And last time, we went through that exercise, also looking at the evidence that has been given by others and what the board itself had said. Now, you have in your testimony last time, just to recap, you have said that Ms Tsholofele Molefe’s version is correct and you were referring specifically to where she goes to Mr Matona and speaks with him about the suspension as it appears from her affidavit. And he in response, according to Ms Tsholofele Molefe,     Yes.  Now, in your testimony you were     You told the Chairperson that you were not aware – you did not have prior knowledge of the suspension of the four executives.       I have looked at your – the transcript of your testimony at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  Comparing it to your affidavit, it seems quite clear that, according to you, the meeting of the 9 t h and the meeting of the 11 t h would have had to do with the suspension of you and Mr Matona as the result of you not complying with Mr Tsotsi’s instruction.  Is that correct?     Yes.     Yes.  But my question is ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     No, that is not a problem Chair.  Should I proceed Chair?     Thank you.  Mr Koko, my question stems from – because it is a different question.  It is not whether or not there was discussions about the suspensions in the meetings of the 9 t h and the 11t h.  It is about what you say was going to happen in those meetings.   According to the way you narrate the issues, you give the understanding that that was your understanding that Mr Matona says you ...[intervenes]      Ja.  But you know that Mr Matona has denied your version from his affidavit you have seen?  That he – he says he did not say to you that if you do not unsuspend Mr Sikhasimbe, Mr Tsotsi is going to suspend you and him.  You see his denial?     Now.  And you have also admitted that you did not raise the issue of Mr Sikhasimbe with the board at the time of your suspension.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  It is clear from the minister’s affidavit, Minister Browne, that she was also aware of the Sumitomo matter.  I have read a paragraph from her affidavit.  Do you remember that?       And she said an executive from Eskom came in person to tell her about the issue.  Do you remember that?     And you have listened to the audio recordings, you have looked at the minutes of the meeting.  It is apparent. from both the audio and the minute, that the minister came to the board on the 11t h of March around eleven or half-past eleven, had a meeting with the board but never raised the issue of Sumitomo with the board.      Ja, I heard you earlier saying you have listened to the audios.  I think you do say in your affidavit, in fact, that the issue – even here you said, five minutes ago – the issue of the suspensions was definitely raised in the meeting of the 11 t h.  So you cannot be definite unless you know what took place in that meeting.     Not.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Mr Koko I think you are right that it was established before the Commission, at least insofar as evidence is led, that the audio record – the minute – the meeting with the minister was apparently not audio recorded.  I think you are correct in that regard.  That is what has not been done here.  You follow?     You follow?     But we do have the minutes of that meeting in the file.  The evidence here does not show that the minister raised the Sumitomo matter with the board.  In fact, the minister comes there.  Dr Ngubane testified.  It is in his affidavit.  Mr Khoza was here recently.  It is also in his affidavit.   That the minister, when she arrives there, raised four areas of concern to the board and that area included your area.  And said the four executives should step aside.  It will be better if they step aside so that they do not hinder the inquiry that the minister wanted to have undertaken.  So that is the evidence before the Commission.  Do you have any comment?     Thank you, Chair.  In fact, Dr Ngubane...  Chair, you will recall.  He says after the minister left, it was absolutely clear to them that the minister wanted the inquiry and the minister wanted the executives to be suspended.     That is the one thing.     The – we also asked Mr Khoza the same question whether it was clear to you after the minister left that that is what she wanted and he also confirmed.     So Sumitomo, Mr Koko, was not raised with the board.       Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, that obviously should be contrasted with your attitude which you talked about when – by the time of Dr Ngubane’s board     H’m.  So and that also be compared with your attitude that you went at length with the board to tell them that but you are suspending the person who is not responsible for maintenance.  You mentioned those two gentlemen.     That is right.  Now let us then look at what you say in your affidavit in regard to your suspension.  Please turn to page 45.  Eskom bundle 15, page 45, Chairperson.     45.  Are you there, Chairperson?     Thank you.  Mr Koko, are you also there?     So just to put it in context, you talk about a Dentons’ report and Ms Suzanne Daniels who does not have the report, says the report is destroyed and you question her why she cannot produce this report and this is at the time of the Dentons giving its investigation and     Comment?     What is telling in that paragraph, Mr Koko, is that it does not bear what you have just explained.     That is, if Mr Tsotsi’s version is correct, that is not there.  In fact, the opposite is true in your statement …[intervenes]     Let me finish.  You urged the reader to remember, you add the word remember, that at the time – the board at the time was acting on instructions from government to get rid of me.     Can I finish?     Yes, Chair.     You find that from paragraph 19 onwards.  I mean 79, I will give you the page reference, Chairperson.     79.  That is on page 26.     Chair, I should warn you, that reason spans fifteen pages of that document.     Page 26, the first paragraph on page 26,.which is 79.     Chairperson, it is unequivocal.     Correct?     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Can I get that Mr Koko, what he said?     Yes – yes, sorry, I can confirm that.     Mr Linnell says in his view the executives responsible because of influential presence, he would advise that they be suspended to avoid them influencing their subordinates.  So Mr Linnell did say it.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, I believe that you said you had been appointed into this position in October 2014 prior to you being suspended, Generation.     The position from which he was suspended on the 11 March 2015.  Is it October 2014?     Yes.     Oh, yes, so …[intervenes]     Chair, I am moving on.  Mr Koko, in regard to that paragraph you have assisted us with,     Why this burning issue of Mr  - misconduct of Mr Sikhasimbe was settled at 12 months with him at the CCMA?     Thank you, Chair.  And Mr Sikhasimbe says - you see the affidavit from him, that he is puzzled that he would have been so important to cause the suspension of four top executives and in fact the loss of the jobs of three of those executives at a high cost to Eskom.  Your comment?     Yes, I am moving on, Chair.     Yes, it is not the purpose, Chair.     It is not the purpose.     The purpose is again testing Mr Koko’s validity of the reasons given for his suspension. I am moving on, Chair.      Yes, Chair my question was if you look at the totality of the evidence, that if Mr Koko is correct that his suspension is as a result of Mr Tsotsi and Mr Sikhasimbi being suspended, Mr Sikhasimbi says wow, then I was so important that I caused four executives to be suspended and three of them to be gotten rid of.      That is right, yes.      Correct Chair.  Now let us – I had said that I will come back to the version of Mr Tsholofelo Molefe and Mr Koko, by the way you testified about the Koko hunt last time in your appearance can you tell…[intervene]      Thank you Chair.  Yes, Mr Koko I had asked in regard to the testimony the Koko hunt.  When did that start the Koko hunt?       I just want an indication of when did it start.        Okay.      So what does it entail?      Yes, but I am asking what does it entail?      Chair let me try to expedite.  Mr Koko I am going to run through the version of Ms Molefe because that version is correct as you have accepted. Now the version is that on the 10 t h of March 2015 they were in the second day of the strategy session.  Ms Veleti tells her that you are calling her to come to Melrose Arch and she did not know Ms Veleti why you were calling her and makes enquiries with Ms Molefe and Ms Molefe say well do not go if Mr Koko calls you again let him call, let him speak to me… That’s on the 10 t h, on the same date in the evening she, Ms Molefe, is called by Mr Dan Marokane and Mr Dan Marokane tells her let’s meet and they meet, wherever they met, and he relays to her what he had been told by Ms Suzanne Daniels, which is the meeting with you at Melrose Arch has ...[intervenes]      Which is the meeting with you and Mr Salim Essa at Melrose Arch, so I am just giving you that version.  With that information she meets, she goes to Mr Matona the next day, on the 11 t h of March, and that is when she says to Mr Matona I hear that we are going to be suspended.  Mr Matona says I hear – I have heard rumours also that we are going to be suspended. Now Mr Matona does not say to her well you know – or let’s start with her first, she does not say to Mr Matona I understand that you and Mr Koko are going to be suspended, and for the ...[indistinct] reason, nor does Mr Matoma respond along those lines. So clearly her suspension, or what she had heard was the suspension was in regard to the four executives as told to her by Mr Dan Marokane, Mr Marokane told by Ms Suzanne Daniels. I want to take you to a paragraph in your affidavit on page 46, paragraph 156 ...[intervenes]      Chair I can give him time to go back now.     Ja, but I am saying the version of Ms Tsholofelo Molefe which ...[indistinct]      Ja page 46 Chair.  What I was saying to Mr – to you Mr Koko, is that the version of Ms Molefe, which you say is correct, you said it last time, that is the one that is outlined there and when she goes to Mr Matona saying we – I understand we are going to be suspended she is referring to the four executives, but I want to refer you to this paragraph, paragraph 1 ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes Chair.     Okay, yes Chair.     Marokane yes.     On the 14 t h Chair.    The Saturday.    Chair the…    Well Mr Masongo did answer my question saying – he answered it in the affirmative that he told Mr Dan Marokane but I did put to him that Mr Dan Marokane did not confirm that and…    No that one is confirmed yes.    That one is confirmed.    I did provide him with Mr Masongo’s affidavit.    I specifically asked him.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Just to clarify on this Vilene Chairperson.  When she testified the transcripts shows now she is telling before we ask her questions. “And he indicated that I might be referring to Mr Koko I might be asked to ask in the role – in the role because there was not in those words there was chance that the FD was also in the list of suspensions.” So but then we – it is incumbent on us to get clarity from her.     So – can I – let me just finish.    So then we would have asked questions to clarify and she would have answered which is what Mr Koko is referring to.    And that is what the evidence is Chair.    Sorry Chair but that is …    Yes Chair thank you.  Let me put it this way Mr Koko.  You see your explanation for the – for your suspension it does not explain why these executives who are four who we understand in two different meetings before the 11t h they get suspended – talked about that is including yourself and they get suspended on the 11t h just as it is said to have been discussed at the Melrose Arch meeting.  Your version does not explain that.  That is one.   Let me add the other one.  It does not explain why the Minister comes there on the 11 t h and he – the other board members have said he speaks in support of what Mr Tsotsi had said on the 9 t h.  Identifies four areas of her concern and she says these four executives should step aside.  I will add the third one.  It does not explain why the executives who were appointed to act they say you told them they will act – at least these two.   But I told you also about Mr Abram Mabolane that you said to him this meeting you are being called to the Chairperson it is maybe about you going to act because we are going to be suspended but you did not tell him who is going to be suspended.  He walks away from your office under the impression that he is going to act in your position.  And all three of them get appointed just as they say you suggested to them. Your version does not explain that so how – how does the Chairperson view…    It also does not explain your version why the coincidence – is it a coincidence or what that Mr Masango says he told me – Mr Koko four executives are going to be suspended but I will come back and the other three will not.  And exactly that happens.    Ja.  It does not explain Mr Koko which is what Mr – Ms Daniels was told that there will be an inquiry by an independent firm. And what happens is this.  Mr Linnell who was embraced by the board to be the coordinator he had suggested the different in mind.  One to be headed by a judge and to appoint a law firm and an auditing firm.  What happens the Audit and Risk which was headed by Ms Mabude declines that terms of reference and the board goes out of its way to appoint one independent I suppose law firm Dentons to conduct the investigation.  Exactly as she was told at Melrose Arch.    Yes.  Chair as to the four executives and one returning we know that from Mr Masango.  That is from his side. And it does not explain the genesis of all these meetings – the meetings at the President’s but you said you cannot dispute that because you were not there.   It puzzles the mind that if you – if your statement could be said prior to the 11 March and prior to this executives – the three being gotten rid of that they will be gotten rid of and the witness says, I heard it from Mr Koko.  And you see the board is at pains to negotiate – to exit them and pay them huge amounts of money as harsh money to go away.  That s I said here previously that that is either a coincidence or it is an orchestration.  Your comment?  Which on the face of it it seems if you look at this witness’ evidence you would have been part of or behind it.    Mr Seleka …    Shall I ask the last question Chair?    Yes.    I ask a question in a minute Chair.  In less than a minute – I ask a question in less than a minute.  I cannot control the answer how long it is going to be.    But let me see I can simplify the questions and…    Time estimation Chair.    I think we – we could be less than ten minutes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Thank you Chair.     Okay, there, they fixed it.  And then Mr Koko, the board returns you.  They returned you back from your suspension on the basis that the Dentons Investigations did not find any wrongdoing against you but when, in fact, the board never gave Dentons the mandate to investigate any misconduct against any of the suspended executives.  Your comment?     Yes.  Then I have referred you to page 46 of your affidavit, paragraph 157.     157.     Ja, Eskom Bundle 15 Chairperson.  Sorry.     Page 46.     Oh, okay.     Paginated, yes.     Yes.  There is a paragraph there Mr Koko, paragraph 146 and I think you are specifically dealing with paragraph 27 of Ms Tsholofele Molefe’s     Eskom Bundle 11.  Please assist Mr Koko.  Eskom Bundle 11, page 15.  Paragraph 27 Chair is at the bottom of the page.     Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph reads    What     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.     Now let us got to page 37 in the same bundle Mr Koko.  Eskom Bundle 11.     Ja, the same one Ms Molefe’s affidavit is found.  Page 37 Chair.     Of the same bundle.  Eskom Bundle 11.     Where we are reading ...[intervenes]      Page 37.     You see, Mr Zethembe Khoza has denied having a prior meeting.  He was here.      He only went as – even though the meeting of the 19 t h show that he had a meeting with those people who were to act.  So he has denied that part.  You will recall in the meeting ...[intervenes]      We have...  Ja, checking was done with her Chairperson.     Ja.  As you say, it is – she says reliable sources Chair.       So...     To substantiate it.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Chair, the bundles, as my learned friend says, some of them were given to him.  The request for hard copies, I was not aware of it but I am not sure whether the Commission ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.  Oh, yes.  I have just provided my learned friend with it.  Last time ...[intervenes]      No, I understand Chair.     And he is complaining about last time.  The last time, we only referred to Mr Koko’s bundle.     No, that is correct Chairperson.     It was not available to them before.     The bundles which we used, we determined that during the course of our preparation.  So I decided today, during the course of the day, that I will seek to rely or refer to bundle – not bundle, but the affidavit of Ms Molefe.  So we did not provide it then last week or during the course of the week.      But the affidavit would have been provided to them.     Yes.     Yes.     That is right Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, Chair I accept that.  We would have shared the affidavit of Ms Molefe only with them.     The affidavit...  But is that correct?  Because when they are sent - my understanding is - when they are sent, the Rule 3.3. Notice about a particular witness Chair, they are provided currently with a password that gives them a link to the documentation that goes with that.  So I ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it is a fair point Chair.       I am not sure...       What ...[intervenes]      Chair, may I explain?     I know ...[intervenes]      I know I said it is a fair point but is has to be assessed in the context of what parties get provided with in terms of Rule 3.3.  So the bundles are available to them electronically.  So they will always have them.       H’m.     Yes, that is the point I was making because we provide with electronic versions.       So it is not hard copies Chair.       Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Give them the bundles ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.  Then page 37 of Eskom Bundle 11.  Three, seven.  Eskom Bundle 11.  Chair, this ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Thank you.  Chair, this is a transcript of Ms Molefe’s testimony at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.       You will see that this transcript is dated 8 November 2017.     The starting page is page 20 Chairperson.       The starting page of the transcript is page 20.     But the portion I want to read is in – is on page 37.  Against miss ...[intervenes]      Oh.     Oh.  What I am explaining is.  The transcript Chairperson starts on page 20.       Yes.     Paginated page 20.     The passage I want to read from is on page 37.     Yes, okay.     And that is against Ms Molefe’s name Chairperson.  You get the first two names.  Honourable Mazzone and then Ms L..  Is that Ngcanga?       Thabiso(?).       That is right.  Let me skip that.  [laughs]       Then there is Ms Tsholofele Molefe.  And there – Chair, the paragraph I...  Well, just let me read it     Have you gone through it Chair?     Correct Chair.     Yes, thank you, Chair.  If we have just gone through it.  Mr Koko – I can see his anticipating my question.  Mr Koko, this testimony which is exactly the same as in that paragraph 27 of her affidavit was done on the – was given on the 8t h of November 2017.  You know that exactly, is it not?     Do you know that exactly, is it not?     That she gave this testimony on the 8t h of November 2017.     And at that time, this Commission had not been established.       So this Commission or the team of the investigators could not have done what you allege in your affidavit in paragraph – the paragraph I have read.       157.     You want to answer the question?     Ms Molefe.     Ms Molefe.     Chair, I think the documentation speak for themselves and I have no further questions.     No, it was given before we started. 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]      Yes, I do.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chairperson, I have listened to the audio and I can certainly say the meeting of the 9 t h did not discuss suspensions.     I can confirm to you that the meeting of the 11t h certainly did.     That is correct Chair.     I have been Mr Matona’s affidavit and I am sure that he denies that.      I did not raise the issue with the board.  That is correct Chair.     When I was suspended on the 11t h of March.     The earliest opportunity I got to meet the board after the 11t h of March, I certainly did and did so sharply.     [No audible reply]      I remember that Chair.     Chairman, the meeting of where the minister was is not recorded.  And I have not seen the minutes.  So I do not know what the minister raised.       Chairman, there is no audio recordings, nor the minute of the meeting of the 11t h where the board – where the minister was.       I have listened to the audio of the meeting after the minister left.  I have read the minute of the meeting after the minister left.  The minute – the meeting of the board with the minister was not recorded, nor minute taken.  So I do not know what the minister raised at the board.     Yes.     Oh, certainly.     Certainly.     Certainly, that is what I meant.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Chair, the part that I recollect is that the minister raised areas that she needed to be investigated and there were four areas.  I also recall the evidence in this Commission that says the minister did not instruct that executives in those four areas be suspended.  She left it to the board.  That is the part that I remember.     No, I heard evidence here that the minister said she cannot instruct the board to suspend.     H’m.     No, I missed that Chair.     I...     When Mr Khoza was testifying, I was ...[intervenes]      ...busy with the counsel putting together the ...[intervenes]      Ja, Chair.  I cannot comment on what the minister told the board.     Except what I just heard.     At the first earliest opportunity Chair.     When I realised ...[intervenes]      ...that the story that the board told me, was when they told me that they had – the board has information in their possession that points to sabotage in the area of my business.  Now once somebody...   You know, you should come to a meeting prepared.  And     Yes.     Yes, Mr Govender and Mr Ntsokolo.     I am there.     No, Chair.     This, I am playing back to the Commission, I am saying if Mr Tsotsi’s version is right, that he was directed by the former President of the Republic together with Ms Myeni, one, when the opportunity  arise through Denton after interviewing witnesses who can vouch for what – for my corrupt activity, the government and the board should take that opportunity to say here is now real evidence we can work on to get rid of Mr Koko because witnesses that have been talked to by Dentons, we hear from Ms Daniels, brought in damning incriminating evidence to Denton.   Now if the government in terms of what Mr Tsotsi’s version is all about is correct, they would have been – it would have been a clinical finish.  Mr Koko, here is the evidence, here are the witnesses, step aside.  But I am simply saying that is – I mean, it is a dereliction of duty for the board that has got before it information from Denton that says I have acted corruptly and there are witnesses to support that.  Instead they bring me back but that information of Dentons does not find its way through the final report and I respect Dentons, I think if Dentons is aware of criminal activities, whatever instructions, they are professionals, that information should find its way through the final report.   So I do not buy the story that the documents were destroyed.  Even if they were destroyed, Dentons, as professionals, will stand by the report and say you have asked us to do this but we have come across this information.  It did not find its way there.  They bring me back allegedly to cooperate with other so-called agents of state capture to do what the transactions they are doing and on top of that, in October they promote me.  Does not make sense.     But this is what it means.     No.     Of course, at the time.     I understand what you mean.  But, Chair, I am here to talk to my affidavit and I will talk to my affidavit and I will not feel less to talk to what I meant, I wrote this.  Remember, this Commission was told that it is government through the former President who directed our suspension.  Remember that.  This is what this paragraph says.  So …[intervenes]     Chair, can I take you to paragraph 114 on page 35?     Page 35.     Yes, I am very clear before this paragraph in my affidavit on the reasons why I was suspended and I am also very clear that the version that I was suspended because there was an inquiry that was mooted on the 6 March in the President’s guesthouse that culminated in the meeting in Nkandla on the 8 t h.  That may be well be true and I will not quibble to it and you will remember that Nick Linnell says it is him on the meeting of the 6 t h with Ms Myeni who suggested that it is not possible to do an inquiry of this nature without getting the executive to step aside.  That is the evidence of Nick Linnell.  He also says …[intervenes]     Ja, I am certain that he said that, I am hundred percent sure.     In the meeting in the presidential guesthouse where the President was supposed to attend but did not attend and he …[intervenes]     Yes, it ended up in the meeting between Ms Myeni and …[intervenes]     Mr Linnell.  When the discussions of the inquiry was mooted Mr Linnell says to Ms Myeni it is not possible to do an inquiry of this nature and still leave the executives in their offices.  That is what Mr Linnell says.]     The President allegedly did not pitch up and they were directed to be at Nkandla and they had …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes and then …[intervenes]     Yes.  And then he says – first there was a discussion around the need for the inquiry and then there was discussion about the areas that must be investigated and at that point the areas that must be investigated were three, Generation, Commercial and the [indistinct] 13.44 problem and then he says he did not know Eskom and none of the people in the meeting knew Eskom.  The names of the people to be suspended were later emailed to him later that evening and the names were Mr Matona, Mr Koko and Mr Marokane.  Now I am not in a position to dispute or agree with that.       That may well be.  What I am putting to you is that Mr Tsotsi who testified here and said he has always wanted an inquiry into Eskom but he has not acted on it.   When the opportunity  arose through that process, to throw my name in there, he did it, otherwise he would have been objective and if he had been objective my name would not stand against Generation.  The real person who was managing Generation, at least at that point for the short time, when Mr Ntsokolo would have been there or his predecessor who managed Generation for the last seven years and the only reason Mr Tsotsi, I think – and then that is my thinking, between now and then he did not mention Mr Ntsokolo and Mr Deba(?) is because he wanted to force my name at all costs because he wanted to get rid of me because of how I responded to him with Mr Sikhasimbe.     I was appointed October – I was appointed in the position – in the Generation position in October 2014.     No, no, no, I apologise.  I was appointed the head of – the GE Technology and Commercial October 15 and then 12 months later, October 2015, the head of Generation.          I appointed in 2015, October.     October.     October 23, 2015 I was appointed the head of Generation.     2015.     October 2014, Technology and Commercial.     You are partly correct.  You are partly correct.  I was responsible at that point on …[intervenes]     In part – in March – no, no, I was responsible during that meeting for Commercial.     Right, now the trick about Commercial, it is quite elegant actually and if you know Eskom you are going to laugh at it.  The reason they have put Commercial there is because of the evidence again led by Nick Linnell based on the letter, a very poorly written letter by a gentlemen that I have never met, called Jabu Masangwane(?).  Joe Masangwane Masangwane says the corruption in Commercial is based on the diesel expenditure and at that point, Chair, Eskom was burning a billion rands per month on diesel.  Jabu Masangwane to create an excuse and a force narrative to get me suspended on Commercial issues, he says we have converted – and please listen to it again on Nick Linnell - Mr Linnell’s affidavit.  He says we have converted the open cycle gas turbines in Ankerlig and Gourikwa to base load and because of that then we were having this billion rand expenditure.  That can only come from a person who is mischievous because it is not factual or who is clueless, does not know because the only reason we were burning diesel of a billion rands a month is because the Generation fleet was sitting at an energy availability back factor at that time, and I am telling you a number that is factual, of 69%.  That is the only time when the government set up a war room because the performance of Eskom at that time was at the lowest.  It has since become the lowest now in 2020 and that was the only time – that was the time we had a Majuba coal silo collapse and we lost 3 600 megawatts at Majuba. So at that point, given the 69% of the burn energy availability factor and the fact that we lost Majuba, we had no reason but to burn diesel to keep the lights on, it had nothing to do with corruption.     Yes, yes.     Chairman, I think you …[intervenes]     Chairman, the affidavit of Mr Linnell first said there were reasons given for which areas were to be suspended.     He says there were reasons.  The reason that they gave for Commercial, which was my responsibility.     Were false.      Were false and does not matter how you look at it.     And that …[intervenes]    Correct.     Correct.     Correct.  And, and, and they made to carry the monkey that did not belong to me.     Why was it settled?     Chair, this is quite an interesting point.  So Mr Sikhasimbe was dismissed and I effected the decision itself.     I implemented that.  Then he went to CCMA.  Ms Daniels was handling that and Ms Daniels came to me and with IR and said what is your strategy?  I said the guy must not come back.  The guy was not come back, he is dismissed, that is it.  Then 2015, contrary to what many people think, Mr Chair, and the board members came here and struggled very much to give you a picture of what was happening in Eskom in 2015 and, I mean, I invite your investigators to go and check the minutes of the IFC of 26 February.  It tells you the real picture of Eskom.  It was a …[intervenes]     IFC.     The Investment and Finance – if there is any single document that tells you the position of Eskom is that it is those minutes, I think it is paragraph 5.       It says …[intervenes]     February 2015.     The 26 February.     It says we are bankrupt, the government is not going to help us, the IMPD4 must be expedited.  The load shedding in 2015 cost the economy, if you use CSI numbers, close to R85 billion in 2015.   I said to Suzanne, go handle this, I support you.  My focus is not to go to CCMA and courts, my focus is to stop the loss of R85 billion to the economy.  My focus is to make sure that we stop the primary energy cost and you will read it in there.   Suzanne Daniels came to me, the hearing of Mr Malesela took very long, the internal hearing, it took extremely long and I was very clear and I told everybody I told – I even went to – I think Mr Molefe was the CES, I said Mr Molefe, I am not spending time at the CCMA given what the IFC says about the position of Eskom, my focus is to stop load shedding.   My colleagues at Eskom will tell you, in 2015, when I took over Generation, they were having meetings, I cancelled all meetings.  I cancelled all meetings, I cancelled all executive meetings, I said our focus – our focus is to keep the lights on. We are load shedding, we are costing the economy over R80 billion a year, so - and so that is the reason why.  Ms Daniels came to discuss it with me and say we want to settle this matter, say Suzanne, make it get away, but I do not want this person here, my focus is to keep the lights on.     Mr, I heard Mr Linnell and Mr?     Mr Mosongaai?     Except that the audios of the 11 t h it is Mr Tsotsi who talks passionately about me.      The 11 t h of March meeting.      No.     The 11 t h of March meeting.     Except that it is Mr Tsotsi who is very passionate about me.     No let me tell you why.     When Mr Linnell tried to explain how he knew or how he met Mr Masanganye he frequently said in this Commission I have met him at Zola Tsotsi’s house.  I was introduced…[intervene]     Zola Tsotsi’s house.     Yes, so I cannot rule out that it was a caucus position between him and Mr Tsotsi.     Chair I am and you might be unhappy with my answer but I certainly…[intervene]     I am certainly of the opinion that Mr Tsotsi and Mr Masongwane conspired.     Correct.      Chair and you will need to give me a chance this is very, very important to my heart.     It started December 2014.      So Chair the Koko hunt started with a matter that landed on your desk that you…[intervene]     I am explaining that Chair Mr Seleka has to give me a chance here he cannot push me I will give my story.     We…[intervene]     Yes, so let me do that, so there was a project at Eskom and there is still a project called the Koeberg steam generator replacement. This steam generator replacement was delayed for quite some time before I was appointed but I am an engineer and I understood the dynamics of having the Koeberg steam generator replacement done and quite frankly the toing and froing we then ascertain like the steam generator was nonsensical.   One, two there were serious issues with the project team that was running it.  Just to summarise the story short the Koeberg steam generator contrary to what many people do not understand in my view was the Picasso to the nuclear bid into the future.  It was the single biggest nuclear project in the country second to the big nuclear future.  So we had to do it and do it properly and I made sure that we do that but the story of nuclear was politicised.  Nuclear is President Zuma and renewables is alleged to be Mr Ramaphosa.  So we had – and those dynamics played big time towards the ANC conference.  But in my mind I was clear it is the right thing to do and we will do it and I will take no prisoners.   Chair I have never been attacked so much I mean the document that is served before the court was a similar conspiracy to what we are doing now and the conspiracy was the Board tender committee awarded the steam generator contract to Western House and overnight Mr Matjila and Mr Koko changed the decision and awarded it to Ariva and they went to I think it was to the Minister and between the Minister Brown and Mr Matjila and Mr Koko moved the decision from Western House and to Ariva.   At the time Mr Chair the story sounded the believable you could have heard another Commission of Koeberg generator force but I was the phase of it, I took claim on that.  Everybody the newspapers criticised me left right and centre because they argued that I am anti-renewables and pro-nuclear.  That is where the Koko hunt start the culmination of the Koko hunt was in June 2016 when we were supposed to sign the renewable IPP’s.  Now purely on the economics of Eskom anybody who buys a product and listen to me Chair anybody who buys a product for R83,00 when he can make it for eighty-three cents a unit for eighty-three cents when he can make it for forty cents and then sell it for R2,25 is stupid and does not act in the interest of Eskom.   It is happening today and I repeat it is stupid whether government is doing it, whether Eskom is doing it, it is stupid.  You can make it for forty cents, you buy it for eighty-three cents, you sell it for twenty-five cents.  I objected to that, till today I am carrying the brunt of it that is the Koko hunt.            Yes, and everybody take that opportunity to say this guy is corrupt, his pro-nuclear, his anti-renewables if I have done something wrong for as long as I mentioned his name that is good.  When the issue of Koeberg steam generator was raised in this Commission your response which hurt me because you created an impression to the public that Mr Koko is out of line.   You said but the merits were not discussed, I wrote the judgment the merits were not discussed.  What you did not tell them is that the contract, the person who came before the court was not the person who tendered the person who came before the court did not have a local standing to court that is what when you should have said when you should have told the public it hurt me Chair that here is a DCJ telling the public that I wrote the judgment and if Mr Koko had read the judgment he would have, you did me wrong but that is fine that is the Koko hunt.      And the minority judgment of then Deputy Justice Moseneke ruled in my favour.     And the South Africans must know that there was a minority judgment by Deputy Chief Justice Moseneke that said Koko was right the words that he used was that Mr Eskom was meticulous.      I accept that Chair I made your point.      Chair I ...[indistinct] about what he says but I need to answer his question because I want to come back to ...[intervenes]      Yes, my counsel told me to keep quiet when the lead investigator speaks, and ask for permission to comment.     And I will do that.     I am at page 46.     Thank you Chair, I don’t believe Ms Molefe’s affidavit or what Ms Molefe was told that I called Ms Dlamini to come to Melrose Arch, that is false, I don’t believe that because it is false.  I have never called Ms Dlamini, Ms Nonkululeko Veleti, to come to Melrose Arch, I called her I told her I am at Melrose Arch, so the discussion between her, Ms Molefe and Ms Veleti that I told Ms Veleti to come to Melrose Arch I don’t believe it because it never happened, it is false.     No, no, no I cannot reject the conversation Chair.    I was not there when they talked so I cannot reject that there was a conversation between the two of them.     What I am saying is that if Ms Veleti Dlamini told Ms Molefe that I called her to Melrose Arch she is mistaken.     Yes, the part that I agree that with Ms Molefe and that is based purely on my interaction with Mr Matona, is when Mr Matona says he knew, he knew from, he knew – he says he knew from outsiders, I think he owes you an explanation who the outsiders are, that they will be suspended.   Ms – no, yes, that is Ms Molefe, that make it because it accords to the conversation that I had been having.   The part that should interest all of us is that Mr Matona denies that, she says I only learnt about the suspensions of the four when I was suspended.     Chairman you are not correct to suggest that Ms – no – Ms Daniels and Mr Masango are acting independently and I will come back to that.       Ja, so I am coming to that, I am saying ...[intervenes]      ...you are not correct.  I called Ms Dlamini, that is a fact, I told her I was at Melrose Arch, I actually thought she is at Megawatt Park, and what she did not tell you because we were very close, before I knew that she was at the college I was harassing her to find out what is going on, in the corridors at Megawatt Park, because that was the day I was supposed to be suspended.     I am saying what she did not tell you about our conversation when I called her and I told her that I am at Megawatt Park and I told her why I was at Megawatt Park, I told her I ran out of the office, I did not want to ...[intervenes]      I told her at Melrose Arch, I ran out of Megawatt Park because Mr Tsotsi has a permanent office at Megawatt Park, he interacts, and I did not want to come across him, but I believe that he was going to suspend us on that day and Ms Veleti Dlamini was quite senior and I said just find out for me what is going on in the corridors talk, when I – I don’t know whether I phoned him first – her first – or Mr Masango first, but I also phoned Mr Masango.    So at no stage that I told her I am at Megawatt Park, but here is a clue for your answer, at no stage did I tell her to come to Megawatt Park, I told her my story ...[intervenes]      I apologise, and I think you are right Chair.  Here is a clue to your answer, Ms Veleti and this makes me not to sleep because I am wondering why would she do that.  She says in her affidavit in the afternoon when we met at Midrand, and remember the meeting of Midrand I told you, she did not tell you, she was asked to comment on it, she said Mr Koko told me that she will be suspended with other executives and she writes it in black and white, she did not tell me who else was going to be suspended. When she comes here to sit here and she looks at you and you asked her did Mr Koko tell you that the CFO will be suspended.  She says yes, that – and it is irrational, her affidavit is very clear that I did not tell her, she comes here she says I told her.  I cannot explain why other than to say she looks, she came here, she looks at the trends, she thinks that is what you want to hear.  If you go to Ms Daniels based on the suspension letters, the four suspension letter that were shown to you by Mr Khoza and Ms Daniels that were written by her on the 10 t h in the evening ...[intervenes]      Ms Daniels, written by her and aided by Mr Salim Essa, when in her version she was not asked to assist either me or Mr Essa to write suspension letters.  That is  classical example of if ever you needed evidence that Ms Daniels was in contact with Mr Essa on that day it is those four letters.  The source of the information to Mr Marokane, to Ms Molefe he is the same person who based on the evidence here, met Mr Essa at least at seven o’clock, that is the issue for me.  She had contact with Mr Essa based on the suspension letters.   They both, Mr Masango and Ms Daniels, go to Parliament and they say we worked together to get rid of Mr Koko, so they did not act independently.   It is a story Chairman a concoction created after March 2017 after I have dealt with her – with him and Ms Kraai.  Ms Kraai and Mr – Ms Kraai and Mr    But Mr Marokane does not say that Chair.    But he does not.    Chair I listened to the testimony.    That was put to Mr Masango by Mr Seleka that Mr Masongo – Mr Marokane denies what Mr Masongo says.    Sir you – Chair.    Chair you have said we were close with Ms Daniels.    We had a very good professional relationship that is correct.    But she did not tell me that she met Mr Essa and wrote the suspension letters against the four of us and it was created by Mr Essa.  She did not.  I cannot explain that.    I just cannot explain her behaviour that here is a person on evidence before us met Mr Essa, wrote the suspension letters, Mr Essa edited the suspension letters and then she goes to Mr Marokane and say, Mr Koko took me to Mr Essa and the four of you are going to be suspended.  I just cannot explain that type of behaviour.    And Chair there is a – there is a..    I apologise Chair.    No the – I do not think that I was understood why in my discussion in my dinner discussion in Midrand which Ms Vilete says is – was twenty minutes and it was not.  And when we were discussing and she says so if you are going to be suspended – because I was very clear.  I said me and Mr Matona are going to be suspended.  I did not talk about other people who will most likely act, I said I do not know you may probably act.  There is a reason for that    And there was a reason for that.  And the reason for that is because if you look at the Eskom organisation structure the most senior person at the time in commercial – remember I was head of commercial it was her.   She had set up what we call Shared Services all the transactional activities on finance and commercial were centralised into one and she set it up and she did so well to it and she became an executive of the year.   So if you look at the succession planning and you say who is more – who are the two or three or four people who will step into the position of the Chief Procurement Officer you will be naïve if you do not mention her.    Chairman I cannot – I cannot carry that – the monkey of a Melrose Arch meeting with Salim Essa.  It did not happen.  I did not know Salim Essa in 2015.  I have put it to you go check my telephone records, go and probe whatever intelligence you can employ you will not find my contact with Mr Essa either telephonically or on the emails.   Ms Daniels met with Mr Essa on the 10 t h the evidence shows that before you.  So I cannot carry that monkey.  I did not have a discussion with Mr Essa and Ms Daniels about the suspensions.  I did not meet Mr Masongo at Melrose Arch.  I phoned him during the day he was in a meeting.  I said on the 3r d I phoned in the afternoon towards five o’clock I was driving to go and meet Ms Dlamnini.  She – he asked me he will come to where I am.  I said no, no we are neighbours so I know where he lives.  Do not come to Joburg.  But I told him exactly, exactly what I was going through.   I did not tell Mr Mabalane that he is going to act.  I have not seen his affidavit.  I am looking forward to it.  I explain to the commission why I think I was suspended and I am convinced why – I am convinced why I was suspended.   I cannot explain what Minister Brown did.  I cannot explain it but I can tell you why I think I was suspended.    Chair I once again am – if you want a witness that has said too many things that do not tie up it is Mr Masango.  And you go with his version at your own risk. What I can tell you is that the story that the board was in a conspiracy with me to take me out and bring me back.  They had an opportunity to leave me there.  I – it just does not make sense.  This story of a conspiracy that brings me back is just as a minimum just ridiculous.    Chair once again when you asked Ms Daniels that – when she said to you Ms Essa told me that four executives will be suspended and they will not come back.  And you asked me – you asked her but why did you not say so?  She could not give you a decent answer I do not think you got a decent answer.  I cannot speak for the Audit and Risk. I do not know how Dentons was appointed.  I just know I dealt with them, they interviewed me many times.  I cannot talk for the board.  They must come here and speak for themselves.    If ever there was an orchestration I was never part of it.    Chair my sincere apologies I can do with a comfort break.    No five minutes.    Five minutes.    I will run quickly.    Thank you Chair.     Chair, I think that the board must be ashamed of themselves from day one because the suspensions were not warranted.  They must be ashamed.  I told them – and the minute of the 11t h is very clear.  I went in to create a – they even had to cut – to send me outside for a cool-off, you know, like a rugby player who has been out of order.   They had to say – I had to stay outside for close to 40-minutes because I just did not agree with them.  They were not making sense.  So I was not surprised.  And when I met them, I told them.  When they gave me a settlement, I did not even look at it.  I told them by blood is blue.  I did nothing wrong. Charge me if I have done something wrong.  So I was not surprised.     46?     Chair, I saw the letter that my attorney sent you because I do believe and you may disagree with me and I could be wrong, it is okay.  I do believe that your investigators are chasing people with evidence.       By chasing people in their evidence.  And I do believe that they coach certain witnesses.  I could be wrong.  By some of the things that I read in this evidence, based on what I know, I get shocked.  It is only – it is something that I can say only in this place.  And if I am wrong, I will take it.     That is my belief and I have to say it.       And that last sentence points to that.     But let us go to what I am saying about – we talked about it.  I cannot dispute the conversation between Ms Molefe and Ms Dlamini.  I was not there.       But the content is not true.     The content is simply not true.     Eskom Bundle 11?     Chair, it is much more than that.       It is much more than that.      We are untrusted in the telephone records because we want to know ...[intervenes]      ...who was Ms Molefe talking to, who reliable – told her that.     And ...[intervenes]      And what was the discussions about.  And that is the discussion that the telephone records my counsel has been asking.       I beg your pardon?     Do know what     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair, the...  Here is the point.  And it is not a single event.  It is – there is a trend.  There is a trend that starts with the Parliamentary Inquiry on Eskom on State Capture.  And the only difference between here and in parliament is, I think we got a better Chair here that asks difficult questions.   But the tendency of investigators to given this purpose and then come and just follow that line, that is what I am all about.   Instead of saying we had to but where is your evidence?  Where are the people you say called you?  Let us interview those people.  You say four people have met with the chairman.  Where are those people?  Let us interview those four people.  Nobody is telling me about that.  And that is the point I am making.     I am saying exactly that Chair.     I am saying exactly that.     If I have to be blind about it.  It is the same. 
WITNESS:   Matshela Moses Koko.     No.     Yes.     So help me God. 
MATSHELA MOSES KOKO:  (d.s.s.) 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Before you commence.  May I just hand these documents up to you Chair?     You will recall when we were in this chamber before, when I was not here, I did refer you to the issue regarding the documents that we were – you can recall, the records that we were unable to source from the Commission’s staff.   And I then mentioned to you that it might be necessary for us in the circumstances to revert to the promotion of Access to the Information Act which we did have to do during the course of this week.  You are the Information Officer in terms of the act and the documents we ...[intervenes]      I cannot hear you sir?     No, not in terms of the legislation.     Not in terms of the legislation.     Well, it is the head of the organisation and ...[intervenes]      And that is you.  So you – so what I really want to enquiry about is.  Where you have been put in your put in your capacity as Information Officer, whether you have been put in possession of those documents?      The originals, you will see there on the 9t h of December, two days ago.     As you say.     Ja, we needed assurance ...[intervenes]  Yes. ...that you are in possession of it ...[intervenes]      ...and that in your capacity under the act ...[intervenes]      ...you will give it the necessary attention.  Thank you.     Thank you.     There is one further issue.  And that is rising from the earlier testimony of Mr Koko and what you put across during that.  We have drafted a supplementary     So it would be relevant to ...[intervenes]      ...what is at issue today.     Then the third issue is, though, and that     I am ...[intervenes]      ...very well.  So.     Chair, and then, yesterday at about – I think my attorney received the document at about quarter past ten in the morning and it is quite a substantial affidavit, a further affidavit that Ms Daniels has deposed to.  I think it was deposed to on the 30t h of November but it was only given to us yesterday.   And in this affidavit, we would have really liked to deal with that affidavit as well because it is directly relevant to today but in the circumstances, we were unable to do so.   I do not even know when it came to my attention and to my client’s attention but we are going to respond on affidavit to that affidavit in due course.     So I just want to draw that to your attention.  Thank you Chair.     On that subject Mr Chair.  There are two further subjects, apart from the suspension of the executives that my client was directed to, provide a response.  The one relates then to the Tegeta Contract if I can put it broadly in that way.  And the other relates to the McKinsey Master Services Agreement.   From what you have just said.  Can we assume that the plan of the Commission if I can put it in that way, is that those two subjects will be dealt with at the same time?     Very well.     Yes.     Oh, okay.     Much of what was in the letter...  Well, the whole letter is confirmed in the affidavit.     In his supplementary affidavit.     And more detail is given.     Particularly about the issues that we submit do fall within your terms of reference.     But have not, apparently, been investigated before you.     So that is a major aspect of it.     And but I understand what you...  Is in other words, if we can point your investigators in the direction of where matters should be available, that could potentially support my client’s version of events.     Mr Chairman, there is another thing I must raise with you.     And that is, in the previous proceedings there were certain documents that were requested from my client.  And to be perfectly frank.  It was my responsibility and I ran out of time.  We will insofar as possible make those available to my learned friends.     But we have not yet.     We apologise for that.     Really.  It is just that ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct] [00    We are gratified to learn of that.  Thank you Chair.     [Microphone not switched on]     We ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Chair, I think the conclusion of the previous hearing, in the absence of my learned friend, because he was in conference with you after the hearing, you will recall.  I had a conversation with Miss Govender(?).  And...  With Ms Jaggenhout(?)     My learned friend’s junior.     And the reason for that conversation was that Mr Koko was during the testimony on the 3rd of December, confronted with bundles that we do not have and that he was not supplied with beforehand.  That leave us in an embarrassing situation.   And the arrangement was and we referred to the files that were behind Mr Koko and said we would like to have them.   At that time, I insisted I wanted it in hard copy but the next day on the 4 t h of December, we wrote the letter and we     Yes, but ...[intervenes]      May I...?  Like you and I ...[intervenes]      ...on this point.  We are not provided with electronic access to all the bundles.     These were the only bundles that we received electronically.     I have...  If I my learned friend wants to ask questions about this bundle, Mr Koko will be able to deal with it, I am sure.     So that is fine.     For this limited purpose.      To refer to this bundle.     We are going to come back.     And we would then really like to be put in possession of the bundles.     Electronically.  In any old way, use home inspection.     But if it is like ...[intervenes]      What page?     Yes, Chair.  Chair, it is a matter of time.  The re-examination will take a substantial period of time but what I do want to do is, because the issues that have been debated with the witness here today, have all been dealt with ...[intervenes]      ...in the affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...that was ...[intervenes]      Well, it has not yet been handed up.     That is the real point I want to make.     So his more comprehensive responses ...[intervenes]      ...to this whole issue ...[intervenes]      ...are contained in here and the original of this has apparently been taken by the person on the Commission’s staff who prepares the bundles.     And – but these have already been given page numbers.     Bundle 15.     So on that basis, if I may hand up to you ...[intervenes]      ...a copy of the signed affidavit.     Then shortly, the accompanied bundle which is going to be a substantial bundle ...[intervenes]      ...will be made available electronically ...[intervenes]      ...to the secretariat.     But the issue here is that the matters that have been raised are dealt with in this affidavit in great detail.     And you will find that from paragraph 51 on page 18 of the affidavit itself.  I see it has not been numbered in accordance with bundle 15. 
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, I am a bit lost now.  What document are we referring to?     I was under the impression that you were referring to what Mr Seleka said.     But I must be mistaken, I am sorry.     It seems to me the witness misspoke when he referred to 2015, he intended to refer to 2014 and then he said a year later in 2015 [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     But it is on record but he misspoke.     Mr Chairman I have actually got a problem with what has just been stated to you.     I actually have a problem with what my learned friend has just put to you because what it really amounts to.     The intimidation of the witness.     Because what he is saying to you and he is suggesting that you and I are on the same side.     May I speak Sir?  May I speak Sir?     So it is – he is indirectly trying to limit the witness’ answers that is what he is doing and that is not fair Sir and you should not allow it.  That is not a joke.     It is not a joke Sir.     This is my very point he hides behind supposed humour.     But that is not what is happening here Sir.     And we would argue, Mr Chairman, that you should have regard to what is in this affidavit in this regard.  Similar matters have been dealt with in the original affidavit but in the meantime what has happened is that the evidence has come available that on the 10 March Ms Daniels was part to a document that was exchanged with Mr Salim Essa. That is of very crucial importance to where the truth lies. I would also point out that the passage that was referred to in Ms Molefe’s evidence before the parliamentary commission makes for interesting reading and it does not accord, but that is for you to look into, with what was said to the Commission.  What she did report at that stage is apparently that Ms Vileti came to her and said Mr Koko wants her to come to Melrose Arch and that was all and that she then later learnt the following day that the four people who were going to act in the positions of the suspended people had all been called to Melrose Arch. Now what has happened about that version of events, we have no idea but we just want to point out that it is any event inevitable that over a passage of time there are going – conflicts are going to start, people start – and you are fully experienced there, people actually start believing what is imprinted in their minds and it makes the fact-finder or the trier of facts version very difficult.   But the point that we are making is, there are of course avenues which can be followed to track the movements of people.  The cell phone companies know where calls are received and where they are made from.     Because they know which towers have been activated.     So if somebody says I was at Melrose Arch but it then appears he was on his way to Witbank, you can know about it.     That evidence is available provided of course that you ask for it.     And so that is the issue, is eventually one looks for concrete evidence.  Evidence that cannot be contravened by the mere say-so of witnesses.  But we make the point that we have dealt with these issues comprehensively in this affidavit and we now place it before you.     So that it, I would imagine, becomes available for public consumption as well.     As I say I am not …[intervenes]     Yes, yes, my learned friend has it and the original has gone off to be copied.     The point that I am making is that it is going to take time, the re-examination because we will take you through this affidavit.     And so that is going to take some time.      Thank you.     And thank you for [indistinct] 03.39 yesterday.
