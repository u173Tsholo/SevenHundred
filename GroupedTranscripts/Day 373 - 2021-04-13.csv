CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Seleka,, good morning every – Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Ja I corrected myself.  Okay alright.    The oath you took yesterday Mr Singh will continue to apply.    Thank you.  Okay let us proceed.   Or maybe Mr Seleka maybe the – there was a contract but it never came into operation because for it to get into operation there were those conditions that needed to be backed and therefor nothing should have been done under it.    Yes.    In the end it might not make much difference whether it was void from the beginning or it did come into being but did not come into effect.   And no – and nobody ought to have acted under it in circumstances  where the conditions had not been met.    That is what I am – I am – I think you are talking about or is that – was that not so?    No I may be – I may – I may have missed something.  The approvals were they not the suspensive conditions?    Oh the suspensive conditions were different.    Oh okay.    No then that is fine.   Oh okay.    Okay.  No that is fine.    Well the law as well because you know people are alleged to have entered or done certain things without contracts where they were supposed to do them only if there were contracts.  What – what – where you might have some point is the fact that Eskom states a section a certain factual position does not necessarily preclude Mr Singh from stating the factual position as he understood it – that part.  I think that part may be a fair point.  Okay.    Alright.   Yes continue Mr Seleka.    As you do so Mr Seleka always remember that as I understand it.   Mr Singh is not a lawyer.    But of course by virtue of his position he knows some laws you know.  He knows something about – so – so I am just saying as you deal with it.    Just bear that in mind.    That – ja – okay alright.ADV SELEKA    Ja.    Okay no let – I think…    Mr Singh – Mr Seleka is asking you whether you agree that as Chief Financial Officer of Eskom you would have been expected to have a working knowledge of the PFMA.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.   Yes.    Okay please …   Please – please speak up Mr Singh maybe you can – could repeat your answer.    Hm.    What email is that Mr Seleka?  I am not sure what the two of you are talking about.    You seem to be talking to the two of you between yourselves only.    And to say what?    It had require – it had the required approvals?    Because…    Because authority depending – authoritymight be something different from approval.    It just depends.  Approvals?    And are conflicting.    Ja okay.    Mr Seleka.   Hm.    Okay let me just understand that.  National Treasury had issued an Instruction Note.    And it had laid down certain requirements for the appointment of consultants on a fee basis.   And then – but they wanted that is Eskom wanted to appoint McKinsey on a risk basis.    So in other words the Instruction Note on a fee basis would not be applicable to a risk basis.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  So – but the Instruction Note from Treasury was understood to deal with the appointments of consultants.   And if you were going to – if you wish to appoint consultants not on a fee basis.  But on some other basis it was understood that nevertheless you must approach National Treasury.    For approval.    Ja.    Something else ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay so – so in other words your point is the appointment of consultants both in terms of National Treasury Instruction and in terms of Eskom policies was supposed to be on a fee basis.    And if you wanted to do something different.    You needed – if Eskom wanted to do something different namely appoint consultants on a basis other than a fee basis they needed to approach National Treasury.    For approval to do it that way.    To deviate.    That is – that is the point.    Okay.    And is Mr Singh’s position that his understanding was that the – if Eskom wanted to appoint consultants on a risk basis Eskom did not need to seekapproval for deviation as you understand it?    Ja.    From somebody at National Treasury.    Oh that is – is that the email he wanted to?    Okay.  So far so good in terms of understanding where you stand Mr Singh namely if Eskom wanted to appoint consultants on a basis other than a fee basis was it your understanding that Eskom did not need toobtain approvals from National Treasury?    Ja.    Ja.    12(d).    Okay.    I am sorry first of all what are we looking for at page 1193?    That is what you are talking about.    Okay.    And whose affidavit is this?    Okay alright.    Yes.    Ja.    Do we have those legal opinions you are talking about in one of the bundles by any chance?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.   No, no that is fine, okay, alright.  So they can be – one could see them.    At some stage.    Okay alright.  You – Mr Singh you were – you then wanted to – did you want to refer us to the letter of acceptance?   Yes.    1199 yes.    Does it quote the letter – 00   87.1.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.  Okay.    Ja what is the page?    Oh.    Okay for what it is worth let me …    Just have the acceptance letter.    Okay.  Okay.    I am not sure I understand the paragraphin the letter of acceptance.    That talks about a condition.    It says   And then the next sentence says   Ja.    Yes.    But – but you have got to – how can you say this is what the position was at the time if you do not know what it says the position is?    Or what you understood it to be.    Ja tell me what you understood to mean.   Oh okay.    Okay well it does not help then.   Well I – I – maybe the – maybe he just formulated this paragraph inelegantly but I cannot tell what he is trying to say.    Ja.    Hang on Mr Singh let Mr Seleka finish.    Ja.    And that was it.    Ja.    Ja.    You did not have a view then.    But you have a view now.    Ja is your view about what this paragraph means or is it something else?    What is that ja tell me?   Ja no I have read that paragraph I do not understand what it means.    I thought that you wanted to tell me what you think it means.    What page?   1197 of?    14(d).    Ja.  That is of Eskom Bundle 14(d).    And page 1197.    Okay.  Ja.    Ja.      But let us – let us try and shorten this if we can.  Is your position that you cannot say whether ornot the conclusion of this agreement was legal – was legal or was lawful?    Is that correct?    Ja.    Okay alright.    90 you said.    I am sorry what paragraph?    Okay I have got it.    Yes.    Well before you proceed you have thequotation in 90.2 what do you understand it to mean?    The Practice Note 3 of 2003 is that the one that said – is that the one relating to the appointment of consultants on a fee basis?   Yes but I go back to my question you remember you said in three minutes time you would have made the point.  Is your position that you are not able tosay whether the conclusion of this agreement without the approvals in terms of the PFMA was lawful or not?    So your position is that as far as you are concerned it was lawful it was proper?    Based on this ja.    Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.    Ja.    I am sorry you – did you say paragraph 90?    Oh.    Yes I think – I think you – the point you make.    When you refer to this may be saying buthere it is said that no approval was secured.    But I understand his point to be different.    Ja.    No I appreciate that.    I am saying my understanding of what Mr Singh’s view is.    Is that he is saying you can say whatever you want to say about approvals.    Here is an email from Treasury – National Treasury.   And his understanding of that email is the agreement could be concluded.    I think that is his point.  So that he sayswhoever sent the email would have known about whatever requirements.    Who sent the email.  As far as Mr Singh is concerned everything was proper then.    Articulation of not my proposal.    In terms of what you are saying.    Ja.    Ja.     H’m.     H’m.     Ja, okay.     Mr Seleka.     What, you want to go back to Eskom or what?  [laughs]     [laughs]  Is that hardly six months from January 2016 or from – or October 16 or from June 2016?    Yes?     Let me just understand.  Where you say why did you terminate, is that you as in Mr Singh or you as in Eskom?     He ...[intervenes]      He will clarify.  Okay.  Mr Singh ...[intervenes]      Let your answer, will clarify.  We will seewhether you say why you are asking me.  I did not terminate anything.  Or whether you say, yes, I terminated.     Mr Singh.     H’m.     You did not?     Not terminate the agreement?     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Your voice goes down.     But he said your affidavit said the contract was concluded in January.  And then he said, yesterday you said it was, what, 31 March?  That is what – how he sought to back up what you are saying.     H’m?    Not terminated, concluded.     H’m?     Well, Mr Singh can correct him.     He can say but I did not say that.  That will be ...[intervenes]      Yes, you did not say that.     Of course, Mr Singh, you have to tell the truth whatever the truth is, okay?     If you are able to say if having initially said in your affidavit the contract was concluded in January 2016 and later on you said it was concluded in – on the 31 s t of March 2016.  If that is what you said that version might look in a certain way.  The version you are     Yes.     No, no I accept that ...[intervenes]      Yes?     In October.     H’m.     H’m.  Ja.  Well, ...[intervenes]      H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     Ja, it might change.     Ja.     No, I ...[intervenes]      It is changing information.     Yes.  Okay.       Well ...[intervenes]      Well, is not it a fair point to make,Mr Singh, the one I think you made yesterday that you have personal knowledge of Mr Mabelane signed.     Ja.  So you have to look at what information is placed there.  You were not there when hesigned.  So you cannot say that is the date that he signed.     Ja.     Ja.  Well, the information changes, you look at it and say it would affect what you say.     Ja.    H’m.     No, no.  I think Mr Singh, the important thing is.  You did say you have no personal knowledge when it was signed.  So the person who can tell us when actually it is signed is Mr Mabelane.      And Dr Weiss has said in his affidavit when he signed.     We do not have an affidavit fromMr Mabelane, Mr Seleka?     Or when he signed.     Ja.     Deal with that.     Ja.    Ja, ja.  Okay alright.  No, that is fine.  I think let us move on.     Sorry, it is your voice again.     Well, that was a long answer.  Is it not possible for you to say the reasons why the contract was terminated were A, B, C?     Hang on.  What about it?  That there have been no compliance or what?    Ja.     H’m?     You say they did not comply completely at some stage, you said so?     Maybe let me ask the question this wayso that we can eliminate some things.  Was any of the reasons, assumingly there were two or more reasons.     Assuming – ja, assuming there were two or more reasons for the termination.  Was there any reason that was based – that related to what McKinsey had done wrong?     Nothing?     It was just Eskom’s own decision based on certain reasons?     Okay what were they?     Ja?     H’m?     Ja.     On the programme?     Ja.    Yes.     Okay the external auditors had a view which indicated that there was a risk.     They would flag it irregularity.     Irregular...  Ja, okay.  That was one.     Okay.    H’m?     Yes.  But National Treasury was questioning whether there was justification for concluding this contract on a sole source basis.     Oh, just ...[intervenes]      In general?     Okay.     Reasons.  Okay.     That is the risk that the external auditors could flag it as an irregular expenditure.     Two.  That the requirements faced by National Treasury on the use of sole source contracts.    Both in terms of forward looking ...[intervenes]      ...the kinds of things that they wanted Eskom to ...[intervenes]      ...comply with and as far as backward looking, as far as things ...[intervenes]      ...that they wanted to get reports on.     Ja, okay alright.  Mister ...[intervenes]      H’m?    Yes.     Yes.     Okay.  At that stage, was the value known?     Requirements.    H’m?     H’m?     Over three years?     Yes.     H’m?     H’m.       H’m?     H’m.     But as with regard to compliance, while on the one hand, you did say yesterday by virtue of McKinsey’s response to your letter of the 19 t h  of February.      You took the view or Eskom took the view that they were complying or they had complied but you did say that later you were not satisfied or Eskom was not satisfied about at least one requirement if I am not mistaken.     H’m?     Ja.     Yes.    Yes.  Elements of their response ...[intervenes]      ...of your ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, ja.     Had not been finalised.     Yes.     Yes.  But I thought you agreed, at some stage with him, that that part, namely the issue of SDL ...[intervenes]      Because McKinsey never concluded any agreement with a subcontractor in terms of SDL and therewas no compliance in that regard.  But you were saying when Mr Mabelane signed, you do not know what discussion may have arisen with regard to that.     Which may have led to him to sign.     But you had no personal knowledge, yourself, that the SDL requirement was met.     Ja.    Yes?     H’m?     [laughs]     Hang on Mr Singh.     Let me...  Mr Seleka thinks you might not be going towards responding to his question.    He just wants us to understand.  Yes, Mr Seleka.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay.     Okay do you want to repeat the question maybe.     Hang on a second.  Just repeat thequestion and then you answer Mr Singh.     Hang on, Mr Singh.    You said your question is – seeks to get confirmation from him or agreement whether he said something or not.  What is that you want ...[intervenes]      Did you say that yesterday, Mr Singh?    No, no.  Just focus on the last one.       He says he understood you to say yesterday.  Although when you had looked at McKinsey’s response to your letter, you had thought that McKinsey had satisfied the requirements.    Subsequently, in a meeting – I think you said ...[intervenes]      In a subsequent meeting of the SteeringCommittee, the matter was discussed and you, that is the committee, I think ...[intervenes]      ...was not satisfied that McKinsey had not satisfied all the requirements.  So he wants you to confirm whether his recollection of what you said is correct or not.     No, no.  That is fine.  At least that is clarified, ja.     Okay.     Okay let us take the ...[intervenes]      ...tea-break.  I do not know whether the pace is fine.  I have a felling the pace is not as good as it should be but you know that better because you ...[intervenes]      ...in terms of what still needs to be dealt with in terms of Tegeta.     But ...[intervenes]      ...in the end, we seek to strike a balance between doing justice to the issues and not being too slow.     So ...[intervenes]      But let us take the tea-break and then when we resume ...[intervenes]      ...if there is something to finalise on the MSA, do so but we need to get to Tegeta as soon as possible.     Okay we – it is twenty past.  We will take the tea adjournment.  We will resume at twenty-five to twelve.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.    So in other words, there was an agreement that certain work that was in progress should be finalised?     Yes, ja, okay.     I did, ja.    What is the page?     702.210.     What did you say Dr Fine’s affidavit or evidence says?     Eskom.     McKinsey.     Ja.     Yes, okay.     I think I have seen something along those lines.     In one of the affidavits.     Yes.    Ja.  Dr Weiss’ affidavit we have.     We had it yesterday.    Ja.     Ja, can we go to where he had done so?  Can we go where Dr Weiss gives a background of how Regiments was introduced to McKinsey.     If everyone’s understanding is that he does do that.     Oh okay, maybe you can read it.       Oh, page, ja?     Yes but let us go there, you will continue.  Let us go to that page where Dr Weiss deals with how Regiments was introduced to McKinsey because you said Dr Fine or Dr Weiss – Mr Singh, is that right?  You said both of them deal at length with how Regiments got to work with McKinsey.     Yes.  Is it fine if we go to whichever one of them or you want us to go to both?     Okay, alright, do we have Dr Fine’s affidavit?     Okay.    Not in any of the bundles that you have?     Oh, but it can be found somewhere?     Or we do not have it at all?     Okay, maybe it can be found for later then.     Ja, we will come to it.     Okay.  Yes, continue, Mr Seleka?     So you would have sent it while you were still at Transnet?     Yes, okay.     Okay, do you remember where we can find your letter?     Okay.  Okay, if it is not found now we can come back to it later when somebody has found it.    Okay.     Okay, let us continue in the meantime, we will come back to it once somebody has found it.    They did...?     Okay.     Okay, okay.  H’m.     Yes.     That was quite low.     Ja, okay.     While you were at Transnet?     Okay.  So do you remember which year was that?     Last time.     Okay, well I cannot remember.     Okay, okay.  So between 2012/2013 or thereabouts until you left Transnet you had met him once or twice.     Okay.  Is that in functions or privately or at Transnet?     It was the occasion when – was there an occasion when he was either your office at Transnet or somebody or Mr Gama’s office and …[intervenes]     That was Mr Gama’s evidence.     Ja, okay, okay.  So that was one of the two?     Oh, no, no – ja, okay.     Yes, okay, okay.  But you say fromaround 2012 or ’13 up to the time you left Transnet you had met once or twice?     Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     Can I go back to your one or two occasions with him while you were at Transnet?     Were those business encounters or was it just…     And were they planned or were they not planned? They were business-related, not personal.     I may be wrong but I seem to remember that last time when you talked about your encounter with him or one of your encounters with him it was outsideTransnet, is that correct?     It was not at the office, ja.  On both occasions, if it is two or not one, or you…?     You cannot remember.     Ja, you know that one of them, if there were two encounters, one of them was not in the office.       Oh, okay.     In your office, okay.     Okay.     Okay.  Okay, alright.     I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  And did you say those were not planned meetings in the sense that maybe you bumped into him or it was some function and he was one of the people in the function?     Or there was an arrangement to meet.     It was an arrangement to meet.     Okay.  And it would have been the two of you only or you cannot remember?     Okay, no, that is fine.  Mr Seleka?     No, Mr Singh, I mean, you were a CFO of Transnet, a very big state owned entity, you are not going to just go any meeting as if you are not busy.     You are only going to go to a meeting if when you look at the reason for the meeting you think it is important, is it not?     Sorry?     Well, it may well be that if it was a single meeting you would remember than if it was many meetings but it may be that if it was many meetings but only one them ran through the maybe, you know?  But youare saying you cannot remember now what the reason was but you accept that you must have known then.     What the reason was.  H’m.  Okay, Mr Seleka?    The technicians should tell us if there is a problem.     The Reverend is not here.  I think somebody will tell us just now.     You may proceed.  Okay, alright.     Did you say beginning of July?     On the 16 July.     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Please speak up a bit?    Doing what?     Well, let us understand what you are talking about.  What do you mean when you say on boarding?  I mean, if you are going to – if you are being seconded to Eskom, your own on boarding or McKinsey’s on boarding?  Which one are you talking about?     Ja, that happened before …[intervenes]    Assume duties at Eskom.     Ja.     Yes, well I do not know what you and Mr Seleka – how you and Mr Seleka are using the term on boarding, if – I would understand if you talk about yourown on boarding at Eskom but then if you are talking about your own on boarding at Eskom, I would expect that to be done by Eskom officials on boarding you.  If you talk about McKinsey’s on boarding at Eskom, I would expect that to be one by Eskom officials.  It may well be that for somereason when it was known that you would be going to Eskom you would also be – you could be included but I am not sure now when both of you talk about on boarding, whose on boarding you are talking about.     Ja.     Ja.  Oh, he has used the term.    Okay.     Ja.     Well, maybe let us start here, Mr Singh.  Insofar as you may be talking about your own on boardingat Eskom, you have heard what my understanding would be if you talk about your on boarding.  Is your understanding different from mine?     And does he make it – is it clear from his evidence who he was saying was being on boarded, McKinsey or yourself?     Or are they saying they were on boarding you at Eskom.     Ja, no well I would expect Eskom officials to onboard you, you know, not McKinsey.     But that is his term.     But basically from my understanding, my recollection  of the evidence, really there was nothing about on boarding in those discussions as far as I - in terms of my own understanding of on boarding, the discussions seem largely to have been about this is whatwe have in mind for Eskom, you are going to be CFO of Eskom, what is your take on this and that and that and you gave your take.     Is that so?     Okay.     Ja.     Ja, okay.  What does remain strange, of course, is why that should be done by an outsider and that is a point that I may have made last time, you know?     Why that should not be done by Eskom officials who are already at Eskom for somebody who is at Transnet but who will be joining them as their colleague.     Why is it normal for an outsider to – if you are – if I have a house, I have a family and somebody is going to join us and stay with us, why must somebody else not from this family prepare him to say when you stay with these people, with the Zondos, this is what you must be ready for.  Why must it not be done by me?     Ja, no, it is a strange thing.  Butanyway, you have said what those sessions were about.     Mr Seleka?     Sorry?    Well, we – no, no, but we do know that Ms Mothepu said it was either June or July?     I think she said June.    And Mr Singh would remember, Mr Singh said it was not June it was July.     In terms of the meetings, ja.    No, no, no, Mr Seleka has not talking about negotiating now.     He did talk about negotiating then but all he is saying now, he says Ms Mothepu said in those meetings the McKinsey people were making certainproposals for you to comment on and she said you were indicating those that you were not happy with and indicating what you had no problem with.  That is what Mr Seleka says Ms Mothepu said.     Are you saying that that is not true as far as you are concerned in terms of the July meetings?     In terms of the content of the discussion as opposed to the month.  You already said June is wrong.     Ja.     No, no, we are done with that, you did deny that.     Ja, you said meetings happened in July.     Ja.    Yes.  Is there a time when you say that did happen if it did not happen in July or are you saying it never happened even after July?    So is the difference therefore between your version and Ms Mothepu’s version in this regard apart from whether it was in June, whether the meetings were inJune or July, is the difference that you accept that at some stage in your interactions with McKinsey there was a time where they would make proposals and you would examine them, their merits and demerits, accept some of their proposals, reject some but you say that happened after you had assumed duty at Eskom and not before and to the extent that she says that happened before you assumed duty you would deny that part.     Okay, alright.    He says Travel Excellence was not one of them, is that right?    You say was one of them?     Okay, okay.     Do you recall how you came to do business with them or can you not recall how that came about?     Oh, okay.  Do you have a recollection of when you may have started using them?     It would have been after.     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Do you want to refer us to where that is?     Mr Seleka, let us take seven minutes break, just a short adjournment.  Let us adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     Yes, there’s the affidavit of Samira Suleiman?        Okay.    I’m sorry Mr Seleka I think you should start with what she says her relationship was with Mr Salim Essa.     Before you go to where he says, she says Mr Essa introduced Mr Anoj Singh to her.     And I think she explains earlier that Harvey World was also a travel agency or not?     Earlier in the affidavit does she not explain that Harvey World was also a travel agency?     Ja, okay.     Ja, that is sufficient.     Oh then just to connect everything      “...I was introduced to Mr Salim Essa, Mr Essa, whom I then serviced as a client.”     You can then take it from there.     No, no, you’ve got less zero’s than – it is 3000365.     Ja, how the two of them met and what arrangements they had, you wouldn’t know anything about that, or would you?     Yes, ja.     Okay, thank you.  Mr Seleka?     I think you are saying you would deal with that later, is that right?     You would like an adjournment? ADV VAN     Oh, okay, no that is fine.   Let’s take a – well it might affect, because I think you are saying it mightaffect a lot of things, okay let us take that short adjournment, we are at nearly quarter to one, okay let us take the short adjournment, give minutes.We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, we are at five to one, but maybe let’s do about ten minutes or so or fifteen minutes and then we take the lunch break.     Okay.     Okay ja, I think counsel for Mr Singh nods.  Ja, okay, alright.     I am sorry, you had read to 22.1 and Mr Singh was about to respond to it.      Do you want to respond or comment Mr Singh?     Now, I do not know whether you are referring to Mr Seleka or to me.    Yes, okay, you want to give a broad answer and then we can see whether we go to, ja…[intervene]     No, that is fine, I think that is fine.     Sorry, you say the essence.     Yes.     I know that there was the discussion of travel agents evidence during Mr Koko’s evidence, but I cannot remember whether I directly said anything, ja.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja, I would like Mr Seleka to remain in the driver's status as far as this but at some point you would be allowed to make all the points that you want to make.  But I think for now, insofar as there are errors in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit I think it may be enough for you to simply say, there are a number of errors that you have identified, or inconsistencies or contradictions or whatever it is in her affidavit.  And later on, you will identify them and say what do you make of them.    Yes.     Ja.     No that is fine, I think let us go point by point but if at the end, you say, having gone point by point, I would like to say the following broadly, that is fine.  But also, as we go point by point, you will feel free to make whatever points or if you say, well, I am listening to this, I am not admitting it. But in terms of the broad response I will be saying that this evidence in this affidavit should not be relied upon because it's got too many errors or the annexures are riddled with contradictions or errors.  That is fine, but I think let us go pint by point, as long as in the end, you will be able to make all the points you wish to there, okay.  Mr Seleka.   That relates to a booking that…[intervene]    …she says, was for you to fly from Dubai to Johannesburg on 8 June 2014.      And she annexures annexure SS1,annexure SS2, annexure SS3 and annexure SS4.  So you want Mr Seleka that we go to those before he responds to those annexures?     Well, maybe then you must not ask him to comment on the paragraph in general you must just put specific questions, such as was there a booking that was made for you to fly from - that was made by TravelExcellence for you to fly from Dubai to Johannesburg on 8 June 2014?  He might say yes there was or he says I do not know what they are talking about.  So if you want him to then maybe you just ask him specific questions based on a particular paragraph.     Okay, so you - from what you are sayingI think you are saying they may have made a booking but you did not ask them to do it.     Ja, okay.     Or did you fly from Johannesburg, from Dubai to Johannesburg on that date, irrespective of who had made the booking?     Yes, okay and you say you think it would have been on Transnet business?     Okay.     Yes, and the bookings insofar as there was such a – there may have been a trip, the booking would have been made by - would it have been made by Travel Excellence?     Would the booking insofar as you may have travelled to Dubai on Transnet business on that day, as you may have travelled from Dubai to Johannesburg, would Travel Excellence have been involved in making your booking?     It would not have and insofar as you may have been travelling for Transnet business, would there have been a standard travel agents that Transnet would use?     What was the name of that one?      You cannot remember.     But there would have been a standard travel agency.     And therefore, to the extent that if indeed you did travel on Transnet business, that travelagency may well have records.     Ja, okay.      Yes, okay. Mr Seleka.     Well, he has said, as far as his concerned, he never asked Travel Excellence, to make any booking for him to travel from Dubai to Johannesburg on that date, and I understood you to say and you must tell me if I am wrong Mr Singh. I understood you to imply that you never authorisedanybody to ask Travel Excellence to make a booking for your travelling on that occasion.     Okay.     That is the document that.     Oh, yes I see where it says ticket void.     In the column - you see the void there?     Ja.     Well, he was saying that he, as I understood he never asked Travel Excellence to make this booking and he did not ask anybody or authorise anybody to ask Travel Excellence to do that.  Is that right, Mr Singh?     And then you were referring to the fact that it says ticket void as to suggest that…[intervene]     There was never - it was not used.     But if it were to be found that you did actually travel on the 8 t h of June 2014, from Dubai to Johannesburg.  Of course, the question that would arise is how Travel Excellence would have known about your travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg.     Yes.     You will do it, Ja but bear in mind that question.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     Yes, but remember that on their version, on her version, she says Mr Salim Essa introduced you to Ms Suleiman, Mr Salim Essa on her version was keeping an account with them, was there client and whenever they made bookings that related to you and other people, I think she says, they always connected those bookings with Mr Salim Essa’s account because he was seen by them as the guarantor – she put that in quotes “guarantor”, in regard to those bookings.  By which I mean, they must have been thinkingwell, in case this person does not pay we will talk to Mr Salim Essa to say well this is somebody that you introduced to us so now they are not paying, so you must pay, that is my understanding.     Ja.     So you are saying that after Mr Salim Essa had left the country, you have continued to have dealings with them and ask them to make bookings for you.  Is that right?      And when you make those bookings they invoice you, I assume, and you pay?     Yes, so you are - but your question is, how would Mr Salim Essa be a guarantor after?     Ja, of course, she is dealing here with aspecific time as I understand it, a specific time and I do not know whether once he had left, they would still say guarantor you know, and I do not even know whether they sense of guarantor is what I am thinking.  But she says in her own affidavit, that there are occasions when you called to make arrangements for payment.  She says so in her affidavit, even during those times and then I think there are occasions when she says, Mr Salim Essa made payment in regard to your travelling, ja.  Mr Seleka.    Well, you would not say you made bookings after him, Mr Salim Essa had left.  You requested Travel Excellence to make bookings for you, after Mr Salim Essa had left, unless there was a point that you regarded as the point when he left.  So I think Mr Seleka is asking what is that point.     Have you made travel - did you make travel bookings with Travel Excellence last year?     Maybe one?     And 2019, do you recall did you make any, did you request them to make any?     Maybe one as well, but are you saying that you do not have a time that you take as the time when Mr Salim Essa left?     Ja, because that seems on the face of this - of it to undermine the point you were making.     But do you regard last year as a time when he had left the country?     Yes, but your understanding is that he left roundabout when?      But you say, definite last year – by last year he had left.      By beginning of last year, maybe?     Yes, okay alright.      Ja.     Okay, let us take the lunch adjournment it is twenty past one, we will resume at twenty past two.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES    Ja.     Just repeat that last point.    Oh is there an affidavit by Mr Singh detailing his official flights while he was at Transnet?    But just for the sake of clarity Mr Singh with regard to paragraph 22.1 can we – can we take it that you are saying you did travel from Dubai to Johannesburg onthat date or around that date?  What you are denying is that you had asked Travel Excellence to make that booking or that you had asked anybody to ask Travel Excellence to make that booking, is that correct?    Okay alright.  Okay.    Okay just repeat the point you make aboutthe receipts ja I think your – try and speak up a bit.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja no I – I understand that.  As I understand her evidence in her affidavit she does say thatthere were times when you would arrange with her that you would send a driver to give her cash to settle some of the invoices.  Now you have said that you know her.  You have said that you know Travel Excellence.  You have said that you did make bookings – you did ask them to make bookings for you at times because it may be that you also asked other agents at other times.  Is that correct?    Yes.  Now in regard to those occasions when you had requested her to make bookings for you wouldyou receive invoices from her?  Would she send you invoices and would you receive them?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay but at some stage or anotheryou would know what you – what you owed them?    Yes.  And how did you pay them?  Did your method of paying them ever include sending a driver to pay them in cash?   Ja.    Is your recollection that all payments you made that include – included cash payments even if there were – or let me ask were there some payments you made in cash?  Oh okay and would you have any recollection as to whether it was something quite usual for you to do namely to pay in cash even though sometimes you paid by other means?    It was not unusual.  Okay.  Okay alright so she – she says here a driver was – you know was sent to drop the cash.  So you are saying although you accept thatsometimes you did pay in cash but you say – you say you never sent a driver or are you saying you are not sure whether you might at some stage or another sent a driver with cash?    No, no I accept – I accept that that is what you say in regard to this invoice.  I am talking about those that you acknowledge would have been your invoices because you would have requested her to make the payment – to make the bookings for you?    In regard to those bookings which you had requested her to make for you.    Where you had to pay are you saying that there was never an occasion when you would have sent your driver to pay her in cash or are you saying you are not sure whether at some or other stage you may have sent a driver to pay her in cash or you say whenever I paid – you paid you paid her yourself even if it was in cash?    At your instance.   Yes, yes.  Is the answer yes?    Oh but whether it was a driver or not…    You are not sure.    Do you recall whom – who else you might have asked to go and pay for you in cash if it was not your driver?   Or is it something you cannot remember?    Oh it would not be somebody from work?    Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.    Ja.    Okay.     Yes.  Is there a copy for Mr Singh’s counsel?    Okay alright.    I guess you will need to have both files?    To compare.    Okay what page in the bundle?    Sorry just repeat Mr Seleka whose affidavit are we looking at now at the Transnet Bundle 5 at page 426?    Ja.    Okay.  Alright.    Okay.    I am sorry – I am sorry.  I thought you said1.13.3?    Oh okay.  A return trip to Dubai between 3 June 2014 and 8 June 2014 yes.    Yes.  The first trip of 4 June 2014.  You shared a return flight with Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta on Flight EK763.  The following individuals were in Dubai during the   So the allegation he was asked to deal with then allegation that he had a trip – he was not – he had a return trip to Dubai and back between 3 June 2014 and 9 June 2014 and that he shared that flight with Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta and the flight number is given.    And that during that same period when he was in Dubai a number of people mentioned there were also in Dubai that is what the allegation says?    Okay.   In the same bundle?    Somebody must just assist Mr Singh to find the page.  It is your affidavit where it says At paragraph1.18.2 at the top.    Oh you do not have all the pages?    Okay.      Have you found the right page Mr Singh?    Yes,  Yes    Yes.  I think for the sake of completeness Mr Singh can we take it that when you exited Dubai on 8 June 2014 you returned to Johannesburg?    Okay alright.  Okay Mr Seleka.    Just repeat your – what you are putting to him.    Oh divination.    No explain yourself Mr – do not shift the responsibility.    I am sorry just repeat that last sentence.    Ja    Yes.    Yes.    Yes but Mr Seleka’s point is this.  If you did not ask Travel Excellence – if you did not tell them you were going to be travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg on the 8th of June 2014 and if you never asked anybody to tell them or to make a booking for you to travel from Dubai to Johannesburg on the 8 th of June 2014 how would they haveknown your – how would they have known that you were going to be travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg on that date?  How would – how could they get it so right?    Do you think they have supernatural powers to know this?    Yes.    Yes, ja but she is saying between you andMr Essa she is not sure who made the request but it is one of you.    As I understand what she is saying.    Hm.    Let – let us see it – is that at 221 ha? “I cannot recall whether I spoke to Mr Essaor Mr Singh.” Is that where –     Oh I cannot recall who made the request.  Oh okay no I was – I had in mind the latter part of theaffidavit.    Ja but my understanding based on her affidavit is that when she says she cannot recall even when – where she does not mention whether it was you or Mr Essa my understanding is that she is talking about you and Mr Essa because throughout her affidavit the only person – the only persons who used to make requests for your travels were either you or Mr Essa. So in that context I understand her to be – when she says I cannot recall I am – Iunderstand her to be saying that but it may be that you are right we should not be thinking about those – any of those two maybe somebody else but she  as far as I recall she never anywhere else never says in her affidavit somebody else other than either yourself or Mr Essa would request that.    Ja.    Okay, yes.   Ja so sometimes it would be somebody else.    Ja.    Okay, okay, no, no that is…    Ja.   Yes but let us find – let us complete our understanding about what your response is in regard to you.  I think relating to the 8 th of June 2014.  Am I right to say in the end you saying well it must be – it must have – it must be a coincidence that she got that right or as you say maybe she had some supernatural powers because indeed you were – you did travel from Dubai to Johannesburg on the date that you did.    Just repeat that sentence.    On your behalf?    Ja okay.  Mr…    Yes no, no, no that might be so.  At this stage he was dealing with my question as well as MrSeleka’s question of how come they – this travel agent had this information correct if Mr Singh was not the one who told them about his travelling or somebody that Mr Singh had asked to tell them.  That – that was what we are dealing with.  Mr Seleka.    Before you go there Mr Seleka ask this question to Mr Singh with reference to paragraph 20 of Ms Solomon’s affidavit.  She says Mr Essa introduced you, Mr Singh, to her during 2014.  She says prior to that she had never met him.  Now do you recall whether, in terms ofyour own dealings with her, you had met her at any time before 2014?  No.So do you know whether ...[intervenes]      Is your recollection that it may have been in 2014 that the two of you met or would it have been after, on your recollection?  You meeting her – let us leave out Mr Salim Essa for now.  Just in terms of your owndealings with her.     So my question is.  Because you havesaid that you have had your own interactions with her.     Because you did make – ask her to make bookings for you and you did settle your invoices.  So I am asking.  In terms of your own recollection.  Are you able to say whether you met her for the first time or started dealing with her for the first time in 2014 or after 2014?  Because you have said that it was not before 2014.     H’m?     You think it may have been 2014 sometime?     Okay, no, that is fine. Now the question that arises because I think you were quite emphatic and you must tell me if I misunderstood you.  You were quite emphatic that you were not introduced by Mr Essa to her. Is that right?     Yes.  Your dealings with her from the time you started up to now, the relationship has – the business relationship between you and her has been fine. There had been no issues?     H’m.  Do you know why she would say you were introduced to her by Mr Salim Essa if actually that was not – it is not what happened?     You would not know?     Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     That is now Mr Singh’s affidavit in Transnet Bundle 5?     Page 840.     Yes.     Yes, continue.    Is your answer, therefore, yes to Mr Seleka’s question or is it a no?  He is asking you whether the reason why you said to the best of your recollection is the reason why you said that that you wereuncertain whether the trips were for Transnet business?     You were not – you are certain?     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     In other words, what Mr Seleka is sayingis.  He would have expected you, if you were relaying on the documents you are talking about, he would have expected you to say, according to these documents and you mention them, you were on Transnet business trips.       Just repeat that, please.     H’m, okay.    Mr Seleka.     In other words – you know, the point is, when you say to the best of your recollection, it does not give the impression that you are basing it on documents.       It is like you are basing it on your memory.     Okay.     I think ...[intervenes]      No, no, no.  I think Mr Singh can dealwith the question.  Mr Singh, what do you want to say in response to what Mr Seleka says or do you have no ...[intervenes]      He is saying it is strange – it will be strange that they asked you to explain your trip from Dubai or to Dubai in circumstances where the documents that they showed you reflected that it was a Transnet business trip.  That is what he is saying.  Do you want to comment on that?    H’m?     Just hang on one second, Mr Singh.  Are you able to hear him well?       [laughs]     Ja, you see Mr Sing.  You – there are two people you want to make sure they hear you.  It is me and your counsel.     [laughs]     If Mr Seleka does not hear you, you can deal with that.  [laughs]     I must hear you and your counselbecause your counsel needs to protect you.  [laughs]  And I need to make a finding about what you are saying.     Ja.  I think that is better, ja.  But after some time, you might find that you ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay alright.     Ja, just see how you – I am sorry, the space is very limited but just do your best.    Okay.  Ja, he needs both.  You see the counsel has to use this room and I would not need to use such big files.  But that is fine.  [laughs]  His space is limited.     Okay alright, ja.  Okay.  You remember the proposition?     Why it would have asked you to explain this trip, if from the documents that they showed you, it was clear that it was a Transnet business trip.     Oh, okay.     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Ja, but your requested the documents from the Commission?     Okay.  So they did have the documents at some stage?  They provided them to you?     Ja.     H’m?    Ja.  But they ultimately gave it to you?     Okay alright.  So is the point that youare making that at the time they asked you to explain, they might not have had those documents?  They might have got those documents after you made the request?     Yes.     Ja, okay alright.     H’m?    Ja.     Ja, no, no.  I think, in effect, you are saying you do not know but what you do know – you do not know when they had the documents in their possession.  That is the Commission.  What you do know is that they sent you a 10.6 directive and in that 10.6 directive, you were asked to explain this trip.  You requested information.  They provided you with information.     You do not know at what stage they were in possession of the information?    [laughs]     Ja?     Yes, but you can re-examine on it when you re-examine.  Okay.  Mr Seleka, let us continue.    What is that now, Mr Seleka?  [laughs]     You and Mr Singh, you are getting to talk about things that we are not..  [laughs]  But ...[intervenes]      Ja?     That they knew about that?     Oh, okay.  And what was the answer, Mr Singh.     Neither of the above?     H’m?     Because you dealt with her?     Ja.  Okay.     Okay.  But I did not hear you give thatanswer when the two of you were talking.     [laughs]  Oh, okay.  Maybe he was.       [laughs]     Alright, let us continue.     I guess the first question is whether you and your partner undertook that trip to those destinations and back.       Mr Singh.     Ja?     Okay.  No, that is fine.  Just do what will make you comfortable Mr Singh.     This booking?     Yes.    August 2015?     Not 2014?    Okay?     Was not pursued?     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.     Okay.     H’m?     H’m.  So is your response that, one,Ms Solomon is mistaken in saying it was your partner who requested that she make that booking but that the position is that you asked her to make the booking, numbers 2 and 3.  You and your partner did travel, fly from Johannesburg on 6 August 2014 to Dubai and back to Johannesburg on12 August 2014.  That part, you say, is correct?     Okay alright.  And with regard to the ticket numbers, you do not dispute those even though you might not recall whether those are the correct numbers?     Sorry/     [laughs]     [laughs]  Okay.  So but the trip did happen and it was booked through or by Travel Excellence.  The booking was requested by you.  And then, was – did it cost R 60 000,00?     Ja.    That is SS-6.     H’m?     Ja.     Yes, ja.     Okay I am there.  Yes?     Ja?     Yes.     Ja, h’m?     In respect of the airport tax?     H’m?     H’m?     I am looking but I think ...[intervenes]      I am thinking in the meantime whetherwe should go into the details ...[intervenes]      ...because you say the booking was requested by you ...[intervenes]      ...ja. MR     Yes?     Ja?     Yes.     R 60 000,00.    Yes, yes.     H’m.     Ja.     Yes.     H’m?     Ja.       The record(?) ...[intervenes]      H’m.    I am sorry.  Where do you see that?     Yes?     H’m?     13 November 2018.     Ja?     H’m?     You regard that date as a date for what?     H’m?    H’m.     The one at 1565 ...[intervenes]      But I think, Mr Singh, until we know what they say or she says this date represents, it is difficult to say much about it because there is nothing indicating what it is for.  Whereas if you look at the top, you can understand that is the document number, that is date, date and that is account number...  But here at the bottom, it is just a date and time.  And I do not know whether the words SUP or what.     But otherwise there is nothing writtenwhich gives us an idea what that date represents.  Maybe she can be asked to give us a supplementary affidavit and say - tell us what that date represents and then you can comment on it to see whether – what it means.     Ja.     Yes.     Just repeat that point?     Ja, let us – well, it is important to refer to, at least, the page.       These pages numbers are long.     Ja.     Ja, okay.     Ja?     Yes.     H’m?    H’m, h’m.     Ja.     Ja, ja.    H’m.     H’m, ja.  Okay.     Ja.     Yes.  Ja, she can be asked to deal with all the queries you raised insofar as they can be explained.     But this one, we – the point is.  You accept that she made the bookings for you, it was at yourrequest for you and your partner to travel to Dubai and back on the dates given.  I guess the next thing is.  Did you pay her to settle whatever the invoice was, whether it was R 60 000,00 or whatever in regard to this trip?     Are... ...[intervenes]      You paid for all of them?     Okay.  Would ...[intervenes]      Yes, would you have any proof of payment in regard to payments you made for these trips where you had requested them to make the bookings foryou?     Ja.  But where you made payments by way of cash because you said there would have been such occasions, they would have had to issue you with receipts, I would imagine?     Yes.  And where you have – where you paid by way of EFT, that should be able to be traced inyour accounts, bank accounts?     Sorry?  Yes, but to the extent that theCommission might be able to trace that.If your cooperation is required, you would give your cooperation?     You consider it?     Ja.  Because the Commission – the banks have been quite cooperative whenever the Commission has issued them with summonses to disclose certain information.  They have, generally speaking, been very cooperative.  Of course some it may be done without your consent but to the extent that your cooperation might be required, that is why I was asking but you have said you and your legal team would consider.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  But again, herversion here is quite clear namely that it was Mr Essa who settled this invoice.  She says Mr Essa paid via EFT to her Nedbank account and she subsequently transferred the money from her Nedbank account to the account of Travel Excellence.  So I take it that you are not in a position to deny whether Mr Essa made some payment to her in regard to this trip and she moved the money from her Nedbank account into the account of Travel Excellence or you are saying it is one, you never asked Mr Essa to do that.  Two, you do not see any need why Mr Essa would have donethat because he had not been involved in this booking, you had requested the booking yourself and three, you say you paid.     So if Mr Essa made some payment, maybe that is their own thing but you made – you settled this account [indistinct – dropping voice]     Yes.     Are a big issue?     No, no, I understand that.     No, I understand that, I understand that.     Okay, Mr Seleka?     You are now talking about Mr Essa’s payment?     Ja.     Yes?     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.  No, no, that is fine.  Those points should be raised with Ms Suleiman so that she can deal with them maybe in a supplementary affidavit but she must still come and give evidence, maybe she will deal with thatbut some of the points that Mr Singh is raising are things that should be easy to address.     Well also, I mean, if the relevant banks can just produce these documents then it is very objective.     And so that would be – that should be easy to just obtain the relevant documents from the bank.  But if, Mr Singh, it is true that Mr Salim Essa did pay Travel Excellence in respect of this - in respect of your travelling, even if he did so without – or if he did so without you having asked him or without any arrangement between the two of you, are you able to say why he would do that?  In other words, an amount – let us say according to Ms Solomon, an amount of R60 000 was paid by Mr Salim Essa in respect of your travelling and your partner’stravelling.  Now I understand the issues you have raised about this bank statement and so on, but let us assume that in the end the banks provide proof of the payments and it is established that indeed Mr Salim Essa made payment, whywould he make a payment in respect of your travelling and your partner ’s travelling?     Well, I guess that you cannot say that because you were not there to see whether he made the payment.  What you can say is you never asked him.     On your behalf.     No, no, no, no, no, I am not dealing with that.  If, after all the evidence is in, Mr Singh, the fact remains that Mr Salim Essa made payment to Travel Excellence and that that payment was in regard to your trip and your partner ’s trip.  If you never asked him to do so and if there was no arrangement between the two of youthat he should pay for it, why would he do that because that question will arise if as a matter of fact when all the evidence is in, the fact stares us in our face that Mr Salim Essa did make the payment on the date given by Ms Solomon and that the payment was in regard to your tripand your partner ’s trip, the two of you.  So I am saying the question that will stare us in the face is if you never asked him to pay for you, if there was no arrangement between the two of you that he should pay for you, why would he have paid this amount [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     No, no, it is not hypothetical in the sense that if the bank documents that will be asked for, if they reveal that, it will be a reality.  Of course if theyreveal that there was no payment, that is the end of the matter.  No payment by Mr Essa, that is the end of that matter.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, this is what I am raising with you.  You were not there when according to Ms Solomon she had communication with Mr Salim Essa about this payment. She says that the payment was made by Mr Salim Essa was for your trip, okay?  Now I was suggesting to you earlier on that you cannot deny what was said between the two of them because you were not there.     Okay.  But what you can say is, if Mr Salim Essa said to Ms Solomon he was paying for your trip, he was saying so without you having requesting him to do that.  That is what you can say and it might surprise you, that is another thing, but if I were to believe Ms Solomon,that this is what she was told by Mr Salim Essa, then I would then come back and say well, on the one hand you say you never asked Mr Salim Essa but we all know your trip did happen.     And Ms Solomon, based on her affidavit, it seems is not going to say you paid for this amount based on this, I do not know when she comes what she will say but based on this it looks like she will say it is Mr Salim Essa who paid and then I would have to ask myself the question but what are the probabilities that Mr Salim Essa would pay this amount, say to Ms Solomon I am paying for Mr Singh’s trip without the two of them having spoken, without an arrangement.  That is what I will be faced with and I am giving you a chance to say this is how this can beexplained, if there is an explanation that can be given.  But you might say well, I do not know how it could happen and I cannot offer any explanation, all I can say is I never asked him to and I paid for the trip myself.     Ja, okay ,alright.  Mr Seleka?     I guess, Mr Seleka, it is better to start with the question whether there was a trip.     On those dates to that destination.  Did you travel, Mr Singh, from Johannesburg, did you travel on6 November 2014 from Johannesburg to Dubai and did you come from Dubai on 9 November 2014?     We are at paragraph 22.3, page 1565.5.     Okay and it was to Dubai, from Jo’burg to Dubai and from Dubai to Johannesburg and on the dates given there.    You agree?     Okay, alright.     Okay, then the next thing is whether it is true that the booking was made by Travel Excellence.     That is so.  And then the next question is, who requested the booking?    Sorry?     You would have.  Okay, alright.  And what do you say about the payment?  She says shereceived a call from you and you informed her that a driver would be dropping off cash to settle the account and she says the account was R55 775.     Maybe the amount should be the last thing because you might need to check but in terms of you having called and told her a driver would deliver the cash to her, do you recall that?     Ja.     Okay, but you would have paid it.     Either cash or …     Okay, alright.  So the use of a driver, you say you did not.  You did not use a driver to drop cash to pay this.    H’m?     You cannot recall.     It is possible?     Okay, Mr Seleka?  Or do you want to say anything about the amount?     SS10.     Okay.     Okay, not that is fine.  Okay.  And the date of payment that she gives there, you do not take issue with the dates or do you?     Ja.     Ja.    Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Okay.    Okay.  Mr Seleka?     No, he said he does not take issue with it.     But I asked him about the dates, that iswhat I have – you take issue with the dates that she gives for payment?     No, okay ,alright.     Mr Seleka?     I am sorry, Mr Seleka, is it possible to pull your mic closer to you or is it not moveable?  Okay, ja, alright.     Well, do you want to – oh, I thought you would take us to the answer.    Because if there is an answer let us look at the answer before he says anything.     But maybe you read the whole of 1.13.6,then we go to the answer.     Ja?     Gezinhliziyo Vincent Zuma.     Nhlanganiso Ntshepe.     And let us go to the answer.     I think – well, one, he – it seems Mr Singh admits that he travelled to Dubai and back to Johannesburg on the dates given in the directive.  He has no knowledge of – he says he has no knowledge whether the individuals listed in the directive in that paragraph were also in Dubai during the period mentioned.    And he does not deny that Mr Salim Essa was on the same flight but he says he was not aware of that.     Now is the relevant paragraph of the directive which is responded to here does not coincide with 22.3 of Ms Solomon’s affidavit?     That is correct?     Okay, alright.     So you said, Mr Singh – in fact you are saying there is nothing particularly – there is nothingstrange about paragraph 22.3 about the trip because you requested Ms Solomon to make that booking and she made it and you travelled and you paid them.     Ja, okay.     Ja, okay, let us continue.    He just wants you to confirm that towardsthe end of 2014 you were still at Transnet.    Well, I think you said 2012, 2013.    And I thought you also said once or twice, is that right?      But you have agreed when Mr Seleka says on a couple of occasions.  So that seems to me to make it more than once or twice, but maybe not really, but you it is once or twice.     And around 2012, 2013 ...[intervenes]     And not 2014.     Okay.    Train could be very long.  If you are in the same ...[intervenes]    Coach.    Ja.     Well, the question is whether based on the fact that in 2012, 2013 you had met him once or twice, whether in 2014 if you met him in the same flight on which you were travelling you would recognise him?    You did not see him on the occasion.    No.     You were frequent in Dubai, Mr Singh in 14, early 2015.  Yes, continue Mr Seleka.     22.4.    So you confirm that on 23 February 2015 you flew from Johannesburg to Dubai and on 26 February 15 flew back from Dubai to Johannesburg.  Okay, and who had requested Ms Suleiman to make the booking?    Sorry?    You did?  Okay.  Continue Mr Seleka.     Yes, you cannot remember whether you sent a driver.    But you made the payment.     And can you recall whether it was in cashor you say it might have been cash, it might have been in some other way?    Yes.     Yes, and do you make any ... do you take issue with the amount?    We would have to go there.    But if you say more or less, it is fine.  I do not know if we need to go there, because you may be making the same points that you have made in regard to the others, but if you make a different point, that isdifferent.     You want us to go there?    Ja, okay.     SS14, what is the page, 1565?      Okay, I am there.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     Ja.    You say there is a discrepancy with the numbers, with the figures.   Yes, yes but other than that you admit the trip and, but you say you paid for it yourself.     Yes.     Yes, ja.  Okay.    Okay, no that is fine.  Then continue Mr Seleka.    Mr Seleka, can I disturb you and ask something else?  I do not want to forget.     And I am remember that because I am going to ask that here.  team works on my bundle toindicate, indicate a paragraph what Mr Singh’s response was, where he says I admit that this trip did happen ...[intervenes]     On that date.  From there, there and back, but I made ... I requested the 15 t h, I did not send the driver or I am not sure, I sent a driver, but I made a payment.  In regards to each paragraph I would like something like that.     But precisely because I now wanted to ask you to make sure the team can do that, I remembered that there is homework that your team was supposed to do in regard to Eskom.  That document relating to Mr Tsotsi and Ms Lynne Brown about the composition of the variouscommittees.You will recall that some time back ...[intervenes]     I had asked that your team should work on that and produce a document.     Initially the document that has been produced was not correct.  I said it should be redone.     And last time we talked about it, I saidyour team must give me the document.  I have not received this.  Now I did not want to forget that because it is important.  So ...[intervenes]     If you can make sure that I get that not later than tomorrow.     Ja, that one but in regard to this one, this is the request I am making.    Okay.      Okay, alright.  So you can continue.     So I am hoping I can get this one notlater than Monday.    Ja, okay.    Okay.  Okay.  I disturbed you while you were on something, so ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Tell me which one are difficult topronounce, I will ...[intervenes]     Well, tell me when you are stuck.    I will come to your aid.     Okay.    At Transnet?   Nhlanganiso.    He might not be able ...[intervenes]     Mr Seleka, let me complete what I would like to be done to make my job easier.   Link it with the answers of Mr Singh’s affidavit.  So that one can see they are the same.    Ja.     Ja, and his answers, yes.     Okay, alright.  So now this answer at paragraph 58 and 59, paragraphs 58 and 59 relates to what paragraph in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit?    22.4.    Okay.  Alright, thank you.  So that trip Mr Singh which you have admitted, was it a Transnet businesstrip or was it a personal trip?      The one you, the one dealt with in paragraph 22.4 of Ms Suleiman’s affidavit, that you deal with in the paragraph that we have just looked at in youraffidavit, namely paragraph 58 and 59.     Personal?    Okay, alright.  I am not sure whether we asked him in regard to each of the trips because it becomes important to know whether it was personal ...[intervenes]     Or business because his affidavit doesnot always indicate whether it was personal or business.    Yes.     Okay, okay.    Yes, okay.    Ja.     Ja, okay.  No, that helps.  Then we know that accept that one, your version is all the others which you admit were private.     Yes, okay.    Okay, okay, okay.  No, that is fine.     Ja, ja.  Let us complete what we need to ask him about paragraph 32.4.  Then let us take an adjournment, a ten minutes adjournment.  We will take theten minutes adjournment and then when we come back, we I will hear what is going to happen about the evening session from the work team concerned and ...[intervenes]     Lawyers involved.  So we will interpose.   And then depending on what I am told, we will take it from there.     Okay.  You still want to, do you still have questions on that paragraph?    Okay.    Well, not everything.  He does not accept the issue of a driver but says he is not sure whether he would have sent a driver.     But he says in the end the payment came from him.  Is that right Mr Singh?    Ja.     You have commented ...[intervenes]     Ja, ja.      Ja.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja, ja.      Ja, I think except for the issue of the driver and the issue of the discrepancy in the amount, the invoice in substance he accepts.     Ja.  Chair, it may be an opportune time to...[intervenes]  Ja, let us take a ten minutes adjournment, then we adjourn.  Thank you.    We are just interposing at this stage for me to be informed what the state of affairs is with regard to the evening session that was planned.  I was going to hear Ms Norma Gigaba’s evidence.  Mr Myburgh, do you want to tell me anything?    Yes, okay alright.  If you can do it, if your mic is working, you can do it from where you are.  That is fine.  Just make sure your mic is working or otherwise they can sanitise the podium and then you can ...[intervenes]     Oh, okay alright.     I think you can just start by placing yourself on record and then you can tell me what you need to tell me.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Would you like to read that letterinto the record?    Okay.  Is there anything you are able to tell me other than what is in the letter about her decision?    Yes.   Okay, okay.    Thank you.  Mr Myburgh, what do you say about this situation?    Yes.     Ja, okay.    Yes.     Yes.  No, that is fine.  It is surprising thatshe made this decision.  She was scheduled to give evidence on, I think Friday.  She, we were told I was told she was ready to do so via Zoom for, actually from Cape Town. Then I adjourned the hearing of her evidence to this afternoon or evening.  So I wonder what it is that could have happened in the meantime, but it seems to me that you are right in saying that she should give evidence and if she has anything to say, she will say it after the summons has been issued, and when she hears in response to thesummons. So I do authorise that a summons be issued against her.  I will give a date to the legal team to insert in the summons as to when she must appear before the commission.  So yes, and then with regard to Mr Gigaba’s application that will be set down for hearing before the commencement of Ms Gigaba’s evidence, on the day that she will be required to give evidence. So let us leave it at that, and we will take it from there.    You are excused.     Thank you.  Okay, then we can resumewith Mr Singh’s evidence.  Have you had a chance to sanitise properly?      Okay, alright.     Did they go on strike?  Okay, alright.     We have an understanding that we will try and finish or adjourn at about quarter to six.     Ja.  So Mr Singh, we unfortunately will not be able to finish again today, because we could have gone beyond, but everybody thought we would have finished earlier which has not happened, and your counsel had other commitments and we need to accommodate that and another day will be arranged for you to finish.    Let us continue.     To Mr Essa’s account.  You said Singh.    To Mr Essa’s account.     Yes.     The driver?    You, is it a definite no or you cannot recall sending a driver? MR    Okay.      The last time I think you said you do not recall having sent a driver, but you know that payment came from you?    Okay.    The same as here.     I guess unless there is an issue about discrepancy we can move to the next booking.   Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     There are no invoices?    But you say you do recall that you were sent invoices?    Ja, in regard to some ...[intervenes]     Ja, okay.    Okay.  Well, you know Mr Seleka, maybe Mr Singh could identify in regard to the next paragraph or is it only two left, two or three.   Okay, alright.  Whether the, his answer in regard to this one is the same for the rest, because then it was going to be quicker but if it is only two left, then ja.      You can just go through each one of them.     Plus proof of payment.  Or receipts from you.  You cannot provide that, but you say to the extent that you may have paid by EFT, that should be reflected in the bank records, but you do not have access to those. That is what you have said.  If the commission is able to get those, you expect that those records will s how the payments?    Oh, okay.  No, no that is fine.  That is fine.  Of course from the commission’s side, it can ask for bank records in regard to Travel Excellence in terms of what payments were given there.    Which can be identified whether they reflect what Ms Suleiman says here.  Okay, alright.  Okay.     Ja.     Ja, that is fine.     Ja.   Yes.    Yes, but I do not think you should interfere.     Ja, okay alright.  Let us continue.     Are you done, are you done with having dealt with 22.7?    You are at 22.6?    Ja, let us move on to 22.6 and 22.7 and let us finish that part.    Or subject to the usual concerns that you have raised.   The driver.    Yes, okay.    You confirm that you made the payment, what you cannot confirm is whether it was cash ...[intervenes]    Or EFT.    Ja.  Or a driver, did you say or a driver?    Okay, alright.     The invoice?    Well, I understood you to be saying as far as the invoice is concerned, subject to your concernthat you have expressed in regard to other bookings, about the discrepancy, you had no problem with the amount.  I understood you to be saying that.    Relatively?    Oh, okay.  Let us, ja let us deal with that.  Okay, what would you like to say about it?    Yes.     Ja.     Ja.    Yes, yes.     Ja, okay, okay.     Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     H’m.     H’m okay what page Mr Seleka?     That’s Transnet Bundle 5?     Ja.     You know Mr Seleka, Mr Singh if necessary can do a supplementary affidavit to say which one of these people he knows which ones he doesn’t know.  So maybe you can devote yourquestioning to more substantive things.     Ja.     Ja.     I’m sorry I didn’t hear the answer.     Well he asked a few times or a numberof times.     A couple of times.     No, no he’s not asking about the response you gave, he says, you said you may have met him at the Gupta residence.  So then he asked, oh you’ve been there, I think you said yes and then he said a couple of times and what’s your answer to that?     It was more than that?     Okay, and what estimate would yougive?      Over the whole period?     Six or eight or ten, no I think you said, not more than ten.     Oh, okay, now I remember ja.  No, no I’d forgotten that you did actually talk about how many times.    [Laughter].     Or was it on Transnet?     Oh yes, it was on Transnet ja, so I’m sorry Mr Seleka we’re talking about Transnet and you were not involved in Transnet.     Ja, no, no that’s true okay alright, so he said under the Transnet work stream he had been to the Gupta residence, either he said not more than 10 times or maybe around ten times, okay.     482?     The last paragraph?     H’m.     Ja, you were still on 22.6.     You still have 22.7.    Just repeat that Mr Singh please?     1565.37?    Okay.     Ja, okay I’m there.  What points did you wish to make about?     Yes.     Yes.     What’s the paragraph?     483?     No let him finish, Mr Singh     Raise your voice please?     Okay.     No I think he did not say it.    He did not say he did not recall, it hedenied it.    Ja.    Yes well let me ask this question.    Have you noted Mr Singh that in her affidavit about these bookings Ms Suleiman at one time says she one time says you made the request for the booking.  Other – on other times she says she cannot recall who made the requests. You note that?    Okay.  And sometimes she says you madepayment by way of arranging for a driver to drop off cash.  You have noted that?    And sometimes she says Mr Essa made payment to settle your account. Maybe just once I do not know whether it is more than once but sometimes she says so.  Do you recall that?    And – and she says I think all the time these bookings they linked them – them to Mr Salim Essa’saccount for the reason that she gave that they regarded him as the “Guarantor” in quotes.  Now you are not suggesting are you that where she says Mr Salim Essa made the payments in regard to your account your bookings or trips that she is deliberately and falsely getting Mr Essa to beinvolved in regard to your trips but you are saying she may be mistaken or are you saying no she is just fabricating?  Or you saying no I am not saying she is fabricating I think she is genuinely mistaken?    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    H'm    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay no that is fine.  We need to stop because our counsel needs to go and we did agree that in order to stop but I just want to say that it will be a – or let me put it this way.  To the extent that you made payments to Travel Excellence you would have made those payments if itwas EFT or other than cash you would have made those payments to whatever account number they would have given you, is that right?    Yes.  Yes.  And if it was cash you would have given them cash and they would have deposited themselves.    To whatever account.  Okay.  So I think that the legal team and investigation team need to makearrangements for Travel Agents – Travel Excellence bank accounts to check whether there were payments from Mr Singh in regard to any of these so that if there is proof that payments were made we can know payments were made    Alright.  I think we must stop here.    Then maybe on the day when Mr Singh  comes back to the extent that there is something to wrap up.    On this we will wrap up and then move on.    Okay alright.      Okay.  Thank you very much to everybody we are going to adjourn for the day.  For the benefit of the public tomorrow I am hearing the evidence of Mr Gwede Mantashe testifying on behalf of the ANC in regard to Parliamentary Oversight and the issue of deployment and other matters.  But basically it will be about Parliamentary Oversight and deployment because the President will towards the end of the month testify in relation to the ANC. We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Indeed.    Thank you.  Mr Singh thank you again for your availability in assisting the commission.  Yesterday we traversed a couple of – well quite a number of issues regarding the MSA and I want to conclude on that MSA.   I was about to go to what is the legal review presented to Eskom by CDH and that deal specifically with the suspensive conditions amongst other things that you were – you referred to a couple of times yesterday. But before I do that Mr Singh I want to place on record Chairperson the affidavit that I read yesterday of MrPhakamani that that matter Eskom was the Applicant and Mr Phakamani was an acting Group Chief Executive of the Applicant when he deposed to this affidavit.  So he was deposing to the affidavit for and on behalf of Eskom.  So the requirement for the NationalTreasury that we read about yesterday is actually Eskom’s position and if Eskom says there was no National Treasury approval that means the contract was a nullity from inception which means the contract never came into existence Mr Singh. And then it would not matter whether or not the suspensive conditions are fulfilled because it is neither here nor there. Do you follow that reasoning?  You – do you follow the reasoning and then you can comment on what yourview is?    Chair I am – I remember because the PFMA requirement it is a legislative requirement.    So if – if that one is not obtained at theright – at the beginning the contract according to the PFMA is a nullity – is void ab initio.    Yes well…    Yes so the Chairperson has the suspensive conditions in mind?    Oh yes what – okay I hear what the Chairperson is saying.   No.    We at Clause 3.1.    Yes.    Then the PFMA was Clause 22.    Yes.    Yes.  So there is that distinction then because as I said to you…    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    As the Group Chief Executive Officer – Chief – Chief Financial Officer you should have a working knowledge of that Act because it falls squarely within your – the purviews of your duties, is it not?    No.  The Act falls within the purviews ofyour duties is it not?    We will go to that.    Ja.    I am saying…    Thank you Mr Singh.  But clearly the – this requirement for National Treasury approval the team of which you form part was aware of it.  It is clear from the documentation.    The documentation in the bundles.  The Steering Committee meetings we can see that you talk about that approval even on the 9 t h of February 2016.    Ja.    Yes.  Correct, correct.      Say again.   Ja this is what I want to do Mr Singh Chair because I do not want to waste time on this matter.  If the – if the National Treasury approval was not obtainedthat is the one clause of the agreement the agreement then does not start off the blocks.  In addition to that you have the suspensive conditions.  Those suspensive conditions if they are not fulfilled as CDH and I was about to go to that yesterday – as CDH found in their legal review to Eskom it only serves as an aggravating factor.  But if you say they were fulfilled as you do in your affidavit of yesterday it does not change the fact that the Treasury approval because of lack thereof the agreement could not have come into force.  Youunderstand what I am saying?    Yes please.    The what?   Yes it is in your – it is in your affidavit of yesterday.    You quoted it. I do not know whether you…    Yes.    Yes…    Yes Chair just before we got there.    What Mr Anoj Singh should explain to you Mr Anoj to the Chairperson is that there was a Practice Note as we read yesterday 2013/2014 of the National Treasury which only allowed for contracting on a fee basis not risk based and Eskom had adopted that Practice Note on their policy for procurement and hence the internal people were saying that you need to obtain Treasury approval if you want to deviate from that policy of ours firstbecause we have adopted that Practice Note of National Treasury.So that is what Mr Hadebe says, that is what Mr Anoj should know.    That that is the – that is where the turning point is Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes – yes.    In the sense that the risk base is not catered for in that instruction.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    For approval.    Yes if – because you are deviating froma fee basis appointment.    You now want to do something else.    Outside.    But Eskom had taken a step further.  They had adopted that into their policy.    Yes.   Correct Chair.   Yes.    Yes.    To deviate yes.   Yes.    That is the point Chair and you find that explicitly in the affidavit of Mr Phakamani Hadebe.    And I have just for the record.    Yes that he says they relied on that email.    For that position.   From somebody at National Treasury.    Correct that is the email he wants to refer the Chairperson to.    Say again.  Eskom Bundle 14.    14(d).    14(d).    Yes Chair.     14(d). Oh.  She says it is page 1193.    Ja.  Well I started reading from page 1193 paragraph 78.1.    I do not think we incorporated them in the bundles Chair.    But I know that they – I think they are annexures or maybe they from the – what is it they call itthe Record Bundle. In that High Court application and we can – we can have them.    They are available.    But just not incorporated in the bundles.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Ja.    Basically the opinions are conflicting Chair.    Ja because one is for Eskom by one of my colleagues and the other is McKinsey sourcing anopinion from a law firm and they come to a different conclusion.    Mr Singh for the purposes of the letter of acceptance that is in Eskom Bundle 14.    Will you use that?    Ja.  But I think the Chairperson might want to have sight of the letter.    Page 811.111 but now Chair that is a different Eskom Bundle.   That is C.    Ja that is…    811.111.  And Chair as you look at it we did obtain the one – a copy signed by McKinsey.    Yes but the contents are the same.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Yes a senior moment.    Ja.    Ja Chair I am not going to be able to help you because I am equally lost by that paragraph. But as I said yesterday Mr Koko cut a long story short.    Mr Singh.    Yes he cut a long story short and I think he appreciated the fact that the conclusion of this agreement required National Treasury approval.    And he did not have it and he said…    He said so much here.    That is was wrong to conclude thisagreement.    Ja.      Mr Koko.   No I know that but you do not have a view.    Wait the Chair does not follow you.  He is referring to the paragraph Chair which is – which you just read which we cannot understand.   Yes.    80?    That is Bundle D, that is…    14(d) Chair.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  And what Mr Singh should have read to you Chair is the page before.    Which is page 1201 paragraph 90 because they seeking this thing after they have purported    90 ja.  90.    Yes.  Because Chair remember as youread.    Yes.    Yes.    So – sorry Chair yes just before that.  That after they signed the agreement and I should add purported to conclude the agreement they then sought – they took this step.    But the contract requires them to do the step before they conclude the agreement.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.      No I understand his position.     Ja.    Okay we can move on.  That is Eskom.  Mr Radebe’s position is Eskom’s position.     Ja, but we take note of the fact that you are relying ...[intervenes]      Say again?  [laughs]    [laughs]     Ja.  Well...  Yes.  Now, Mr Singh what you have said to the Chairperson, that you did not know these things at the time.  You are relying on them now when – as you see them.       Ja.  Why did you terminate this agreement, by the way?    The MSA, why did you terminate it?  The MSA was meant to be three years.  Ms Goodson, when she starts at Trillian, she is told by Mr Angel, Clive Angel ...[intervenes]      Okay.  I was asking you.  Why did you terminate this MSA, by the way?  Because it was meant to be for three years.  You terminated it hardly six monthsinto it.  It was meant to be for three years.  Ms Goodson said ...[intervenes]      That is correct, Chair.  That is – because Mr Singh’s version has changed.  You know it has evolved over time, Mr Singh?Your affidavit says January 2016, is the conclusion.  Yesterday, you were adamant it is 31 March 2016, the conclusion.  I do not know on what basis.  And then we have mister – Dr Weiss saying he only signed in October 2016.  But assuming this contract was in place and you purport to terminate it in June 2016.  Why did you terminate it?     Yes?     Well, I think maybe ...[intervenes]      Let him clarify, Chair.     I think Mr Singh knows.     They made a submission to the BTC with reasons to terminate.       So he – the case that you know, Mr Singh.     Ja.     Oh.     Oh.     But ...[intervenes]      Yes.    Thank you, Chair.  I do not need to belabour the point but Mr Singh you do not need theversion of Dr Weiss to tell the Chairperson when your, according to your knowledge, the agreement was concluded because even with Dr Weiss’ affidavit you have said it was signed in January 2016.  Yesterday you said, because of Dr Weiss’ letter of 28 June, then this agreement must have been signed between March and June 2016.     H’m.     We have one of his ...[intervenes]      No, we are getting one from him Chair.     There is one.  There is one on the issues but he does not ...[intervenes]      ...deal with this particular issue.     So we have approached him to address this issue and ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Thank you.  Mr Singh, you did not mention the reasons why the termination was made.     It ultimately became one point six billion.     It ultimately became one point six billion.     Chair, that is correct.     But the Chairperson is also correct in regard to the part which is, even after they had sent you a response to you, Mr Singh, later you met with the SteeringCommittee and you were not satisfied that they have met all your requests.  You did say that yesterday.     No, but Chair.  Can I ask Mr Singh ...[intervenes]      Mr Singh.     Yes.     Yes.  Now I ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, we have put to Mr Singh what we remember he said yesterday.    He needs to say    Yes.     Yes.  What we remember Mr Singh is saying is that they did respond to him.  He wrote the letter with those bullet points that the signing of the proposed agreement is contingent upon the successful response to this.  They responded.  And you said, however, after the response, you had a Steering Committee and you were not satisfied that they have successfully satisfied all your requests.  That is what you said.      Correct.  Which is, Chair, that even after they had received the responses from McKinsey in a subsequent meeting of the Steering Committee, the Steering Committee was not completely satisfied that they have answered all the requests.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you.     Shall we take the ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     I ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh, let me – time is the enemy at this stage.  I think we are enjoying your evidence but we will have to approach it differently.  So the termination is done on 16 June – by letter dated 16 June 2016 for the reason that you have articulated.  Those reasons, Chairperson, are found in the minutes.  Well, not the extent you have mentioned them.  The minutes of Steer Co you have mentioned but also in the submission that was made to the BTC.  Those are inthe bundle, Chair.  Can you explain to the Chairperson, Mr Singh?  After the termination in June, there were – there was a meeting with – the meeting of the Steer Committee, at least in August 2016 which still included Trillian and McKinsey.What was the reason for that further engagement with them?     What was the reason for further engaging with Trillian and McKinsey after the terminationof the MSA or the purported termination on the 16 t h of June 2016?     H’m.  Ja, the last meeting as we have it, is the 4 t h of August 2016.  Okay.  When Ms Matshepo was here, she testified that when McKinsey decided to terminate further discussion with Trillian for the purposes of considering them as a subcontractor in respect of the MSA, you were unhappy with that termination and you asked them to give – you asked McKinsey to give Trillianmore time to provide them with documentation that was required in regard to BEE and ownership of the entity but McKinsey was steadfast in their position.  What is your comment in regard to her version that you were unhappy with that decision?    Face the Chairperson.  Ja.  Did you hear, Chair?     No, that is fine.  Recall again that your – that letter of the 19 February specifically mentioned the BEE partner (Regiments Group) and in response to that letter Trillian – McKinsey rather, sorry, indicated that they will not subcontract with Regiments but they will consider Trillian which was at the time under review.  Is there reason why – well, I know you dealt with – I think you were explaining the reason why you specified Regiments yesterday, is that right?    Yes but not those paragraphs, I am talking about your requests to Trillian – I mean, to McKinsey.  Number 4 was about the development of a BEE partner (Regiments Group) as regards the visions, aspirations, yes.  Do you remember that?     Okay.     Oh, you cannot remember, okay.     Yes, correct, the opening statement.  I am just dealing with a slightly different matter and let me go further on that because when I read the affidavit of Dr Weiss and Mr Amankwah, I see something to the effect –and I want you to comment on that, that you would have been the one who introduced or suggested to McKinsey to subcontract Regiments firstly when you were at Transnet and secondly when they were at Eskom.  I am going to read that to you, you can go to – Chair, we can go to theaffidavit of firstly Mr Amankwah, Eskom bundle 14(C) page 702.10.  Assist Mr Singh there?     702.210.     Correct, Chair.  Paragraph 19.1.     Yes.  Do you have it there, Mr Singh?       19.1, Mr Amankwah     Do you have a comment on this?     Okay.     No, it is fine, that is your response.     To Dr Fine’s transcripts?     Oh, we do not have it here.     Yes.     Yes, we did have it, Chair.     I also have a...     Yes.     Yes, I am on that page, Chair.    Page...     Yes, I need us to go there because I have another question.     Yes.    Not that one, Chair, not in the bundle.     Yes.     No.     Yes.     No, we can find it.     Yes.  No, we can find it.    Yes.     We will find it, Mr Singh.     Ja.  But if you read this affidavit of Mr Amankwah and Mr Singh, is that not after the fact because when you read the affidavit there seems to be a proposal by you that Regiments should be McKinsey’s subcontractor     Okay, let us go to Dr Weiss’ affidavit. In the same bundle, page 693.     Can I move on?    Okay.  Dr Weiss’ affidavit, page 693, paragraph 44.  Are you there, Chairperson?     Yes.  Paragraph 44, this is Dr Weiss’    So you were familiar with Regiments from your Transnet dates.     You were familiar with Dr Eric Wood.     You were familiar with Mr Salim Essa.     Not?     So in what relation were you familiar with him? MR     You came to know him as the majority shareholder in Trillian when you were at Eskom.     He – it has been testified here that he was essentially the rainmaker for Trillian.  He would get Trillian to be subcontract – to get a contract with an SOE or a state entity and he would get them a major contracting party for Trillian to be subcontracted to or for Regiments tobe subcontracted.  Did you know that?     The Commission …[intervenes]    Yes, Mr Singh, his meeting with you asthe CFO of Transnet?     In these meetings?     Why meeting you?     Did you not ask him?     Chair, I see the screens are off, I do not whether the light broadcast is interrupted or...     The Reverend is not here.     Should we proceed?     Mr Singh, prior to your secondment toTransnet, Ms Tsholofelo Molefe was there.  She was approached or introduced by one of her colleagues Mr Colin Matjila to Mr Salim Essa who said there is a company Regiments that can help Eskom with cash unlocking initiatives in their balance sheet .Salim Essa and Mr Eric Wood through Regiments, they could not get what they wanted at Eskom at the time.  We know that Ms Molefe says she suspects because of her resistance to their proposal it might have been the reason why she was suspended and ultimately terminated atEskom or separated from Eskom.  You have conceded that you in fact engaged McKinsey and Regiments for your on boarding at Eskom even before your official start on the 1 August 2015, is that correct?     Can I just say something?     Mr Chair, I am putting it in Mr Singh’s inverted commas.  Insofar as he said it was his own on boarding, that is what I am saying to him.     Yes he has used that term.     But we know that the evidence we received from a witness goes wider than that.     But I am only being specific to what he said.  I am using his concept and he will explain to the Chairperson.     Yes.  Mr Singh, it is interesting that the concept – you do not seem to own that concept.  Sowhat do you call what they were doing with you in these sessions?  You say it is McKinsey’s concept.  Well, what do you say to this?     Ja, but just lastly, I think your explanation of what they were saying to you is exactly what the Chairperson – how the Chairperson was explaining.  They were pinpointing what you say there perceived to be challenges at Eskom and we know from Regiments, Ms Mothepu, that they were making proposals to you and some of the proposal you will not accept and you would do the changes and you would then say ja, this is what I want to focus on, correct?     Not in July?     When?     But if you do not know when – if you do not know when, how do you deny July?     June, June.     Yes.     That is right, yes.     Yes.     I do not know whether that is a contention.     I was putting to you her version.     Exactly what you have said.     Okay.  Well, I will not go to Dr Weiss about negotiations because you know he puts it in May, June, that they started around there and that was specifically about the negotiations.   Mr Singh, zooming back on Mr Salim Essa, youwould have seen the travel agents’ affidavits in which they say you were introduced to them by Mr Salim Essa in 2014.  What is your comment on that?     Travel Excellence is one of them.     You are saying is.     Yes.     No, Mr Chair, I cannot, my PA normallydid lots of stuff for me in my personal capacity, so it may have been here that recommended them, I am not...     Even in terms of year you cannot remember?  Okay, alright.  But it would not have been before 2010 for example?     And you have seen that they say they did your flight bookings from 2014, there is three flight bookings in 2014, three flight bookings in 20 …[intervenes]    Yes, Chair, I can certainly do that.  This is Eskom bundle 18(B)     Thank you Chair.  The affidavit is found on – Eskom bundle 18[b] page 1565 point one.    That is correct.       Samira Suleiman, an adult femaleemployed as a travel agent working at Double Excellence t/a Travel Excellence, and the relevant passages in relation to Mr Singh are from page 1565 point 4.  Are you there Mr Singh?     So I – this is - my summary was based    Yes Chair.     Certainly Chair that is on page 1565point 3, under the heading relationship with Salim Essa,     Earlier in the affidavit Chair?     Yes, yes, that is on page – the page before, the preceding page, 1565 point 2, at the top of the page, “background to my relationship with Ms Halima Alana, both I and Ms Halima Alana had been working in the travel industry for the last 30 years.   At a point in time both I and Ms Alana worked together at a travel agency called Sure Three Way Travel.  I later went on to join a travel agency named Harvey World Travel and Ms Alana left to start up her own travel agency.”     Is that sufficient?    And then going back to page 1565 point 3, paragraph 16 ...[intervenes]     Correct yes.     Yes.     Yes. “After a while many of the employees, includingmyself were let go from Harvey World.  I then contacted Ms Alana and joined her at Travel Excellence around June 2013.  Mr Essa, being my client, followed me to Travel Excellence.  At Travel Excellence I usually dealt with Mr Essa directly.  I do not believe Ms Alana ever dealt with him directly, although both Ms Alana and I have access to each other ’s mailboxes to ensure that we are able to speedily respond to the requests from clients.  Mr Essa had a standing account with us, accountnumber 300365 ...” ...[intervenes]      Thank you Chair. “Mr Essa would usually either send me an email orhe would phone me with a request for bookings.  Although Mr Essa frequently requested us to book tickets for other people we always allocated the transactions to his account as we considered him the guarantor for all such travel bookings.  Mr Essa usually corresponded with us being either his salimessa@gmail.com or salim@global.co.za email address.   Mr Essa’s secretary also frequently corresponded with us using the Salim@global.co.za email address.  I unfortunately cannot rememberher name.”  And then the next heading is Travel Arrangements for Mr Anoj Singh, I suppose Mr Anoj Singh  will have on knowledge of that information I read.     But do you know Ms Samila Suleiman?    Then travel arrangements for Mr Anoj     ...or comment on it?     Chair I think the ...[intervenes]     Thank you.  Where’s my file?   Mr Singh I was reading from that file 18, Eskom Bundle 18[b] page 1556 point 4, I have read paragraph 22, we have 22.1,     Correct Chair.     Sorry, sorry Mr…[intervene]     Thank you, Mr Singh there in paragraph 22.1 we have asked you to comment on.     That is page 1565.4.     Chair, I would like him to comment first on the content of that paragraph that there was a booking for you from Dubai to Johannesburg…[intervene]     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh that is the question then in regard to the factual allegation made, can you confirm or not that there was a booking made for you by Travel Excellence, to travel from Dubai toJohannesburg on 8 June 2014?     Yes.     Do you recall you travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg on the 8 t h of June, well…[intervene]     Yes.    Yes, I think Ms Suleiman herself says she cannot recall who made the request but the booking was for you and I think that is what we seeking to confirm with you that the booking for a flight from Dubai toJohannesburg was for you, on the 4 t h of June 2014.     On June 2014.     Then they refer to the cost of thatwhich the invoice was addressed to you although it was charged to Mr Essa’s account, but let us deal with the allegation that the invoice was addressed to you.  Which is SS2 on page 1565.13, the air ticket is also on the page just before that.  So that invoice, what do you say about it Mr Singh?     Where is that?     Yeah.      Is it the invoice or the ticket?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I see it.     I have just seen that.     Yes.  So what do you say about that?    Say again?     Yes.     Let me ask this question Chair and then maybe we can take a lunch adjournment.  Mr Singh, when did Mr Essa leave the country?     You have no idea.     No, no, Mr Singh you were telling the Chairperson what from a factual point of view, is what you want to convey to him.  That after Mr Essa left the countrywho would have served as the guarantor for the cost occasion by your flight bookings.  Now the question is pertinent to that, when do you say then to the Chairperson did Mr Essa leave the country?     But Chair, just before we adjourn.     And we will adjourn, Mr Singh, you then cannot - and I think you have to accept that you cannot use the general statement as a point of criticism in relation to this affidavit.     No, but you are not addressing what I am saying to you, you cannot use your general statement, which you said it is as a point of criticism in relation to this affidavit.  Do you accept that?      Yes, Chair we can take a lunch adjournment.    Thank you, Chair.    Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson I was conveying to Mr Singh and my learned friend that I have endeavoured to obtain Mr Singh’s affidavit to the Transnet work stream specifically on his travels between Joburg and Dubai.  I have arranged that the Chairperson’s bundle on the same be delivered in due course I would do the comparison between the…    What the agent is saying what Mr Singhhas responded to the Eskom work stream.  The Transnet work stream.    In due course when we have the – when the Chairperson’s file is here I have for Mr Singh we will then do the comparative specifically in the – in regard to the dates of travel.    Those could be – and that affidavit issubmitted to the commission under the Transnet work stream.  Yes.    Thank you.  So that 8 June 2014 Mr Singh.  Then the other aspect of the paragraph which is the    Thank you.  Mr Singh when you refer to your driver is this a personal driver?    When you refer to your driver are you referring to your personal driver?    Yes.    Oh it an allocated driver from Transnet.  Chairperson I believe the file is here and I think I should complete every section also by reference to it.    That is Transnet’s Bundle 5(b).  We have a copy for Mr Singh.    Yes there is.    Page     Yes Chair.   Yes Chair.    Page 426.  426 is a page in the 10.6 Directive – 426 – 426.  I think it has that flag – the orangeflag.  So it is (inaudible).    Yes.  Chairperson we are going to look at two documents.    The one is the 10.6 – Regulation 10.6 directive issued to Mr Singh requesting him to provide information to the commission on certain aspects.  The page reference I have now given is the page in that 10.6 directiveas page 426.    We will then also refer to the affidavit of Mr Singh responding to their request in terms of the directive.    So the first – the page I have referred to is 426 paragraph 113 he has been asked to provide information relating to local and international trips that appear to have coincided with trips by members of the Guptafamily and their associates inter alia for present purposes Chairperson 1.13.3.A return  trip to Dubai between 3 June 2014 and 8 June 2014 that is the reason why…    No 1.13.2.    Yes.  That we – we referring to 8 June 14 because of – it coincides with the date in the Ms Suleiman’s affidavit.    Yes.   Correct Chair.    Mr Singh’s response to that on page 480 - 480.      480 that is…    In the same bundle that is Mr Singh’s affidavit of the 2n d of February 2021.  480 the same bundle.    I think Mr Singh’s file has been regularised.    Yes.  So the – Mr Singh then respondsparagraph – at paragraph 1.13.2 return trip to Dubai and he    On 8 June 2014.    So then Mr Singh it is either acoincidence or divination on the part of the travel agent that they arrange your trip from Dubai to Johannesburg on the same date 8 June 2014?    Oh.    Yes.  So I am saying and you will comment it is either a coincidence or divination on their part that they arranged your return trip from Dubai to Johannesburg on the same date 8 June 2014.  Your comment?    Oh.  Ja my learned friend (inaudible – laughing).  Maybe she can explain what divination means.    Divination that means Mr Singh they would have known by some supernatural powers that you were travelling and travelling from Dubai not from Cape Town to Johannesburg on this very date of 8 June 2014.    Thank you Chair.  And to that point raised we should equally look at the – the receipts of the R9100.00 cash payment together with that ticket.  But Chair part of 21 of Ms Suleiman’s affidavit it may well also be something you had in mind it says from – so they getintroduced Mr Anoj Singh they say gets introduced to them     Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  I was going toask you, Mr Singh, about your paragraph 49 in the affidavit.  I see there ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     Four, eight...  Yes.     Five in Bundle B.     Were you say    Yes.  So is there a reason why...  Sorry.  Are you saying you relied on documents from Transnet provided to you by the Commission?     Is there a reason why you used thewords to the best of your recollection as opposed to, this document show that I travelled on a Transnet business trip?     H’m.  Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes-no, that is correct because if the documents – if – but I will find out – if the Commission gave you the documents that show what you are saying, the question is also, why would they ask you this questionthat you should explain the trips to Dubai betweenJune 2014 to 8 June 2014?     [laughs]     Yes.     Is that of your affidavit?     Okay.     [laughs]     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, then let us go back to Ms Solomon’s(?) affidavit.  Paragraph 22.2.   “The booking was requested by Mr Singh’s partner, Ms Saline Make(sic)...” Is that pronounced correctly?     Oh, Nike.  [laughs]  Is that your partner?     Is that your partner?    Is that your current wife?     Coincidence or divination?     Chair ...[intervenes]      That sentence, Chair.  I was simply confirming with Mr Singh that Ms Salina Nike is the partner.  He confirms it is his current wife.       So I was asking whether, is it a coincidence or a divination?    Yes.     He says ...[intervenes]      Oh, okay.     I was.     I did.     So. “Ms Salina Nike for Mr Singh and her flightfrom Johannesburg on 6 August 2014 to Dubai and back to Johannesburg on 12 August 2014.  Mr Singh and his partner were issued with ticket number...” And the numbers are given, two numbers. “...respectively.  See SS-5. The total cost was R 60 000,00 which was charged to Mr Essa’s account...”     Yes.     You will be a genius.     Ja.     Which invoice Mr Singh?    But the date is there in that block.     31 July 2014.     Yes?     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.     Thank you, Chair.  I just wanted to say on that aspect, Chair, it is an inter partes transaction.  If Mr Singh says he was overcharged, he must go after Travel Excellence.  The Commission, what are we going to do with it?    Well, I am saying if you say you were overcharged.     Oh, okay.     Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Wait.   Because I also wanted to comment on that.  The invoice, let us go through it, is dated 31 July 2014.  That is the invoice on page 1565.17.     1565.17, the one we have been dealing with.     Say again?     Yes, that is Travel Excellence invoice.     31 July 2014.  Do you see that?     Yes.  Now they say they receivedpayment on 6 August 2014, that is on page 1565.19.     Yes.     And then – is that electronic bankingtransfer they are talking about on the page before that, also dated August, 5 August 2014 which is the very first entry, see ex date and the amount is 60 000, the amount is 60 000 on that receipt.  So I am not sure – what are you saying, the invoice has been created to match the amount because the invoice comes before the payment.     We have dealt with?     No, only insofar as it relates to your MSA and your letter.     And Ms Solomon asserts that thisamount was then transferred to Travel Excellence’s bank account.  So on her version I would have expected her to have a bank statement that reflects her bank statement that reflects the contra of 60 000 that is going out and then if Travel Excellence’s bank statement to show 60 000 coming in.  This would deal with her version.     Yes.    Thank you, Chair.  Let us go back to Ms Sulaiman’s affidavit.  Well, let us – I must just say this part is not captured in the Transnet request to you.  So let us go to paragraph 22.3 of Ms Sulaiman’s affidavit.    Page 1565.5.     Ja.  The 6 November trip, paragraph 22.3.     Thank you. “A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from Johannesburg on 6 November 2014 to Dubai and back to Johannesburg on 9 November 2014.  I cannot recall who made the request.  Mr Singh was issued with ticket number 4724296595, see SS9.  The total cost was R55 775 which was charged to Mr Essa’s account, see SS10.  From my recollection  I received a call from Mr Singh who informed methat a driver would be dropping off cash to settle the account.  As per Mr Singh’s advice, a driver dropped off the cash on 11 November 2014.  I attach hereto the receipt issued 11 November 2014, see SS11.  This amount was deposited into our bank account together with other cash we had on hand.  The amount deposited on 11 November 2014 inclusive of the R55 775 amount to R65 700.” Now the first question again, Mr Singh, is whether there was a booking for you from Johannesburg …[intervenes]    Okay.     There was a trip?     Page 1565.21.     Chair, I did not get the answer to your question whether Mr Singh you take issue with the cash receipt.     He does not take – okay.     No, that is fine.    So just out of interest, Chair, if we might go again to the Transnet file, 5(B), page 427 because this particular clip is reflected there.  427, Mr Singh, paragraph 1.13.6.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Relates to your return trip to Dubai between 6 November 2014 to 9 November 2014, the dates coincide with Ms Sulaiman’s.  You share the flight to Dubai with Mr Salim Essa on EK766.  Shall we first deal with that?     Yes.     Yes, the answer …[intervenes]     Okay.  So the first part is you – well, the second part, you share the flight to Dubai with Mr Salim Essa on EK766. “The following individuals were in Dubai during the same period.” Chair, should I read the names of these individuals?     Mr Ashok Narayan, Mr Sanjay Grover, Mr Gezinhliziyo Vincent …[intervenes]    Vincent Zuma, thank you, Chair.  Mr Zwelakhe Nhlanganiso Ntshepe.     Tshepe. Ms Julia Basitsano Khumalo, Evan Naidoo, Mr Abraham Stephanus Burger, Mr Mohamed Intius Ahmed Patel and Mr Mohamed Iqbal Survé.     Mr Singh’s affidavit – the relevant paragraph is on page 482 of the same Transnet – of thesame bundle, yes.     482, paragraph 60, 61, 62.  So Mr     Yes.     Yes.  Is that correct, Mr Singh?    Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Obviously, Mr Singh, this is in November 2014, you would have known Mr Essa at this time.     Okay.     Let us move on.  At paragraph 22.4 …[intervenes]    We are back at Ms Sulaiman’s affidavit.  This is towards the end of 2014, Mr Singh, you were at Transnet at the time.  This is November 2014.     Sorry, I just want to piggyback on the last point.    Ja, about ...[intervenes]     Yes, and I thought I understood that you had on a couple of occasions met with Mr Salim Essa in 2014.     And you just do not recall when was that?    So you knew Mr Essa towards, by ... ortowards or by the end of 2014 you knew Mr Essa?    Yes.     Yes.     So ...[intervenes]     So this is the man you would recognise if he was on the same flight with you or on the same bus or train or car?    Ja.     Shaft, yes.     You would recognise ...[intervenes]    So let us then go to paragraph 22.4 of   I, where was I?    Yes    You confirm.    Yes, and you also confirm the facts regarding payment, you calling her saying the driver wouldcome to drop off the cash?      Thank you Chair.  Chair, if we mayagain go to the Transnet, 5(B).  Page 427.    Page 427, paragraph 1.13.5.  Which seems to correlate with Ms Sullivan’s affidavit, paragraph 22.4.    Yes, Chair.    I see.    Yes, Chair.     Yes.    Correct.     Correct.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    That is right Chair.     Yes.     Yes.  I, yes we should be able to provide it.    I will do it myself, Chair.     Yes, no but I am fine.     Mr Singh, that is Eskom, Transnet 5(B),page 427 paragraph 1.13.5.  Which I said seems to correspond with Ms Suleiman’s paragraph 24, 22.4.  So this relates to return trip to Dubai between 23 February 15 and 1 March 2015.  So I think is that one of the discrepancies you were trying to point out in the invoice or the air ticket, that it has a date of 1 March?    So it seems to be here.     Okay, thank you.  The following individuals were in Dubai during the same period and the names are there Chairperson.  Some of them are difficult to pronounce.    Can I read the ones which are familiar?  Mr Salim Essa is also there.    Okay.    Thank you, Chair.  So there is Akash Garg, Ashok Narayan, Sanjay Grover, Vivian Keith Oates.  Mr Singh, may I paused there.  We have not asked you whether you knew this people or you know them.  Do youknow these people?  You do not know Akash Garg?    Do you know Akash, Mr Akash Garg?    Ashok Narayan?    Sanjay Grover?    Vivian Keith Oates?    You do.  How do you know him?    On behalf of Ernest Nyambo?    Shamim Shaik?    You do not know.  Is that Mogammed Rafique Bagus?    Rajesh Kumar Gupta?    You know Mr Gupta.  Mr Rajesh Gupta.    Riaz Zaloojee?    Michael Andrew Thomas Hulley?    Abraham Stephanus Burger?    Salim Aziz Essa?     So the answer is yes?    Stefan Nel?   Zwelakhe Nhlanganiso ...[intervenes]     You do not know him?    Hamza Farooqui?    Michael Rodenburg?    Patrick Makhubedu?    Kim Valerie Davids?    So the answer is yes?    Now there is a Lynette Brown.  I do not know whether that is Lenelle or Lynette Brown.  Could that be the minister?  Do you know?   And Maboikanyo Imogen Mashazi?     No?    Well, they say they were in Dubai at the same time as you.  Your affidavit is on page 481.  I mean on page 481 you answer, you provide information in response.  At paragraph 1.13.5 return trip to Dubai, 23    481.    Of the same bundle.     58.    I have read 58, you confirm the dates.     Yes.     I need a document that will link what the paragraphs in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit link it with the questions in the directive.     Yes.     Correct.    And his answers.    Ja.      22.4.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct Chair.  We know Mr Singh, you have at least identified one which is the first one of 8 June 14, as according to your recollection is a, well I think  it is two.     Oh, yes.     So at least the ones in this affidavit, except for one, are private, personal.    Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Ja.     No, Mr Singh have we, you are accepting everything there with the payments as well?   Yes.     And the amount, R31 000-00?    Okay, but your recollection of what youpaid?    Okay.    Okay.    So ja, or so the substance of the allegations ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Ja.     Our helper ...[intervenes]     Thank you Chair.     Yes.    Mr Singh, back to Eskom Bundle 18.  18(B) page 1565.5, paragraph 25.5.  Are you there?  “A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from Johannesburg on 11 June 2015 to Dubai and back to Johannesburg on 15 June 2015.  I cannot recall who requested the booking.  Mr Singh was issued with ticket number9242812055, see SS17.  The total cost was R30 075-00 which was charged to Mr Singh’s account, see SS18.  From my recollection ...”    Oh, sorry.  I beg your pardon.    “To Mr Essa’s account, see SS18.  From my recollection I received a call from Mr Singh who informed me that a driver would be dropping off cash to settle the account.  As perMr Singh’s advice a driver dropped off the cash on 13 June 2015.  I attach hereto the receipt issues, dated 13 June 2015, see SS19.  The cash was deposited on 17 June 2015, along with other cash on hand, see SS19.1.”Mr Singh, again do you confirm the trip allegedly requested by yourself from Johannesburg to Dubai and back from Dubai to Johannesburg on the dates mentioned, 11 June 2015 to 15 June 2015?    You confirm making the request for that trip?    With Travel Excellence?   And ...[intervenes]     The same as ...[intervenes]     The same as here.     Mr Singh, can I ask you this?  In so far as you confirm the your request, the trips made, the dates are correct, the destinations is correct.  Were you invoiced by Travel Excellence?    Where are those invoices?   Why?    Yes.     We can do the same.    Yes.  So does it mean we will not be able to obtain the invoices from you?    No.  Okay, you can then ...[intervenes]     Now Chair, then we need to go to the Transnet bundle because ...[intervenes]     There is a correlation.    Transnet Bundle 5(B) page 427, paragraph 1.13.7.  That is the last paragraph on the page, page 427 Mr Singh.  This relates to return trip to Dubai, 11June 2015 to 15 June 2015.  You shared a flight to Dubai with Mr Ashok Narayan on EK764.The following individuals were in Dubai during the same period. Still Narayan ...[indistinct] Mr Singh, you said you what did you say about Mr Ashok Narayan, whether or not you know him?     You do not.     Ja, whether or not you know.    Mark Henry Juan Paul Verasat?    Zitholele Nyangana Absalom Sindi?    Sarushni Pillay?    Attie Gupta?     You do know her.  How do you know, is it a mister or miss?     Okay, how do you know her?   Rajesh Gupta, the next person?    Okay, so you know both of them.  Zakiya Ghardia?    Salim Aziz Essa?    It is pronounced that way, Sanyif Kumar.   Ja, thank you Mr Singh.  Zakharia Kasim Vahid?    Ashok is already there.  David CliveHersowich?      Veronica Ragavan?     Govender.  How do you know her?    You have interacted with her?    Okay.  What, do you mind telling the Chairperson what the purpose was of the interaction?    The 659 payment.    Which we will come to when we deal with the Tegeta transactions.   Ja, oh I see.  Then Chair, we go to Mr Singh’s affidavit on page 482.  In the same Transnet Bundle 5(B).  482, paragraph 63, 64, 65.     482.  So your answer is to, at paragraph 1.13.7, return trip to Dubai 11 June 2015 to 15    64 says, Mr Singh your private trips, I know we have not asked this.  If you are able to tell theChairperson when they are private what is it?  Is it a holiday you are taking to Dubai or is it something you cannot disclose because it is private and personal?    Okay.  64 says   Is it because you heard my learned friend whisper that?    Because she just said that now.  You are not allowed to testify.    She whispered that Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Obviously Chair I can traverse issues beyond the directive to Mr Singh.  Mr Singh, then let us go back to, sorry.  Chair, you do not have any question before?   No, we are still ...[intervenes]     No, we are still at, we are just finishing 22.5.    Yes.  Mr Singh, back to Ms Suleiman’s    And the place as mentioned, from Johannesburg to Dubai and back to Johannesburg?    The amount, hundred and forty thousand, do you also confirm it?    Ja, and the ...[intervenes]    The way in which payment was made?    Ja.      You cannot recall how you made the payment?    Thank you Chair.  There is again in this case a correlation in the directive, in the Eskom, Transnet Bundle 5(B), page 428.       Did they give you a discount?    Did they give you a discount?     Ja, thank you Chair, and I also see that the tax invoice doesn’t only include tickets it also includes what appears to be Dubai visas, amounts to multiple entry and then the ticketing fee.     H’m.       Sorry Mr Singh how would you receive invoices from Travel Excellence?     H’m on WhatsApp?     Or?     I thought the CFO would be fastidious about these things?     Page – Transnet 5(B) page 428.     Yes, 113.8.     You are there, Mr Singh, it relates to a trip to Dubai between 15 December 2015 and 24 December 15, that corresponds with paragraph 22.6 in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit,“The following individuals were in Dubai during the same period, Marc Henry – ja those difficult names, Henry, John, Paul …[Indistinct], Zanier Verbeek, do you know that person Mr Singh?     Hamza Farooqui, I’ve already asked you, Soojang Dejon[?], Ashrack Narajan[?], Idam Essa.     You don’t know him, he seems to be related to Mr Essa?     Zeenat Osmani[?] do you know him?     Sureya Kent Singana[?].     Artie Gupta, you know, Shubange Gupta?     You don’t know?     Amankant Singana[?]     Chasank Singana[?]     Duduzane Zuma?    Duduzane Zuma?     You don’t know Mr Duduzane Zuma?     Oh, you’ve never met him?     Mogammed Rafique Bagus.     Rajesh Kumar Gupta?     Yes?     Yes, Edward Mziwoxolo Zuma?     Jan Hendrik Christiaan Smal?     Seipati Sylvia Dlamini?     Thabo Sylvester Johnson.     Shamim Shaik?     Marco Rottenberg?     Tokyo Sexwale?     You don’t know Mr Tokyo Sexwale     Tokyo Masima Gabriel Sexwale.  Janow Alphen de Kock?     Sakiya Vulga.     Fana Hlongwane?     Xolisa Kennedy Memani?     Tato Motwe.     Surely?  Your answer?     No.  Patiswa Gift Magashule?     David Clive Haskovitch?     Sumati Neil Jacobs?     Ayanda Dlodlo?     Madwikano Imogen Mashazi?     Zachariah Cassim Mahied?     Paul Shondlo Flati?    Yes.     Yes, David Douglas Des van Rooyen?     So you know of him?     Ja, Prosper Ladislas Abessi?    Mohamad Noah Kapati?     You know of him?     Yes.     Kupdan Terran Moodley?     Yes.    You know of him?     How do you know of him?     How do you know of him?     No, no that’s fine but I just want to know how do you know of him?     To what effect?     His involvement in Regiments?    You’ve never met him through Regiments?     Ashu Chala?     Yes, so you have been…[intervenes].    Okay.     Yes Chair.     Thank you, oh, sorry but can I follow up on this question Chair, which I just had?     Mr Singh you said you might or may have met him at the Gupta residence?     Is that in Saxonwold?    You have been there?     A couple of times?     Yes.     A couple of times.       But I wasn’t – was I here?     I wasn’t here.     Okay, it’s fine, I won’t read the rest ofthe names Mr Singh, if we need to do a supplementary affidavit we can do so but I’ll be in touch with your legal team.  Then your affidavit is on page 482 at the bottom of the page paragraph 66.     482.     Yes.     The bottom of the page, paragraph 66.    So the - it’s an answer to paragraph 113.8, return trip to Dubai 15 December 2015 to 24 December 2015, Mr Singh says, “I confirm that I travelled return to Dubai on thedates set out above”, Mr Singh again it will be for private purpose?     And then the next page is, “I have no knowledge whether the individuals listed in this paragraph were in Dubai during the period mentioned since I have not been provided with any proof thereof”. Should we read into that, Mr Singh, that you didn’t meet with them in Dubai?   Sorry I can’t hear?      So even in those occasions when Mr Salim Essa is said to have been in Dubai the same time, should we read your answer to that, where you say that you have no knowledge that they were present there, to mean that you did not meet with them?     Chairperson I think we’ve reached the end of it, paragraph – that was 22.7.     Ja we’re getting to that.    That’s correct, that’s Ms Suleiman’s affidavit Mr Singh sorry to have to jump between the two files. Page 1565.6 paragraph 22.7 reads, “A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from Johannesburg to Dubai on 50524 February 2017 and back on 27 February 2017, I cannot recall who made this request.  Mr Singh was issued with ticket number 9150537622CSS24.  We further also booked a ticket for Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta (Mr R Gupta) for this flight, together with visas for Mr VarunGupta and Mr [indistinct] Singala, the invoice is addressed to Mr R Gupta and was charged to account number C000349 which was the account belonging to Sahara Computers, a Gupta owned entity.  The total amount invoiced was R134 560.00 CSS25.  To the best of my recollection I received a call from Ashu Twala who was our contact person at Sahara Computers who informed me that a driver would be dropping off the money in cash.  This, in deed took place seeing as the driver dropped ofR170 000 in cash shortly thereafter, the difference would have been for settlement of outstanding fees on their account CSS26.  This cash was again given to a friend, who in turn made an EFT payment to Travel Excellence FNB account CSS27”.I will – for completeness I will read,  “In the past, we have frequently assisted the Guptas with booking flights for themselves or for other parties on the request of either the Guptas or Mr Essa, then 22.9, it is common for our clients to pay cash for their bookings, both Mr Essa and Mr Singh frequently sent their drivers to deliver cash for their bookings”, Mr Singh do you – that 22.7, do you confirm the trip from Johannesburg to Dubai on 24 February 2017 to 27February 2017?     You do, at your request again?     With Travel Excellence?     And for private purpose?     Your – the payment, they say it was made by Sahara Computers, did you make the paymentyourself?     You did?     Do you know of Sahara Computersmaking this payment as alleged?     Do you know whether – were you aware that Mr Rajesh Gupta, together with Mr Varun Gupta and Mr Singala were also booked on the same flight?     She says for this one, “We further also booked a ticket for Mr RajeshKumar Gupta for this flight, together with visas for Mr Varun Gupta and Mr Singala”, Ja, well, maybe we should then just confine ourselves to Mr Rajesh Gupta.     On that flight?     Do you recall, how much you paid?     Well, I don’t think she says you paid because she says Sahara Computers made the payment and that was a cash payment dropped off by a driver but she seems to suggest that the payment for yourself and MrRajesh Gupta for the flights and then on the other hand for the visas for the two other gentlemen was a collective payment made by Sahara Computers.     Yes.     Thank you, there is a correlation again, Chairperson, in Transnet.    Bundle 5(B) page 428, Mr Singh, paragraph 1.13.9.     428.    1.13.9, the second last paragraph, return trip to Dubai between 24 February 2017 and 27 February 2017, that’s one and then the second part of it you shared both flights to and from Dubai with Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta on flight EK762 and EK761, you have said you were not aware of him?     Your response to this is on page 483 of the same Transnet Bundle 5 (B).    483 paragraph 68, 69 and 70, it’s an answer to paragraph1.13.9 return trip to Dubai, 24 February 2017 to 27 February 2017, paragraph 68 reads, “The content of this paragraph is denied.  I specifically deny the allegation that I travelled return to Dubai between 24 February 2017 to 27 February 2017”,Now – okay Mr Singh I’m not appreciating, yet, your denial so you will help me understandbecause…[intervenes].     Because the allegation in Ms Suleiman affidavit, paragraph 22.7 I thought is to the same effect ofyour – it’s not?     Okay, you can explain the difference because you admit Ms Suleiman’s allegation…[intervenes].     428 yes, 1.13.9.     Yes.     Can you compare this with Ms Suleiman’s paragraph 22.7 because I know you accept that one, you admit that one but I just need to understand whatis different – what is the difference between the two because she also says a booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from Johannesburg to Dubai on 24 February 17 and back on 27 February 2017.  I cannot recall who made this request, Mr Singh was issued with a ticket.  So,that part you have said that it is correct and I thought it is the same as …[intervenes].     You want the ticket, SS24?     Is on page 1564.36.     So are you saying the omission of Deli is what you’re trying to correct?     No that was a trip on those dates 24 to 27 February from Johannesburg to Dubai and back from Dubai to Johannesburg.    Oh, so it’s correct – what is it, it’s correct, save that you need to add Deli to it?     Okay but is it the same as the 10.6 directive?     Which, I suppose insofar as thequalification is made in regard to Ms Suleiman’s affidavit add Deli, accept the rest but you need to add Deli, I think, nothing further turns on that.     No, it’s just the issue of payment, of course which is the one lingering issue.     In the sense that she says there was a global payment of R170 000 from Sahara Computers, you say you paid for yourself.    And  then whether you were with Mr Rajesh Gupta on the flight, you say – what do you say, you’re not aware of that or you deny that?     Oh, you didn’t see him.  Chairperson that is on the travel.  Can you recall how did you pay for this flight, Mr Singh, for this trip?     Yes, but how did you pay, can you recall, or you wouldn’t, driver drop off cash, EFT?     Okay, now, Mr Singh, looking at this evidence or affidavit of Ms Suleiman that it was Mr Salim Essa who introduced you to them, you say you can’t recall.    Oh you denied it?    Okay.  Oh then that will make me ask you   Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes Chair.  Thank you. 
MR SINGH:  That is fine Mr Chair.    Oh so 00   So – so (inaudible) just wanted that question not the first one?      Or do you want me to respond to the first oneas well?    Mr Chair I would agree with that but I would qualify that by saying.   That I would be expected to have a working knowledge of aspects that are applicable to my specific domain.    Which is finance hence I said Section 54.2b for example is Capital and Procurement Capital Projects those are things that negate that entail us that we dealt with almost on a daily basis.    In terms of procurement and all of these other aspects Mr Chair hence we have a very specific function within Eskom as well as Transnet.  We have a fully fledged group legal function as well as compliance – as well as a compliance function and they are the ones that arecapacitated and accountable in terms of delegation of    So now the technical test.  Is that better?  Now?    Okay.  So in terms of the question as it relates to the PFMA being something that I should be particularly familiar with Mr Chair yes I do concede that itis something that I am familiar with.  I am familiar with the sections of the PFMA that applied to me in my specific daily activities as it relates to the CFO.  Issues – broader issues like procurement and other aspects of the PFMA Mr Chair I normally left to the specialists and those are theGroup Legal functions as well as the Legal and Compliance functions within the – both the organisations certainly I will quote is Eskom and Transnet.They are specifically delegated those functions through the delegation of authority premise.    By which documentation makes it?   In the Steering Committee?    Oh yes it is – it says there it has been obtained.    So it comes back to this point Sir.    Okay carry on you – I – you going to make a point.    I understand totally.  Do you want me to respond?    So firstly Mr Chair as I said to you yesterday or as you correctly say today I am not a legal person but I will give you my view for what it is worth and also secondly Mr Chair in terms of correction to Mr Seleka as I said yesterday when he started with this topic these matters are not – were not within my personal purview at the time.  Iunderstood that there was something that was happening but they were not in my direct interactions on a daily basis.  Even if you look at the affidavit that Mr Koko had – Mr Hadebe’s affidavit that Mr Seleka had taken us through it was Mr Koko that was dealing with this matter at a latermeeting that he had called with Mr Laher, with Mr Mabelane and with Mr Govender.  So from that perspective that team was dealing.  Ultimately an individual by the name of Mr Ave Gorie who was from Procurement engaged with National Treasury to obtain the email that we obtained.  Let us just park there – there for now okay.So that is the context within which I give my feedback now.  So between then and now I have come across all of this information which I will now give you my view on and the reason why I give you my view Mr Chair isbecause the Parliamentary Inquiry called on me to provide that.So that is how I come across this information.  First point to make Mr Chair is that Mr Seleka is correct in saying that Mr Hadebe in his affidavit acts on behalf of Eskom and provides a view that Eskom had at this point in time.Similarly Mr Chair when I sit here and I provide an affidavit I was also an official of Eskom at the time.  So I provide you a version of – of the events and the facts thatexisted at the time.So that was Eskom’s view at the time.  If it was correct at the time all well and good – if it is now proven to be incorrect then it is incorrect.  But it is not for me to say whether it was right or wrong because that is not my – asyou say I am not a legal person. But all I can tell you now is I knew of the events that occurred leading up to and what the Eskom position was at the time given the information that we had at the time.So Mr Chair in terms of the National Treasury approvals Mr Chair as I said and maybe we should try and find this email of the 4 t h of February.  Do we have it somewhere in the bundle?    The email that we received from National Treasury on the 4 t h of February 2016?    Did we put it?    Is the email there actually?    Submitted yesterday.    Okay.    Mr Chair it is…    Mr Chair it is the email that Eskom relies on – that Eskom relied on at the time.   To say that it had the required authority to enter into the contract relative to…    Approvals or authority or standing to enter into a risk-base contract.    Which is…    No hence – hence I am saying Mr Chair.    Well you see this is where I think there is some level of confusion in my mind if I look at what hashappened.Eskom relies or Mr Hadebe relies on I think Practice Note 1 okay which requires an approval for a deviation which is what I think Mr Koko testified to in terms of the document he had signed.The email that we referred to Mr Chair is relying I think on a different Practice Note that effectively allows for entities such as this one to allow to enter into risk base contracts without a deviation necessarily having to be sought from National Treasury.So there is two different schools of thought.    Oh I – from what I can see I think that is what the – the problem is Mr Chair.  And one seeks to say listen you have the – this schedule is applicable and therefor you can enter into this contract.  That is the email that we refer to.What Mr Hadebe relies on is a schedule that effectively says you require to physically apply for a deviation which in that case you would have do something– submit something to them, consider it and then receive an application for an approval or a non-approval.So in my view I think that is where the issue lies and I think therefor I am saying Mr Chair in order for me to demonstrate what the position was at the time when Eskombelieved it had the requisite standing – let us call it standing to enter into the risk base contract this email provides that context.So that would be for the issue of whether the PFMA was complied with or not before we get to the suspensive contract.    No but…   Mr Chair.    Mr Chair I think you are summarising it correctly but I just need to add one…    Additional point.    Mr Chair Mr Seleka and I think Mr Hadebe or Mr Hadebe and Mr Seleka is following their thumb taking a view of convenience to say Practice Note was clear cut and was applicable.  Right.  So in – from what I can understandin the – in the documentation that we currently have now but this was not a clear cut Instruction Note that was black and white and was applicable or not.  There was some ambiguity as to whether it was applicable or not.  Now yesterday when Mr Seleka took us through MrHadebe’s affidavit and maybe we should go there – what is it again?    Yup.    14.      Oh so sorry.      I 00   Yes.  So Mr Chair you will see and the – the paragraph that I would like you to go to is – oh so page.    So that is…   Yes so this is the affidavit I was talking about Mr Chair.    But if you – if you move to page 119…   This is Mr Hadebe’s affidavit Mr Chair.    If we move to page 1195 you see paragraph 81 there Mr Chair?    It says there was a meeting that was called on or about 27 October by Mr Koko.    Okay and 81.1 basically deals with the peoplethat were there who are basically Mr Mabelane Chief Procurement Officer, Mr Govender who was the Programme Director on this, Eskom’s then Director Group Capital, two representatives from Vikas – from McKinsey being Vikas and Dr Weiss and 81.2 deals with Mr Laher explaining the hold-up in the conclusion of the Master Services Agreement relating to National Treasury approval which again relates to this matter of the fixed fee versus the risk base fee vis-a-vis the Instruction Note that Mr Seleka speaks to that found its way into the Policy document.81.4 Mr Chair is what is applicable to us.  81.4    Yes Mr Chair I would have – I would have like to.    So maybe actually Mr Chair let us just use Mr Hadebe’s affidavit if we then move to page 1199.    Actually Mr Chair…    Oh.    Mr Chair for – for convenience at this stage whatever it is worth paragraph 84 of Mr Hadebe’s affidavit deals with Advocate Paul Kennedy SC’s opinion and thereis a – they quote a relevant extract.    If it – if it is helpful for you Sir.    Ja.    I was just going to use – I was just going to use Mr Hadebe’s affidavit.    Yes because it is written – it is actually quoted.   Mr Chair I also have not – as I said I was not party to this.    I know nothing of this all I can say is this is what the position was at the time.    So 00   Well Mr Chair as I said I qualified by saying I was not party to it but if you want me to give you my view I will tell you what existed at the time.    Understood it.    Well Mr Chair at the time as I said I was not party to it so I did not know what it meant.    Okay.    But Mr Chair before we go…   Who?    No that is fine but you asked me for my view so I am giving you my view Sir.    No I have a view.  I do not 00   No Sir.    Based on the information that I see yes MrChair.    No Mr Chair I am taking you through the relevant information that existed and I am bringing you to a point that was one of the – that is one of the – how can I say?  Pertinent facts that you were need to be aware of that existed at the time in that Mr Mabelane issued this letter with that condition.    Mr Chair the paragraph you just read in the letter of acceptance.  So if we then move on Mr Chair to …    Oh okay.  So Mr Chair I can attempt to tell what I think it means now.  If you look at – if we go back to 83.1 Mr Chair.    Page 1197.    The same.    D.    Yes.   So we are at paragraph 83 – 83 83.1    So there you see Mr Chair on – at paragraph   Mr Chair.    Mr Chair is you give me three minutes ofmaximum.    I will – I will try and conclude this matter.    Okay.  So my first contention Mr Chair is that we are comparing two different Instruction Notes.  2003 Instruction Note 1 which is what Mr Hadebe and Mr Seleka relies on and to an extent now Mr Koko.But if you move to – one second Mr Chair.   If you move to paragraph 90 of – so page 1202.   Paragraph 90.2 on page 1202.    90.2.    So you see there Mr Chair it says   It says   Mr Chair firstly it tells us that there are two different documents that are actually being used.  Mr Hadebe relies on Practice Note 1 of 2013.  This basically refers to Practice Note 3 of 2003 and it says it is still applicable until replaced with a new instruction after promulgation of the new Treasury regulations.    So Mr Chair the Practice Note that Mr Hadebe and Mr Seleka relies on is Practice Note 1 of 2013/14 okay.  This is Practice Note 3 of 2013 which obviously precedes this Instruction Note that they refer to.  This says that 2003 Practice Note 2003 is still applicable and you can stillremunerate on a risk basis given you do some stuff. So my first point is Mr Chair is that we are comparing two different how can I say – enabling or governing documents.  So I am trying to say that at the date when all of this was transpiring vis-a-vis the actual agreement this is what National Treasury’s view was at the time.    Mr Chair in my view given this email from National Treasury I believe that Eskom had the required standing to enter into the applicable contract – on the applicable basis because it is clear that the Instruction Note is applicable and so replaced.  And Mr Chair at the time Mr Chitty Phango [?] would have been fully aware of the Instruction Note that Mr Seleka refers to because he was the – he would have been the person that issued theInstruction Note.  It would not have come from anybody else.    In terms – based on this email.   Email from.    And Mr Chair in response to Mr Seleka I agree with you Mr Chair in terms of your proposition.   Oh sorry.    Yes in terms of what I am saying.    But in addition to that Mr Chair the reason for me to highlight to you the condition in the letter of acceptance is particularly for this reason.    It is because Eskom concluded the letter ofacceptance with the view that National Treasury instruction note was not approved.  The instruction note that Mr Hadebe and Mr Seleka relies on therefore that condition found its way there as ambiguous as it is.  So that empowered them to sign on the basis that it was notapproved.     To confirm that it was not applicable, they then engaged with Treasury, through this process that resulted in Mr Chevy Mfango’s response.       And that is the position I take relating to this point.     Well, Mr Chair, I was at Eskom at the time as well, at some point as well.       So give me a contract and I will go back to Eskom and then I will you my official position.     [No audible reply]      I was just saying to you, if I go back to Eskom then I can give you an official position as well.    But you are now asking me a question and I am responding to you.     Sorry, sir?     Again, I was not – I was having a sip of water.  So can you repeat?     [No audible reply]     Ja.      Well, Mr Chair, firstly ...[intervenes]      No ...[intervenes]     [laughs]     So, hence I was going to clarify that.    It is the – technically incorrect to say that I did not terminate.     I did not terminate the agreement.     Ja.     I was not the delegated authority to terminate the agreement.    The original decision to enter into the agreement was taken by the board and the committee.     So the decision to terminate or otherwise,was sent back to the board... and the Board Tender Committee made a conclusion.     Mr Chair, I think first.  Before we go there.  I want to clarify that I am not too sure that Mr Seleka gets the changing of my version.       I am saying, I want to clarify that I am not too sure where Mr Seleka finds that my versions have been changed.    Because if you go ...[intervenes]      Yes.     That is why I am saying Mr Chair.     I did not say that and he knows that.  I said in these Steering Committee meeting of...  I think it was the second Steering Committee.  I think there was a slight... at that step(?) by the 31 s t of March any contract should be concluded, the contract should be signed.  So I said between 31 March and 28 June, at some point in time,this contract was then signed based on the Eskom version of the facts that were there.      [No audible reply]     Well, Chairman, I have a problem with that.     When I give a – when I am requested to comment on a document and they say here is the document, what do you have to say about it?  So I tell him, based on what I know.     No, let me finish Chair.     Then I get Dr Weiss that comes in Decemberthat says, no, this thing was now ...[intervenes]      ...in October.     Now I never knew that before that, as Itestified.  The first time that I came to know that this contract was not signed at any point was when they...       So when – and even when I come here, I said to – I say to you the first things.  These are not things that were in my – they were to within my personal knowledge.     However, if you want me to go to them, I will go to them with the information that I have before me based on what I have seen thus far.    If you bring another piece of information to me tomorrow ...[intervenes]      ...indicating otherwise.     I concede to the position that I have.     So it is not evolving on the basis that I am being ...[intervenes]     It is changing information.     But Mr Chair, again, it is coming back to this point of what information.  As I said to you.  When I came in – the first time I came here and I was presented with    Right.  And I said I do not know when it this thing...  It was the first time that I heard of the fact that this thing was not signed, was when Dr Weiss was testifying.       So I ...[intervenes]      That is fair.     And hence, Mr Chair, I take exception to the fact that Seleka says my version is constantly changing.       My version is not constantly changing because of the information that is placed before me.     Yes.     I mean, otherwise, I am going to sit here and     Yet there is a letter that says it still in draft(?).     That is correct.     Ja.     Well, Mr Chair, in the- I think it was the third BTC, Steering Committee meeting relating to the master service agreement, as I said yesterday.  It was a closed session that was called.    There was a closed session that was called to discuss the issue of the MSA.  And they were the issues relating to the letter that we have discussed yesterday, the 19 t h of February letter, that we were still...  And at thatstage, there were also – that coincided with that Mr Chair, there was a significant amount of focus that National Treasury had started placing on what they called Sole Source Contract.  And Sole Source basically means contract that are placed without an...And there was additional guidance, there was additional reporting requirements, there was additional practise to be considered and so on.  So with all of those matters – even, Mr Chair, the issue of the contact value at that stage, also became a little bitmore apparent because being a risk place contract I do not think this contract actually had a value that anyone understood.  And I think Ms ...[indistinct] or Mosilo(?), I think eluded to the fact that there was this contract as big as ten billion or twelve billion or whatever the...  So all of those factors, Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      Sorry?    No, no.  Mr Chair, what I am talking about is the potential had it lasted three years would have basically gone to at least ten or twelve billion in terms of the – thissharing model and obviously if the benefits had been...  Given all of these changes, as well as I think Mr Mabelane at the time, added an additional concern that was raised by the external auditors relating to the - I think it was the Corporate Plan contract or even this contract.  I am not – I think it may have been referring to this contract.  That they had raised concerns regarding the validity of the fund(?) in terms of it potentially being considered irregular expenditure.  So all of those issues and more particularly, I think, the concerns raised by theexternal auditors were factored into the decision.  And the recommendation was made to the Board Tender Committee to consider it...       Okay, Mr Chair, it was A, the issue of the 19 t h  of February letter that was discussed.     Mr Chair, there as – as I said yesterday – there was pretty much compliance ...[intervenes]      ...in the terms of the way they had responded to the letter.    But I do not think it ...[intervenes]      Ja.  I think, Mr Chair, it was more around the substance of the whole programme because when I received this Steering Committee mandate, the concerns relating to the 19 t h  of February letter, it was relating to the programme that I... in terms of the Steer Co.       H’m.     No.     No.    Yes.     So, basically, Mr Chair, if we put them inorder of importance.     The first one was the external auditor ’s view?     The external auditor ’s view ...[intervenes]      ...on the contract itself.     On the programme.     In terms of the contract.     And its validity and so on because if they had an issue with it Mr Chair, it would ultimately reflect as irregular expenditure in terms of the...     Yes.     Irregular expenditure.    That was one.  And that flowed, Mr Chair, from the increased focus that National Treasury was placing on...  contract.       Right.  Which either – so they were doing it in two ways.       They were doing it, firstly, in terms of swindling(?) the processes and procedures and grounds on which you could actually do sole sources into the future.     No, particularly this one Mr Chair.    They were issuing guidance and directives(?) ...[intervenes]      In general.     That was both backward looking and forward     But the ...[intervenes]      Irregular expenditure.     Contracts.     As well as ...[intervenes]      Comply with.     Monitor ...[intervenes]     Yes.     And then ...[intervenes]      And then, Mr Chair, obviously the value of the contract.     Given those two issues.     Also became a problem.     Well, Mr Chair, given these ...[intervenes]      ...these developments, then we then had to have an answer in terms of what was this value.  Or certainly, I did not know the value then(?).     So then the value was then – then we have – then a calculation was done and then I had an understanding what the value was.       And it was in the region of the ten or twelve billion that has already been ...[intervenes]     Over the three year period.     Even that value with the two initial concerns that I raised because a bit concerning that we were nowentering into this type of contract ...[intervenes]      ...those – with significant exposure, given the reporting requirements and the potential irregular expenditure that this thing could lead to.     So those were the primary and as a last one, okay, I think we then discussed the issue of the responses that McKinsey had given us but not in the context of whether McKinsey complied or not.  Because as I saidyesterday.  In principle they complied with all.     They said yes to everything.  Right.     The discussion was more around, how do we actually – if we have an objective of the 18 top engineers and if we have an objective of the 18 empowering consulting or empowered consulting companies, what is the best way to do that?  Is it actually to do, you know, a massive contract with one company?  Or is better to actually give it to a number of – select five or six or seven or whatever the number is.  And then try and, you know, get a broader based type of implementation plan for economic empowerment rather than having, let us say, one.  So that was more – the decision – the discussion surrounded more the – how can I say – not the – as I said, it was not about McKinsey whether they complied or not.  It was more about, how does Eskom actually see it actually playing a role in achieving those... whether it be through one big bang approach or whether it be through smaller initiatives.       Yes, sir.     No, no Mr Chair.  My feedback to the Commission.       In principle they had complied in a responseto the letter.     But at the subsequent Steer Co we had a discussion relating to the letter.     And the elements of the letter.     Which is ...[intervenes]      My ...[intervenes]      No, their response.     And this is the meeting that I was referringto.     Where we discussed the broader aspects of how implementation of a programme of this nature could be considered.     Given the current environment we are finding ourselves in.     So that was discussed, not the actualcompliance or non-compliance of the issues that were listed.     Mr Seleka raised the point that because the BEE questioned of my letter ...[intervenes]     ...had not been finalised.     He then says that could never been valid(?).     Yes, sir.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     No.     Mr Chair, let us understand this.     The issue of the 19 t h...  As you said yesterday, the 19 t h of February letter is going to be...     I understand Mr Seleka’s point of view in terms of focussing on the 19 t h  of February letter but Mr Chair, again, it is a point that the Board TenderCommittee delegated to the Group Executive Technology and Commercial ...[intervenes]      No, no, no.  Let me ...[intervenes]      That is not what I said.     Mr Chair, that is not what I am saying.     Yes.     Well, Mr Chair, I would ask Mr Seleka to clarify what he is actually asking.  In what he asked me a few minutes ago and what he is asking me now, there is a difference.     Yes, sir.     The Steering Committee.     It is correct to the extent that I was clarifying yesterday even the context within which this SteeringCommittee discussion was happening.  And I have clarified that because you have allowed me an opportunity to clarify that.     I have lost you at the last bit?     Mr Chair, the – once the termination was communicated to McKinsey, there was an understanding that – or not an understand, an agreement – that it wouldmake logical sense for the programmes to reach a logical end point on our programme’s initiatives within the programme to reach a logical conclusion, if you can call it that, that were already in progress.  So that – they ...[intervenes]      Would be finalised and no new initiatives would be undertaken.    And I think that date, I think, Mr Chair, was around somewhere in July/August if I am not mistaken.       Mr Chair, I – as I testified before.  I think, Mr Chair, the choice of a sub-contractor relates is – is the prerogative of the main contractor.  Eskom is a recipient of that outcome.  I do not recall being unhappy with McKinsey’s view as Dr Weiss has testified.  We requested that they provide us alternatives in terms of being able to onboard a new supplier [indistinct] ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, I do not know.  I was not trying to specify, all I was trying to do yesterday was to reference to the fact that the opening paragraph refers to the Regiments Group and then the second sentence in the paragraph relates to incorporating or ultimately movingover to Trillian.     Yes, that is my – I am responding to that.     I am saying I cannot remember why Regiments Group was put into paragraph 4 specifically.    But I did comment on the fact that the opening paragraph, the first two sentences of the opening paragraphs of the letter refers to Regiments Group and then ultimately transition to Trillian.  I think that is what the letter says.     19.1?     Sorry, I do.     Sorry, Chair.    Yes, Mr Chair, I am just trying to think what is the best way to respond to this statement.  Mr Chair, Mr Amankwah’s version of events is very far from reality as I had no such interactions with suggesting Regiments as a subcontractor to McKinsey at any time.     Actually to be quite honest, Mr Chair, the transcripts of Dr Fine goes into great detail as to how Regiments actually ended up being a subcontractor ofMcKinsey and if you want to go there, we can go there, I think we should got there.     No, I think I am going to go there because this is an issue …[intervenes]     Or his affidavit because I am sure he is covering it in his affidavit as well.     Mr Chair, this is …[intervenes]    Mr Chair, Dr Fine basically goes through a process of explaining how Regiments was introduced to …[intervenes]    No.     To McKinsey.     Because Mr Amankwah’s allegation is that I suggested to McKinsey that they should use Regiments.     Okay?  So firstly I am saying Mr Amankwah’s allegation is not based in fact, he does not support thisallegation with any piece of paper.Secondly I am saying that both Dr Fine and Dr Weiss go through some level of detail in terms of how Regiments became a subcontractor of …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     It was part of the money stream – Dr Weiss, Dr Fine and Mieszala were on the same day.     I have not finished with this one, Chair.     I think Dr Weiss does deal with some of the aspects relating to Transnet.     And then Dr Fine deals with it in greater detail.     Mr Chair, I think for present purposes maybe the one for Dr Fine is probably better.     Sure, no problem.     Lastly, Mr Chair, I think in one of my affidavits I attach a letter that – and again, Mr Chair,forgive us but we are responding to a matter that relates to Transnet because this is where he is alleging this happened and the letter that I sent to McKinsey clearly states – and I think it is a 19 June letter 20-something and I think it is one of our affidavits.     At Transnet.     And it clearly states that Transnet acceptsRegiments as subcontractor to one of the contracts – I think it was a transaction adviser contract that we had awarded them – based on Regiments’ recommendations of Regiments as a subcontractor.     We can just check and in one of my affidavits [indistinct – dropping voice]     Mr Chair, I think maybe we should introduce into the records the money flow session that will clarify these questions.  The presentation that Mr Amankwah is referring to, I can only believe relates to the presentation that was provided to Mr Sagar that then provided it to McKinsey and Mr Sagar would have received that from Regiments.  Why is being associated with me in any way,shape or form, I do not understand, yet the money flow work stream has evidence on it and has received the exact feedback that I just gave you through an evidence leader of your own.     Sorry, Mr Chair, just before we move off this,     I am saying you will find that I do not think they will concur that a basic due diligence on Regiments was done.     As alluded to by Mr Amankwah in paragraph 19.3.     You can.     Mr Chair, again, I am not too sure what really turns on this but at the end of the day, Mr Chair, I spoke positively of all and any firms that engaged with me that actually did well.  So if it was Regiments or Letsema or PwC or Deloittes or J P Morgan or whoever, if they set out to do what they were asked to do and they did it properly then yes, if there is a recommendation to be made, arecommendation would be made and Mr Weiss actually concedes, he did not see any issues with it because it is a normal thing to happen.  Did I say this with a specific intention of them engaging Regiments or Trillian as a subcontractor?  No.  They of their own, Dr Weiss and DrFine.  Dr Fine asserts to their credentials at Transnet, Dr Weiss relies on those credentials that they had obtained at Transnet to engage with them in Eskom.   So, Mr Chair, on their own version, on McKinsey’s own version, they were the ones that decided who came across.  I did not in any way, shape or form influence anybody to do anything at any stage.     Yes, Sir.    Yes.     Sorry, yes, Sir.     Not as it relates to Regiments, no.     Not as it relates to any relations that he may or may not have had with Regiments.    Yes, while I was.     I think, Mr Chair, you asked me that question …[intervenes]     Also last time and I said to you I would be guessing if I knew but I think I gave you a date.    I think if memory serves I think I gave you a date of 2012 or 2013.     Yes.     No, no, Mr Chair, as I testified before it was[inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     No, no, no, Mr …[intervenes]    That was Mr Gama’s evidence of him meeting Mr Essa in my office.     No.     Ja, we will deal with Mr Gama’s evidence later on.     Once or twice.     Not – I got to know that through the process of the McKinsey process when they became aware of the fact that Dr Wood was engaging with Mr Essa and Mr Essa was in fact the majority.    No, I did not.     Yes, Sir.     No, as I testified …[intervenes]     I am not too sure, Mr Chair – well, as I said, it is very long time ago, so I am struggling to recall but I do recall that I did meet him.  But they were business-related.     They were business-related, I think he was looking for – to promote his business at the time and I think he introduced himself, he introduced his business credentials and I testified the last time, I think, he hadinterest in oil and gas or something or other that time and I think that was the extent of our engagement.     It was not at the office, no.     Mr Chair, I do not remember.     I certainly do not remember.     No, no, Mr Chair, I certainly do not recall.    Having Mr Essa or entertaining Mr Essa at my office.     For any meeting.     So if it was one, it was outside, if it was two, it was outside.     No, no, no.    No, it was a setup, it was an arrangement.     Yes.     If I recall it was only the two of us.  I did not recall …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     I do not know.     Well, these meetings are set up and my office sets them up and they are set up then I attended to understand what people would like to [indistinct – droppingvoice]     No, no, I …[intervenes]    Well, Mr Chair, as I said, this is like stuff that you are asking that is eight years ago, Mr Chair.     I said these are meetings that ask that happened eight years ago.  I do not even know what the document was that he even brought to the meeting.  So it will be highly irregular of me to say well, I went to ameeting for this specific reason.  If I met him on 15 occasions I could tell you I met him on 15 occasions because there was common theme for us to meet.  But in this case it was an arbitrary one or two meetings, for me to remember why I met someone eight years ago for a single meeting.     Yes, definitely.     Mr Chair, we conceded that the on boardingwas arranged and at the behest of McKinsey and Mr Chair, also, when we look at this context of the on boarding meetings happening before my appointment at Eskom, Mr Chair, we have included in the affidavit that we have submitted yesterday, the official announcement of my appointment at Eskom and that was done on the 16 July.     16 July.     July, 2015.    And that was announced by the board of Eskom on that day.     So, Mr Chair, in the context of these on boarding sessions, given the fact that the announcement of my appointment was made on the 16 July, I do not believe that they are actually irregular or there was anything untoward as Dr Weiss has testified.     Oh, sorry.  As Dr Weiss has testified.  It is a normal thing that they did with Ms Tsholofelo Molefe as well at the time.  They did it to all the CEOs, they did it to all the CFOs, they would have done it to other Group Executives as well, so …[intervenes]    The on boarding, Mr Chair, the on boarding activities.     Mr Chair, Mr Seleka refers to these meetings.     Prior to my …[intervenes]     Assumed role to Eskom.       So I am just putting in context that the meetings happened in the context of McKinsey’s on boarding of myself relating to my role at Eskom.     Well, Mr Chair, let us put it this way.  The word on boarding, I import from Dr Weiss’ transcriptbecause he deals with what he refers to as these on boarding sessions, right?     It was – it is a McKinsey term that is used to – how can I say...     That is basically – that is basically what it is,Mr Chair.  And that was the context of these meetings.     No, as I explained to you previously …[intervenes]     Yes.  But as I explained to you, Mr Chair, previously, there were also those sessions that happened where Eskom individuals on boarded myself while I got – ja.    No, Mr Chair, I think you have an incorrect recollection.     Yes.     The on boarding sessions, Mr Chair, were the – and maybe we should put this into context, Mr Chair.     We have an organisation that is in crisis.  We alluded to the fact previously that in January of 2015, they were really in a deep crisis, they had load shedding, their energy availability factors were like at 69%.  Their coal prices were escalating at around 18%, when inflation was around 4 to 5%.  Their new-build programme was one, unfunded and two, being schedule and their budgets were uncontrollable.  They were burning diesel at a rate of a billion rand a month.  So, Mr Chair, that is the environmentwithin which I was finding myself.  So these on boarding sessions sought to elevate those issues, say these are the issues that you are going to be dealing with, these are the issues that we believe caused these things.  So when you get there, be in a position to deal with them because theseare the root causes of these issues.     Mr Chair …[intervenes]     But Mr Chair, with respect, Mr Chair, I dealt with that matter and Dr Weiss on his own affidavitconcedes that this is normal practice to happen.     Well, sometimes that is why you need family counselling, Sir.     Yes.     No, I said – I did not say it is McKinsey’s concept, I said I imported Dr Weiss’ word which was on boarding sessions.  I said on boarding sessions are normal, I have been – I have had sessions with a number of people that brought new concepts that wanted to talk about Transnet issues in all of those things.  There was in some way or shape on boarding session.    But not in July.    Not in July.     Whenever it happened, I do not know when it happened but it was certainly not implied, there was nonegotiations that were happening [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Because the sessions in July did not have initiatives to say let us move this, let us move this, let us move this.     In terms for the meetings.     Yes.  And then Mr Seleka put to me that Ms Mothepu says that I was negotiating.  So I am asking when was I negotiating?  When was I putting these things in or taking them out?     Mr Chair, I will repeat once again, as I have done before, that Ms Mothepu’s recollection is incorrect because if – let us for one minute suggest that Ms Mothepu…[intervenes]     Well, Mr Chair, let us deal with June, let us not deal with any other point.    Because Mothepu is – if Mothepu’s evidence is that I was doing this in June …[intervenes]     No, no, let us say July, let us deal with …[intervenes]     In July.       Let us deal with the content of the July meeting.  So am I to understand Ms Mothepu is saying that in July McKinsey made proposals, which I then rejected and I requested other things to be put in.  Is that what the contention is?     No, but what …[intervenes]     No, so what is her version?    Okay.  So in that case, Mr Chair, I deny that.     No, Mr Chair, post that – I mean, for example, I mean I was requested to comment in an affidavit – I mean, in a 3.3 notice of 10.6 notice around the fact that there was an email that I sent to Mr Wood requesting him to look at some Duvha insurance claim, for example.  So that was a request that I made to them.  So I made the request.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     I have no recollection of that, Mr Chair, I do not recall Mr Essa ever introducing me to a travel agent.  I used a number of travel agents to travel, Travel Excellence was one of them.     No, I am saying …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     No, Mr Chair.    Not from – no.     Certainly, definitely, ja.     Yes.     No sir.     I do Mr Chair.    Mr Singh, I think, no I am Mr Singh, but I am doing the same thing that I did yesterday.     Or myself sorry Mr Chair, I would think that in order for us to deal with this, Mr Chair, I would like to first deal with it holistically rather than deal with each individual item.     Yes, and then we can see.     Mr Chair, I think the first point that we needto make is that the nexus of this affidavit of Ms Suleiman.     Mr Chair the origins of Ms Suleiman’s affidavit…[intervene]     Arises from a concern that Mr Koko raised to the Commission via a vis the affidavit of Ms Galiema and I think you then directed the Commission to do further investigations, if I am not mistaken, which then gave rise to this affidavit.      Well, anyway this basically comes about.      And one of the issues Mr Chair, that we can clearly see in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit is that she does concede that the issue of Mr Koko was in fact an error.  There was an error.     There was a clear error in terms of one of the aspects of Mr Koko’s travel documents relating to Ms Galiema’s affidavit.  So that is the first let us say issue that we have or I have with Ms Suleiman’s affidavit is that you will find that it is riddled with inconsistency and Iwould say, errors, which I will take you through.  And the first one I would like to point out is obviously Mr Koko’s admission by Ms Suleiman that the document was incorrect.Mr Chair, if we then go to…[intervene]    Thank you, Mr Chair 22.1 this refers to…[intervene]     8 t h of June.     Yes, Mr Chair.      Mr Chair, I deny that this booking was made on my instruction or on my behalf.     No, sir.     Well Mr Chair, I do not recall, but I know that from the Transnet work stream, it would appear that I was on an official trip during this period of time, and I had to be and I was - I think the return leg was via Dubai.  So I would have travelled via Dubai on an official trip back to South Africa.     And Mr Chair, based on the information that has been given to us by the Transnet stream it wouldappear that it would have been official business at the time.      Then there would have been no need for this ticket.    Sorry, sir if?     No, sir.     Yes, sir.      Mr Chair, I am not…[intervene]     I cannot remember.    Yes, there would have been, yes.      May well have records, Mr Chair.     And hence I am saying I do not recall making this request.     The 8 t h.     Mr Chair…[intervene]     That is correct, sir.      Mr Chair, I have never received this invoice and as you will see, Mr Chair it actually says ticket void.     SS2.     In the route, in the column saying route the third line, it says ticket void.     SS2 annexure.     At 1565.13.     That correct, sir.     There was never a travel.     No.     But Mr Chair, hence, I wanted to paint the picture for you upfront.      But it is fine we will deal with it.     Yes, but these are in fact the inconsistencies that you will find, in every one of these things.     I mean, for example, they allocate this thing to Mr Essa’s account, I did not instruct any of this to happen.     I said they allocate it to Mr Essa’s account of C000365.     I never issued an instruction to please charge my stuff to Mr Essa’s account.    No, I agree with you Mr Chair, but let us dealwith that mater, that aspect.      That you bring up, if Ms Osmond’s version relating to the guarantor issue is to be correct.   Mr Essa – okay during this period of time, he was in the country and he had an account, post him leaving the country I do not think he still has an account with Travel Excellence and neither I would think that Travel Excellence continues to extend his guarantee status if it ever existed.  Yet, if I had - I booked tickets with them post this period of time andthey still allowed me to have - let us call it a deferred payment type of arrangement.  So who was guaranteeing my payments at that time, when he was not there?     That is correct.      Yes, Mr Chair.     After.     I have no idea.     Well it was reported in the media so that is when I guess we know about it.     Mr Chair, I was making general statement. Isaid I was making a general statement, Mr Chair, I do not know the exact date when Mr Essa left the country.     Well Mr Chair as I said, I was making the comment generally, I really do not know the date on whichhe left or purported to leave.  But I know that I have made travel bookings - I do not know how many but I have made table bookings with them.     Yes, I think maybe one, I think.     Yes.     Maybe, one as well, one or two maybe.     No.    But Mr Chair, as you were - let us say, moving back in terms of your timeline, in terms of saying, did you book one last year or did you book one the year before. I think that is the general point that I was trying to make, is that even as early as or as late as last year, if I had booked with them and if he is not here, then who was guarantee.  So that is the point that I was trying to make.    Yes, Mr Chair based on media, it is common cause that his left.     Chair, I would not speculate.      Yes.    Mr Chair, I would be speculating but I know, Mr Chair, my point that I am trying to make is, if it is that these guarantee facilities were what were available, I am saying I did not enjoy those facilities through Mr Essa.    No but if you - that is why I said - that is why I requested for the Chair, to allow me the indulgence of dealing with it holistically.  So all of these things will beput into context, as we are going to deal with these issues individually and you are going to get to a point where you are going to ask me this question.     I accept that Mr Chair.    That is correct Mr Chair.    Mr Chair I have not – I have no recollection of this invoice.  I deny that this invoice was made out to me.  There will be no reason for me to pay for this invoice.  And Mr Chair if you look at the – the – sorry not the invoice the receipt.  Mr Chair even if you look at these receipts and they pervasive throughout they relatively rudimentary receipts.  I could have got a receipt book and written this invoice myself I mean receipt.    I said Mr Chair I denied that this receipt was made our in my name.  I did not receive this receipt.    It does not bear any signature of mine or the purported driver or anybody.    From who this cash was purportedly received from.    Secondly Mr Chair if I denied the fact that I request this booking to be made in the first place.  There is no reason for this receipt to be made out in my name.    That is correct Mr Chair.    Mr Chair I think occasionally I would receive them.    Via Whatsapp.    If I recall correctly but I do not recall (inaudible).    Mr Chair yes.    Mr Chair I certainly paid through voyager miles sometimes there were credit card payments that I had made.    There was cash payments that I made but I do not recall my driver going to settle any of these.    Mr Chair I think I recall some of them but I donot recall which ones exactly.    I would – I would think Mr Chair it was not unusual.    Mr Chair on this particular invoice I am sayingthere was no need for me to pay this because I did not request it.    Yes.    Okay Sir so the question is…   Yes Mr Chair …    Mr Chair I – look – from a driver perspective Iam probably referring to our previous conversation in terms of the Transnet driver.  But I think in this case Mr Chair I think you asking the question did a third party sometimes pay whether it be a driver or relatives or…    At my instance yes.    Yes.    I…    I am not sure.    As I said Mr Chair.    It might have been – it might have been a family relative or it may have been acquaintances.    No.    Sorry Mr – Sorry Sir.   No I was clarifying the Chairperson’s question so that the response that I gave to the Chairperson in terms of saying no it was not my driver.   I was referring to the allocated driver from Transnet.    480.    I do not have it.    I have until 476.    Yes.    Yes Mr Chair.    That is correct.    Sorry Sir I got the first part I did not hear your second part.   Sorry it is the meaning of your word in your second…   Well Mr Chair I think for the purposes of thisdiscussion what is important is also paragraph 48.4 of the said affidavit on page 480 is that between and 4 and 8 I    Okay so 48.4.    Basically says that I was travelling in June between the dates of 4 and 6 between Frankfort and Heathrow.    So 49 basically then says “To the best of my recollection the aforesaid travel related to business travel.”   So as I originally said Mr Chair the issue is that I was actually travelling on business there was no need for me to have this.  I was not requested.    Well Mr Chair I am not too sure maybe it is a coincidence for the word that you used    Maybe – as you will see throughout the affidavit Mr Chair some supernatural powers was at play.  But on her    This is Ms Suleiman who is saying it.    Well Mr…    Then she must state that 00   This is not the way I interpret it.    22.3.    Yes.    Well Mr Chair it goes back to Ms Suleiman’s recollection of the events that took place six years ago or seven years ago.  Because if you then take paragraph 22.2 and I know I am jumping ahead.   Advocate Seleka but apologies for that.  If you look there she says a booking was requested by Mr Singh’s partner.    Ms 00   But the point is.    That request was never made by (inaudible).    And that comes back to the point of the recollection of events.    By Ms Suleiman.    Well Mr Chair based on the information that Ihad it would seem like it is a coincidence because I am not able to say whether it is – well I do not think I can categorically state that Mr Essa did not request that.    I said I can categorically state that Mr Essawould have not requested travel.    Not on my behalf.     No, Mr Chair.     Well ...[intervenes]      In terms of...  Mr Chair, I do not recall this meeting of 2014, certainly by Mr Essa, as I have said.  So your question is?     Yes.     Mr Chair, I think the term dealing with her is probably more appropriate.    I think it would have been probably in and around this time but certainly not 2012 or 2010.     Sometime.     That is correct, sir.     No, sir.     Mr Chair, I would be speculating.       [No audible reply]      Look, Mr Chair, I think when I – when we drafted this wording we had access to the official travel records from Transnet which we had requested from the Commission which indicated to us that this trip, basically, was a business trip.     No, sir.     Yes, sir.     Yes, sir.     Well, not really.     Okay, Mr Chair, maybe a better choice of words would have been appropriate.     I said, in that case, maybe a better choice of words would have been appropriate.     I think ...[intervenes]      Memory, h’m.    Chair... [Speaker is not clear.]     Yes, Mr Chair.     It is quite simple.  It says – if you look at     Okay.     Okay let me rearrange my ...[intervenes]     [laughs]  Okay Mr Chair.     Okay, Mr Chair, is this better?     No, it is because of these files.     So maybe I should put one on this side.     Yes.     I think this will be better...     Oh, yes.  I was – Mr Seleka wanted to know why the Commission asked me ...[intervenes]     Well, Mr Chair, it was not – they did not show me the documents.    Yes.  So they put this to us in a 10.6 Notice, right?     In a 10.6 Notice.     Given the fact that they had put it to us, we then requested the information.     To understand whether these trips were eitherpersonal or private or business or private trip.     That is correct, sir.     Well, Mr Chair, I think we got the 10.6.      We then requested the information?     Whether they had it or whether they asked it from Transnet after our request, I am not too sure.     Yes.     I do not know Mr Chair.     But it would seem so.     Well, Mr Chair, if you look – I can take you further, for example.     If you look at the sub – just go to paragraph 54 on page 481.       Of my affidavit, yes.       You see, they asked me to explain a return trip to Hong Kong on 30 June to 03 July.  Now again, in that – if you look at that, again it is a business trip to – basically the Commission had thought that I had a return trip to Hong Kong, relating to... return to Hong Kong.  Itwas a business trip to China that was via Hong Kong.  So the ...[intervenes]      So the – I do not know if I am answering your question?    Yes.     Or the more to be hand – asking these questions in the 10.6.  I was not aware of that.     We will accept it for now.  Nike.       Sorry?     It is my current wife.     Ja.     Neither.    No, Mr Chair.     Ms Solomon knew that Ms Nike was my partner.    Yes.     No, I thought he was asking the question with tongue in cheek.     [No audible reply]      Sorry, Mr Chair.     I was just getting that name.  So I am goingto keep this file here but I am going to try and get close to the...     Mr Chair, the first point to be made is that Ms Suleiman is mistaken in her recollection.  So Ms Nike did not request this 6 t h of August 2014.     This booking.     Ms Nike, in fact, requested a booking in August 2015.     2015.     Not 2014.     Which also was cancelled and not used.     It was not.     It was booked, it was cancelled but it was – so it was cancelled.     We never used it.    So Ms Solomon’s recollection in terms of who requested this flight is incorrect.     On the 6 t h of August 2014, however, we did fly to Dubai.     And I requested that flight.  So from that perspective, that is the state of the paragraph 22.2.     That is correct, sir.     I was just going to say, Mr Chair, if I recall, those ticket numbers...     If I recall, these ticket numbers that would really ...[intervenes]     No, that second word that you used.       Mr Chair, if you look at the invoice that Ms Solomon attaches to her affidavit.     Again, I do not recall this invoice off hand.     Yes, SS-6.     But it seems like the number is in the ballparkof what I recall.     In terms of the ticket prices and so on.     So what is anomalous, Mr Chair, is.  If you look at the invoice itself, okay?  SS-6 on page 1565.17.     So if you look at it, Mr Chair, you look at airfare and you look at airfare for Mr Singh and Ms Nike, the first two lines.    You see it is actually R 20 000,00 and R 20 000,00.  Then you have airport taxes, R 10 000,00 and R 10 000,00, coming to a balance of R 60 000,00.     Okay.  Now when you compare that to the Serendipity Tours invoice which is on page 1565.16, the page before that.     You will see, Mr Chair, that there is adiscrepancy in the airport taxes.       Yes, if you look on the Travel Excellence invoice it is airport taxes of R 10 000,00 and R 10 000,00 straight.  Okay?    If you look at the invoice from Serendipity, the taxes are R 6 000,00.  So, basically, if you look at the line airport taxes and airport taxes subject to that.     So you are basically R 6 627,00 plus 322.81.  Are you there Mr Chair?     Okay ...[intervenes]      But Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      So the point I am making Mr Chair.    Is that there is a discrepancy.     Between, let us call it ...[intervenes]      R 60 000,00 and a source document from Serendipity.     Now, the reason why I make that point is, Mr Chair, is.  This R 60 000,00 is tied back to an EFT or a bank settlement from somebody.     Let us not say Mr Essa or whoever.     Let us just say somebody, okay?    Now, in – and I will – and again, when we go through each of these invoices, you will see the same pattern.     Is that, it is linked to some bank statement with some value and then you have an invoice that is generated that equals that but it is not supported by the actual, let us call it – for lack of a better word, external invoice.    If this one ...[intervenes]      ...in itself can be relied upon.     Because if you look at the date on which the Serendipity invoices are generated, they are generated on the 13 t h of November 2018.       So if you look at 1565.16.     If you go right to the bottom, Mr Chair, on the bottom left-hand corner.     You see there, Mr Chair, there is a date.    And I think there is a time there.     As well.     Now ...[intervenes]      That is what I am saying.  I do not know what that date is.     Because if this travel happened in 2014, I would expect this invoice to be dated 2014, not 2018.     ...which is a duplicate(?) invoice.     1565.16.       Yes, but I am saying is, if you look at ...[intervenes]      Yes, but if you look at the bottom.     At the bottom left-hand corner, you see a date of 13/11/2018.    No, I take that Mr Chair but again I am askedto comment on a document that is in here.      And I am telling you, from what I see, and I am commenting on the issues that you are presenting to me in terms of the documents.     And I take your point that maybe when she comes, she can say.     And maybe at the same time she can explain as to why the Serendipity invoice is 53 to 70 and her invoice is 60.     Sorry, Mr Chair.  If you look at the Serendipity invoice the total ...[intervenes]      Sorry.     Long, ja.    So it is 1565.16, Mr Chair.     If you look at the invoice totals.     And then you will see there is a line below that says less to...     So it is 53 to 70.     Okay.  So that is effectively the total that was the costs of these trips(?) from Serendipity.     Then you will see that the 1565.17 which is the Travel Excellence invoice, you now have an amount of R 60 000,00 in there.     Okay. So there is a discrepancy of R 7 000,00.     And it is all allocated to airport taxes.     Which is not ...[intervenes]      And all, Mr Chair, I would understand that,yes, Travel Excellence has to charge for their service.  So there would be a discrepancy between Serendipity and Travel Excellence.     But not the value of R 7 000,00.     Mr Chair, I think a general comment across all of the travels ...[intervenes]      As I said, I did pay for all of them     I paid for all.    In a manner I described to you...     Mr Chair, I will check but I do not think so.     Yes, Mr Chair, but I do not think I kept any of it.     Mr Chair, I think if there were occasions where that happened there would be records.     I said on the occasions when those happened, there would be those records.  Unfortunately, for me to go back and request them.  Yes, all my bank accounts have been closed.  So accessing bank records is a problem.     Mr Chair, we will consider... ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]     Yes.     That is correct, Mr Chair.    That is correct, Mr Chair.     And Mr Chair not to forget that – and I will come back to it, the discrepancies in the invoices are a big issue.     Are a big issue.    And you will see why.     No, let us not get this incorrect, Mr Seleka.  I did not say I was overcharged.    That is why I am saying, I was saying I wasnot overcharged.      Because this invoice is a fabricated invoice.  I am telling you, this invoice has been created to equal an amount that appears on the bank statement.     Sorry, what?    That is the invoice.     That is the invoice.     Yes.     That is correct.     1565.19?     That is correct.     I could also – we have dealt with backdating quite significantly in this [indistinct – dropping voice]     I have said we have we have dealt withbackdating of documents quite extensively.     Okay.  So, Mr Chair, I think as I have said, in my view, if you look at the receipt, if Ms Solomon is to continue with this thread, Ms Solomon should then have produced Travel Excellence’s bank statements that reflects the deposit of 60 000.  Here there is just this rudimentary receipt that is again produced, okay?  That references, Mr Essa [indistinct].  Similarly, Mr Chair, in terms of thiselectronic banking contra there is not stamp as to where this originates from.  The authenticity of this [indistinct – dropping voice] what it reflects and it only reflects a deposit.  So where is the payment?    Mr Chair, if you look at 1565.18.     It is purported to be a bank statement.     That reflects an amount of 60 000 being paid to Ms Solomon specific.     Not in relation to my ticket that I paid.     So that is the deficiencies that we have withthis.     Well, Mr Chair, I can emphatically say that he never did so.     No, Mr Chair, I saying is he never made payments on my behalf.    This is a hypothetical statement.     Okay, let us deal with it like this, Mr Chair.  As you said when you started this line of inquiry, you said I cannot actually say or not say …[intervenes]     …whether Mr Essa paid or did not pay.     These amounts.    Not for my travel.     Let us leave travel aside.  So if there are indeed amounts that Mr Essa would have paid to MsSolomon, for whatever reason, those things may have happened but it is not necessarily that he paid for my travel.  So let us – in your case, Mr Chair, you are posing to me, if the bank statements come back and it reflects these 60 000 amounts as Ms Solomon alludes to, I still find it difficult to understand how it will be then associated with the fact that it was for my travel.     That is correct.     Yes.    Well, that is where it stays, Mr Chair.     Sorry, what page are you on now, Sir?     1565.5.     I am there, Sir.     Sorry, Mr Chair…     Yes, Sir.     There was a trip.     That is correct.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     That is correct.     Yes, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, I would have.     I would have.     I am just getting to the relevant annexure.     Mr Chair, I think it was basically the same as I explained to you before, that I would have paid for this.    In terms of the method of payment, we will have to check and get it.     Yes.     Or some manner.     Mr Chair, in terms of this specific one, I cannot recall.     I said in this specific instance, I cannot recall.    Yes.     Yes, Mr Chair.     I was just going to go to the particular annexure.     SS10.    Mr Chair, other than again the discrepancy in terms of the airport taxes I think nothing else that I want to raise around the invoice.     Mr Chair, I see that there is a Travel Excellence bank statement at SS12 that reflects an amountof R65 700 again.     And she explains this by virtue of the fact that there was other case.     That needed to be deposited.     So again, Mr Chair, I do not see a bank stamp.     That indicates how the 65 was made up.     Normally you would go and deposit or indicate, you know this is the makeup of this 65.     And it is made up of 55 or 50 or from this person or that person or something.  So I do not see that.     No, Mr Chair.     This is on the 10.6 notice?     So again is the required – let me wait for you.  427.  You are there?  1.13.6.  Ja relates to your return trip to Dubai …[intervenes]    482?     Yes, that is the one.     Yes.     I have no recollection specifically when I actually, as I said, met Mr Essa.  I do not think I cananswer the question definitively.      We are back on…     On which paragraph are we now?    On which paragraph?    Oh, yes.     Yes.    Hm.    Mr Chair, I think I said that it was probably in 13, 2014.    Ja.  2012, 2013 there.     Yes, Mr Chair.    That is correct, yes.     No.    Mr Chair, I think I would have recognised him, but I did not meet him on the flight.    No.    I confirm that.     Mr Chair that would have been me.   I did.     As I have said in the previous response, I am not too sure about this part, but at the end of the day I paid for the trips, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Some other form.    But as I said we will look into it.     Mr Chair, we will have to go to the ...[intervenes]    Back to the ...[intervenes]     Well Mr Chair, just two things.     If we can go to SS14.    Which is 1565.      1565, 24.25.    The first one Mr Chair is if you look at MsSuleiman’s statement, she says that I was scheduled to fly on the 23 and return on the 26 t h, per paragraph 22.4.      However, should you go to 1565.25.    You see that there is a return date of the 1 s t of March.    So the statement obviously is incorrect in terms of the return date of the 26 t h, it should be the 1 s t ofMarch if the invoice is correct.    Then you will see Mr Chair, if you look at the first column, the airport tax column and the total column.  If you take the EFA and you add it to the airport taxeswhich is twenty thousand plus twenty thousand, it does not give you a total of thirty thousand. That total should be forty thousand and then if you add a thousand to that, the grand total should be forty one thousand, but then if you look at the total columns at the bottom, the ten plus ... the twenty plus the ten gives you forty one, it does not give you forty.So again there is a ...[intervenes]     Mr Chair, that is correct.    That is correct Mr Chair, but the reason why I raised this issue with the discrepancy on the invoice is because it is used to justify a deposit or deposits or EFT’s that have been made and can be proved.     Yes, the substance of this invoice does not make sense.    I think that is all I want to note.     Sorry, sorry one second.     That is correct.     I agree.   No sir.     No sir.     No sir.     I do sir.    If it is indeed the same Vivian Keith Oates that I know, then it would be, he was the head of internal audit at Eskom, I mean at Transnet.    Yes, on behalf of Ernest Nyambo.    That is correct.     No.    No.    Mr Chair, as I testified before I know MrGupta.    Yes.     No.    No.    No.    As I have testified I have met him once or twice.     Yes.     No sir.      No.    No sir.     No sir.    No sir.     If it is indeed Ms Brown’s PA, then I have met her in her official capacity.    Yes.     If this refers to the minister then I know the minister, but if it is not the minister, then I do not know who this is.     No sir.     No.    Sorry sir, where are you?  Page?      481.    Paragraph?    58.    The one ...[intervenes]     Mr Chair, they are personal.    Yes.     No Mr Chair, if you look at, let us make it easy.     Of all the flights that I covered by Ms Suleiman, they all [indistinct] and we come to the one...[intervenes]     Private trips.     The one that we have a little bit of acontention with is the first one.     Which I am saying she records it.    But I am saying I have a different version as to how they happened.    Yes.  Mr Chair, your issue comes in when youare looking at the [indistinct].    There is a mixture there.     That is correct.    That is correct Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, I ...[intervenes]    I have commented on that, in terms of the discrepancy ...[intervenes]    Mr Chair, I do not as I said I do not have a recollection of the exact amounts like ...[intervenes]     But the issue of the invoice ...[intervenes]     Discrepancy ...[intervenes]     Linking to the deposit in the bank statement is obviously a concern.     Right.    Mr Chair, I do confirm.    I do sir.     That is correct.     No Mr Chair.     There is no recollection.     That is correct.    Mr Chair, at SS18 ...[intervenes]     Which is on 1565.29.      You find the same discrepancy Mr Chair interms of the invoice.     In terms of the air fare and the airport taxes do not add up to the total.      To my recollection, yes.     I do not have them.    I do not recall.  I do not have record.     Yes.     I would have thought all of them Mr Chair, but I do not recall them.   In detail.    No.   Mr Chair, we said that we will consult with counsel.   Yes.    I said I did not.    And then there is Suan Dijon.      Do you need me to confirm each one of theseagain?    No, I do not.     No, I do not.    No, I do not.     No, I do not.     I do.    It is a Mrs.    I think she is the wife to Mr Rajesh Gupta.    Ja.    No sir.     Yes sir.     [indistinct]    No.    No.    I do.    Mr Chair, she was either the CEO or had some position within Oak Bay Resources or Tegeta at some stage.  So I had interactions with her.     Yes.    I was explaining to the Chairperson that if it is indeed the same Ms Ragavan who worked at Tegeta or either Oak Bay, she was we interacted relating to I think the pre-payment for 659.    Yes.     Indeed so.     The page number again sir?  Page number?   That is correct.    Mr Chair, at this point I would like to believe that they are private and personal.     Mr Chair, the forensics did not ask for us to confirm whether we knew these individuals.     No.    No sir, I did not.    I do so sir.     That is correct.     Mr Chair, if we have regard to the amount ...[intervenes]     Yes, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, as before ...[intervenes]    I do confirm that I made the payment.    That is correct.  I confirmed that the payment was made by me.    Yes.     Or driver.     Yes, Mr Chair as before yes.    Sorry Mr Chair, before we go there.  Are wegoing to deal with the discrepancies on the ...[intervenes]     Yes.     No, no I am just saying that the amount in this case is relatively large.    Large.    Mr Chair, if you go again to 1565.32.   As you will see, as we raised before Mr Chair, the airport tax, the air fare seems to be correct when cross-referenced to the Serendipity invoice which is reflected on 1565.33.  but the airport taxes are completely misrepresented and if you then look Mr Chair, the total of the Serendipity invoice is in the region of about R95 500-00.  Yet the amount that is then on the invoice, is hundred and forty thousand.So Mr Chair, thesediscrepancies are rather large.     And even if I was generous Mr Chair, I would not be paying ...[intervenes]     Such large discrepancies.     And Mr Chair, lastly again.  If you add up all these numbers that appear on this tax invoice, they actually do not come to hundred and forty thousand.  They actually come to R146 560, 144 560.     Sorry?     Well it seems like I was overcharged firstly and then they decided to give me a discount.     That is correct.     There’s a correlation again Chair.   I think it was on WhatsApp or some sort of communication.    Yes.     I would think it’s WhatsApp, I don’t think – at that time I didn’t really maintain an email address or private email address but I think it would have been on WhatsApp.     Well as it relates to my own personal stuff I’mnot sloppy.     No I do not know anyone of these.    No.     I would assume so.     No.     No.    No.     No.     No.     No.     No.     No.     Well, I know of him.    No.     No.     No.     Sorry yes.     No.    No.     No.     No.     No.     No.    No.     No sir, I know of him but I don’t know him.     No sir.     No sir.     No sir.     No sir.     No.    No.     No sir.     No sir.     No sir.     No sir.    No.     No.     Not too sure, if it is the ex CFO of Eskom.     I may have met him once or twice in CFO forums that – for SOC’s so I don’t really recall but if I did in that circumstance.     No sir.     I know of him but I don’t know him.     No sir.     No.     Mr Mohamad Noah Kapati?     No.     Kovendran Moodley?     No sir.  I know of him.     Yes.     Sorry sir?    Because of all the articles that have been written, I don’t have a relationship.     Because of the media articles.     In terms of the allegations relating to his involvement in …[indistinct – dropped voice].     The allegations relating to Regiments and the – I don’t know what you want to call them, the alleged relationship that he has with Regiments.     No sir.     No sir, I may have met Mr Ashu at the Gupta residence but that would be limited to that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     As I’ve testified to the Commission already.     I said, as I’ve testified to the Commission already, Mr Chair.     Now you ask me to remember my response that I gave three or four weeks ago.    Well, if you’re defining a couple as two, then no, Mr Chair, it was definitely more than that.     Yes.     I think when we ...[intervenes]     I think when we traversed this the last time, I think we spoke about …[intervenes].     I think it was between 10 and 12.     It was on Transnet.    Well, in all fairness Mr Chair, you also talked to me about Eskom and Transnet.     What page?     That is correct yes.     No sir, I confirm that I did not meet with the individuals in  Dubai.     I did not meet with any of these individuals.     That is correct.    I do sir.     Yes.     Yes.     That’s correct.     I did sir.     Yes.     No sir.     I don’t think she’s saying that they were booked on the same flight, I think she’s just saying that visas were arranged.     Mr Chair, I was not – I do not recall Mr Gupta being on the flight, I don’t recall seeing him.     Yes.     Ah Mr Chair, this is going to be an interestingone.  Let’s go to the document…[intervenes].     I think that’s what she’s…[intervenes].     So, Mr Chair, if we go to the documents at 1565.37 which is Annexure SS25.     1565.37.     That is correct.     And we will also reference 1565.36.     Mr Chair, I think, firstly we – so Mr Chair, I have no recollection of this arrangement in terms of Sahara paying for my trip, there was no such arrangement that I recall.  So, as I’ve stated I paid for my trip, so if you look at the 15 – the …[indistinct] invoice which is at 1565.37 itis made out to Rajesh Kumar Gupta and it reflects me as a passenger which correlates to the tax invoice which is basically from Serendipity on 1565.37.  Now, what is interesting is that this invoice relates to the Serendipity invoice we should have the same configuration of theSerendipity invoice as it was the case with my partner when we travelled and the configuration was that her name was on the top my name was on the bottom so it was one booking with one ticket, I mean, two tickets but one booking.  Now you find that in this case, Mr Gupta is not reflected on this…[indistinct – dropping voice] which I can only assume that he then made his own arrangement and there’s another invoice which is obviously not provided by, either Serendipity or Travel Excellence, so that’s the first point.  Then if you look at the SS26 which is on 1565.38.    Mr Chair, on Ms Osmond’s – on Ms Suleiman’s version he agrees that it is Sahara that paid, he received the cash from ….[indistinct – dropped voice] yet the receipt is made out to Mr Singh, so I don’t understand. If anything, Mr Chair, that should have been made out to Sahara Computers or in the name of Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta.     Sorry?     No sir.     In terms of the content of the…[intervenes].     Not technically.     So, if you look Mr Chair at 428, I’m on the right page right, 428?     Yes, if you look at 428, Mr Chair, 1.13.9 it says, according to the 10(6) notice, return trip to Dubai between those dates, 24 and 27.    So, Mr Chair, in actual fact the – again as in the case of Hong Kong, I was transiting through Dubai, so the actual flight destination was actually South Africa, Dubai, Deli.  So the 10(6) the first return trip to Dubai was not a return trip it was a return trip to Deli, so that’s what we…[intervenes].     Okay maybe I should have then said, it’s not technically correct because the Serendipity does refer to a date if I can get to it, I think it’s 1565 …[indistinct – dropping voice].    SS24.      Yes, and you’ll see there, Mr Chair, itbasically says Joburg, Dubai, Deli, Dubai, Joburg, so maybe I should have also, when you led paragraph…[indistinct – dropped voice].     Well, let’s understand, when you led 22.7 you asked me if I agree that the tickets were issued.     Okay, so maybe I should have said, technically, it was actually to – includes Deli as well.     [Inaudible 27.08].    The reason why we deny the 10.6 directive was because we thought they were specifically referring to flights that only happened between – it says return trip from Dubai to – I mean between these with a return trip so we actually said, no it’s not a return trip from Dubai only, it also included a leg to Deli and we make the point that we actually didn’t spend any time in Dubai, it was in transit.     No.     [Inaudible 28.16].     Yes, ja.     I did not see him on the flight.    Well, Mr Chair, if you look at the amount, it’s around R60 000, I assume it was in and around that amount.      I’m sorry Mr Chair, I’m saying if we have reference to the Serendipity invoice it was around R60 000 so I assume it will be in that region.    I’d be speculating that.    I denied it.    Denied.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Chair in terms of the overall concluding.    Remarks that I wanted to start with.    You would see that the discrepancies that I have highlighted.   Throughout all of this.    Indicate that maybe Travel Excellence’s accounting records their books of account and the like is not exactly one hundred percent.      Which may lead one to conclude that it is a fabrication in terms of the documents that we have now seen.  Because there is one document that I recall now MrChair that I would just like to highlight.  Just one point.    And then I will move on Mr Chair.  Which is fairly a small thing but it is – to me it is a bit of – it is a significant matter.  If you – if you look at 1565.37.   Which is the – the invoice that relates to Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta which is the last invoice for R134 560.00 you will notice Mr Chair in the centre of the invoice at the bottom there is a date of 28 November 2018 which is the day before the commissioning of this affidavit.  So again Mr Chair I am as you said before we do not know the relevance of this date but it begs the question when was this invoice generated?  And on what basis and how?  So on one hand Mr Chair I am – if I had to give the benefit of thedoubt to Ms Suleiman I would say this is just very bad accounting and record keeping and admin and if that is the case then Mr Chair if you look at the – the theme it may be that she – because on her version she allocated me to Mr Essa’s account then the receipts that she got she issued receipts with reference to Mr Essa.  So that could be one version or explanation.    And then on the extreme side you could then say given this evasiveness of this irregular discrepancies itcould be that – that it is a fabrication because as I said before Mr Chair it is – it is convenient for a bank statement to reflect a R170 000.00 then to – for you to say I received R170 000.00 in cash and then you have an invoice that has significant discrepancies that add up to R170 000.00.   And your source documents do not tie them – tie up to them.     So that is the summary I would make Mr Chair.    I would think so yes.    Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson I am sorry tointerrupt.  I – I hear what Mr Seleka says at this point but with the greatest of respect to him this is not the issue to be decided here.  This is a – you are here to interrogate with the greatest of respect the facts that applied at the time whatever position Eskom currently takes ex post facto is a totally different story.My understanding was always that what you need to do is interrogate facts that applied at the time and that people can assist you with and deal with because of their knowledge at that point.   Thank you Chair.   Chairperson sorry Mr Singh’s voice is coming over very softly on this side.    Yesterday the sound was up quite high today it is quite low.    And it is important that we hear what he says this side.    Chairperson it is indeed in the –an attachment to the affidavit that we produced.    Yesterday and maybe it – it is a good time just to make sure that the affidavit is received as an exhibit and you can then be referred to specifically tothis annexure.    Annexure AS8 attached to the affidavit of yesterday just to make it easy Chairperson.     Chairperson, sorry to interrupt.  Maybe if …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chairperson.  Maybe if Mr Seleka knows when this happened he should put it to the witness.  If he is interrogating that issue, say to Mr Singh on this day and this day according to Ms Mosilo Mothepu, this is what happened.  Let him then comment on those dates, not speculate.    Chairperson is there copies for us too because we did not know that this is going to be dealt with today.    Chairperson sorry maybe it is important Mr Singh eluded to it earlier that ticket was voided it seems not to have been used.  And I think it is an important factor to take into account too.     Chairperson, there is one more based on the points that was raised by my client.  Of course it is very easy through metadata to establish when a document was generated and when not.  So that is a further point that can eventually be looked at.     Chairperson …[intervenes]     Chairperson, sorry, with greatest of respect, my client stated it as a fact and I thought we were dealing with facts.  He paid for this ticket. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, I am sorry to interrupt.     This is not what Mr Singh said yesterday.  He never stated categorically that it was terminated by the 31 s t of March but to put that proposition ...[intervenes]      Or concluded.  He never said that.     It is not what he said.     And my learned friend should refrain from putting statements to him that is incorrect.     Chairperson ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, I assume Mr Seleka is now speculating as to reasons why things were done.     The issue was about counting(?)...  In fact, without... my learned friend must look at the 10.6 and then he will understand.     I was going to say that wecannot hear at all.     He needs to move nearer to the microphone.       Chairperson, sorry.  I again – I need to again just raise my concern in the context.     You have to look, with the greatest of respect, at paragraph 1.30.  When these questions about the trips are asked, they are asked against    Chairperson, maybe my client must just, when he deals with the invoices, refer to the annexure numbers and the pages so we are all on the same page.
SINGH:Mr Chair, as I testified before the Commission, under the Transnet work stream I had occasion to meet Mr Essa once or twice but that was…[intervenes]  ...the point that one has to think ...[intervenes]   Mr Chair, it is similar to the other ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson before ...[intervenes]      ...before we continue with this there is an issue that I would like to raise vis-a-vis the aspect of the – and I know you are entitled to listen to hearsayevidence, but it relates directly to the issue of what he says about Mr Essa, and maybe it would be appropriate to first deal with my learned friend from that issue before I place it on record, because most probably taking into account the way that the Commission investigators should operate I would assume they have done it, so if – and I hate to ask for two or three minutes, but let me first deal with Mr Seleka to try and see if it is done, and then I will take an instruction as to how to deal with that particular issue, because I think you can understand it impactscertain issues directly relating to my client.     Thank you Chairperson.     No Chairperson I think – I want to ask my learned friend about it now, because I need to understand if something has been done.    Chairperson, again sorry.      I think the reason why my client wishes to start there is basically - and I do not want to give evidence on his behalf.     What he is trying to say is, insofar as you going to rely on this affidavit and the annexures I have an issue with it, because there is problems with it. There is problems with the annexures, there isproblems and you cannot now ask me now to comment on something where there is clear problems with it or clear issues with it.  I want to explain to you why I say you as the Evidence Leader and your investigators cannot rely on these documents.
HEERDEN:I would like a very brief adjournment. 
ADV SELEKA:   Yes.    Ja, I accept that, we have addressed the – or to move forwards, if not addressed but we have agreed to move forward. 
MR KOKO:  No.  
INQUIRY RESUMES:
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you Chairperson.  We did during the course of the morning receive a letter from Ms Gigaba’s attorneys advising that she withdraws from her participation in the commission.  Ms Gigaba’s attorney is here. She has a copy of the letter.  Might I suggest that she be allowed to address you and hand up the letter formally?    Well, we are not apprised of precisely the detail of Ms Gigaba’s facts in relation to the commission, obviously those are things that can be addressed in the course of her evidence.  What we wouldlike to place on record for present purposes, is the letter came as something of a surprise to us, because Ms Gigaba was schedule to give evidence remotely from Cape Town on Friday afternoon.The next thing that we learnt of was this letter, andI think precious little could have happened between Friday afternoon and Tuesday morning.  But that we can deal with in time.  What we propose to do is then to issue a summons, so that Ms Gigaba is compelled to come and give evidence before you. She of course then will be at liberty to detail whatever her concerns are.     We understand that it is obviously difficult for you to schedule her evidence immediately as ofnow, but we just do point out that obviously for the purpose of the summons, the sooner we get a date the better because then we can issue the summons.    And I think it will probably be in the interest of everyone that her evidence be heard sooner than later.     You also know DCJ, that Mr Gigaba himself has brought an application during the first instanceto suppress the evidence of Ms Gigaba.  So when the matter is set down again, it may be most practical that Mr Gigaba’s application is then heard before Ms Gigaba gives evidence.     Thank you Chairperson.  May we be excused?    Thank you. 
ADV MAKHATHINI SC:  I think it is working Chair.     Yes.    Okay.  The full name Gcwalisile Makhathini from RNT Attorneys.  
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI: I represent Ms Norma Gigaba.    Okay.  We received Chair, instructions Chair last night that Ms Gigaba would like to withdraw her participation from the commission and I this morning addressed the letter to the commission, advising truth to that effect.     Yes, Chair.  Okay   There is nothing Chair, I have not yet even had an opportunity to consult in detail ...[intervenes]     Other than what she discussed with me before writing this letter.    Thank you Chair.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Chairperson, it was not to assist my client.  I mean if Mr Seleka read the notice he would have clearly seen that it does not ask do you know these people or not.    It was not to interfere Chairperson, not at all.
