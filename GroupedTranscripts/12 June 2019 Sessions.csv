ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Part of the work streams that have been presenting evidence before you.  Tomorrow the aviation work stream will begin its work for the next few weeks.  We obtained the statement finally in its signed form, attested form last night and at – as at yesterday it was not clear who would be implicated but Rule 3.3 Notices will be issued at the conclusion of the evidence.  Can I hand up Exhibit EE1?    Yes.  Chair the direction from the Chair was that a series of witnesses be called.  Those witnesses fall outside the normal planning of the legal team and the investigation team.  It was only late last week that it was planned therefore for Mr Nxasana in the absence of other witnesses who were unavailable to come today.  The time was set aside for consultation on Monday the investigators having done quite some preparation over the weekend.  Mr Nxasana was not available on Monday and therefore had to come from Durban to Johannesburg today – yesterday when his statement and evidence was prepared in consultation with the legal team myself.  It was not clear until yesterday evening when the statement was finally attested to who would be implicated and to what extent.  It was not possible to obtain from the various judgments and court records read over the weekend with any certainty who should be implicated and for  that reason and because this witness falls into a different category from those that are planned from the outset we would ask your leave to issue 3.3’s after the conclusion of the evidence today?    Not in…    Yes it does.    The statement does Chair.  It – the focus is not entirely on the litigation that has gone through the courts concerning the circumstances under which the contract of Mr Nxasana came to an end and what the courts have said about it and there are various other applications that have come before court including the constitutional court in relation to the termination of their services.  The evidence of Mr Nxasana deals with a much broader set of issues and it was only on full examination of those issues that the extent and the basis upon which implicated persons are indeed implicated can properly be dealt with.  So there are different issues.  The various court cases are a matter of record and I will in due course ask leave to place on record publicly excerpts from the judgment of the constitutional court in relation to the matter that finally came before  court where the constitutional court’s attitude to the independence of the NPA and matters related to the independence are set out.  But apart from that those particular issues that led to that litigation in the courts are not central to this statement.  He deals with other matters in addition.    Yes.    The investigators have done an enormous amount of work.    In the time.    From the day in which it was decided that Mr Nxasana should be requested to give evidence.    The documents to which you have referred particularly the court documents.    Have been collated.    We do have them here.    And are able to put them before you.    It was however necessary to leave the public domain to one side and concentrate on the allegations relevant both in the court applications and other matters relevant as the evidence of the commission has been put before you.    In order to get the detail.    Of exactly what allegations he makes.    And who should be     Served with notices in regard to the detail that you will hear.    Of particular concern to the legal team are the questions as to the independence and effectiveness of the National Prosecuting Authority and the question will be raised as to what extent if any there has been political interference in senior appointments in the National Prosecuting Authority and the effect this has had on the efficacy of the organisation and this is a matter addressed pertinently by Justice Madlanga in the constitutional court  judgment and I will ask leave to put excerpts on record in due course at the conclusion of the evidence.      Yes.    That judgment is in your bundle.    After the divider at page 85 and following.    It is a very instructive judgment.    In regard to the issues that the commission is dealing with.    Indeed.    Yes.  And not only Mr Nxasana but other witnesses will deal with…    Those questions.    And their answers.    In due course.    Chair bundle EE1 is out of sequence because he bundles for the aviation tranche of evidence have already been prepared.    As bundle DD.    So this is a little out of sequence but I think the circumstances left us with no choice.    May the witness be sworn?    Or may he…    Give the affirmation?    Mr Nxasana would you bring the microphone closer to you please?  You have in front of you a bundle marked EE1, do you see that?  It is Exhibit EE1?    Would you go to page 27 please?      Whose signature is that at the bottom of page 27?    Is that your signature?    Did you attest to this affidavit  last night?    And the statement from page 1 to 28 are you satisfied that that correctly reflects the contents of the evidence that you are going to give and wish to give?    And subject to any typographical errors or other errors we may come across of which we do not yet know the contents are true and correct?    Sorry Chair.    I notice that now Chair.  This morning I asked the witness Mr Nxasana which he would prefer – which course of action he would like to take today I was – my attention was not drawn to the fact that this was an oath nor did I have – pay any attention to it quite honestly Chair.  But perhaps the witness might explain?    Mr Nxasana it is common knowledge that you are a former National National Director of Public Prosecutions.    And in that capacity you carried out the duties of your office in Pretoria?    Right.  Before we deal with the period of your own office and before we deal with the brief history of the NPA at least to your knowledge before you came to the NPA please tell the Chair what your qualifications are and what profession you performing at the moment?     You left the National Director of Public Prosecutions post in May 2015, is that correct?    And since then what work have you been performing if any?    So you are an attorney in private practice [indistinct].    Alright.  In Section A of your statement at page 1 you have given a brief timeline in order to illustrate a point that is pertinent to the work of the commission.  You set out in paragraph 3 a timeline and in that timeline you note who has been the National Director of Public Prosecutions for what period since April 2001.  Would you place that on record please?    The statutory term of office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions in terms the National Prosecuting Authority Act what is that?    Alright.  Has any of the NDPP, National Directors of Public Prosecutions since its inception ever  completed a ten year term of office?    Right.  Chair the constitutional court in the judgment we referred to earlier has made some pertinent remarks in regard to security of tenure in relation to the independence of the NPA and that issue will be dealt with in due course.  For the moment Mr Nxasana you recall certain events in relation to some of the appointments and dismissals of National Directors of Public Prosecution that is not necessarily to give a complete record of the evidence it is merely to highlight and raise questions at this point in time Chair.  Would you tell the Chair of the events of which you have at least indirect knowledge from paragraphs 4 onwards?    What is common to both proceedings however is that the inquiries whether judicial or internal to the NPA Act according to the best of your recollection anyway in principle at least clear both Mr Ngcuka and Mr Pikoli?    And then how was Mr Pikoli finally removed, can you recall?  Without going into too much detail.    You have told the Chair in your timeline summary that Advocate Mpshe was not in the position on any permanent basis.    In relation to Chair?    Ngcuka yes.    Yes.  How did his term of office come to an end to the best of your recollection?      And that is after the Judge Heffer inquiry?    And then in relation to Mr Pikoli you said to the Chair that the matter came before Parliament and  subsequent to that his – or as a consequence of that his term of office came to and end?    Alright.  Alright.  The details Chair are understandably not placed before you in their thoroughness but will be in time.  Then in relation to Menzi Simelane what is your recollection?    He was then I understand replaced in an acting capacity by Advocate Jiba?     Alright and we will talk of that in a little more detail in due course.  I understand you were then appointed when?    Alright.  Do you recall any litigation before our courts in relation to a directive to the President to make a permanent appointment?    To the post of NDPP?  Would you just tell the court – tell the Chair briefly about that please?    Yes.  When that evidence is placed before the Chair in the fullness of time and all its details certain questions arise and they arise as a matter of observation now and that is firstly your comment that appears to be entirely correct that no  National Director of Public Prosecutions in the whole history of the National Prosecuting Authority has ever fulfilled a full term of office?    Secondly the history of encumbrance in that office appears to be filled with inquiries and allegations relating to their fitness to hold office and very often having been cleared of any wrongdoing or any adverse finding nevertheless their terms of office have come to an end?    Ja.  Given your own experience in relation to the National Prosecuting Authority and the post of the National Director of Public Prosecutions what is your view as to the effect of this history on the stability and effectiveness of the NPA?    And would that have any effect on public confidence in the NPA?    Yes.  And what role does Parliament play to your knowledge in relation to the National  Prosecuting Authority?    You will make some comments later in your evidence in relation to the role of Parliament and in relation to matters within your own knowledge.    But we will do that later in the statement.    You have also mentioned that Parliament played a role in relation to Mr Pikoli?    But perhaps we should place that evidence before the Chair in the fullness of time.      Chair there will be reference.    Further in the evidence to at least two other inquiries.    Chair but your comments are noted.    The appointment of a National Director of Public Prosecutions is you state governed by the constitution.  You deal with that in paragraph 11 of your statement.  Would you just tell the Chair very briefly about the provisions regarding the appointment of a National Director of Public Prosecutions?    I am sorry if you just hold for a moment.  May I say perhaps unsurprisingly Chair the live stream is down and I have been asked to request a ten minute adjournment?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Nxasana before the break you were at paragraph 11 of your statement and you had – I think - made the point that the appointment of the National Director of Public Prosecutions is governed by the Constitution.    If I may take the liberty Chair just to place on record the relevant sections of the Constitution.    You refer Mr Nxasana to Section    Are they?  Then powers of the Prosecuting Authority are set out in broad terms in Section 179(2)    Then Subsection 5 deals with policy and the functions of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  How is policy in relation to prosecutions formulated and by whom?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  You refer to  Section 179(5) of the Constitution.  That is the subsection which deals with the powers and duties of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  Perhaps we should place that on record and then I - you    What does that mean in practical terms?  What policies are determined?    Do you recall the content of the policy in broad terms whilst you were the National Director of Public Prosecutions?    Perhaps – perhaps that is a task for the investigators …    In due course. Section 179(5)    You refer to Section 179(6) of the Constitution in your statement at paragraph 13.  What does that deal with?    In other words who exercises final responsibility over the National Prosecuting Authority?    Services, right.    Perhaps there is a public interest in your question and its answer.  Once again we are down …    And offline.  I have been  requested to ask for 10 minutes. This is also important I think for the record …    So …    Perhaps we should take the short adjournment now.    Thank you Chair.    At least for now Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Nxasana if you go to paragraph 14 of your statement you deal with Section 9 of the National Prosecuting Authority Act which is the legislation which directly governs the National Prosecuting Authority and you refer …    To the Section which sets out the requirements of the person who may be appointed as National Director of Public Prosecutions.  What are those requirements?    Yes and particularly relevant to your particular case are the provisions or were the provisions of Section 12 of the Act which we will deal with when we come to the Constitutional Court matter involving yourself and others.    Where certain subsections were declared unconstitutional.    Let us then deal with Section C which details the circumstances preceding and surrounding your appointment as National Director of Public Prosecutions in 2013.  Would you tell the Chair about those circumstances please?    Before you go there Mr Nxasana in relation to the process by which you had been selected did he mention anything other more formal than bouncing your name off other colleagues?    Right.  Sorry proceed if you will.    Did you subsequently meet with the President at the time?    Spell that surname please.    Okay, thank you.    Yes.  What happened at that meeting?    Is there anything else about the meeting that you wish to tell the Chair?    Have further contact with Mr Hulley?    Did he tell you anything of the President’s intentions?    Right.  Do you know whether the  position prior to your appointment of National Director of Public Prosecutions was advertised in anyway?    And apart from what you have told the Chair are you aware of any more formal or any other - for that matter – selection process?    Yes.  We deal with that later.  For the moment though were you ever subjected to an interview in the formal sense where you were asked questions about your own history, your own qualifications your professional history?    Your attitude?    Right.  So there was no interview that one could describe as a formal job application interview  in relation to your appointment?    Well did have the characteristics to your knowledge of what one would expect in the ordinary sense a job interview to entail?    Right.    Were you required to fill in any application form setting out your personal history, your details and similar matters?    You did however complete a security clearance application?    Did you sign any other document apart from your security clearance application prior to been employed?    Alright.    You then would have arrived at the NPA during October.  Is that correct?    Of 2013?    What did you find on your arrival?    Right.    You deal with some of those issues in due course.    Perhaps we should take it step by step.  The Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions at the time of your appointment was Advocate Jiba?    Was there any formal or even informal handing over process where the two of you sat down and exchanged details of the state of the NPA, the prosecutions current policies and the like?    Did you instruct Advocate Jiba to conduct a formal hand over process with your appointment?    At the time we know from other evidence and the Chair will be informed perhaps in relation to these matters and more detail in due course but we have heard that at this time there were investigations being conducted in regard to the conduct of General Booysen in KwaZulu-Natal.  What has been called the Cato Manor death squad investigations?    Were you given any information about those investigations on your assumption of office?    How did you learn of the investigations – if at all?    G-O-R-V-E-N.         You mentioned to the Chair, Mr Nxasana that during the course of the conversation with Advocate Jiba you suggested that she might have considered actually examining the evidence and asking the prosecutors to point out the evidence to her on which she based her decision.     What – do you recall her response to that intervention by yourself?     So in summary you learnt from sources other than sources in the NPA that Judge Govern had issued a judgment in which he was critical of the NPA stance in relation to charges against General Booysen.     You read from the newspaper?     You then instituted your own inquiries within the office as Director of National Public Prosecutions.     You called Advocate Jiba who had signed the racketeering certificate to account basically.     You suggested to her that it would have been appropriate for her to satisfy herself directly by reference to witness statements and other evidence that there was indeed a basis for issuing the certificate.     You then understood from her responses that she hadn’t had direct access or required direct access to evidence but had rather relied on the opinions of others.      You then conducted the exercise yourself.     And you came to a different conclusion.     Won’t you spell that name please?     Just to explain the reference you made to Section 204, Section 204 is a Section of the Criminal Procedure Act, I understand, that is used to enable a co-accused to assist the prosecution and perhaps receive indemnity in the Court’s discretion as a result.     And that’s what you were referring to.     Earlier as having been as step  that could and perhaps should have been taken.     The time at which you took office, October 2013 was a time when the former President Zuma was still being investigated, is that correct?     Were you briefed on the status of that investigation?     Alright.     Yes perhaps my question should have been re-phrased to more accurately reflect what you say in paragraph 29 Mr Nxasana when you say you were not briefed on the status of the investigation rather on whether the investigation itself was continuing.     Right if we can move on then please to the events leading up to your own suspension.  During your first year in office, it was not much more than a first year in office, but during that year, did you learn anything about the attitude towards you and the conduct towards you on the part of Advocates Jima and  Mgwebi, that’s Laurence Mgwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba?    Because these are serious allegations perhaps we should do you the favour of allowing to go through your evidence in the sequence you settled it in your statement.  You talked about people in Umlazi informing you.    This was before your appointment actually became confirmed or…    Before you took office.    After its confirmation but before you took office trying to as you put it dig up information about your past.    That is the one set of facts that you place before the Chair.    You also mentioned earlier in your evidence the approach to you of two NPA officials.    Now what did they tell you?  That is in paragraph 33 of your statement.     And the other person?    What did she tell you?    Let us just take that slowly because that is a lot of information.    Right.  So you have said in your statement that almost immediately after you were appointed two NPA officials approached you.  We will deal with Mr Joubert in a moment.  The other person how do you spell her name?    Ngo.  Right.  Did she tell you anything about Advocates Jiba and Mwebe?    Yes please do.  Look at paragraph 33 of your statement.       And Advocate Mwebe?    Did they approach you together as a team or did they approach you separately?    These were two separate independent…    Approaches to you?    Right.    Alright.  These approaches to you at whose instance were they made?  Did you call on them to speak to you?  Did they come of their own accord?  What was the case?    And separately?    Alright.    Alright.  You have spoken then about the two NPA officials who approached your unsolicited and separately?    With information.    About what other people in the NPA were doing to unseat you?    Is that more or less an accurate summary I do not want to put words in your mouth unnecessarily.  We are going to go to the detail in a moment.      Right.  You said that Mr Terence Joubert gave you an affidavit that is part of the bundle?    In summary what did Mr Joubert tell you in that affidavit?  Or what did that affidavit say?  You deal with that in paragraph 36.    Mhlongo told who?    Yes.    That is you?    Yes.    So the affidavit of Mr Joubert talks of a conversation between Colonel Mhlongo and Mr Joubert?    And relates what was told to Mr Joubert in that conversation by Colonel Mhlongo?    And you have related some of that?    Was anything mentioned in that conversation according to Mr Joubert about the Road Accident Fund?    And you have – is that what you have just told the Chair about?    Alright.    And what – was anything said about the example prior example of Mr Stanley Gumede would you  explain that briefly to the Chair.    Now you have told the Chair that this conversation between Mr Joubert and Colonel Mhlongo was recorded?    You informed the investigators that it had been recorded but as of yesterday we had not been or the investigators had not been able to obtain the recording?    You managed to obtain the  recording?    Okay.  And you now have that recording?    Chair we have not had an opportunity firstly to hear the recording, secondly and importantly to transcribe the recording.  I am not averse to playing the recording should you require Chair in fact to do so but on the assumption that we have not been able to precognize the witness in relation to the recording.    Well it is just perhaps inconvenient for you Chair to hear the recording which may be unclear in part without it being properly transcribed.  But without a transcription the…    It is not up to us to preconize the witness in the sense that we…     Indeed Chair we will do that over the…    Long adjournment.    Today.    Yes.  Indeed Chair.    Is this a convenient time then?    Chair we have had a polite request from counsel representing Advocate Jiba to place opposition or  an argument before you. I am trying to get hold of counsel concerned – Advocate Ngalwana.  May we stand down for five minutes so I can establish where his whereabouts are?    Thank you.    Yes thank you Chair.  You – you will recall this morning prior to the witness being called and sworn and giving testimony it was drawn to your attention that in all the circumstances which were placed before you Rule 3.3 Notices to implicated parties had not been given but would be given immediately after the conclusion of the witness’ testimony.  On that basis you requested to allow the witness’ evidence and you did so.  Since then Advocate Ngalwana on behalf of Ms Jiba has approached the Commission and made certain requests of the Commission.  In essence that any evidence concerning Ms Jiba be excluded pending the issue of a notice to allow Ms Jiba to consider her position and take legal advice.  Now Chair the purpose of the Rule certainly as we understand it or at least the principle purpose of the Rule is to give an implicated person an opportunity to place a version before the Commission and to make  application to cross-examine.  In other words to contest the evidence given by a witness and in any approach that you will be requested to make that principle should remain sacrosanct.  There is another potential purpose of the rule and that is if there is any prospect of unlawful and I stress unlawful as opposed to inadmissible evidence being given perhaps of a confidential nature or of a top secret nature then that implicated person would have an opportunity to deal with it.  I do not believe we are dealing with that category of issue in this matter.  Certainly not in the evidence that the witness intends to give.  So that is the principle purpose of the Rule to allow a version to be put and to allow cross-examination to take place and it should be respected at all times.  There can be no doubt about that.  The Rule maybe departed from in appropriate circumstances and our submission is such circumstances existed this morning and you Chair accepted that.  There are two principles embedded in the rules of fairness with which this Commission is obviously bound and in the rules which give expression to those principles of fairness.  The one is that no party may because that implicated or otherwise disagrees with the evidence that a person is going to give and who has received notice of that evidence hold a trial or a contest outside the Commission’s proceedings and say you cannot lead that evidence because it is wrong or I disagree with it or because it is false.  The proper place for that contest to take place is in this forum in public and indeed that is what the law requires that this Commission to take place in public.  So a witness gives evidence that.  That evidence is contested after that witness has been – had given  evidence.  There cannot be a trial outside which would influence that witness’ evidence.  That is the first principle.  The second principle is that – and it is also sacrosanct – is that any implicated person must be given a full and fair opportunity to contest the evidence of a witness and to cross-examine subject to the rules and the discretion that you have embedded in those rules Chair.  So those are the two sacrosanct principles.  The question is can they be met in this case.  If there are circumstances which indicate that the evidence that this witness is about to give is somehow unlawful or cannot be lawfully put before a Commission that is one set of issues.  I do not believe those exist here.  If however it is merely a matter of managing a fair opportunity to respond either by way of putting up a version or by way of allowing cross-examination then that can be managed in any order that you might make Chair and the rules provide expressly for such a circumstance.  I think that is Rule 3.6.  There are two options then having considered the position that I would suggest require consideration.  The one is to allow the evidence - but to exclude any reference to any implicated party because of course all implicated parties must be treated in the same manner not only Ms Jiba – to allow that evidence to be given without reference to any implicated party and then to recall the witness at a later stage once notice has been given.  That is the one option.  It may not be entirely practical.  It is the cautious option.  The second option is to allow the witness to testify subject to appropriate arrangements being made on representations by Mr Ngalwana either now or at a later stage to ensure that there is a full  opportunity to place a version before you and to cross-examine in due course. The tape that we mentioned earlier may possibly fall into the category of that evidence that may not be led at all and perhaps representation should be allowed on that before the tape is played but that concession we are happy to make but otherwise Chair the stark choice and the approach to adopt is left with you.    Chair just …    Just a little more briefly than  what has occurred so far.  The first thing is you will make an order.  I will abide by that order.  I cannot abide by suggestions …    In regard to what would be appropriate.    Yes.  So let me do that then.  Firstly it is important to place on record this issue of timing.    There is a suggestion that the witness’ evidence has been timed intentionally or unintentionally …    I do not know how you time evidence.    Evidence unintentionally …    In order to prejudice Ms Jiba.    Let me state quite clearly that is not the case.    I can give the Chair an assurance and …     And as you know Chair it was at your direction that this …    That this happened.    In any event the timing was not a choice of the witness.    The timing was imposed …    At your request.    He had nothing to do with it at all.    The third is that in any even the consequences of evidence being led under oath or under affirmation at a public inquiry of this nature would inevitably affect other issues in other jurisdictions and that must be so.  Those consequences can never be an excuse or a grond for not leading evidence that we are obliged to lead here by virtue of statute but that is not an issue that we need do  any more than note for the present.    The second point that we would like to emphasis as a legal team Chair is the very nature of a public inquiry.  It involves encouraging witnesses to come forward, to give evidence within its terms of reference.  It is inevitable the statute contemplates that the terms of reference contemplated the regulations contemplated the rules contemplated that persons will be implicated by evidence adverse to that – to that persons interests.  It is the very stuff of this inquiry that evidence would be led implicating other persons in many cases negatively or adversely.  That principle cannot be undermined by any order that you would make Chair or anything that the legal team could agree to.  Provided witnesses are treated fairly and those rules are there for that purpose.    So Chair all we submit …    Is that the principle must remain sacrosanct.    That witnesses must not be prevented from giving such evidence as they are entitled to give (intervenes).    Well …    No that is – that is clear.    And then a solution that we will reach …    That principle will be met but the public out there is listening to this argument.    It can never be the case that the public should be discouraged …    From coming forward to give their evidence …    In fear that prior to their giving evidence …    They will somehow come under some sort of judicial or other attack and …    Somehow their influence will – their evidence will be influenced in that way.  So the principle that must remain sacrosanct – we submit – is that witnesses must believe that  they are free to come here and give evidence whatever its consequences and however damaging it may be to other people and I believe in the solution we have reached that is sacrosanct.  It is subject only to one duty and that is the duty of the Commission to act fairly and that we are trying to do in that case.  The last point that I would like to make Chair is that I will obviously abide by your ruling but the intention is not to deal with anything beyond the interactions that gave rise to the many court applications and decisions of the court and in fact insofar as a judgment deals with a particular issue one may assume that that is in the public domain.  It is a matter (indistinct) thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.     Chair a housekeeping matter, I’ve decided to deal with something that I had intended to deal with at the conclusion of the witnesses’ evidence and that’s the Constitutional Court judgment, one can safely assume that matters commented on by the Constitutional Court and contained in the judgement, particularly are matters in the public domain.  They do not, in any event, implicate Ms Jiba or any other individual apart from the former President in any sense at all and those are merely comments.     And all parties concerned have and an opportunity to present their versions, argue fully and the result of all that process in the highest Court is what I’m going to refer to.      Chair in addition to that Mr Nxasana himself raises a concern that he’s here at some personal cost and at the request of the Commission, volunteered to come forward and given that his evidence may now stretch over to another day it’s a matter of some concern and I would just wish to place that on record it was communicated to me during the recent short adjournment.     Well look at the applicable law.     Thank you.  Chair the final matter is that, Mr Nxasana is booked on a flight at 7 o’clock so if we may because we’re going to come back another day anyway, adjourn at  the normal time.     Thank you.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Nxasana at page 11 of your statement you deal with the circumstances giving rise to your ultimate suspension by the President.  For the moment we’re not going to deal with the evidence that you intended leading concerning the circumstances which say – which you say would have explained or would explain the President’s actions because those are matters which implicate other parties.     Yes.     Yes there was an intention to suspend and that was the subject matter of litigation.     I’m sorry if I put it that way. You also deal with the step that you took to ensure that in any process that occurred in relation to your employment you attempted to ensure that you would receive a fair hearing.     You deal with the inquiry that was intended to be held under Advocate Nazeer Cassim.      We won’t go into that for the moment simply because I’d like to keep the evidence in its proper sequence. You then deal with the situation at the NPA during your term of office which has been a subject of comment by the Courts and concerns the conduct of persons who are implicated by your statement.     I’m not going to test the fine distinctions between what are facts within your knowledge that haven’t been canvassed in Court and what evidence has been canvassed in Court, that’s perhaps too fine a distinction to draw at this stage.  So what I’d like to do is, just to place on record as is common knowledge that you ultimately entered into what has been termed, a settlement agreement.     That settlement agreement involved payment to you of a sum of money.     That issue came before the Courts and what came before the Courts were not only the terms of the settlement agreement but the fact of the settlement agreement, the circumstances in which it took place and its lawfulness.     That litigation of which you were a part but not the principle applicant finally found its way to the  Constitutional Court.     And in a judgment of the Constitutional Court which is contained in the bundle at page 85 the Constitutional Court dealt with the evidence placed before it…(intervention).     The Constitutional Court dealt with the evidence that had been placed before it, dealt with the judgements of the Court below and came to its own findings in relation to the issues before it, principally matters relevant to the National Prosecuting Authority and in particular relevant to the eventual ending of your term of office.     And I’d like to go there directly if I may, to deal with, firstly some general comments made by the majority of the Court under the hand of Madlanga J, Justice Madlanga and if one can go to paragraph six.  The Constitutional Court and its majority there says, and that’s at page –sorry Chair, that’s at page 92 of the bundle where the background is dealt with.     Paragraph six reads, “The event that are at the centre of these proceedings are in the public domain, the judgment of the High Court notes that it   was common cause before that Court that since September 07 the recent history at the NPA, and it quotes the judgment of the High Court, has been one of paralysing instability”, That is the quote, that judgment gives detail of that history. If we may go then to paragraph seven it reads, “In July 14 within about only nine months of his appointment, a process calculated to remove Mr Nxasana commenced”,  That process would have been the substance of your evidence today.     In the main at least, “The then President, the judgment continues, Mr Jacob Zuma informed Mr Nxasana of his intention to institute an inquiry into his fitness to hold office, this was followed by a notice that the former President was considering suspending Mr Nxasana pending finalisation of he inquiry.  The former President said that suspension was necessary in order to maintain the integrity and good administration of the NPA”, Your evidence would have dealt with that contention in some detail because you, in your evidence, would have today, and will in the future give evidence regarding what you regard as the true reasons for what occurred.     The notice also specified that  the inquiry sought to establish whether certain issues were consonant with the conscientiousness and integrity of an incumbent in the office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions as required by the NPA Act, we’ve referred to that section of the constitution already Mr Nxasana.     The issues were,  “Mr Nxasana previous criminal conviction for violent conduct allegedly unbecoming and divisive comments which had the effect of bringing the NPA into disrepute made by Mr Nxasana  and reported in the media and alleged non-disclosure of facts and circumstances of prosecutions which Mr Nxasana had faced previously”. Now in your evidence you will go into some detail in regard to these issues, in particular the lack of particularity that you alleged in Court proceedings you had been subjected to.     And in fact reference is made to that in the latter part of paragraph eight on page 94 of the bundle where the Constitutional Court says,  “Mr Nxasana approached the High Court seeking an order compelling former President Zuma to provide the required particularity and interdicting the former President from suspending him until he had furnished him with this particularity”,   That particularity, Mr Nxasana is that to which we have just referred.     The application was not – that application was not pursued to finality, the former President changed tact in late 2014, he proposed that the dispute between him and Mr Nxasana be mediated, Mr Nxasana acceded to this proposal, is that correct?     And then paragraph nine which is on page 94 of the exhibit EE reads, “It appears from a letter written on 10 December 2014 by attorneys acting for Mr Nxasana that former President had engaged Mr Nxasana to get him to agree to vacate office.  In the letter Mr Nxasana made it plain that he did not want to vacate office as there was no basis for him to.  He stated that he would, however, consider stepping down only if he was fully compensated for the remainder of the contract period”, Is that a correct record of the facts as far as you are concerned, I will give you an opportunity to expand on it in a moment.     At issue in the litigation -  in part at least was whether you had requested the former President to be  allowed to vacate office or whether you were compelled to vacate office against your will but subject to certain conditions.  If I put it correctly, it’s now your opportunity to place the issues in dispute before the Chair.     The position is summarised in paragraph 12 of the Constitutional Court judgment and that appears at page 95 of Bundle EE – Exhibit EE it reads, “It must be noted that right from the onset and throughout the entire negotiation process that culminated in the settlement agreement, Mr Nxasana unequivocally stated that he did not wish to resign and that he considered himself to be fit for office, instead his preference was for former President Zuma’s  allegation that he was no longer fit for office, to be tested in a formal inquiry as proposed by the former President”, Is that the proposed Cassim inquiry?     The summary of the judgment  continues, or the judgment continues rather, “Throughout he protested the existence of a factual or legal basis for him to vacate office, also he disavowed any invocation by him in Section 12 (8) of the NPA Act to voluntarily vacate office.  It is so, of course that he did indicate that he would resign only if he was paid the full salary for the remainder of his term of office”. Does that fairly summarise the position as far as you are aware?     Then there are some general comments Chair, which I think it is appropriate to place before you because the evidence that will be led by the legal team deals pertinently with these issues and these comments of the Constitutional Court are instructive and very important for the work of the Commission and if I may place them on record.     At paragraph 18 the Constitutional Court says,  “The importance of the office of NDPP in the administration of justice is underscored and amplified by no less an instrument than the Constitution itself.  Section 1794 of the Constitution requires that there be National legislation which guarantees the independence of the Prosecuting Authority. Lower down the   paragraph it reads, Section 1794 provides that National legislation must ensure that the NPA exercises its functions without fear, favour or prejudice, that legislation is the NPA Act.  Predictably Section 32(1) A of the NPA Act requires members of the Prosecuting Authority to carry out their duties without fear, favour or prejudice and subject only to the Constitution and the law”. Paragraph 19 reads, “This Court has said of the NPA’s independence “there is a Constitutional guarantee of independence” and any legislation  or executive action inconsistent there with would be subject to Constitutional control by the Courts.  The reason why this guarantee of dependence exists is not far to seek.  The NPA plays a pivotal role in the administration of criminal justice with a malleable corrupt or dysfunctional Prosecuting Authority many criminals, specially those holding position of influence will rarely, if ever answer for their criminal deeds.  Equally functionaries within that Prosecuting Authority may, as Casak submitted be “pressured” into pursuing prosecutions to advance a political agenda.  All this is antithetical to the rule  of law a founding value of the Republic.  Also Malleability,  corruption and dysfunctionality are at odds with the Constitution and junction of prosecuting without fear, favour or prejudice.  They are thus at variance with the Constitutional requirement of the independence of the NPA.   It continues, at the centre of any functioning Constitutional democracy as a well functioning criminal justice system, in democratic alliance, Jacoub ADC J observed that the office of the NDPP “is located at the core of delivering criminal justice”, if you subvert the criminal justice system, you subvert the rule of law and Constitutional democracy itself.  Unsurprisingly the NPA Act proscribes improper interference with the performance of prosecutorial duties.  Section 31 (1) B provides, subject to the Constitution and this Act, no organ of State and no member or employee of an organ of State nor any other person shall  improperly interfere with, hinder or obstruct the Prosecuting Authority or any member thereof in the exercise, carrying out or performance of its, his or her powers, duties and functions”. And then the Court makes some further comments relevant to your evidence Mr Nxasana and generally relevant to the evidence that will be led and the concerns raised by this Commission.  At paragraph 21, which is on page 98 of Exhibit EE it reads, “Improper interference may take any number of forms without purporting to be exhaustive it may come as downright intimidation, it may consist in improper promises or  inducements, it may take the form of corruptly influencing the decision making or functioning of the NPA.  All these forms and others are proscribed by an Act that gets its authority to guarantee prosecutorial independence directly from the Constitution.  Paragraph 22 reads, another guarantee of the   NDPP’s independence is provision for security of tenure.  In Section 12 (1) the NPA Act provides that the NDPP shall hold office for a ten year non renewable term of office.  It is now well established in terms of this Court’s jurisprudence that security of tenure is an integral feature of the Constitutional requirement of independence. In justice alliance, and the reference is given to that case, this Court held that “international standards acknowledge that guaranteed tenure and conditions of service adequately secured by law are amongst the conditions necessary to secure and promote the  independence of judges”, these necessary conditions must of course be true of the independence of the NPA as well.  In a unanimous judgment in McBride Bossialo AJ said, amongst fact said that amongst the factors that are relevant to the independence of offices or institutions which in terms of constitutional prescripts must be independent are “the method of appointment, the method of reporting, disciplinary proceedings and the method of removal from office and security of tenure”,  And we’re here dealing with Mr Nxasana in your case with the removal of yourself from office and the circumstance’s in which that took place and the lawfulness of that set of events.  There is further comment relevant to the previous comment in paragraph 23 which reads, “The NPA Act has two other salient features that help shield   the NPA from improper interference namely the non- renewability of the ten-year term of office of the NDPP and certain safeguards on the removal of the NDPP from office”, And then the various methods that provide for – are provided for termination of the office of the NDPP are dealt with.  It goes on to say in paragraph 24 that, the manner in which your office was vacated Mr Nxasana was not Constitutionally compliant and you recorded in the judgment as having accepted that, is that correct?     And then paragraph 25 certain salient comments are made concerning the conduct leading up to your vacation of office and paragraph 25 reads, that is on page 100 of the judgment, “The facts set out above point to one thing and one thing only, former President Zuma was bent on getting rid of Mr Nxasan by whatever means he could muster, his was an approach that kept on mutating, it was first a stick then a carrot a stick once more and eventually a carrot.  There was firstly notification that Mr Nxasana would be subjected to an inquiry with a view to establishing whether he was still a fit and proper person to hold office.  Concomitantly there was a threat of suspension pending finalisation of the inquiry albeit with full pay.  This was followed by former President Zuma’s proposal that there be mediation.  When there was no progress on this the inquiry was instituted, whilst the inquiry was in its preliminary stages  the former President pursued a parallel process in which Mr Nxasana was first offered in a draft settlement agreement ten million rand.  As indicated earlier he did not accept it.  What plainly evinces how desperate former President Zuma was to get rid of Mr Nxasana, is that this was followed by a draft settlement in which the amount was left blank.  Mr Nxasana was being told to pick whatever figure, indeed Mr Halie said that he would “await the final amount from Mr Nxasana” and then the question is asked in paragraph 27, instead of settling for so huge an amount, why did the former President not simply pursue the inquiry, did he not believe that the evidence that had motivated him to come up with the idea of an inquiry was sufficiently cogent, if so why did he not just abandon the inquiry and leave Mr Nxasana in office, after all he was exercising his powers as President and not involved in a personal dispute which he could settle as he pleased.  It is difficult to comprehend why he would have settled on so huge an amount from public coffers to boot.” It continues in paragraph 28, the inference is inescapable that he was effectively buying Mr Nxasana out of office, in my book conduct of that nature compromises the independence of the office of NDPP, it conduces to the removal of troublesome or  otherwise unwanted NDPP’s through buying them out of office  by offering them obscenely huge amounts of money”. Then in addition to those comments, certain comments are  made in regard to your own conduct in accepting the amount of the settlement and I’ll come to that in a moment Mr Nxasana but as far as you know, is that a fair summary of the facts that were at least placed before – and I’m excluding any opinion now that may have emerged from the judgment, I’m just relating the facts.     I know that you are more empathic with the minority judgment.    Which we will come to in a moment and explain the differences, but your evidence then not only deals with the termination of your office as NDPP but the real reasons that you allege existed which caused your office to be ended.      And that evidence would implicate certain individuals.     And it is to those individuals that notice will be given and in relation to whom you will give evidence in due course.      But as I understand that evidence it is such that there is an explanation for the conduct which led to your, the termination of your services?      I must put before you the comments of Justice Madlanga in paragraph 85 of the judgment, those are clear on page 123 of the bundle Chair.  In the latter part of     And that was whether you should be allowed to return to office.  In fairness you should be entitled to comment now that that evidence is on record, or that judgment is on record.      Yes, if you wish to.     It’s an adverse comment and therefore in fairness you should be allowed to put your own opinion before the court, before the judge, before the Chair.     If we have time we will get there in a moment.  Just to place the judgment of the majority in proper context its reasoning at least in part is in paragraph 87 which appears     Relying on the former President of the Labour Court reasoning that where a dismissal is invalid and unlawful nothing needs to be done, the employment contract just continues, Zondo, JA, I think.     President of the Labour Court.     JP yes.    The order proposed by the second judgment that has the effect of prolonging the instability, so it seems that part of the reasoning of the majority was that the instability by allowing you to return and the majority felt it had a discretion in that regard, which should be exercised in favour of the conclusion that you should not be allowed to return, the concern was one of stability at the NPA.     And then one of the further results of the judgment of the Constitutional Court is that the appointment of Advocate Abrahams was declared invalid and the President was directed to appoint a replacement for Advocate Sean Abrahams.    If I may then just briefly go to the order, you were ordered then to repay the amount received by yourself less tax, is that correct?    And then in the minority judgment after a long debate over the consequences of a declaration of invalidity in regard to termination of an employment contract the conclusion is reached at paragraph 112 by the minority, which is at    Yes.    Yes the last quotes were all from the minority judgment.     Yes, I might just add Chair that the Commission’s Act under which we operate was passed at the time the currency was still in pounds, so that may favour the witness.    I think the Interpretation Act may have something to say about that, but we did examine it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well yes you may.  Normally Rule 3.3 Notices are issued before if you propose to have them issued after we should explain to the public why?    Well does his evidence not really relate to matters that have already been dealt with in courts and judgment - judgments of the high court and the constitutional court and…    And where those who may be implicated have been aware of those – of what he says about his tenure at the NPA and they have had a chance to respond to those.  Does it cover anything new?    In his statement?    Well as you say he was among a number of witnesses that I said should be called.  Other witnesses were witnesses who have been implicated by certain witnesses and other witnesses were not necessarily implicated but would need to come before the commission to give their version which could corroborate or not corroborate previous witnesses and – and he – he falls under Law Enforcement but he – I had considered that he – his evidence – he needs to give evidence.  But I conceded that what was important relates to in regard to his evidence – relate to his tenure at the NPA.  Certain matters which have been in the public domain as far as I am concerned those are the matters I had in mind and particularly how he left the NPA.  Now that has been dealt with extensively in affidavits that were filed by him and by the former president and other persons in the high court and in the matter that culminated in the constitutional court.  I think it was brought by Corruption Watch and maybe other parties.  But there may be other matters that the legal team you know had you know also thought of once he was to be called.  So I would like the full set of affidavits in the Corruption Watch matter to be placed before me as soon as possible to give me a full picture of the situation.  So obviously you can – you can cover whatever the legal team or you think should be  – should be covered in relation to his evidence but in particularly I was interested in his tenure at the NPA.  Some of the matters that may be important for the commission in the light of his terms of reference there have been all kinds of allegations and evidence about the NPA and then of course the circumstances under which he vacated office.    So I thought I would just make clear what I had in mind but from the legal team’s point of view you – you are at large to cover much more than that if you believe he has got more in – more evidence that relates to matters falling under our terms of reference.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No that is fine.  Thank you.    Yes well I think you should put in the whole judgment and draw particular attention to particular    Parts of the judgment that you think are particularly important.    Ye.    Okay.  No that is fine.    Ja.    Yes.  No that is fine.  Indeed of course the main point of Mr Nxasana’s evidence has to be about the independence of the NPA and whether there has been interference with it and by whom and in what circumstances would that interference be justified?  Is it permissible, is it not permissible?  So more than anything that is – that is the most important thing everything else is about that.  You know all the evidence has to revolve around that whether…    There was interference and if so what form it took and  under what circumstances.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  No thank you.    Ye.s    Yes.    Ja.  Yes okay.    Thank you.    Please swear him in.    Or administer the affirmation.     Thank you.    Mr Pretorius before you proceed I notice that the witness did an affirmation now but the statement is – I noticed.    I noticed that the witness – the witness affirmed a few minutes ago but the affidavit is – is an affidavit and it is under oath.  Is everything in order with that?    Well we can – we can ask – Mr Nxasana?     Yes.    So…    Either it is fine.  This you did as an oath and it is fine and now you did an affirmation both are fine I just want to check that?    They are both fine?    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Hm.  I know that the inquiry that was chaired by Doctor Ginwala was an inquiry under the Prosecuting Authority Act as opposed to a Commission of Inquiry under the Commissions Act.  I am not sure about the Inquiry that was chaired by Justice Heffer in relation to Mr Ngvuks whether it was a Commissioner of Inquiry under the Commissions Act or whether it was an inquiry under the – just an inquiry under the National Prosecuting Authority Act.  But I think the point you make is not about those technicalities it is simply that certain inquiries precede that.    Their departure.  But it is just important to     To – when we are not sure ja.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius did he complete the story in relation to Mr Ngcuka, his resignation after the inquiry, did he complete that part?  What happened to Mr Ngcuka after?    In relation to Mr Ngcuka?    Did he complete the story about what happened after the inquiry chaired by Judge Heffer?    Well the – the story might not be perceived to be complete when you talk about inquiries in relation to the NPA.  If you do not mention that recently there was also an inquiry relating to somebody who had acted as the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  So if one states simply facts of course you what – what you were talking about were those who had been permanently appointed as National Director of Public Prosecutions namely Mr Ngcuka, Mr Pikoli and of course yourself but there is also somebody  who had acted quite a number of times and I know you will talk more about some of the events.  Then there was an inquiry in relation to her and it is public knowledge that that inquiry reached certain conclusions and I think the matter may be going to Parliament for what it is worth.  It may be that it is important to just state those – back those facts.  Ja. Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  No thank you.    Hm.    Okay alright.  We will take a ten minutes adjournment to enable the technicians to attend to the problem.  We adjourn.     You may proceed.    Ja.    I am sorry.  Before that Mr Pretorius with regard to who appoints who the National Director of Public Prosecutions is appointed by the President.    And you have just said also the Directors of Public Prosecutions are appointed by the President.  Is that right?    The Directors of Public Prosecutions are those the  NPA Officials who are in various provinces or some are heading the NPA in provinces but others are not necessarily heading NPA in provinces but fall within some or other office of the NPA or in the courts.  What is the position?  What is the structure?    So you have talked about Directors of Prosecutions and a Head of Directors of Prosecutions.  Is that right?    So each Director of Public Prosecutions …    Is – is Head of certain region insofar as the NPA is concerned?    Okay and the regions are not necessarily demarcated in accordance with provinces or are they necessarily demarcated according to provinces?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Number of High Courts?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    But as a general rule when one hears the term Director of Public Prosecutions when it is used in the context of the NPA one should be thinking of somebody in charge of prosecutions in  the area falling under a certain High Court or in a – in a province but accepting that there are provinces where there are two Directors instead of one?    Where there are two in the same province that is Directors of Public Prosecutions one of them would be the Head?    Or they – they …    There is no Head or they are both co Heads?    Okay, okay.  So is the National Director of Public Prosecutions at the top …    And then four Deputy …    National Directors of Prosecutions?    And all those are at the Head Office in Pretoria of the NPA?    And then you have Special …    Directors of Prosecutions.  Is that right?     And – and those two are or how many would there be of Special Directors of Prosecutions – Public Prosecutions?    In the Act?    Yes.    Oh.    Oh, okay.  So the number might change from time to time?    Okay, okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Sexual – oh – protection of witnesses?    Ja.    Hm.    Oh okay.  Now in terms of the hierarchy it is the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is the Deputy National Directors of Public Prosecutions and then is it then the Special Directors below that?    Or they are on the same level as the Directors?    Oh.    Oh.    About who is at Head Office …    Who is not at Head Office?    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    But legally they are on the same …?    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Below the Directors do you have Deputy Directors …     Of Public Prosecutions?    Yes and then those …    Could be a number – there could be a number of them?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, there are different levels?    Now Prosecutors that one finds in the High Courts and in the Magistrate’s Court would they simply be Prosecutors or some of them would be Deputy Directors and maybe even Director - Directors?    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    They – they fall under the Office of …    Of a particular DPP …    In the province?    Okay, okay and …    Hm.    Yes.    District Courts.    In the particular court?    Of jurisdiction?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Prosecutors, ja.    Yes but …    Basically in – in the province where they operate the Prosecutors – Chief Prosecutors and whoever they fall under the DPP  of the Province?    All of them?    Yes okay, thank you.    And – and the President appoints the DPPs …    But below that does he go that far?    He stops there?    And then who appoints the DPPs – the NDPP?    Or who appoints them?    The Deputy Directors?    Ja.    The Minister in consultation with the NDPP?    Okay, alright thank you.    That would include – would that include when to prosecute and when to not to prosecute and when to withdraw charges or prosecution?    Thank you.    I – I take it that he – he is being accounting officer is limited to how money is spent or is - does it go behind that as far as you understand the position?    Oh.    Yes.    No, no that is important that we should have it on record.    Yes.  It is – it is about the time for tea.  I was not going to take it because we just had 10 minutes but we are forced to take it now.  So we will take an adjournment until half past 11.  Hopefully it will be sorted out …    In the meantime.  We adjourn.     I am told that the technical problems have been sorted out at least for now.    Yes.  Let us proceed.    Well based on what Mr Hulley said to you it seems that what you are saying is he said to you your peers suggested that you might be the right person.    Hm – and you – you had not applied for any position?    Yes.     Okay.    Well you can say it …    In isiZulu and then seek to translate – interpret it for     People who might not understand isiZulu.    Ja.    A position where …    Spears would be directed at you.     That is – that is the (intervenes).    It is a position where spears could be directed at you.    Okay.    Is he – I know what you are talking about when you say in isiZulu and in English because in the Zulu culture – you know – if you are of the same surname – you know – there – there is some kind of connection that you – that is recognised even though you might not be related in any way in the English sense.  I think that is what you are talking about.    With him are you related in any way in the English sense?    You are Black relatives?    Oh, okay.    Okay, alright.    Thank you. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    You – you did of course as you said you were asked to furnish your CV which you did?    Ja, okay.    Prior to your assumption of duty but after the announcement of your appointment had you been in touch with the Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions who was acting before you came to arrange for what would happen when you arrived or there was no communication?     Okay.    In relation to the date of your assumption of duty when would that have been?  In a week’s time or when you asked for her to do a hand over – a week’s time, two weeks’ time or much later?     Okay, thank you.    Yes.    That is in terms of the National Prosecuting Authority Act?    Or in terms of the legislation (intervenes) …    To – to …    Racketeering?    Yes, okay.    Was she pointing to certain specific people as experts?    Yes, okay.     I am sorry.  When you say she said she relied on …    The persons that she referred to as experts in racketeering.    Was she saying that in relation to concluding whether or not a racketeering charge should be one of the charges against General Booysen?    So she was saying as to whether there was enough evidence or not to justify …    A charge of racketeering she had relied on them?    That was your understanding (intervenes)?    Yes, okay.    You made a comment earlier on about who has power to authorise or sign racketeering certificate or authorise that a person be charged with racketeering and as I understand your evidence you were saying that it’s only the National Director of Public Prosecutions, in the whole country who can authorise that a person be charged with racketeering, is that correct?     And to show that authorisation he or she signs a certain certificate, is that correct?     Now I thought there was a point you wanted to make about that, I assume that Ms Jiba had signed that certificate if she did sign it at a time when she was acting National Director of Public  Prosecutions?      She had the power.     So there is no issue about that?     So part of the point you are making is, there must be a reason why the legislation said only one person in the whole country can make the decision whether a person should be charged with racketeering and that must be because of the seriousness of the charge of racketeering and its consequences on a person and that although  any prosecutor and any Director of Public Prosecutions should satisfy themselves or himself or herself before deciding on any charge against anybody.  This one is particularly serious…(intervention).     And the NDPP must take care to satisfy himself that there is – or herself that there is proper and sufficient evidence before authorising it, that’s part of the point you are making.     Okay thank you.     I understand you to say the persons to whom she referred as experts were in the same room, in the meeting.     What was their response when she said that, did  they say anything about whether there was evidence or were they conceding that there wasn’t evidence?     Yes.     Thank you.     You see some of the witnesses who have come before me have suggested that what has happened in some of the cases is that people who were fighting corruption were being charged by the NPA with various crimes in circumstances where there was no evidence to support those crimes.  The suggestion being that they are being the decisions to charge certain people may have been influenced by reasons other than legitimate legal reasons.  Now I have to ask you this question, were you - did the persons that Ms Jiba referred to as experts in racketeering, did they at any stage say to you, here are some documents which supported our opinion that General Booysen should be charged, either on that day at the meeting or at any stage afterwards, did they ever say to you, no, no, no our decision or recommendation to the acting NDPP was justified because of this and that and that?     I think you may, I think we may have been told – I think we have been told yes.     So this person who had signed this statement, you  say he was a security guard simply said, he was present when somebody collected money and said it was for a certain General or the General…(intervention).     Wanted the money yes- wanted by the General.     He did not mention who the General was is that…(intervention).     Yes and that he was present also – or that the Chairperson of the Taxi Association took it to meet with the General and that he was present when he met with the General or that didn’t come out clearly?     Yes but also he didn’t say who the General was?     Are those the only two documents they produced?     And they did that in that meeting?     In Ms Jiba’s presence?     And Ms Jiba didn’t point to anything else she might have been told or shown in regard to what evidence there was.       Okay thank you.        No I think it’s important that, while you are here, we get as much evidence as you have to inquire into these things – these matters because it’s quite a serious suggestion or allegation when it is said that the NPA or certain people within the NPA abused their powers to charge people who should – against whom there was no evidence and that they were motivated by certain illegitimate considerations because if there is no evidence to support those allegations against those people or against the NPA then let us know but if there is evidence then let us know, the nation deserves to know exactly what the position is because the NPA is a very important institution in the country and in the fight against crime and the nation needs to know exactly what the position is and if there are people who did that, we must know if there is evidence that shows that that’s what they did and they will come before the Commission, put their side of the story and the Commission will make decisions and findings in due course and it was important that somebody like you comes before the Commission because you were – for a certain period of time occupying this very  important position of NDPP and you left under certain circumstances and in the public domain there are all kinds of things that are said but also there are judgement, Court judgements that have dealt with that.  It’s important that somebody like you comes and tells the Commission exactly what you know and what happened while you were NDPP so that the Commission can have as full a picture as possible before, in due course, it makes findings.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes. MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER     But you are saying with regard to the…(intervention).     Are you saying anything in regard to any other charges I can’t remember whether that was the only charge he was facing, are you saying anything about any other charges he may have  been facing other than the racketeering charge, I just can’t remember if it was just racketeering charges.     Okay thank you.       Was – is it correct that the investigation was still going on at that time because remember in 2009 charges were withdrawn, did the investigation continue after they had been withdrawn?     So in other words you are not necessarily saying there were investigators who were still continuing to investigate…(intervention).     That you do not know?     Ja you simply know that the matter…(intervention).     There were Court challenges relating to the dropping of the charges.     Okay.    Maybe before you proceed Mr Pretorius just one line.  At the time going back to Mr Joubert’s affidavit – at the time you got that affidavit was Mr Joubert known to you?    So you received an affidavit from somebody that you had never met, that you did not know?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    On the email.    Okay, Thank you.    Hm you talk about two officials of the NPA one of them I understand to have been Mr Joubert.    That you are talking about.  Was the other one the person that you refer to as Queen Mhlogo?    Okay.    Okay.  Thank you.    Around about the same time?    Hm.    During the month of September before you – no, no after you had commenced your duties as NDPP?    Okay ja.    Where Ms Queen Mhlongo…    Was working [indistinct]    Hm.    Yes.    So – so this lady who was employed by the NPA said a person who was standing behind her.    At…    Oh next to her?    At the time when you made the speech.    After being introduced by Minister Jeff Radabe at the NPA to the NPA staff.    Said you will be surprised that you will not even finish three months?    And then that same lady later came back to you and said that person was Mr Lawrence Mwebe?    Yes.  Okay.     Okay thank you.    The information that the lady gave you about the gentleman that was standing next to her was that information solicited?    Hm.  Okay.    How long is the conversation in the recording?    Yes.  Maybe during lunch break I do not know if there could be a chance for you to hear it I would not be insisting that it be heard today if you would rather let it be heard some other time but…    If you …    Ja.  No I would prefer that you hear it first so that you have an idea about its value.    Before I allow it..      If – once you have heard it and if you say you take the – your submissions that it can be heard then we can look at hearing it but if there are circumstances that justify that it be heard on another day then that should be arranged.  I am sure Mr Nxasana would make himself available.  But obviously to the extent that it is possible we would like to try and finish his evidence.    And so it is just a balance to be struck.      Thank you.    Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment now it is one o’clock we will resume at two.  We adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Okay.  We will stand down for about five minutes.    We adjourn.    Mr Pretorius you - do you want to deal with the fact that we only resume now?    Well I said in the morning when you mentioned that Mr Nxasana was called in – or pursuant to my directions one of the things I said was that I wanted to hear his evidence in regard to his departure from the NPA and I said of course then his tenure at the NPA because he having been National Director of Public Prosecutions at a certain stage and there been suggestions and allegations and some evidence that there may have been interference with the NPA and that some people in the NPA may have used their powers to charge and not to charge certain people in an unlawful way or they may not have been motivated by proper reasons.  It would be important to hear his evidence.  So one, I confirm that Mr Nxasana was called pursuant to my direction.  That is the first point.  The second point, you did raise in the morning the issue that Rule 3.3.  Notices were not given in advance – were not sent out in advance because the legal team only got a signed statement of the witness yesterday or last evening.  I was concerned about that but I indicated that in terms of my focus it was – I expected the witness to deal with largely matters that have been the subject of judgments and some litigation that would be – that would have been in the courts but of course when a witness gives evidence he gets asked  questions and he gives evidence and he may elaborate and so on.  So – and – and I was prepared to let him continue and in doing so the provisions of Rule 3 – of the Rules of the Commission make – they provide that where a party who – an implicated person believes that he has not been given enough – enough notice that party may approach the Commission for such order as may in effect give redress to the situation.  Of course this is a situation where the notices were not given in advance at all.  That is important to look at.  I think what should happen is I should allow Mr Ngalwana to say something if he wishes to say something.  He represents Ms Jiba and then we take it from there but it may well be that where notice has not been given at all.  It may be that that must be looked at carefully as opposed to where notice was given but there is a complaint that it is inadequate – the notice given is inadequate or – so maybe subject to whatever you might wish to say I would like to hear what Mr Ngalwana has to say but maybe that we should see what can be done.  The idea is always to try and be as fair as possible to everybody but taking into account practicalities that we have to deal with.  Mr Ngalwana.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Well you might wish to look towards the end of the Rules …    For something that might say any application provided here needs to be (indistinct) application.    I seem to think there is something along those lines but …    Anyway you – you …    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.     Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.     Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  No, I just want to confirm again that as far as I know the only reason Mr Nxasana is here is because I gave directions that a number of witnesses be called and he was among those and – and it was not the first time that I said he should be called.  Already last year I had said he should be called and I think some attempts were made but it did not happen.    Early this year I had said he should be called and  some attempts may have been made and did not succeed.    So he might have had nothing to do with …    Him being here and Ms Jiba maybe or his evidence been at – at a particular time nor would the legal team really or the Commission have anything to do with that and from my side as I indicated earlier on and you were not here with all the allegations about what has been happening at the NPA this Commission cannot finish its work in regard to the law enforcement agencies what has been happening without hearing evidence of somebody like Mr Nxasana.    So I just – I just want to clarify that.    Yes, yes.    In judgment.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.     Yes.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ms Jiba.    You say Mr Nxasana.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    As we speak what I am inclined to allow is Mr Pretorius first option which you – you have no problem with but when I say that I am inclined to say there should be no problem if the evidence includes evidence or it includes matters that have been dealt with in court judgments or affidavits filed in – in court on matters that are in the public domain already in respect of which whether it is Ms Jiba or the former President or Mr Mrwebi where they would have had a chance to deal with.  In regard to the point you make namely that as you stand there you do not know what those may be because you have not had a chance to have a look I am wondering whether there will  be no problem if we proceed on the basis that Mr Pretorius would be cautious to look at – to deal – to lead the witness in regard to matters that fall with that - within that and you might not be aware of it as long as it can be shown that there – there are matters that are dealt within judgments or in affidavits that have been in court and so on and then to the – and therefore that for now there should not be any new matters dealt with that implicate the persons who have not been covered in that way but that when Mr Nxasana comes back everybody who is implicated has had a chance then they can - he can cover all new matters.  That is the inclination I have.  What do you say about that?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  I – I think what we would be important is that the witness’ evidence is limited to those parameters.    Whether Mr Pretorius refers to which affidavit and which matter and so on and so on if he – if he can.  I am sure there is no problem but if he is not able to as long as in due course you can be informed …    To say that related to that.  That related to that.  So as long as that can be done it should be fine.    You are?  You would be happy with that?    Okay, alright.  I think we proceed.  Mr Pretorius…    Thank you Mr Ngalwana.  Mr Pretorius what do you …    Say that is the inclination I have but you have (intervenes).    Yes.    Ja, no, no but I want to hear what you have to say about suggestions.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Well I – I have made that quite clear.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes but remember Mr Ngalwana also made it clear that they are not seeking to prevent the leading of evidence …     It is just the timing.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I just want to emphasise again that the Commission seeks to strike a balance between various or among various interests and one of these is that it seeks to ensure fairness to all parties including implicated persons.  I have made it clear over the past year or so both in media briefings and in this venue that implicated persons will be dealt with fairly as well.  They must be dealt with fairly and that nobody will have findings made against them just because of what the media maybe saying about them or against them.  Any findings that will be made will be made on the basis of evidence led in the Commission and throughout we continue to try and be fair to everybody.  I thought I must just emphasise that and again to the extent that there may have been any thinking that Mr Nxasana – Mr Nxasana’s being here is timed by anybody to coincide with anything.  Again I indicate that he was called because I gave directions that he and certain other witnesses  whom we are not mentioning now be called and I have been told that some of them are not available.  So they will – may have to be called later.  So we will continue to have situations where a person who is implicated or not implicated but a person who in the view of the Commission has knowledge or information that may be helpful in the inquiry of the Commission maybe called to come and give evidence.  So it is not the last time that a person is called to give evidence because the Chairperson so directs but fairness to all implicated persons is very important but as I say there is fairness that must be taken into account together with all practicalities and constraints that the Commission has – within which the Commission must operate.  So what I am – these are just remarks that I consider important to make.  With regard to how we proceed I confirm that we are going to follow the option – option one that Mr Pretorius mentioned with which Mr Ngalwana does not have a problem subject to the remarks he made and on the understanding that I believe we – all three of us have achieved here in this open hearing in terms of also matters that may be in the public domain by way of court judgments and affidavits filed in court and Mr Pretorius in leading the evidence of the witness will be – will bear that in mind as he leads the evidence of the witness.  Of particular importance in this case is that the legal team was not able to give notice even to say Mr Nxasana would be giving evidence.  Sometimes there may be a situation where notice was given of – in terms of Rule 3.3 of the Rules of the Commission but the 14 days did not lapse.  That might fall under a different considerations.  So Mr Nxasana will have to come back at – on  a later date to finalise his evidence that would cover any matters that will fall outside of the parameters that I have indicated as discussed here at the opening hearing with Mr Pretorius and Mr Ngalwana.  That is how we are going to proceed.    I would like to take a five minute adjournment and then we will – we will continue.  We will just take a five minute adjournment.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    You may proceed Mr Pretorius.       Well you are, of course, not suggesting that what you mean is whatever it is you are going to refer to is something that has been said by the Court and is in the public domain…(intervention).       Yes okay.       Yes maybe before you proceed let me talk to him.  Mr Nxasana, it appears that it’s inevitable that you may have to come back, now Mr Pretorius tells me that you are concerned about that.  It doesn’t mean you’ll come back tomorrow so you may have intended to spend only today at the Commission but in terms of when you come back your availability would be looked at as well.  Does your concern remain, notwithstanding?       Including yesterday.       Yes.       Yes – no I think it’s unfortunate that this is the  situation and I appreciate what you are talking about when you are a sole practitioner in a legal firm when you are not there you are not earning income and there are people that you have to pay at the end of the month, there are bills to be paid but the legal team may have to have a look, I mean, if somebody goes to give evidence in Court, there’s provision for witness fees and I would imagine that the Commission should have similar provisions that are applicable to it.  I don’t know what limits there are but I would have imagined that they should be – their rate should be such that it should, as far as personal, place the person – the witness in the position he or she would have been in if she had not been called to come and give evidence but I think that probably at this stage there’s nothing more one can say other than that, that avenue should be explored that might not fully cover your situation but it might go to a certain point, is that right?        Yes I think that must be explored, I can see no reason why there wouldn’t be a similar provision applicable to the Commission but the legal team can look into that and you can be in touch with them.       Yes look at the applicable law ja, thank you.       Ja that’s fine.       One second Mr Pretorius, thank you.       One second Mr Pretorius, thank you, you may proceed.       Thank you.       Yes you may do so.    That is in relation to whether you should be reinstated or not?    Okay.    Not in regard to the main issue in regard to remedy, in other words.    Okay, I’m sorry, I may be confusing you.    I just want to make sure that I understand where you locate your comments, you have just said that you felt or feel that had the Constitutional Court considered that matter after this Commission and after the Mokgoro Inquiry ...(intervention)      They may have come to a different conclusion.    I’m just asking whether the conclusion you are talking about is with regard to whether you should be reinstated or not or are you talking about the main conclusion on the matter.    Okay.    (laughing)  Well there has never been a Zondo , JA.   Yes.    Zondo, JP.    Okay yes.    Yes it is, subject to just mentioning that the last part that you talked about in regard to the judgment comes from the minority judgment.    And what you said at the end might be misunderstood as if you are saying that’s what the Court said but what you intended is  to say some of the things you have said come from the majority judgment and the last bit comes from minority judgment.    Yes, yes.  Okay yes we can adjourn now, so Mr Nxasana we will adjourn, and it’s on the basis that you would be asked to come back and the legal team and yourself liaise with them with regard what witness fees or what fees is maybe payable when a witness has come to the Commission and because of that he is not able to work and earn income.  For somebody who is self-employed it is quite important, I am hopeful that there is a provision that would – should take care of that, but – you will be asked to come back.    Yes, but other than that thank you for availing yourself and then arrangements will be made as to when you will come back and the legal team of the Commission will make sure that implicated persons are given Rule 33 notices.    (laughing).  Ja so he might prefer that the remuneration be in the currency as stipulated in the Commissions Act of 1947.    Yes, yes, no thank you very much once again, you are excused.   We adjourn, and tomorrow we will start at – what time should we ...

ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Mxolisi Sandile Oliver Nxasana.    No I have none.    I truly affirm.    Yes I have.    Yes I am on page 27.    Yes I confirm that.    Yes it is my signature.    Yes I did.    Yes Chair I do confirm that this is my statement.    The contents are true and correct I confirm that.    Chair thank you.    Chair it is an option that was open to me I was asked a question then I opted for an affirmation but I do not have a problem giving evidence under oath.    In line...    Yes it is fine.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I hold a B.Proc Degree and an LLB Degree both degrees which I obtained from the University of Zululand. I served articles of clerkship and I was admitted as an attorney in 1997 and from that date of my [indistinct] I practiced from my own account until 2013 when I was appointed as the National Director of Public Prosecutions.      That is correct Chair.    I have gone back to set up my practice again and I am practicing in Durban for my own account as the attorney.    That is correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.  To the best of my recollection Chair the – Mr Bulelani Ngcuka was the first  National Director of Public Prosecutions.  I think from April 2001 until 31 August 2004.  And Doctor Silas Ramaite in an acting position was the Director of Public Prosecutions – National Director of Public Prosecutions from August 2004 to January 2005.  Then in – on 1 February 2005 to 7 February 2009 Advocate Vusi Pikoli was the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  After him Advocate Mokotedi Mpshe in an acting capacity was also appointed as the National Director of Public Prosecutions from 1 May 2009 until 31 October 2009.  After him on 1 December 2009 until 8 May 2012 Advocate Menzi Simelane was the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  Then on 20 December 2011 until 30 September 2013 Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba was also – was appointed to act as the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  Then on 1 October 2013 I took up the position until the 31 May 2015.  I was the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  I was succeeded by Advocate Shaun Abrahams on the 18 June 2015 until 13 August 2018.  On the 1 August 2018 to 31 January 2019 Doctor Silas Ramaite again was appointed to act in that capacity.  Then from the 1 February 2019 to date we have a permanent National Director of Public Prosecutions in Advocate Shamila Batohi.      It is ten years.    Unfortunately not Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Chair the issues are of public knowledge.  Advocate Bulelani Ngcuka as the first National Director of Public Prosecutions was subjected to a commission of inquiry after allegations were made against him that he was an apartheid spy and after he was cleared by the commission that was headed if my memory serves me well by Judge Heffer he then left the NPA.  Then Advocate Vusi Pikoli was also subjected to the same process of a commission of inquiry.  I know at the time he had reinstated charges against the former President Jacob Zuma and also had instituted criminal proceedings against the then Commissioner Of Police and the President of Interpol at the time Mr Jackie Selebi – Commissioner Jackie Selebi I mean.  Despite also his – despite him being cleared at the Ginwala Commission of Inquiry he was  nevertheless removed from office.      Precede that.    To make a distinction.    Yes thanks Chair for bringing that to my attention.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I remember that despite him having been cleared but at the time I think it was President  Kgalema Motlanthe was the President of the Republic of South Africa.  I think the matter had to be referred to Parliament after the Commission of Inquiry but I think they took a decision that she should not be retained at NPA.    That is correct Chair.    My, my…    My understanding Chair is that Mr Ngcuka resigned.    It came to an end – I understand that at times he did make attempts to take the matter to court but I think he was drained out and he could not pursue the matter and ultimately a settlement agreement was reached and he left the NPA.    My recollection Chair is that when Menzi Simelane was – Advocate Menzi Simelane was appointed as the National Director of Public Prosecutions he was the Director General of Justice before that and at the inquiry – at the Ginwala Inquiry he was called to testify and the Ginwala Inquiry made some critical remarks about his testimony amongst other things that his evidence was contradictory and when he was appointed by the President at the time as the National Director of Public Prosecutions the I think it was DA if I am not mistaken who then challenged his appointment and ultimately the matter came before the constitutional court.  The constitutional court declared he – the appointment irrational and reviewed it and set aside.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I was appointed on the 31 August 2013 with effect from the 1 October 2013.    Yes I do.    Chair I think the organisation called CASAC had taken the matter to court compelling the President to make a permanent appointment.  I think at the time the reasons they advanced was that the office of the NDPP was such a critical office that we cannot afford to have an acting and NDPP at the time and that the position had to be filled on a permanent basis. And the court if my memory serves me well delivered the judgment and gave the President who was President Zuma at the time and ultimate time to fill the post by a certain date – a particular date.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair especially with regards to the – with regards to Mr Bulelani Ngcuka and Advocate Vusi Pikoli.    Chair my view is that from this history and also what I experienced at NPA my view is that there has been political interference as well as external interference that impacted on the decision making in the NPA.    No doubt it did have – it does have effect on public confidence in the NPA.    Chair there is a Portfolio Committee on Justice because NPA is also a – a – a unit falling under justice although it is independent.  It plays political oversight over the justice as well as NPA.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Chair.    That is…    It was confirmed.    Yes, yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.    That is the one that I am referring to.  That approach I meant the – the affidavit that I received from Mr Terence Joubert.    The other person was Ms Queen Mlongo who was stationed at the – the NPA offices attached to the Asset Forfeiture Unit in Durban.    She told me that Colonel Mglongo was bragging saying that – in fact she also had recorded him unfortunately we have lost the phones now and the recordings but I listened to the recording myself.  And in that recording he was bragging that he claimed to know me very well and he made a lot of false allegations about me in that recording but of importance is that he was saying that he had been promised the appointment of the Brigadier – he was accusing me of wanting to charge General Mdluli and that General Mdluli if he is not charged General Mdluli was going to make sure that he is appointed as the – he was going to be promoted as the Brigadier.    Chair no he was not known to me.     Yes but he is an employee of the NPA.    And my details are there for them.    Because I received on the …    Official NPA email.    It is Queen. Queen Mhlongo.  Mhlongo it is Mhlongo.    Chair except that – I just see if I can refresh my memory.      Yes, Yes Chair this is – that is the – the evidence that I have just given that paragraph 33 talks to that about the plot to oust me.  That Colonel Mhlongo was the main person that was used by Advocate Jiba to run the compaign.    Both of them Chair.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    She was – she was attached to the Asset Forfeiture Unit based in Durban at the time. But she is no longer with the NPA.  She is the private…    Sector now.    No independent of each other Chair.    Separate incidents.     Yes.    Around about the same time Chair.    Yes.    Yes after I had commenced my duties yes.    And Chair I think I must also mention that both – I think they were – Terence Joubert and – although he was a Risk Officer Specialist.  I think his office was also in the same building as the office where – of the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the NPA in Durban.  That is the …    Yes.    Yes it is – yes – it – at – is it 185 Building, Southern Life Building.    Yes.     No Chair they came of their own accord.    And separately.    In fact Chair what I have not mentioned here in the affidavit is I have referred earlier to an incident when I said I was warmly welcomed at the NPA and during that – I referred to a – to the day when Minister Radabe came to introduce me.  I gave a speech also there.  We were at the auditorium.  Chair I then said – I remember saying that Minister I am no – NDPP has ever finished his term of office and I can assure you that I will finish my term of office.  In fact the NPA Act even permits me to take an extra period of not more than two years and I am sure that I will be here for the period of 12 years.  I was saying that in jest.     But what then happened is that later on I – a lady was then seconded to my office as my secretary and at a very late stage she then said to me that she related her story to me that she said she was present at the – when I gave that – at that welcoming event.  Then she said there was a gentleman she was standing by the door and a second gentleman immediately passed  a comment after I made those remarks and said you will be surprised that you will not even last for a period of three months.  As we continued working together then in the office and she then happened to meet and know that apparently that person who made those comments was Mr Lawrence Mwebe.      Yes.    Or next to her.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes when she got to see him when we had interactions with them in my boardroom.    And she identified him as Lawrence Mwebe.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja but again also Chair perhaps this might also become relevant I – also during the – just to go back.  During the – that September period of 2013 when the announcement had been made before I took office I received – I remember I received a call from Advocate Mdladla commonly known as Advocate Sthembiso Mdladla commonly known as Sticks Mdladla.  I know that he was then subsequently one of the members of the Cassim Commission of Inquiry he was also a member.  He phoned me in the morning and said to me apparently he made mention of a Mr Mwebe.  He said he understand Mr Mwebe wanted to speak to me because he  fears or hears told him that – he has been told that when I came to NPA I will deal with him.  Chair it took me by surprise as I pointed out earlier on that I did not even know him. I did not even met him I did not know anyone except the person that I later identified as Advocate Pinkie Mokgatle.      No Chair.    That is correct Chair.    In summary Chair apparently Advocate Jiba was going to Durban.  I think it was on the day that I met her.  And the protocol is that Terence Joubert as the Risk Officer Specialist in Durban is – was responsible for security and risk. I think he was the head in Durban.  He was the one who was going to fetch Advocate Jiba from the King Shaka International Airport and drive to her destination.  But then Mr Joubert says that he then subsequently when he had made arrangements to go and fetch Advocate Jiba he received a phone call from the Advocate Jiba’s secretary advising him that he was not – he was no longer going to be – it was not going to be  him who was going to fetch Advocate Jiba and it was now going to be Colonel Mhlongo.  And then he said he found that very strange because he talks about the security, the protocol and the security risk attached to all of that.  And then he made mention of a situation where – he then made mention of these two police officers that were deployed to the DPP’s office in Durban Advocate Noko and that is when he challenged that because of the security risk and that they were not vetted apparently his boss from the head office a Mr Ramahana flew down and came down and castigated him for that.  Then he in this affidavit he then talks about the – the plot now that apparently Jiba was running a campaign to get me removed as the – he said to Mhlongo – or he said Mhlongo told him that …    Oh sorry Mhlongo told Joubert.    That Jiba said to him – Jiba does not trust this guy the – who is the new NDPP Mr Nxasana and that Mhlongo must go out and get some – and dig some dirt about him.  So that…    About me?    The whole intention was to embarrass me and that she did not know me but the whole intention  was to embarrass me so that the President will remove me or will fire me as the National Director and she will then be considered to either continue to act or to be considered on a – to be appointed on a permanent basis.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.      That is what I have just told the Chair and also the – the issue about the cases that I had faced in about 2015.    Sorry 1985.    Oh yes.  Chair yes.  In that affidavit also Mr Joubert refers to – he says that Colonel Mhlongo also told him that Mr Stanley Gumede who is the Regional Magistrate in Durban was the person who was considered for the position before myself.  But that Advocate Jiba ran the campaign to discredit him and one of the things in that affidavit that which Joubert alleges is that Jiba or – Jiba then – they convinced a one advocate here – they call him Makosi in Durban to – to complain about the manner in which Mr Gumede had treated her in court as a result Mr Gumede had to face a lot of complaints and he was investigated by the Magistrates Commission.  The matter was all over the media and the President that [indistinct] the President not considering him as the candidate.  Then he says that they were using the very same tactic that they used against – and he was responsible Mr – Colonel Mhlongo in that campaign authorised by Jiba.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yesterday after I had left you.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I think it is less than eight minutes if I am not mistaken or five minutes ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct.    They are also appointed by  the President.    That is correct Chair.    It is …    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Okay Chair.  The National Director of Public Prosecutions is the Head of the Prosecution in South Africa and then we have – during my time four and I think that is still – that is what is still in existence.  Then have four Deputy National Directors of Public Prosecutions.  We then have Special Directors of Public Prosecutions.  Then we have all of these that I have mentioned are based at the Head Office in Pretoria – of the National Prosecuting Authority.  Then in the divisions – in the regions – we have the Heads of the Prosecutions who are the Director of Public Prosecutions.  All of them are appointed also by the President on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice – I think – in consultation with the National Director of Public Prosecutions.    Yes.  The Directors of Public Prosecutions are Head of Prosecutions in the regions.    Public Prosecutions.    Yes.  If …     A decision had been taken to align them to provinces …    Because initially that was the whole idea that the Directors of Public Prosecutions should be aligned to the – to the provinces.    That they – they are Heads of Public Prosecutions in the provinces …    But we have exceptions like in Gauteng.    In Gauteng we have – we have two Directors of Public Prosecution.  That is one for the South Gauteng …    And one for the North Gauteng …    But I – when I left – at the time when I left they were in the process of aligning them so that it will  have one …    One Director of Public Prosecutions.  We will have one Premier for the province.  We will have one President …    Judge President.  We wil have Director of Public Prosecutions and in the Eastern Cape as well …    Because of the …    The number of High Courts and the – and the fact that the area is so wide to cover …    We had two Directors of Public Prosecution.  Hence we also had two Deputy – Deputy Judge Presidents …    Like in Gauteng.    Those are the only – those are the only exceptions.    That is correct Chair.    No.    They – they are equal.    They are both co Heads, yes.    Yes.    National Directors.    Yes.    That is correct.    Special Directors.    Yes.    When I left – because this is not provide by the …    In the Act.    I think they were appointed in terms of a proclamation …    By the President.    The number might change from time to time …    Because at the time it was Advocate Lawrence Mgwebi for the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit …    And at the time it was Mr Dawood …    Who was the Special  Director for – what is this unit that deals with witnesses?    Witness protection, yes.  Witness protection …   Office for Witness Protection and we also had a – another post of the Special Director which I recommended that it be frozen.  At the time Abrahams – Advocate Shaun Abrahams was acting when I arrived at NPA …    And that was the Special Director for Priority Crime Litigation Unit.    Well they (intervenes).    As the Directors.    They are on the same level but there is that power play …   Between the Special Directors and the Directors.     And who …    Yes.    I think that power play – you know – it played itself out     In the matter we will talk about earlier …    A bit later on.    Yes.    They are on the same level yes.    It is just that they are Directors.   They are Special Directors.    We …    We have Deputy Directors of Public Prosecutions.    And …    There could be a number of them …    And some of them at the Head Office.  They are all over.   Well they also rank themselves – the Deputies – as senior and Deputies.    Yes.  Yes they have different levels.   The Prosecutors who normally prosecute in the High Courts they are the Advocates who are  based in the DPPs Office – the Director of Public Prosecutions Offices …    And anyone – you might find – you might find anyone prosecuting.    (Intervenes) from an - an Advocate to …    To a Senior Advocate     Deputy Director, Senior Deputy Director.    The DPP.    Yes.    Yes.    Then the Prosecutors that you find in the lower courts …    By lower courts I mean Regional Courts going …     Down to the …    To the District Courts.  Those are Prosecutors that fall under the Chief Prosecutors in the …    In the particular court.  The Chief – the Chief Prosecutors they – they – under them I think they cover a certain area …    Of jurisdiction.    Under whom they have Prosecutors.   Below the Chief Prosecutor will be the Senior Public Prosecutors, (intervenes) Prosecutors.    Then Prosecutors and – in their …    In their ranks.    All of them, yes.    That is correct.    The DPPs, yes.    No he does not go that far.    He stops there.    The …    The Deputies.    The Deputy Directors.    It is the NDPP and the – and the Minister - the Minister.    With the NDPP.    That is correct Chair.    Chair it means that the – the NDPP must consult with the Directors of Public Prosecutions.  The policy to be followed in prosecuting matters that is how to go about prosecuting matters and what is expected of the Prosecutors in handling matters when they are prosecuting them.    That is – that is correct  Chair.    Ja.    That is correct Chair.  That means Chair as the National Director of Public Prosecution you can mero motu on your own intervene when you believe that prosecution policy and directives have not been followed in a particular matter or when any of the parties involved in the matter approaches you as the  National Director of Public Prosecutions and make representations that you review the decision to prosecute him or her or a decision not to prosecute a particular individual.    (No audible reply).    That is the Minister of Justice and currently it is the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services.    But I must also explain Chair that whilst he – the Minister – exercises final responsibility over the NPA the Director General of Justice is the accounting officer of the National Prosecuting Authority.    Well as far as I …    That is correct.     Chair is that the person must possess legal qualifications that entitle him to – him or her – to appear in all courts in the Republic of South Africa and also that that person must be a fit and proper person with due regard to his or her experience conscientiousness and integrity to be entrusted with the responsibilities of Office of the NDPP.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  Chair as I have pointed out that I was conducting my own private practice in Durban.  Then during 2013 - I cannot remember the exact date and the month – I received a call from Mr Michael Hulley who was the President’s Legal  Advisor – former President Jacob Zuma’s Legal Advisor at the time – who wanted to see me and I obliged.  He came over to see me at my office in Durban.  We had a discussion with him.  He told me that he was looking for a candidate to fill the position of the National Director of Public Prosecutions as he was mandated by President Zuma.  He had with him three names that he told me that he had been given – were given to him by colleagues in Durban but when he bounced off those names to those colleagues they were of the view that I was the person who could do the job and my name was not amongst the list.  Hence he then came to see me.  He expressed then the – he asked me if I was willing to take over the – I would be willing to take over the appointment …    No sir.    Then Chair it – I was surprised.  I was shocked and surprised because not in bad way that I never thought that one day I would become a Prosecutor because I had chosen to become an Attorney but it also at the same time humbled me that my colleagues especially from my division saw something in me that I could head an institute – institution of that magnitude.  Then I felt that - I remember that I even remarked to him that if my colleagues  have confidence in me so why not – why should I not have confidence in myself.  Then I was willing as everyone would be willing to serve the country.  I thought that the – my colleagues saw some qualities in me that entered me to be appointed to that position.  I then agreed.    Yes.  A meeting was then scheduled to meet the President at his official residence in Pretoria and I remember – I think it was around August if I am not mistaken if not before that.  I went up to meet the President at his official residence in Pretoria.  Present at the meeting was the President, Mr Hulley and I think there was also the lady who – who I was later told that she was – she was also the Legal Advisor to the President – Ms Bonisiwe Makhene.   Spelt M-A-K-H-E-N-E, Makhene.    That is correct Chair.    No, no Chair.    Not.    At that meeting - before I went to the meeting Mr Hulley assured me that I was not going to an interview of any sort.  The President wanted just to see me, interact with me and I should relax and that is exactly what happened.  It was not an interview.  It was an interaction and what I remember quite vividly what the President asked me of was that did I have courage to take up that position.  To which I responded by saying yes I do and I even said to him that knowing that he has been through hardships I thought that he meant that I would be able to take decisions independently and firmly.  Then I said yes I have that courage and also I remember he even said something in isiZulu that it is like that position might be like the people stabbing you with arrows something like that.    In isiZulu.    Okay.    Okay.    I think if I remember well he said that position is like (isiZulu) which I understood him to be  saying that it was a – a very difficult task to handle and he described it as like a – arrows …    A position where …    Spears would be directed at you yes.    Literally yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Then Chair as about I was leaving – about I was leaving the meeting - I think the meeting lasted for not more than 30 minutes because I remember it coincided because I had to wait there.  It was a date when I think the former Deputy President of the country – Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka - was there I think to meet the President before she was going to take up the position in the – in – I think was it in The Hague if I am not mistaken - had a long meeting then I had to wait.  There were also other Ministers there that were waiting to see the President.  As I was leaving I think it was Mr Hulley who asked if the – I had anything to – to say and my  response was that my father who is now late was a trade unionist and I know that he would mention that the President - Jacob Zuma – was his comrade at the time.  I felt that was necessary to bring that to the – to their attention.  I think that was because – I think that was prompted by a question that – I think the question was – was I related to Sizwe Nxasana if I remember well.  Then I said to them Sizwe is my – is my brother in isiZulu.  Well in English he is my cousin.    Yes.    No we are Black relatives.  Our – our …    Yes.   Our grandfathers are brothers.    Yes.     Oh the 30 t h …    Ja.  30 August 2013 I remember I was running a trial at Umlazi Court in a civil trial then I received a call from Mr Hulley who then asked me to send – to send him my CV which I then did.    Yes.  He told me that the President was under pressure to appoint and he intended appoint – to announce my appointment. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Although Mr Hulley had told me that the – the President was going to announce the appointment probably over the weekend or on a Monday I think circumstances – he told me that circumstances forced him because the information leaked from the President’s office which then precipitated the President to make the announcement the next day which was 31 August 2013.    No I do not know.  I had not seen any advertisements myself.    No Chair.  I have no idea if there were other selection processes or whether there were other candidates interviewed but Chair I think I must pause to mention that later on I discovered that Advocate Jiba as she was acting she was promised by the then Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development – Minister Jeff Radebe – that she was going to be appointed on a permanent basis.    Except for the meeting?    Except of the meeting that we had on the – when I met President Zuma, Mr Hulley and Ms Bonisiwe Makhene – nothing.   Unless they were to ascribe that meeting as the formal interview - none.    What I can – what I can say Chair is that recently there has been an – an interview to appoint the direct – the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  If that is what you mean that was not done.    That process was not done.    No Chair.    Yes I did.  I completed it only after I was appointed and I was in the office.  I think it was around December 2013.    I would have signed the –  my employment contract as well as the oath of office before Judge – Judge President Mlambo.    Yes.    That …    That is correct – excuse me – that is correct Chair.    Chair I received a warm welcome from the personnel at NPA.  At one stage the Minister of Justice – Mr Radebe – also came to the Head Office to introduce me and I can say I was warmly received.   Chair there was no communication.  I did not know anyone at – at the – at the Head Office except that when I arrived there I – I identified the person who I know in the leadership as Advocate Pinky Mokgatla because she – she attended – I think – the university in KZN – in Durban – and she qualified there and she practiced there as an advocate and she was also my colleague in the Black Lawyers Association.  That is where I knew her from.    But to answer the question there was a time when the – the CEO at the time – Advocate Karen Van Rensburg – and the Deputy CEO that was Ms Beryl Sisulu they phoned me and they wanted to come and meet with me just to give me a briefing of what I would – I should expect when I get to the NPA.  They came down to Durban and we met I remember in one of the hotels in Umhlanga.  Then was we were in the meeting I then subsequently get – received a call from a person who introduced herself as Advocate Jiba who was acting who wanted to see me as well and she then appeared to be around Durban.  I had to hastily go and meet her.  I did not know how – whether it was a coincidence that she knew that they had come down the CEO and the Deputy CEO but I later learnt that they – they got a hiding because they came down to see me from – from Advocate Jiba.  We met and when I met Advocate Jiba she was in the presence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in KZN – Advocate Moipone Noko – and the  gentleman who I knew very well from KZN in Durban who at the time was Colonel BW Mahlangu – Colonel Mahlangu – at the time.  We exchanged pleasantries with him because he is a Mahlangu and my late mom’s surname is Mahlangu and we used to call each other cousins until his involvement in all of this thing and which I did not know then we stopped having that relationship.    Yes.    That is correct.    No Chair.    I did Chair and she did not comply.    Chair I – there were a lot of things happening Chair because when I – I think it was around December – if I am not mistaken – December 2013.    Yes Chair.    No Chair.  I was not given any information.    Apart from the fact that coming from Durban I knew that there was an investigation whilst I was still in private practice because the matter was at the court that I appear frequently.  That is the Durban Court but when I assumed office I did not know what the status of that matter was and I was not informed about it.  I only learnt about it when I read the newspaper.  I cannot remember where I was coming from but I was travelling.  I was on plane – on the plane reading if I remember a – the Business Times.   Then I saw that there was a decision by Judge Gorven in KZN.   G-O-R-V-E-N, yes – criticising the manner in which Advocate Jiba handled herself in the matter but of particular concern was also that the NPA was appealing the decision of Judge Gorven.  Then I became worried because as the Head of the institution and taking into consideration the – the seriousness of that matter I thought that it was appropriate that I be familiarised with what was happening.  I immediately summoned the – I think it was Advocate Jiba – and asked her to tell me what was happening in the matter and summon the prosecuting team.  They came over to my office in Pretoria and we went through the evidence there and then I got the impression - Chair I think the matter – I think they have spoken about the matter previously but …    Of particular importance is that what I also found in the matter is that when Advocate Jiba authorised the racketeering certificate but perhaps I must explain that the racketeering certificate can only be authorised by one person in the whole country that is the National Director of Public Prosecutions himself or herself and the National Director of Public Prosecutions cannot delegate that authority to anyone.    Hm.     In terms of the legislation.    Yes.    Yes.    In terms of the legislation to racketeering.  Then in this matter what I found is that Advocate Jiba authorised the racketeering – she signed the racketeering certificate and authorised the – that – that General Booysen be charged with racketeering which was then the subject matter in court.  Judge – General Booysen challenged the – challenged that and Judge Gorven found in his favour that there was no evidence justifying the authorisation of the racketeering charges against General Booysen but when I questioned Advocate Jiba why she had to sign that obviously bearing in mind that she was exercising her authority at the time before I – I came there.  Her – her response was that she relied – if I quote her she said – I relied on the so called experts – racketeering experts and then I pointed out to her that it is …    Yes.  She pointed at people – the prosecution team who were present.    Then I said to her perhaps it would have been better. I did not expect – I would not have expected her to go through the – the bundles and bundles – in fact it was the boxes of evidence but if I were her I said I would have asked them to point me to the relevant evidence that points to racketeering – to the relevant evidence that implicates General Booysen and to my surprise what they then produced …    Someone.    Yes.    That is correct.    Her …    That is correct.   That was my understanding Chair.     Yes.  then Chair I think it is – it is on record that what was there in the – in the file – in the docket was a – a mere unsigned statement not commissioned from one witness who left the country as in Greece – he is in Greece - and also the other statements were statements of – were hearsay statements which were not only hearsay but twice removed hearsay statements and Your Worship my feeling was that there is no way I then took them through and I explained to them, I convinced them that there is no way that you would succeed in appealing the decision of Judge Gorvan and I then instructed them to withdraw the notice of appeal which, they then did.       That’s correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct and because of – because she was acting National Director, she had the power.       She had the power to say…(intervention).       The issue is that, Chair,  the point I’m making is, before she signed the racketeering certificate she had to satisfy herself that there was evidence to justify her to sign the racketeering certificate and I found her response to my question, really puzzling that she could only rely to the – she could only rely upon what she has been – she was told by the so-called experts, the prosecutors that were leading the matter because – I think that was the reason why the legislature made that provision that it must only be the National Director of Public Prosecutions, that is the – the National Director of Public Prosecutions is given the responsibility to satisfy himself or herself that because of the – of the consequences flowing from being charged with racketeering.       It’s very serious yes.       That’s the point I’m making Chair.       That’s is correct Chair.       Chair her response was that she relied on the – if I quote her verbatim, she said, “I relied on these so-called experts -  racketeering experts”.      That is correct.         Chair the team as far as I can recall, the team appeared to be divided on the issue but they were of the opinion, I don’t know, because they were quiet, they did not respond to when she said she relied on what they had told her.       But then we went through the matter and I made it clear – it became very clear that there was no evidence in the docket to justify the racketeering, in fact, Chair, I went as far as to  - if I may be allowed this latitude, I went as far as to advise them that, you see I come from Durban and most of the – and some of the victims of the so-called Cato Manor death squad were people that I knew personally, I even told them at that meeting and I told the that perhaps I was trying to display any feeling that I might be taking sides, I wanted to display to them that if there was any person that is really very close to what is happening in KZN, it’s myself other than them because even the people who died under the so-called – the alleged death squad, are the people that I knew and I counted to them, the names of those people that I knew very well.  I was trying to convince them and I said to them, you see I understand that you mustn’t be carried away by this racketeering charges, you may also consider the predicate charges, predicate offences, murder, accessory to murder, conspiracy to murder if there is any but really in the docket there is none – there is no evidence of racketeering against General  Booysen and if the docket still remains the same as I left it, my view is still the same.       I read from the newspapers.       Yes.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       That is absolutely correct.      That is correct Chair.        That is so sir.       Chair I did ask them to produce at least evidence – at least prima facie evidence against General Booysen but they then referred to the statement of – I don’t  know if I may mention the witness?       They then produced the statement of a Mr Danikus he was a Greek national, it was an unsigned statement.       It’s D-a-n-i-k-u-s, Danikus, Chair that was an unsigned statement, then when I asked for any statement implicating General Booysen they then produced a statement, I cannot remember the name but I will try to recollect it was a person who apparently was a security guard for a Stanger Taxi Association who, in his statement, was alleging that a Mr Mhlongo who was a member of the executive committee of Stanger Taxi Association was – had collected monies from the Association and told the Association in this security guard’s presence  that , that money was required by the General and that he was present when Mhlongo and the Chairperson at the time was Mr Zondi of the Stanger Taxi Association went to meet with the General at the gateway.  Chair that is the General it doesn’t even describe that it was General Booysen, that is the problem but he doesn’t say that he overheard the conversation between even that General and Mhlongo, that was the only evidence that they said that it implicated General Booysen.       Wanted the money.       Yes.       No.       It didn’t come out clear but I think he was in the vehicle as the VIP protection.       Yes.       At the time yes.       In that meeting.       In Ms Jiba’s presence.       No.     Perhaps Chair, that is why if I follow the matter, I think when it came before you, if I’m not mistaken, I think that is why then subsequent I heard that Advocate Shaun Abrahams re-instated the charges, but I understand that people were sent to Greece to obtain a statement, again I’m told that, that statement is written in Greece and it was translated by someone here.       Yes I appreciate that.  Sir – Chair can I make also this observation because – so that my evidence here is not taken out of context.       I haven’t suggested that there was no evidence at all against General Booysen’s co-accused.       That – just to make that one very clear.     To the racketeering charge against Booysen, Chair there was not a shred of evidence.         Because in the main Chair, perhaps just to unpack this matter Chair, you know I even suggested Chair that if I was prosecuting that matter or directing that matter I was going to – I said to them, you could have approached one of the co-accused and turn him a 204 witness because most of the evidence I said to them, you know, I’m based in Durban and come from Durban and all that you are telling me here is what is in the public domain in Durban.  We hear a lot of things about Cato Manor at the time and I told them that we would hear that when the members of the Cato Manor Unit had killed a person, they would plant a firearm and then General Booysen would come and take over the scene, so to say.  Those were the allegations but then I said to them, these are just allegations and without the evidence in the docket you cannot prosecute because we don’t prosecute with emotions and I tell you this is what I would also hear about the Cato Manor Unit and Chair, there was also evidence also, in the – there were allegations, not evidence in the docket that one member of the Cato Manor Unit shot and killed a teenager at, I think, Empangeni (indistinct) when they were looking for a suspect, I don’t know whether the suspect was  related to this young man but I think they recklessly opened fire and killed an innocent young man.  That’s a simple investigation, I’ve never been an investigator in my life but, I mean you can take – collect evidence, match cartridges, spent cartridges, take the firearms for ballistic  examination purposes and link the person or even use the adoption of common purpose to charge whoever, that is why I pointed out  to them that they mustn’t get carried away with this racketeering charge but of particular importance which I brought to their attention that, if you want to charge a person with racketeering you have to prove that there has been a pattern and this pattern has been continuously happening for  a particular period and I said, if they want to allege that Cato Manor as the unit which was based at Cato Manor, Chair knows where Cato Manor is, in Durban, and my difficulty was that at the time General Booysen was not even a member of that unit because he was the head of the Hawks in Durban based, the now called (indistinct) building in Durban and then to allege that he was managing the enterprise when he was based there, they were not going to succeed.       That is correct Chair.       That is what I was referring to.       That is correct Chair, that is what I was suggesting.       That is correct Chair       Not at all Chair, in fact Chair I’ve never even touched the docket relating to the former President Jacob Zuma.  I understand that the docket was still in the possession of Advocate Jiba and Mr Hofmeyr, if I’m not mistaken.       Chair my response for the question of the investigation, I understand quite clearly that the investigations had ceased to – by then but I understand that the matter was pretty much very alive because there were challenges at the time.  Then my response is in regard to that, that there were people still challenging the decision to withdraw charges against the former President Jacob Zuma.        No, no.       No I’m not – I don’t know Chair.       There were Court challenges.       That is correct Chair.     That is correct.         Yes Chair, Chair as I pointed out that I was appointed on the 31 s t of August 2013 with effect from the 1 s t of October 2013.  In a sense it means that I had this whole month of September still in Durban to wrap up before I took office.  Chair I started to learn that during that period of September, because the announcement was made by the President that, there were people that were running around, driving around in the township where I grew up from that is Umlazi in my area and that these people, many people were stopping people, asking them about me, about my history especially about my involvement in a matter that was publicised of murder around 1985.  It didn’t puzzle me at first because I thought that it was part of the vetting process but this thing gained its momentum until I got to the office.  I then learnt there were members within NPA who were very much responsible also for that.  I then subsequently received unsolicited statement in the form of an affidavit from one member of the NPA by the name of Terrence Joubert wo was, at the time, I don’t know if he still is, a risk specialist at NPA he was based in Durban.  He sent me an email and in the email there was an affidavit that affidavit forms part of the bundle here where he then – where he was basically telling me that there was a campaign by Advocate Jiba that – to dig the dirt about me so that the intention, the whole purpose was to embarrass me so that the President will then remove me as the National Director of Public Prosecutions and she would then stand a chance of being considered to either continue to act or to be appointed  permanently, it is there but it also – this affidavit – in this affidavit he also states that there were police – two police members that were assigned to the DPP, that’s Deputy – Director of Prosecutions in KZN, Advocate Noko who was stationed there at his office who had received vehicles from the provincial office at the time the Commissioner was – Commissioner Mmamonnye Ngobeni and that those people that were there, those two gentlemen they were then tasked with going around finding any dirt about me but he also went as far as recording this Colonel Mahlongo.  Yesterday I tried to get this recording, I only managed to get it very late because it happened in – I think 2013 or 14 where basically I could hear the voice of Colonel Mahlongo and Terrence Joubert, Joubert was playing along.  He did not – Colonel Mhlongo did not know that he was recording him.  He was basically saying that Jiba had mandated him to go about digging dirt about me.  They went so far as to that recording saying that I think Terence Joubert had undertaken to hook him up with people from the Road Accident Fund because the allegation was that because I was practising as an attorney they were alleging that I had embezzled clients monies when I handled the Road Accident Fund claims and also I do not know how they got it from and it is true that my wife at some stage was also – was employed at the – at the Road Accident Fund office in Durban.  All of that it is there that my wife was also employed there and that Terence Joubert was going to hook him up with the gentleman at Road Accident Fund so that they could give them evidence implicating me in all of that.  They also refer in the murder  charge that Terence Joubert could hear him saying that that murder charge that you have in your position referring to Colonel Mhlongo that was – it is there – it is there I have it in the record here.       Yes Chair it remains Chair, notwithstanding.  Chair as I have explained that I run a practice and unfortunately I’m a sole proprietor of my practice, my practice is suffering as I am here.  In fact, I’ve been here, not only today, two days already.       Including yesterday.       And they say that it is inevitable and it’s anticipated that I’ll have to come back.       That is correct Chair.      Thank you Chair.        Yes but just for correction I wasn’t ultimately suspended, just for the record.       Yes.       That is correct yes.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       That is so.      That is so Chair.        That is correct       That is correct.       Yes.       That is so.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.       Yes that is a correct record.       Okay thank you, Chair, I at no stage did I make a request o vacate the office to the former President Mr Jacob Zuma and that letter of the 10 t h that is referred to here, I was also involved in drafting that letter confirming the discussion that we’d had with the President and the company – President and Mr Harley together with my legal representative, therefore the Court found, correctly, that I did not make any request, I never made that request.       That is correct Chair.       That is correct, it fairly summarises the position.       That’s is correct ja.     Yes, it’s a fair remark that is contained here.     Yes.      That is correct Chair.     Certain individuals yes.       That is so Chair.     That is correct Chair.      Yes.     Yes Chair.  Are you asking me to comment?      Yes, thanks.     Firstly Chair as things were going on and that have been going on after I left office I felt that had this matter come before the Constitutional Court after this Commission was constituted and after the other Commission of Inquiry had been constituted I strongly believe that the majority in the Constitutional Court would have come to a different conclusion.  That is my view.     That is correct Chair.      Perhaps ...(intervention)       To remedy, Chair I felt that the ...(intervention)      Yes.      Mokgoro Commission, inquiry yes.     That’s my view.     I believe that the conclusion would have been the same as the conclusion reached by the minority judgment that I should be reinstated.       Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Thank you Chair, I will 
MR MXOLISISANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot remember anyone specific offhand. 
NXASANA:   Yes because…(intervention). 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Thank you Deputy Chief Justice.  Thank you for the indulgence.    Of the two options or perhaps should I confirm that I …    I stand here on the instructions of Majavu  Incorporated …    For Ms Jiba.    None of the legal – members or the legal team …    Are in Johannesburg.    So I am the only one who is here.  So I have been asked to make these representations.    Of the two proposals made by the evidence leader …    I have not taken instructions but I would imagine the one that would endure itself to Ms Jiba and the legal team might be the first one which is to allow the witness to testify further because he is quite right.  We cannot stop the witness from giving evidence in a public domain but then not to give evidence that would implicate Ms Jiba and all the – and the other persons whom – who are not represented by me.    Now Mr Pretorius referred to what he terms the principle of Rule 3.3.     Just briefly I wish to deal with this.    Can I take us to Rule 3.3 itself and with your indulgence DCJ I just want to briefly read it because it is important to understand the text of the Rule so that one can appreciate the textual context and the principles …    That lies behind it.    It reads as follows   3.3.1   There is nothing in Rule 3.5 that says that application must be in writing …    And of course since the legal team …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I – I appreciate that DCJ …    But given …    Circumstances …    When one learns of …    Evidence that might implicate a person …    On the morning effectively five minutes …    Before the beginning …    It is impossible …    That one would be able to put that in writing.    Now this – the Rule as I have read talks about the statement …    Of the witness likely to implicate the implicated person.    Notice of the statement being given.    It does not say notice of evidence …    Being given.    So it is to the statement …    That the implicated person is to respond.    The reason I make this submission is this Mr Pretorius in his second option that Mr Nxasana may testify on all and sundry including evidence - as I understand it – evidence that may implicate Ms Jiba subject to Ms Jiba been given an opportunity in due course to come and place her own version before the Commission.  Now the Rules 3.3 to 3.5 as I have read it does not seem to me to countenance such a proposition because it deals with statement.  It does not with evidence and if a witness is permitted to make or to give evidence that implicates a witness who has not been given notice and then is given an opportunity to come and place evidence later the damage is long done because as we all know we are all members of society.  We watch television.  We read newspapers.  Whatever is said by a witness especially in this Commission - at least it has been my observation – is any allegation - not even proven evidence - any allegation that is made against a person is taken by society to the truth before it is even tested and so by the time in due course Ms Jiba comes to test that evidence it is too late.  Now Chairperson there is a fear that the legal team and Ms Jiba has and I appreciate your explanation of how Mr Nxasana came to testify today.  It is the timing of the evidence the concern is that the President has relieved Ms Jiba of her duties as the Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions but that that decision still needs to be considered by the National Assembly.  Now there is a debate about whether the National Assembly needs to approve the President’s decision or it is simply a rubber stamp.  I have not studied that but it certainly has to be considered by the National  Assembly and so the fear is that any evidence that implicates Ms Jiba without her having been given prior notice may colour those considerations by members of the National Assembly.  We do not know yet when the National Assembly will consider this.  We have the State of the Nation Address coming up in a couple of days’ time.  I do not imagine that is a platform for this sort of thing to happen.  So in short Deputy Chief Justice we without having taken instructions but I imagine this might be a practical way to go about it.  The first option that Mr Pretorius suggested which is to lead Mr Nxasana in evidence except the evidence of the implicated people who have not been given notice.  There was one last thing which I forget now.  Well if I forget it could not have been that important.    DCJ unless there are …    Other questions that you want to put to me those are my submissions for now.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No thank you DCJ.  Deputy Chief Justice that thought has come back to me while you were just (intervenes).    It is the extent of the evidence that Mr Nxasana now maybe led on by Mr Pretorius.  There has been a suggestion that if the evidence covers matters that are already in the public domain or matters that have already been dealt with in …    Affidavits and in judgments.   That Ms Jiba would have had an  opportunity to deal with those in any event.  So they should be no impediment to Mr Nxasana testifying to those issues.  The difficulty with that ordinarily I have – I would have no difficulty with it but the difficulty in these circumstances …    Is I do not know what evidence he is going to testify to …    That is already in the public domain.    That is the one thing and so …    One needs to do to perform this exercise of looking …    At what is already in the public domain to which Mr Nxasana will testify to …    And so one would not raise any objection.    So the exercise that needs to be performed is look at what is in the public domain and what is new.    Standing now here before you I do not know what is new what is in the public domain …     And so …    It seems to be …    Reasonable and practical to allow the legal team to perform that exercise.    Had we known that Mr Nxasana is going to be testifying today.    We probably would have performed that exercise already.    We cannot now be …    Penalised …    And be expected to sit in the Commission.  I could sit …    On a watching brief …    To listen to what is been led to …    But since I do not know what is already in the public domain I cannot stand up and object or tug my learned friend by the sleeve of his jacket and say well hang on a second.    That is not in the public domain because I do not know …    And so Deputy Chief Justice I would request …    That the first option that Mr Pretorius suggested …    Which is and I would add this …    That that evidence should subtract any evidence that implicates Mr Nxasana with it is in the public domain or not.    Ms – did I say?    Oh I am sorry.  Mr Nxasana does not seem to here implicate.  Any evidence that implicates Ms Jiba should be held back.  I am not saying it should excised or not dealt with.  It should be held back.  The opportunity for dealing with such evidence at this forum  will come.  It may be next week.  I do not know what the – what the schedule of the Commission is.  It may be next week.  It may be in two weeks’ time.    By that time …    The legal team for Ms Jiba would have performed all these exercises …    And therefore …    The matter can continue without any discomfort from …    Ms Jiba’s team.    Yes Deputy Chief Justice far be it for me to doubt my learned friend Mr Pretorius’ intentions …    Or integrity – I even hesitate to bring in the word integrity.    I am quite confident that …    He will do precisely that and steer off …    Away from new matters.    Might it not be a sort of belt and racist job …    To request Mr Pretorius to when he puts such questions to Mr Nxasana that have previously been or dealing with matters that are previously of reason …    On affidavit or in judgments …    Perhaps prefix the question.  I know it may be a tough ask …    Because he maybe he did not prepare it that way.    To prefix the question with Mr Nxasana in the matter of so and so in the judgment without citing a particular paragraph …    This matter was dealt with can I ask you this question then ask him or …    In a particular affidavit in a matter this was dealt with …    So that when I keep my note …    I know exactly which judgment to go to …     To satisfy myself and the legal team …    That that matter was indeed – had indeed been dealt with previously and that it is not new.    Yes.    Yes.    No I am happy with that.    Yes.    Thank you Deputy Chair. 
CHAIRPESON:  Hm.
