CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.      Yes are we ready?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes I assume you have briefed them – his legal team about the – the discussion yesterday in their absence?    They are aware of it.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Ja.  Ja.  We have taken longer with previous witnesses than was anticipated and we are now on Friday having had – having heard only two witnesses Mr Myburgh is that right from Monday?  We have had only two witnesses?    Ja so the – we find ourselves at the end of the week with more witnesses who were scheduled to give evidence this week.  We had a discussion in your absence yesterday with regard to what should happen whether it should be Mr Gigaba who would take the witness stand this morning or Mr Singh and it seems that we should that Mr Singh take the witness stand this morning particularly because we are aware that there are some new developments which Mr Gigaba might wish to have time to look at so that when he takes the witness stand he can deal with all matters including recent ones. So – but I said arrangements should be made for you to be here this morning so that we should not just discuss in your absence and finalise things and we should hear if you have anything to say but that is what we propose to do. Counsel for Mr Gigaba would you like to say something?  You can speak from where you are if your microphone is working and that is convenient otherwise you can go to the podium after they have sanitised.    Yes.    Good morning to you.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, no that is fine.  I said developments maybe that is not the right term but Mr Myburgh would share with you what I am talking about.  Maybe it is just a matter not a development.  But thank you for your cooperation we – I appreciate that it is not the best arrangement where you wait for a whole week you have a legal team ready and then you are not able to be heard.  But obviously we are just trying to do the best we can in a very difficult situation where there are very serious time constraints.  So we – we appreciate your cooperation. We are going to fix a date soon.  The approach we adopt is that if we are going to fix a date that we think is within a short space of time we will – the legal team will negotiate those dates but if we think we are giving you reasonable time we will just fix the dates.  But I have no doubt that all attempts will be done by everybody to try and make things happen.  Thank you for your understanding.    Thank you very much.  Okay.  To the extent that you may need to be excused you are excused.    Okay.      Okay.  I think that is fine.  I am sure they have no problem ja – we are at about twelve minutes to ten shall we make it half past ten – half past ten?    No I am sorry.  Ja half past ten.  Okay.  Okay we will adjourn until half past ten. We adjourn.     Did that help Mr Myburgh.     Okay, okay, okay.     Yes.     Good morning.     Thank you very much.     Thank you.  Okay Mr Myburgh.     I think administer the oath, registrar, or affirmation.       Thank you.  You may be seated Mr Singh. ADV MYBURGH     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  That will be dealt with at some other time?     Okay alright.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And the remark will not implicate anybody?     [laughs]  Okay alright.     Mr Myburgh, is this the right time for him to do that?     Yes.     Yes, okay alright.  Mr Singh.     Let me make sure I follow that.  You would like to make some statement at some stage during the proceeding?     Not today?     Okay.  Some stage?     Ja, okay after I have been given the documents?     Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.  Okay. ADV MYBURGH     Just one second.  Registrar.  Yes, Mr Myburgh.       There is file that I need which apparently is not here but that is not a file that you would have known about.  I am sure there is another one but I just want one on which I have worked which will be much more... to look at that.     But we can proceed in the meantime.       Ja.     The affidavit of Mr Anoj Singh, starting at page 436 is admitted and it will be marked as Exhibit 23.3.1. FIRST AFFIDAVIT OF ANOJ SINGH IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT 23.3.1     Yes?     Yes.     Okay what is the correct date? ADV MYBURGH     Oh, that is the date of the affidavit?     Okay.  No, no.  That is fine.     Hang on, hang on.  Oh, I think there are two affidavits following each other.     Ja, okay alright.     The affidavit of Mr Anoj Singh that starts at page 469 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit 23.3.2. SECOND AFFIDAVIT OF ANOJ SINGH IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT 23.3.2     BB...?     The affidavit of Mr Anoj Singh together with its annexures is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB-23.6. SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT WITH ANNEXURES OF ANOJ SINGH IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB-23.6     The supplementary affidavit of Mr Anoj Singh that starts at page 1431 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit 23.7. FURTHER SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT OF ANOJ SINGH IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB-23.7     Speak up a bit Mr Singh.     Yes.     Cultural.     Religious.  Oh, yes, ja.     Over what period?       I think we are asking the same question, ja.      Over what period?     H’m?     H’m?     I am sorry, was not?     Oh, okay.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, the issue of documents that he says have not been provided to them, do you know anything about that, but he says in relation to witness 3 there are still some documents that the Commission has not provided to him.     Oh.     Oh.  Mr Singh, did I misunderstand you?  I though you said in relation to witness 3 there are still some documents that you have not been provided with by the Commission.     Oh.     The one that you say – or that was admitted on the date he testified?     Yes.     Was after.     Ja.     Yes and you have been waiting for that for quite some time?     Well, let – well, sometimes what I know and what the legal team knows and what the investigation team knows are different things because I am the last one to know certain things because of the way the Commission works.  The investigators will have information, then that information will go the legal team, things will come to me only when they are ripe for that but as far as I know, there ought to be only one affidavit relating to each one of the three witnesses except for any supplementary affidavit that may have been provided by anyone to them but the ruling of course was to the effect that their affidavits should be redacted but I – if it is the same – if it is a redacted affidavit of the previous affidavit then there should not be a problem and, in any event, somebody should be able to explain to Mr Singh’s team, legal team, if the position is simply that the affidavit that was given to him had to be redone.  It was still the – it was the previous one but maybe had to be redone and deposed to afresh after – for purposes of redaction. Mr Pretorius should know something about that.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Ja, I think it is something that should – can be sorted out, there may be just some I misunderstanding and maybe your junior might, while you are busy, try and get whatever clarification is necessary including speaking to the evidence leader at the time, Mr Pretorius, and then sharing information with Mr Singh’s legal team.  There may be just some I misunderstanding.     Is your suggestion that to the extent that in his affidavit witness 3 talks about taking you to the Gupta residence, one, that is false and two, it must be that he has given that false evidence because of the pressure that he says was brought to bear upon him by Transnet people and Commission people?     Okay.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh?     If you do not mention the telephone call that you had with witness 3 and you do not mention the pressure in your affidavit, may I know what is – whether in your affidavit you say what reason witness 3 had to effectively falsely implicate you in visits to the Gupta residence?     You deal with it, ja, but it is different from pressure and the telephone call conversation.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     Yes.     Ja.  No, that is fine.  I was undecided about taking the tea adjournment because we had that time.     Is it fine with everybody if we skip the tea adjournment?  Mr Singh, is that fine with you?     Counsel?     Okay, Mr Myburgh …[intervenes]     In due course.     Ja, okay.     No, that is fine, ja.   Are we going to continue in the meantime or we will wait for – oh, there it is.  Registrar …[intervenes]     Okay, thank you.     Yes.     Yes, we can refer to it as the 12 March 21 affidavit of Mr Singh, ja.     It looks like you may have been mistaken, Mr Singh, in saying that in the affidavit you do give a reason why witness 3 would falsely implicate you in these visits.  Of course I am only looking at it as Mr Myburgh is reading, I do not know if I have missed anything.  Other than denying that what he has said is true, I do not seem to have picked up any specific reason that you may be advancing why he would fabricate all these stories.     Question, yes.     Yes.     Okay, no, that is alright.  Thank you, Mr Myburgh?     Well, I see that I think in a paragraph that Mr Myburgh is still going to come to if I am not wrong, that witness 3 when he estimates how many times he took you to the Gupta residence and he also refers to ten.  He says, he thinks he must – but he says more than ten times, you said he must have gone there for cultural/religious function maximum ten times, it is just interesting that you used ten and he uses ten.     Yes, I see he uses six or seven in relation to the visits to the Knox Vault but maybe some where he also uses another number other than more than ten in relation to the visits to the Gupta residence.     It is somewhere.     Ja, okay.     Yes, okay Mr Myburgh.     Well, let us assume like all of us, well, maybe not all of us but some of us there are occasions when your wallet does not have enough cash and you need to pay for something or to give somebody a certain amount and you look at your wallet and it has got too little in it. If that was the case and you knew there was a bag in the boot that had cash.  Why would you have to drive to an ATM instead of using the cash that is in the boot?     No, but on his version, you had money in the boot, is it not?     If the cash is in the boot one would - assuming his version is correct for purposes of this argument.  I do not understand why you would not have said oh there is not enough money here and then use the money in the boot.     Yes, no it is one thing to say the version is not correct but I thought you were attacking it on the basis that this version, you know, has this flaw I would not use cash in the boot, I would use cash in my wallet, if I did not have enough cash in the wallet or enough cash then I would not offer the lunch.      Okay, alright Mr Myburgh.     Was it half a metre?     Oh, 30 centimetres, is that more or less about the length, what is the length…[intervene]     So you say the height was about 30 centimetres?     The height would be the depth.     I am sorry, what was that answer?      Yes, would - I guess maybe one could ask, what kind of amount do you recall having deposited there at some or other stage?     And what would be the biggest amount that you even deposited there that you can recall?     Small amounts?    And the R100 000,00 might have been the biggest or not - you do not know?     Ja, there could have been an amount higher than that or lower?     Okay, alright and the period when you kept – you had these boxes there would it have been from when to when if you are able to say?     Okay, no I may have missed that, okay thank you Mr Myburgh.     Remember to speak closer to the mic.     I am sorry, that was a yes, I think you nodded.     That will not be recorded, so I think your answer was yes.     Ja.     I am sorry Mr Myburgh so going back to the rent you paid for these boxes or each one of these boxes per year.  Would it be fair to say, if you were paying I think you said about 2000 something rand for each per year.  So it would be 2000 something times four?     So that that is what you would pay for it, so it was probably between eight and R10 000,00.     No, no I accept that I just wanted to - so that is what more or less you think you were paying as rent for the boxes annually.     Did you ever talk to him about your deposit boxes at Knox Vault?     And you would not discuss personal or private …[intervenes]     …matters.   So as far as you know he did not know that you had these deposit boxes at Knox Vault?    Okay.  Alright Mr Myburgh. ADV MYBURGH    And you went there once a month.    Hm.  You see how it – how it looks I mean.    Just hang on one second.      He comes up with his version which you say is a fabrication.  It includes going to the Gupta residence, those visits and it includes him saying on certain occasions he will take you to Knox Vault.  Now I assume there are a number of businesses which do the same business as Knox Vault.  He says he would take there to say that is fabrication but on your version it so happens that indeed you do have not one box – deposit box but four at Knox Vault.  It so happens on your version that actually you do visit – you did visit Knox Vault regularly once a month your estimate.  On your version it must be such a coincidence.    I think that is what Mr Myburgh is raising with you.    Mr Myburgh.    Hm.    Hm.    Are you saying somebody within the commission must have told Witness 3 to say that he used to take you to Knox Vaults because that person in the commission was aware that somebody else had kept deposit boxes at Vault Knox is that what you are saying?    Are you saying he was spoon fed by somebody in the commission to make this false allegation against you?    And you think – you think there is somebody in the commission who just had something against you so much that they would ask somebody to falsely implicate you in these visits to Vault Knox – Knox Vault?    Hm.      Mr Myburgh.    Ja the – I mean the effect of what Mr Myburgh is putting to you is that contrary to what you say because you – you were suggesting that it would only have been after…    Yes.    Okay but you must tell me if you cannot hear me.  What Mr Myburgh is putting to you based on what the investigator is saying is that contrary to what you are saying which is that the commission Witness 3 must have been given information by somebody in the commission about Knox Vaults and your involvement with them.  The information that he is putting to you is that the investigator is saying actually the person who – from whom the commission heard for the first time about the Knox Vaults was Witness 3 so which suggests it seems to me that the discovery of the individual or individuals that you were talking about in respect for whom there was – there were legal proceedings and so on came either at the same time or after but Witness 3 was the first person to tell the investigators about Knox Vaults and so on.    Yes.    I am.    Yes.    Yes.    No I think that – I think that things happen in this way because Mr Singh is making this allegation for the first time that the commission – somebody in the commission must have fed this information to Witness 3.  But what would be legitimate is for you to say the investigator who has given Mr Myburgh the information should go on affidavit under oath to pro – I think that would be legitimate.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja it would be provided.  But as I say you know I think Mr Singh is making this allegation for the first time.  If the – if he had made it before I am sure the legal team would have explored the option of getting an affidavit from the investigators.    Yes.    Ja no, no that is fine.  Okay Mr Myburgh.    Okay I am sorry.  Just remember Mr Singh nodding is not good enough.    Ja if you want to say yes you just say yes.    Ja.    So he must have on your version he must have sat down and fabricated all of these stories you went to the Gupta’s, you went in, when you came back he was upset and then got into the car said put off the radio and then fell asleep.  He must have sat down and say how am I going to frame Mr Singh, fabricate a story and he went to this extent of all of these details?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes but that does not necessarily mean you were instructed.  You might have decided.    After the call.    Ja.    Hm.  Hm.  Mr Myburgh.    Ja but I am sorry.  Was he not saying whether he would have said he had been approached by Transnet or had been approached by the commission or he – whether he was saying he was volunteering to give some information to the commission but was he not in effect saying I may soon be making a statement or affidavit to the commission that may talk about when I was driving you.  Well in effect was he not saying that?    Hm.    Asking for guidance.    Oh okay.    But you say you had a good relationship with him.    Ja okay.     I think we must take a five minutes adjournment.    Let us adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    So as far as Transnet is concerned is your version that for the Witness 3 to frame you like this it must mean that somebody or some people at Transnet must have put pressure on him to say things about you that he told them were not true.    And he – he – they put pressure and he did this because he thought his job would be in danger.    Oh okay.  Let me repeat.  So I am asking whether what you are saying is that insofar as Transnet is concerned Witness 3 would have framed you like this if somebody at Transnet or some people at Transnet put pressure on him to falsely implicate you even if he told them that these things that they would have said he must say about you did not happen.    Okay.    I think we must take the lunch break.      Ja.  We will adjourn until two.     Okay let us continue.     Mr Myburgh, I omitted to say, today we will not be able to go beyond four o’clock as we normally do.     [laughs]  And ...[intervenes]      Yes, okay alright.  So maybe around quarter to ten to four we can adjourn.     Okay alright.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  We will take a short adjournment. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.     Well, I do not know if Mr Myburgh had finished his question or proposition.  I...  Do you want to repeat it Mr Myburgh?  Let me hear what it is.     H’m.     H’m?     Maybe let me put it this way.  Mr Singh, you have said that you and Witness 3 had – were on good terms, a very good – had a cordial relationship.  Is that right?     Do you know of any reason why he would want to portray you in such a bad light with regard to the Gupta family, your alleged relationship with them and say that you visited them and came out with bags, I think he says and you must just correct me if I am missing on, which later on I think he says he, at least on one occasion, found that money and that you – he visited with you or you visited Knox Vault when in fact there was – there were no such visits at all?   Or is the answer the one you gave earlier, namely, you think that somebody within the Commission fed him information and influence him to falsely implicate you in this.  There may be somebody in Transnet pressured him to make these false allegations against you?     H’m, h’m.     H’m?     H’m.  And maybe if you do have a name or names, do not mention them now.  Maybe you can look at – we can look at the names later.  Is there somebody at Transnet that you think would really want you to be falsely implicated by Witness 3 in things that you were not involved in?  Do you know somebody who would really desire that at Transnet?     You do not have a name?     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     H’m, h’m.     H’m?     I do not know whether Mr Myburgh you...     Ja.  H’m, h’m.     So you raise the question how he may have known ...[intervenes]      ...all of these people?     Ja, okay.  H’m.  You are obviously not in a position to positively say he did not know them then but you are just raising an issue to say it would be interesting to know how he knew people that, as far as you are concerned, were not in the public eye?     But was she not the Chairperson of Transnet at the time?     She became ...[intervenes]      After?     Okay.  Okay.  Was that the only point?     Oh, okay.  Okay thank you, thank you.       I think it might be useful to get Witness 3 to comment on the point raised.     And maybe by way of an affidavit.     Ja, ja.   Mr Myburgh, at some stage you intimated that Mr Singh’s affidavit for today might be admitted after lunch or something?     Yes, okay.  You wanted it to be admitted as an exhibit?     Now or later?  As long as you do not forget this.  You might do it later if that is convenient.     Ja.     Ja, okay.     What is the page number again?     Ja, okay.     Well, one gets the impression from your answer here that it was not an oversight on your part, not to give this information because you had been asked to indicate how many times you may have visited the Gupta residence and what the reasons were for your visits.  Your answer seems to object to being asked those questions.      Well ...[intervenes]      Yes-no, but the – this is a directive.  It seeks certain information and in his answer he does say ad paragraph 1.12 of the Regulation 10.6 Directive.  Is not an answer to an affidavit.  It is a question that is being put by the Chairperson to – through a directive to get information as part of the Commission’s investigation.  You understand that?     Do you want to say anything about my     Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     Actually...  I am sorry.  Actually,     H’m, h’m.  Yes, Mr Myburgh.     But of course, I am sure you accept that     H’m.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh.     That is fine, ja.  That is fine.     Mr Anoj Singh’s affidavit starting at page 1507 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB-23.8. ANOJ SINGH’S AFFIDAVIT STARTING AT PAGE 1507 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB-23.8.     Somebody must just help the witness, please.     You might wish to repeat the bundle Mr Myburgh.  I think your attorney might not have heard it.     Did you say 21 or 31?     Okay.  So you will go to 31, that is where your questions ...[intervenes]      Okay, I have 31.     Yes, use the black numbers.  Check on the spine whether it is the correct one.     Okay let us start afresh.  Mr Singh, the first thing is to check if it is the right bundle and you will see that on the spine where it says, this one is Transnet Bundle 4.  Transnet Bundle 4.  And then you will go to the right page.     And I think the right page 31.  Have you got it?     Have you got it, the black 31?     Sorry?     Oh.     A break?     Okay alright.  Let us adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Are you feeling better, Mr Singh?     Okay, alright, let us continue, Mr Myburgh.     Well, the question is what do you have to say about the statement by Mr Hank Bester that Mr Basson told him that you wanted the confinement approval condition included which debated that PM Africa and DEC should form part of the SD component.  You have said that there is no confirmatory affidavit by Basson, is that where you stopped or you would say yes, I know about that, I did speak to Basson or you say you did not say that to Basson?     Okay, so the answer is yes, you did make that statement but you are saying you are providing the context with which you made.     Well, maybe I should say this in fairness to you, Mr Singh.  You see, when you said Mr Basson had not provided a confirmatory affidavit it came across as you were denying, you were going to dispute that you made that statement …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Well, the question is whether when you read paragraph 18 of Mr Bierman’s affidavit with the quotation of that message, you say a Whatsapp message.     You cannot hear me?     I am sorry.  You see, I am used to a situation where my – everybody hears me because my voice is rather loud but lately there have been complaints that I cannot be heard, so - okay.  No, I was saying Mr Myburgh’s question to you was whether you do not concede that a reading of paragraph 18 of Mr Bierman’s affidavit with that quotation of a Whatsapp message you do not concede that appears that you had spoken to him about designating a specific company as a subcontractor or SD, Just from the message in that paragraph.     Well, the second sentence says    Why do they want to strange him?  It would seem on the face of it that it is because of the view which is contained – which he refers to in his second sentence because of the view that a specific company must be designated as SD or subcontractor.       Since he is writing to you…     It gives the impression, prima facie at least to me that he is writing to you because you are the one who may have wanted that a specific company be designated as SD.  So the question from Mr Myburgh was whether you do not concede that a reading of this message such as that.     The second sentence.     Yes.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     No, I think Mr Myburgh what he is asking is when you say – when you ask him whether he does not accept that this evidence reflects very – reflects an abuse of the system, I think he wants to know abuse by whom.   I think you wanted to know abuse by whom?  Is that right?     Ja, okay.     Hang on, we are going back to Mr Bester ’s one.     I am sorry, Mr Singh, is it true or is not true that the matter was elevated to you and you were going to consider and you consider the matter closed?     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     To adjourn, ja no I think let us adjourn, Mr Molefe is done except a very limited portion of his evidence that we must still deal with then Mr Singh still has quite a lot to deal with. What is your estimate of how much time you would need with Mr Singh ...[intervenes]      About two days, okay, no that is fine.  I will try and two days somewhere.     Oh yes Mr Gama too, and what is our estimate?     Two days, okay, I will have to do a miracle and find ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja, no, no I think everybody is cooperative about the evenings as well.  Counsel for Mr Singh?     Yes, ja, okay no that is fine.  I am sure it is the same with you Mr Singh?      Yes okay, I will try and make sure the dates are sorted out as soon as possible. Thank you to everybody, we will adjourn for the day, just for the benefit of the public on Monday there will be no hearing but on Tuesday and the days after that next week there will be evidence relating to Eskom. We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Yes thank you.  Chairperson the first business of the day is Mr Gigaba and his Counsel are here.    I think it was indicated yesterday that the hearing of his evidence would be postponed.    I assume you want to set a date or address him and his Counsel.    Yes I think they are aware of the discussion.    I had a brief discussion with Mr Solomons I cannot say that I acquired – it was very lengthy I hope I conveyed to him.    That Mr Gigaba would not be giving evidence today.    And that he will be setting another date.    Because I – I think that is correct.  It seems like a lot more but it has only been two yes.    Mr Chairperson the next order of the day is the evidence of Mr Singh.  Might I just say this?  On Wednesday we received a short supplementary affidavit from Mr Singh but it included over 400 pages of annexures pleadings in a series of civil claims.  Yesterday we received a 70 page supplementary affidavit from Mr Singh.  We also received three emails that may impact upon the proceedings today.  And then this morning we received another 30 page supplementary affidavit from Mr Singh together with what I understand is an expert report. Now we need to make our position very clear we are not objecting to this in fact up until today and I hope it continues we have had a very constructive relationship with Mr Singh and his legal advisors for which we are thankful.  But you will appreciate Chair that we need to consider this new material simply with a view to determining what should be left out today and what should be dealt with next time.  We hope that that is something that we can do in half hour or an hour but I think it would – it would be appropriate if we could be afforded that time otherwise I might start dealing with issues that give rise to objections and we go around and around the mulberry bush I am very sorry to ask but if we could have maybe a half an hour adjournment I think it probably speed up things.    Thank you Chairperson.     Chairperson, Mr Singh is legally represented.  I wonder whether you would like his counsel to place herself on record before we proceed further?     Yes, Chair.     There is also, Chairperson, an agreement that – and we will not refer to certain limited documentation and that we will not refer to one or two specific affidavits.       What we then intend to deal with today is, of course, something to that three topics relating to Mr Singh’s personal circumstances.  We will explore any relationship that he might have had with the Gupta’s.  We intend to deal with Witness 3, the driver.  We intend to deal with certain contextual topics, like, the MDS, BADC and the Delegation of Authority. Then we will leave out the locomotives and we will then to auxiliary things, like for example, the Neotel contracts, the Manganese Expansion Project, Mr Gama’s legal fees, Abalozi and that sort of thing but you are not going to be hearing anything about the locomotives.     Yes, once we have had an opportunity to look through the affidavit and then we will come and deal with that specifically.     I have discussed this with my learned friend.  I am satisfied that he does not intend to implicate anyone.  So we are happy.     Subject to your direction for him to do that now.     Thank you.       Certainly.     Alright.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh, could I ask you to turn to page 436, please?     There you will find an affidavit if you turn forward.  That affidavit runs from 436 to page 468 and it appears to have been deposed to on the 26 t h of January 2020.  That you will see at the foot of page 467.  Would you confirm that?     And would you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Chairperson, may I ask you to admit Mr Singh’s affidavit that commences at page 436 as Exhibit 23.3.1?     I beg your pardon.     Yes.     Mr Singh, if you can ...[intervenes]      Yes, I will come to the second one.     Mr Singh, could I ask you, please, to turn now to page 469?     There you will find another affidavit that runs from 469 through to 484.     And it appears at 484 and hopefully I will get the year right this time.  It was deposed to on the 2 n d of February 2021.  Do you confirm that?     And you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Chairperson, could I ask you, please, to admit Mr Singh’s affidavit that commences at page 469 as Exhibit 23.3.2?     Mr Singh, could I then ask you, please to turn forward to page 1013?     Thank you.  You will see that at 1013 the supplementary affidavit commences.  It is relatively short.  It runs up until 1051.     It contains a large number of annexures, pleadings in a number of cases.  Those annexures run all the way up to 1430.  Can I ask you to confirm that, please?  So up until 1430.     Could I then ask you, please, to go back to page 1015 and ask you, please, to confirm that this supplementary affidavit was deposed to you by on the  t h  of March 2012?     Can you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Mr Chairperson, could I ask you to admit Mr Singh’s affidavit commences at page 1013 as Exhibit BB-23.6?     23.6.     Mr Singh, could I then ask you, finally, to turn, please, to page 1431?     That is the further supplementary affidavit that commences there and ends at page 1501.  It has a few annexures.  Those annexures run up until 1505.  Would you confirm that?     I beg your pardon.  It is in fact 1506.  I see there is a page at the back.  Thank you.  If you could go back, please, to page 1501.  Would you confirm that you deposed to this affidavit on the 10 t h of March 2021?     And would you confirm the truth and accuracy of the affidavit?     Chairperson, I would ask that you admit Mr Singh’s further supplementary affidavit commencing at page 1431 as Exhibit 23.7.       Thank you.  Mr Singh, I would like to just start out by asking you one or two questions about your personal details.  Am I understanding correct that you were the acting CFO of Transnet for a period of time?     2009 to 2012?     And you were then appointed as the CFO of Transnet, as I understand, on the 1 s t of July 2012.  Is that correct?     And you then continued in that position until you moved to Eskom.     When was that move?     Were you initially seconded to Eskom?     So that secondment took up or took place on the 1 s t of August 2015?     As we understand it, Mr Molefe’s secondment to Eskom preceded yours by three or four months.  Does that accord with your recollection?     Yes.     Yes.     I hold a Bachelor of Accounting Degree from the University of Durban Westville at the time.  I also hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting from the same said university ...[intervenes]      And I am sorry.  Mr Singh, one other thing.  Perhaps I should have told you before.  I will ask you the questions, if you can direct your answers to the Chairperson?     It is more important for him to hear than me and I am sitting closer to you.     Alright.  So let us start again.  Your qualifications?     Just one other introductory point.  Are you in a position to be able to confirm that after you moved to Eskom, your successor was Mr Pita as the CFO?     Could we turn to the topic of your relationship, if any, with the Gupta’s.  Could I ask you, have you ever had an occasion to go to the Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s?     And when you say on occasion.  How many occasions?     Yes.  Well, the first question I asked you is.  On how many occasions did you go to the Gupta residence?     But I am sorry.  Perhaps I did not get the first part of your answer.  I recall you saying you attend religious functions.  I think you mentioned that you also had occasion to go there for other reasons?     Oh, I beg your pardon.  Culture.     Cultural and religious...  So those – that was the cause of you going to the Gupta residence and you say you estimate about ten times?     And over what period ...[intervenes]      I beg your pardon?     [laughs]     So you started going there in 2011 or 2012?     Yes.     And then you continued to go there occasionally.  Up until when?     And what caused you to stop going there in 2015 or so?     Now did you have occasion to reciprocate?  Did you ever invite the Gupta’s out for dinner or to your house or was it only you going to theirs?     And which member of the Gupta family would you interact with on these occasions that you attended the Saxonwold residence?     And let me then turn to...  Well, perhaps I could just ask you.  These cultural and religious functions that you attended, would they typically be after hours, on the weekends?  Obviously, on any particular religious day.     Alright.  Did you, Mr Singh, have occasion to visit the offices of Sahara Computers?     So you say your current wife worked at Sahara Computers?     For what period of time was that?     And just so that I understand your evidence.  Do I understand that you would go there to fetch her.  I mean, you say you did not go into the office.     Okay.  So you never, if I understand your evidence correctly, you never entered the offices of Sahara Computers?     And then Mr Essa.  Did you have occasion to meet him?     So where did you meet with Mr Essa on these one or two occasions?     Perhaps Melrose Arch?     And you say that these one or two meetings occurred at Mr Essa’s request?     To discuss, if I my note of your evidence is right, business opportunities at Transnet?     Now what sort of things did you discuss there with Mr Essa during these one or two meetings?     But can you not recall the topic or content of the meetings?     But what company did Mr Essa purport to work for or represent?     I would like now, please, to take you to the evidence of Witness 3.  If I could ask you, please Mr Singh, to turn behind you and to pull out Bundle BB-14(d).     [No audible reply]      BB-14(d).     And if I could ask you, please, to turn up page 122?     I think there is only one number.  Ja, if it – there is only one number.  So I think I have referred to the red ones here, yes.     122.     Now Mr Singh, no doubt you had careful regard to this affidavit and the evidence of Witness 3?     Now the affidavit deals - has two parts to it.  Firstly, it deals with Mr Gigaba and the CPO services rendered to him and then in the second part if I could ask you to go to page 127, it deals with the CPO services rendered to you and that runs from page 127 through to 132, five pages or so.     Paragraph 30    2014?     So you have it as him having started to provide those services in about March of 2014?     And continued up until when Mr Singh?     So that takes us into?     Then at paragraph 31 witness 3     At paragraph 32    Paragraph 33    Paragraph 34    Paragraph 35 he says    Then he says a 35.1    “In instances – at paragraph 36, Singh  would drive to the office with his private vehicle, a blue BMW M3 on Monday mornings and on Friday afternoons, he would travel home with his vehicle. The vehicle would be parked in the basement of the Carlton Centre during the week.” You confirm that?     “Now Singh’s visits to the Gupta  residence and Knox Vault.” What do you know about Knox Vault, what is it?     And if we thinking of the same thing I see it there opposite the Killarney Mall at the old American embassy I think it is.     Paragraph 37    So do I understand your evidence correctly you say witness 3 never took you to Saxonwold?     Those ten odd occasions or approximate ten odd occasions that you went there, would my understanding be correct you attend cultural and religious functions you would have driven in your own car?      Yes, of course you also vacillate on the number of times you went to the Gupta residence to attend - and I do not mean that in a pejorative way, but you say five, ten, ten maybe more maybe less.     Yes, absolutely, at paragraph 38    39    But Mr Singh how does that help you, you say it did not happen at all.     Would a better description of the bag change your defence?     Alright, at paragraph 40    40?     Yes, thank you.  Now, before we get to this issue of Knox Vault’s.  Did you have a safety deposit box at Knox Vault?     And how many did you have?     And how large were these safety deposit boxes that you had four of?      So you went presumably and can you estimate for us, show us?     So would that be say 15 centimetres by 40 centimetres, 60 centimetres?     Please, can you speak close to the mic?      Right.      And then long, and the other one?     So there was a bigger one.      And you say relatively long, are we talking 90 centimetres a meter?     So how high what was the depth of the second box 30 centimetres, 40 centimetres.     Of a ruler.     And the depth?     And what would you estimate that?     60?     So 30 by 50, somewhere along there., sorry if need to take you back.  So that was the safety deposit box two, the first one you said was smaller than that.     Okay.     So let us go - alright, so you had four boxes of varying sizes, you have described the one size to us, 30 by 50, and did you have all four boxes at the same time?     And how much did you pay now to rent these four boxes from Knox Vault on a monthly basis?     Well are they - you would presumably be able to estimate, is it expensive to hire these and especially four of them?     A year?     R2 500,00 not a month?     So Mr Singh…[intervene]     Each?     Per year?     Bur you are going to come back and give evidence presumably this is something that you could look into for us and perhaps look at your records, and then determine what it is that you paid.  I mean, I presume you conclude a contract with an entity like Knox Vaults.  It is quite a serious thing to hire your safety deposit box presumably there is a lot of protocol and paperwork, is that so?     And for how long did you then have these four safety deposit boxes at Knox Vault?     So what years did you have these boxes?     Until 2016, did you say?     Right, and what is it that you did with these boxes, why did you need four of them?     And cash?     How much cash?     Thank you, Mr Singh, I am not familiar with this sort of thing.  I have a safe at home, just explain to me what it is that you needed to - why did you need four of these boxes?   What is it that you were keeping in these four boxes?     And…[intervene]     Why was it not sufficient to keep those things at home in a safe, a typical safe?     And how often would you go then to Knox Vault?     What do you mean by that?     Once a month, so approximately 12 times…[intervene]     So that would be 12 times or so a year, is that right?      And then what caused you to give up these four safety deposit boxes in 2016 or 2017.     And you going to provide details of the rental costs of these boxes when you come back?     You could also make inquiries via Knox Vault.       Alright, so let us go to paragraph 41     So just so that we have it on the record your estimate, as you sit here now, is these four boxes did not cost you more than R10 000,00 a year for all of them?     But Mr Singh, do you want to revise that figure or is that the best you can do?      So let us then go to paragraph 41    “Singh would then take the full bag  from the boot of our vehicle and go into the Knox Vault building whilst I would wait for him in the vehicle in the parking area.  After a few minutes, he would return to the vehicle and I could see that the bag that he carried was now empty.  I suspected that Singh had deposited the contents in a safe at Knox Vault.” You want to comment on that?     Did witness 3 ever take you to Knox Vault?    But Mr Singh it should be quite a coincidence it seems that you had a series of boxes at Knox Vault.    You went there once a month, you did not tell you say your driver about this but somehow he comes up with this paragraph 41 it seems quite coincidental.    Yes certainly Chair.      Yes thank you.  Just before we move on can I ask you this?  You say at a point in time you might have kept up to R100 000.00 at Knox Vault you recall that evidence?    Where did that money come from?    Some moonlighting?    For cash?    While you were the Group Chief Financial Officer of Transnet?    Well you were appointed as the Chief Financial Officer on the 1s t of July 2013 and you as I understand it took up a facility at Knox Vault in 2013, correct?    Alright.  The – the investigator that the commission’s investigator that was involved in relation to the Drivers has just sent me a Whatsapp to say and we can confirm this if necessary that the commission learnt about Knox Vault from Witness 3.  The first time the commission heard about Knox Vault I do not suppose you can comment on that?      Yes certainly.    I think I had mentioned that of course      It is not just a Whatsapp Mr Pierre Leonard is sitting in the gallery.      And sent it to me he would be in a position to confirm that immediately.      But if you want an affidavit DCJ of course we would do that.    Thank you.  And then at paragraph 42    Incidentally Mr Singh perhaps and I am sure we can get the exact distance but how far is it from Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s to the Knox Vault?  Not far?    How long would it take you to drive there?    Five or ten minutes.  Do you know of any…    Five or ten minutes.  Do you know of any equivalent facility closer to the Gupta residence?    And then just one last question on this.  You say you had occasion to go to your safety deposit boxes once a month, why?    Alright.  At paragraph 43   Paragraph 44   That you what?    Yes.    Well let us get to the next paragraph.   “When Singh returned from the meeting at approximately    But Witness 3 himself as you say says it was unusual.    That is what he says.    You accept though this is unusual behaviour if it happened?    And he himself says it is unusual.    Yes.    Alright.  So let us then deal with the Three Rivers Lodge.      I think the question that was posed to you by the DCJ if I could just pick up on that?  I think why would the driver – firstly – first of all from you have said you seem to have had a good relationship with this driver.      In fact on your version he tips you off about the fact that he is going to give an affidavit against you.    Alright but …    If you did not have something negative to say about you why would he have called you on your version?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Mr Singh I just got two more questions before we go to the Three Rivers Lodge.  Can you think of why Witness 3 would frame you given the constructive relationship that you had with him?    And perhaps one other question.  If he wanted to frame you he seems to have come up with a very elaborate and detailed version, why?    Alright.      Thank you.  Mr Singh the bags received from men of Asian descent at Three Rivers Lodge paragraph 46 at page 130. “During July of 2014 the Transnet Executive Committee attended a week long strategy session at the Three Rivers Lodge in Vereeniging.” Would you confirm that?    47 “I dropped Singh off at the venue early in the week and picked him up on the Friday afternoon again.”    48 “While I waited for Singh on the Friday afternoon to finish the session I noticed four men who appeared to be from Asian descent (they looked like Chinese men to me) standing around a Hyundai H1 vehicle in the parking area.  Two of  the men appeared to be busy with a conversation on a cellular phone.” Any comment on that?    49. “The next thing I noticed how the two men (who spoke on the cellular phone) took two luggage bags from the vehicle. One black the other one maroon and went inside the lodge area where the executive management meeting was held.” Any comment on that?    At 50. “At around 15h00 I received a sms from Singh requesting me to come to the conference room where the meeting was held.  As I entered the room the two men who took the luggage bags into the lodge were in the room together with Molefe and Singh.  Singh pointed to the maroon luggage bag and requested me to take the bag to our vehicle. I took the bag and put it in the boot of the vehicle.” Any comment on that?    And if you had a bag with you in the conference room that you wanted to be put in the boot of your vehicle would you typically contact your driver and ask him to help you?    So that is – that is not what I am asking you Mr Singh.    I am asking you take a typical work day; you have a bag.    With you at a conference centre.    And you want it to be put in the boot of your vehicle my question is would you typically contact your driver you knew that he is in the parking lot to come and fetch the bag to put it in the vehicle?    Not you would go and do that yourself?    Well you heard the evidence for example of Mr Molefe when he was sitting in the Carlton Centre conference centre or room and he did not have his cell phone with him and it was in the bag in his office he contacted his driver to go fetch the cell phone.  You used the drivers on a more limited basis.    So you telling the Chairperson that if you had a bag in a conference room and your driver was outside in the parking lot with your car you would not get his assistance to take the bag and put it in the boot you would walk that way yourself out of the conference room?    Alright Mr Singh.  So he says that at     “While I was seated in our vehicle waiting for Singh after putting the maroon luggage bag in the boot of the vehicle I saw Molefe’s driver; (I cannot clearly recall if it was Witness 1 or a colleague) putting a black luggage bag from the same lodge venue to the vehicle that was used to transport Molefe.” Want to comment on that?    But a very detailed version again is it not?    Sorry that was not my question.      It is a detailed version that he is putting forward in this affidavit.    Correct.  51.1 “I recognised this bag as the other bag which the Chinese men had earlier taken into the meeting room.” Any comment on that?    So that was a Friday I take it what would happen is you have explained is he would drive you back to the Carlton Centre, you would get into your blue BMW M3 you would go home for the weekend and you would bring your blue BMW M3 back to the Carlton Centre basement on a Monday.  Is that right?    At paragraph 52. “The next Monday Singh drove to the Carlton Centre with his BMW M3 he left the vehicle in the basement for the week.” That would be consistent with what you have said correct?     “That Friday afternoon I was about to take Singh’s vehicle to the car wash.” Any comment on that?    So you could have a nice clean car?    Over the weekend as we all enjoy.   “As usual I checked that there was no valuables – that there were no valuables in the boot that could go missing.” You accept that he would usually do that before taking your vehicle to be washed?    Well perhaps it is because there were not any before this incident.    Okay.   “I ope – as I opened the boot I saw the maroon bag that I had collected from the Three Rivers Lodge the previous Friday.  When I picked up the bag I realised that it weighed less than before.  I opened the bag to see what was inside and I noticed a couple of rolls of R200 notes.  I sms’d Singh and informed him that the bag was still in the car.  He immediately came down to the basement and collected the bag from me.” You want to comment on that?    Yes absolutely.    And he would not want to disturb you?    And that was the mode that you communicated with one another typically?    Of course he says that he received a sms from you at the Three Rivers Lodge to come to the conference room. That would be how you would contact him and …    But Mr – Mr alright.  I suppose it must be quite difficult to work out when one would sms someone and when one would phone them.  I mean all of us work with this all the time.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh, could I ask you, please, to go to page 131 of Exhibit BB-14(d)?  The ...[intervenes]      Yes, the statement of Witness 3.     I want to deal with what Witness 3 says under the heading, Visits to Sahara Computer Offices.   “I came prepared. That I provided CPO Services to Singh.   I took him to the Sahara Computer offices in Midrand on a number of occasions to attend meetings.   I do not know with whom he met as I always waited for him in the vehicle in the parking area...” You want to comment on that?     You say you went there but you did not go inside?     Alright.  You know who owned Sahara Computers?     Who?     And you know who worked in these offices?     Well, did any of the Gupta’s worked there?  Your now wife worked at Sahara Computer ’s offices.     Do you know which any of the Gupta’s worked in those offices?     I see.       That is a relief Chairperson.  [laughs]       [laughs]       Thank you.     Mr Singh, if you go over the page to     And then at 55    Now, just a few general questions.  You have read this whole affidavit?     And you have noticed, no doubt, that Witness 3 implicates Mr Gigaba, yourself and Mr Pita.     In different ways and to different degrees, correct?     If we go to Mr Pita.  You would have read that Witness 3 says at paragraph 62, when talking     Do you have any idea how Mr Pita, your successor, that came to have a facility at Knox Vaults, at least on this version?     Mister...  Chairperson, I had just been advised that an urgent technical break for five minutes is required.     Thank you.  Mr Singh, I wanted to end off by just asking you this.  Can you think of any reasons why Witness 3 would potentially put his life in danger by fabricating this version?     I just want to ask Mr Singh as to whether he could think of any reason why Witness 3 might potentially put his life in danger by fabricating a version against Mr Singh.  That is all that I wanted to ask him.     No.  May I just have two more questions...?     Mr Singh, could I ask you, please, to     And then one just last thing.  It came to light in the Commission’s proceedings earlier this week and you might have read about this, that there was allegedly an attempt on Witness 1’s life.  Did you read about that?     Alright.  Could I ask you then, please, to turn to...     Yes, we are done with Witness 3.     Sure.     I am going to come back to ...[intervenes]      Yes.     As you please Chairperson.     Mr Singh, I am going to come back to the evidence of Witness 3 and I am going to come back to the allegations that you went to the Gupta’s, the allegation that you collected money and that you deposited it at Knox Vaults, once I have completed my examination of you and dealt with the transaction advisors, the awarding of tenders, et cetera.  I will come back to that at the end.   If I could ask you, please, to turn back to your exhibit, BB-23(a).     The driver ’s you can put away, yes.       It has been included in your bundle now, DCJ.     Yes, thank you.     Alright.  My junior will remind me.  Perhaps we could that just before we break.     I am indebted to you Chairperson.     Mr Singh, could I ask you to turn to the second 10.6 Directive that was issued to you?  That you will find at page 420.     420 Chairperson.     And at 421, you see you were told to deliver within seven weeks of receipt, thereafter the Secretary or acting Secretary of the Commission at the address given, et cetera, the declaration in which you specifically address your involvement or you knowledge of the following.  Do you see that?     And if I could ask you then to turn to page 425 amongst the issues that you were asked to address under that head at the foot of the page, paragraph 1.12.  Do you see that?     And you were asked to address the frequency and reasons for visits to the Saxonwold residence of the Gupta family.     Now let us turn to your answer.  That you will find at page 1500.  And if I can direct your attention, please, to paragraph 300?  You will see under the heading at para 1.12.  Do you see that?     You say at paragraph 300    Where do you tell the Chairperson you are under a summons about the frequency and reasons for your visit to the Saxonwold residence?     You were asked, in what was a summons, to tell the Commission about your frequency and reasons for visits to the Saxonwold residence.     You do not do that.       Mr Singh, you were issued with a summons to answer that question and you land up saying     But why...  Well, why did you not tell the Chairperson, because of course, we are not dealing with Witness 3 there.  You were given a 10.6 to deal with Witness 3.  And then you were asked about the frequency and reasons for your visits.  Why did you not in this affidavit, if you were going to be completely transparent, why did you not simply tell the Chairperson what you said when I started asking you questions?   And I asked you, how many times did you go there and why did you go there.  Why did you not put it in     No.  An omission on your part?     Well, perhaps I could just ask you one more question.  If you read 300 to 303.     And that is a fact, is, you are telling the Chairperson that you have never been to the Gupta’s.     Well, if you read it, you say    But let me ...[intervenes]      Yes, thank you Chairperson.       Yes, thank you.  Now, DCJ, whilst we are in this file, we were at page 1500.  Could I ask you... Perhaps I should just deal with the affidavit now because it is in the same file.     Mr Singh, could you please go to page 1507?     1507.  There you will find an affidavit.  If you go to page 1 – of yours – go to page 1539.  That is the signature page and it contains as series of annexures that run up until 1563.  Would you confirm that?     Now if you go back to page 1539, would you confirm that you swore to this affidavit on the 12 t h day of March 2021?     I presume earlier this morning?     And would you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, if I could ask you, please, to admit Mr Singh’s affidavit that commences at page 1507 as Exhibit BB-23.8?     Thank you.  Mr Singh, on these ten or so occasions that you went to the Gupta residence, who did you see there?     Well, did you, for example, see Mr Molefe there?  By his own admission, he went often including to family functions.     I see.  You cannot recall anyone that worked at Transnet there on those ten occasions?     Yes.  Alright.  I want to turn to another topic and that relates to the Manganese Expansion Project.  Can I ask you please to turn to Transnet Bundle 4 behind you and Exhibit 19?     Someone will help you now.     Transnet Bundle... [speaker moves away from microphone – unclear]  At page 31.     Yes.  So this is the affidavit of Mr Henk Bester.  You will recall that at the time he worked for Hatch Consulting.     I had.  I wanted to go to 31 but then I see that inadvertently went to start at the statement.  it actually starts at page 24.     Yes.     Alright.       24.  It starts at 24.     BB-19.       Mr Singh, BB-19.  I can see it from here.  It is the next divider.       Sorry, Mr Singh?     Yes.     You – this is the affidavit or statement of Mr Henk Bester. You have read it, presumable and you have read it carefully?     And you have noted that there are many references to you in this statement?     You have noted as well that he alleges that you attended a meeting together with Mr Essa.     I want to then deal with those passages if I could?     The first paragraph where you are implicated is paragraph 23 at page 31.  And he says that on the 26 t h of July, I met with Rudi Basson, Transnet Capital Projects... [audio recording ended] ...time to inform him of the visit that I had from Padayachee and Reddy and the apparent insight they seem to have into Transnet matters as outside companies.     Thank you.  So, Mr Singh, we were at page 33 of Transnet bundle 4A, EXHIBIT 19.  Sorry, page 31, paragraph 23.  So I am going to fast-forward just a little bit.  What Mr Bester says is that he has a meeting together with Mr Basson and Ms Strydom, this is what he     Yes, so a hearsay and a lack of a confirmatory affidavit is a non-issue because you accept you said this, this is what you wanted.     Well, Mr Bierman, we know that he put in an affidavit and he deals with it as well.     So just that we understand this, you wanted a confinement approval condition, you must correct me if I am wrong, included which stipulate that PM Africa and DEC  should from part of the SD component for phase one.     Well, what did you want?     You would accept that it would be improper to impose on someone like Hatch the appointment of particular SD partners.     Alright.  So let us go to paragraph 25.     Alright.  Then at 25    So you accept though or do you dispute that Mr Bester was requested to sign an MOU with PM Africa and DEC?     Then let us get to paragraph 29 at page …[intervenes]     Now, Mr Singh, perhaps I could just ask you to keep that bundle open and move to Mr Bester ’s affidavit – sorry, Mr Bierman’s affidavit.  This is Transnet bundle 4, EXHIBIT BB21.       Can I ask you please to turn to page 928?  Just in relation to your evidence that you were not proposing specific SD partners, you would have seen at paragraph 18 at 928 that Mr Bierman says that he gave you feedback via a Whatsapp.       And it says    Does it not appear from that Whatsapp that you were proposing specific SD partners?     So now you concede what?     Right, I see.   Mr Singh, can I just perhaps – I meant actually to start out by asking you more general questions.  Was there a time when you were employed as Transnet where you became at least suspicious of the fact that this SD partner, provision for SD partners was being exploited and manipulated?     Yes, but you have no doubt reflected carefully on your time at Transnet, backwards, not so?     Yes.     Yes.     And you have paid attention to evidence that has been given.  Do you have any sense at the time that there were problems with SD partners and that they were being used in an irregular way?     No, I am not asking you to agree, I am asking you did you have a sense, did you have any suspicion that SD partners were being used in an irregular way?     Now in relation to this affidavit of Mr Bester, as I understand it you want to essentially delete your involvement …[intervenes]     You say you were not involved, I mean essentially when you take issue with the places where you refer to.    But you accept from an overall perspective this reflects a very serious situation, does it not, of an abuse of the SD partner process.      What Mr Bester ’s version.     Well certainly by the SD partners.     Whilst we are in the Bierman file, if you still have it there, could you turn to page 935 please?     Here you see that Mr Bierman send you, it seems, a profiling of DEC, is that correct?     That is what you wanted him to do, to profile this particular SD partner.     Yes.  Alright, if we go back then to paragraph 29 at page 33 of bundle 4A.     So paragraph 29, on or about 1 August …[intervenes]     Mr Bester ’s affidavit, yes.     29.      “On or about 1 August I received a call from Padayachee who indicated he would like to see me again.  We agreed to meet on 5 August 2013.  At the meeting Padayachee and Reddy advised that the confinement approval was imminent but Hatch needed to sign an addendum to the MOU that Hatch had amended. Before confinement could be finalised it was clear that they were not happy with Hatch’s proposed amendments, I understood this to mean that either Singh would not approve the confinement in order for Molefe to give final approval.  Alternatively, both Molefe and Singh would not give the necessary approvals.” Do you want to comment on that?     Alright, so let us then go please to paragraph 35.     No, we need to just give some     Well, assuming you are right, I mean, do you think that adds or subtracts from this version?     Do you think it adds or subtracts from Mr Bester ’s version?     But he is nevertheless telling his story, Mr Singh, and perhaps I could just ask you – you have already given us that version, you have told us of the irregularities, can you now deal with paragraph 35 where you refer to?     No, no, no, I am not suggesting that.     But you have told us about how you think Mr Bester conducted himself in an irregular fashion.      Deal with paragraph 35.     It is late on Friday but really the purpose of this is for you to answer the paragraphs where you are implicated.     Yes.     Could I ask you please to answer paragraph 35?     What about yours? “However I was later informed by Strydom that the matter was elevated to Singh who considered the matter closed.” That is really what I am trying to ask you to deal with.     Right.     Yes?     Who it was raised was Sisheke the general counsel of TFR.     Thank you, perhaps I could deal just with one more paragraph.  At 47 please at page 41, paragraph 47.     “To the best of my knowledge says Bester – sorry to my recollection the meeting with Pita which was set up to include Singh was held on 22 October 2013.   I annex a meeting invite from Pita as HP14.  This meeting was attended by Graham and me and started almost an hour late after Singh had not arrived.   Pita said that Singh requested that he speaks to us as he, Singh, was busy, but we could see him, Singh, pacing up and down in his office and even pass us on his way to the restroom.” Do you have anything to say about that.        You feel you have answered what I put to you?     Alright, thank you.  And then finally can I just take you please to page 44, so ...[intervenes]      Yes, we can fast forward as lot of this, paragraphs 54, 55, 56  your name is mentioned but effectively what is contended is that Mr Reddy must set up a meeting with you, and I want to get to that meeting, paragraph 57.    “On my arrival at Melrose Arch as I walked towards the restaurant I was met by a gentleman who introduced himself as Mr Salim Essa.  He said that  he was there to meet with us as part of the discussion with Singh and needed to see if the restaurant is clean.  I asked him where Mr Singh was and he said he will call him when he, Essa, is ready.  I asked Essa whether he himself works for Transnet and he responded that he is “doing a lot of things” or something to that effect of I have a lot of businesses. He clearly had no intention of answering my question in detail.  I was surprised at the time but as soon as Essa called Singh arrived a few minutes later.” Do you want to comment on that?     I think you mean thirdly.     So Mr Singh did you attend the meeting with Mr Essa or not?     Well perhaps we should first start with that.   He says that the meeting was called, Mr Essa was there, Mr Essa called you arrived at the meeting.     Mr Chairman I see that it is ten to four, if this is an appropriate time to adjourn ...[intervenes]     Two days.     And please Chairperson don’t forget about Mr Gama.     I think he could also be two days.     We are flexible and I am sure we can convince our opponents to sit at night and to get squeezed into those night sessions if that would be more convenient for you. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  Chair we could – yes.    First good morning Chair.    Yes, no the only thing we would like to add is we appreciate we will not be heard today – this session he had kept himself available this week.    We are not sure what the new developments are but we – we trust we will be timeously advised of – of these new developments so that we can respond in terms of 3.3 if necessary.    3.3.6.    And – and then also we had received kindly from evidence leader Myburgh SC an email on the 3 r d of March which set out fairly the areas that he intended to cover and the material that we would need to apply our minds to in order to prepare Mr Gigaba for that examination which we have obviously done. If there is material to be covered on the next occasion we would kindly ask that he then communicate with us in writing as to what these other areas are so that we can proper prepare and then whenever Mr Gigaba is then to be expected if those dates could be arranged with myself and my junior Advocate Gumbi within reason I mean we are not – but within reason I mean we are not going to – to – the commission has got its work to do within reason.    That is all I have to say.  Thank you Chair.    No thank you Chair and we appreciate the work the commission does and we continue to offer our cooperation.    Thank you Chair.

MR SINGH:   Yes, thank you Chairperson.     Thank you Mr Chairman.  So the remark relates to me, like, to make an opening statement.  We are in possession of the Chairman’s ruling in this regard and given the fact that we need to comply with your ruling, we have not been in a position to submit the opening statement to you as required in the ruling.  We would, however, like to place on record that we would like to make certain comments at an appropriate time during the proceedings.     That is correct, sir.     Not today.     At some stage.     Yes.     I am there sir.     I do so.     I do so sir.     I am there sir.     That is correct.     That is correct sir.     I do.     I am there sir.     Correct.     I confirm sir.     That is correct.     I do so.     I am there sir.     150... Ja, 1506.     That its correct sir.     I do so.     That is correct sir.     That is correct.     That is correct sir.     That is correct.     On the 1 s t of August 2015.     That is correct sir.     That is correct sir.     I am not exactly sure of the number of months but he preceded mine. ADV MYBURGH     Of Transnet, that is correct.     And after he was seconded to Eskom before you were seconded, you reported for that short period of time to Mr Gama?     Mr Singh, what are your qualifications?     Oh, I am sorry sir.     Okay.     That is right.     So I hold a Bachelor of Accounting Degree from the University of Durban Westville at the time.  I also hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Accountancy from the same said university.  And I was for a period of time admitted as a Chartered Accountant at South African Institute of Chartered Accountants until, I think, December 2010(?) or so. ADV MYBURGH     Mr Chairman, I was – post obtaining my degrees at the University of Durban Westville, I served a traineeship with B Origin Technology(?) for a period of three years.  I stayed with the firm, thought, for around four years.  Post that, I took up a position with the Spar Group in KZN until 2002.  In 2003, I relocated to Johannesburg and took up a position with the then Spoornet which was, obviously, a division of Transnet as a Senior Manager or a position as Senior Manager, Corporate Financial Services.       That is correct sir.     Mr Chair, I did on occasion had opportunity to go to the Gupta residence.      Mr Chair, the reasons for my visit to the Gupta residence was based on culture reasons.  There were religious functions that were held.  In the Indian community, you are normally invited to these functions and based on my availability, I would on occasion...     Mr Chair, I would have to hazard a very, very wild guess and I would think that it is probably, I think less than ten times.  Probably less than ten.     No, sir.     Culture and religious.     Ten times would be the maximum.  It is probably less.  Between five and ten.      Mr Chair, my first interactions with the Gupta family would have been as a result of attendance to the TNA Breakfast which Transnet would have sponsored.  So I assume it would be that period of time which probably would have been around 2011/2012...     In terms of timing.  And then I would assume infrequently in between from that period of time.     My association was not very intimate.  I mean, for example, I did not...  Sorry sir.     Very intimate with the family.     I knew them.  I knew of them.  My...  For example, I did not attend the wedding, for example.  The Gupta wedding or the Sun City wedding.  So from that perspective I did not see any need for me to... myself with them or for them to do the same with me.     Sorry, sir.  My association with them?     The first time I met them was as a result of the TNA Breakfast which I would assume started around...     I would again hazard to give you a guess.  I would say probably 2015 or so, 2016 or so.     At that point in time, there were all of these allegations and all of these media speculation relating to the family at the time and not that I believe that any of the speculation or issues relating to our relationship between mine and theirs is irregular but I just thought at that point in time it would be prudent to not visit.     No, sir, I did not invite the Gupta’s to my house.     Mr Chair, the religious functions were attended by a number of people and this is normally the case.  So I had occasion to meet Mr Athol Gupta, Mr Rajesh Gupta,  Mr AJ Gupta as well, not...     Well, the ones that come to mind is obviously the Diwali functions and the Diwali function would depending on when the occasion of Diwali would fall in the...       Mr Chair, I did have occasion to visit the – not enter into the offices of Sahara but I certainly knew where Sahara Computers was.  I did visit the – how can I say – the entrance of the office in that my current wife used to work for Sahara.  So on occasion, I used to either pick her up...     Yes, sir.     I would think that it would have been sometime in 2014 or so, I think that she would have started there or 2013.  I am not too sure of the date.  And then, she left, I think in 2015. ADV MYBURGH     A year and a half or so if not two.     Yes, I would go to fetch her or I would drop her off.     No, sir.     Mr Chair, I met Mr Essa on probably one or two occasions at his request and it was for the purposes of just having a discussion associated with business opportunities that he may have had in relation to Transnet but it was of no interest to either of us and that was the end of that relationship.     I do not – because it was a relatively long time ago.  So I do not remember exactly where but it would have – it was certainly not at the Transnet offices.  So it would have been an outside venue.  I am not sure.     It may have been.     Yes, sir.     That is correct sir.     At that time, I think he – I am not too sure what the exact details of those discussions were but as I said, Mr Chair, the discussion actually never went any further than those one or two meetings.  So I did not really pay any attention to any issues that emanated from these meetings.     If I recall correctly, Mr Chair, it would have been what Mr Essa would have been involved in at the time and how he would have probably in wanting to provide services to Transnet...  And I can only conclude that given the fact that he was not actually involved in much Transnet related business at the time, we never pursue the discussions any further. ADV MYBURGH     Mr Chair, at that time, I think he was looking at opportunities in oil and gas if I recall correctly.  Opportunities in terms of being able to supply same to Transnet.     Mr Chair, I do not recall those details.     You said little D?     Sorry, you said little D?     [No audible reply]      Are you doing the red numbers, sir?     122?     I am there sir.     I have sir.     I note that, sir.     Mr Chair, when we first heard of witness 3 it was actually via the media, so the Commission was not gracious enough to advise us in advance that witness 3 was going to testify in this matter so we were relatively perplexed by his evidence and concerned by his evidence given the inferences and the allegations that he levied against us, against me.     In dealing with the fact that we were relatively concerned – well, not relatively, very concerned about the allegations contained in his affidavit.  I studies his affidavit quite closely and found that his evidence was really not very credible and spurious in nature and hence my level of concern was relatively diminished and I also had opportunity to have been forewarned about this affidavit by witness 3 himself probably, I would say – in timing-wise I am not too sure but I think probably six to eight months in advance and this had originated in a telephone call that I received from witness 3 that basically described the fact that he was requested to provide an affidavit or provide evidence or testimony regarding his activities with me as the CPO or close protection officer that he was and he did reference individuals at Transnet that were pressurising him to provide this type of information and he also referenced the Commission or the investigators of the Commission and so I then asked – I said so, witness 3, what type of information are they looking for?  And he then did not directly reference the visits or the alleged visits, all he said was you know what information they are looking for.  And I then said okay – sorry, again, I said witness 3, but that is of no issue or concern, you are employed by Transnet, if there is an official request that Transnet is making of you, you should comply and again, the Commission is a legally constituted body, if there is a need for you to provide any information  please do so and, at the end of the day, whatever information that you provide to them, as far as it relates to our activities, you and I both know that the information they seek does not exist because I have never taken you and if I had gone there on my personal account, it has got nothing to do with you, so please provide whatever information you are required to do so.  And he then said  - he sought assurance from me if that was really what I wanted him to do and I said yes, please proceed.  He said listen, they are looking for log books, they are looking for the information from his cell phone , they are looking for information from, you know, car tracking system and again I said, witness 3, to the extent that that information exists, please provide it to the Commission or to Transnet because you are under an obligation to do so and if it is that there are issues that emanate there from for me, I have the obligation to deal with that, not you.  So that was the context behind me also being perplexed by the affidavit that I then was provided with from the Commission in that the discussion that – the telephonic discussion that I had with witness 3 vis-à-vis the affidavit that was then provided was completely – how can I say, completely different, so – but that is the context behind which I viewed the witness 3 affidavit. In addition to that, Mr Chair, the reason why I believe that witness 3’s affidavit and testimony is a complete fabrication, there are no objective facts that he actually relies on to be able to make the allegations he does.   Conveniently, there are no log books, when patently from witness 1’s testimony there was a requirement to maintain log books.  Mr Chair, log books cannot be dismissed as a mere piece of paper.  Mr – I am sorry, witness 3, did not report to me within the Transnet structure, he reported into the general manager of Group Security.  So these log books and time sheets and all of these administrative pieces of paper would have been required for witness 3 to justify any claims of overtime, any claims of working over the weekend, any issues relating to incidents that may have happened with the official Transnet vehicle, so it is very curious for me to understand that these documents actually do not exist because they had to exist.  Transnet was subject to internal and external audit processes, these documents must have been reviewed, they must have been filed somewhere.  In comparison, witness 1 was very diligent in keeping this document.  So that is relating to the log books. Mr Chair, if you look at one occasion that he describes, he describes an occasion where I was summoned to the Gupta residence, or he alleges that I was summoned to the Gupta residence, via a telephone call that I received.  According to him, I visit the residence, I am there for about an hour or so, I think, according to his affidavit, I come out and I am irate and I use certain vulgarities and he then proceeds to drive me home  But curiously Saxonwold to my home is probably less than 10 kilometres and in being in this irate state he then says I fell asleep in this space of 10 kilometres.  That does not – it is inconceivable that I would fall asleep in an irate state in a space of less than 10 kilometres. So, Mr Chair, those are aspects of this affidavit that was issue for me.  In addition to the actual studying of the affidavit itself, we had occasion to view the cross-examination of witness 3, which was led, I think, on Monday – I may be incorrect in the day.  But again, under cross-examination, Mr Chair, witness 3 did not really – well, did not perform well in that his evidence, I think in my view, was completely dispelled.     Mr Chair, we deal with the evidence of witness 3 in the latest affidavit that we have commissioned this morning.     That is correct, sir.     Mr Chair, as I mentioned originally, we were not provided with the affidavit of witness 3 by the Commission prior to this testimony.  Subsequent to that we did have access to the affidavit at the Commission.  Upon analysis of that affidavit my legal team and myself had engaged with the Commission on a number of occasions trying to obtain the affidavit that was actually admitted into evidence on the day that witness 3 actually testified because the affidavit that was provided to us was actually deposed to post a date on which witness 3 testified. We also had concern in that the testimony that – or the transcripts and the testimony that he had led was in some instances inconsistent with the affidavit that we had been provided with so we were trying to ascertain which version of the truth was actually the truth, was it the affidavit that was entered into the records of the Commission, was it his transcripts or was it the affidavit that we were actually provided with post the testimony of witness 3? And, Mr Chair, just for the record, we still have not been provided with the requested document or an explanation as to why this was the case but nonetheless, notwithstanding that, we have provided the response to the Commission in our very last affidavit.     I do so.     That is correct, sir.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     We still await the affidavit of witness 3 that was admitted into the records of the Commission.     He testified.     Because the affidavit that we were provided with …[intervenes]     Was dated after.     The date on which he actually provided evidence.     Indeed so.     Mr Chair, my recollection of the conversation was as Mr Myburgh has outlined.     Mr Chair, that would be one of the reasons, as I have testified, the conversation and the conclusion that witness 3 and I had regarding the discussion was that we were of one mind that he needed to comply and there would be no issues because the factual nature of the allegations did not exist and that was the conclusion of the conversation, is he never took me to the residence.  So …[intervenes]     That is correct, sir.     Mr Chair, we do not go into the detail in the affidavit relating to the pressure, it was a discussion that counsel and I had and we have decided to provide the information that we have provided in the affidavit.     Mr Chair, in terms of the reasoning behind the exclusion from the affidavit is as follows.  Counsel had requested that I provide the details of the alleged telephone call.  I am terrible with dates so I do not actually remember the dates and the times of these things and given the fact that we wanted to be completely and utterly factual we thought it best be dealt with in this forum.     No, sir.     No, sir.     We do deal with that, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, we do not allude to the telephone conversation.     The pressure was a discussion that emanated from the telephone discussion.     So as a result both of those matters do not find its way into the affidavit.     No problem with me, sir.     Yes, sir, I do.     Sir, again, the discussions between the legal team and myself regarding this matter of cross-examination was communicated to the Commission and again emanated from the. let us call it, I misunderstanding, as you put it, Mr Chair, relating to the versions of the affidavit that we needed to be able to understand whether we would need to cross-examine or not at that stage.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     Sorry, Mr Chair, I may have I misunderstood your question.     But if that was the question then I do agree with you.     That affidavit does not contain that [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes, I am.     Mr Chair as I testified witness 3 did not actually report to me directly.   He reported to the General Manager, Group Security and would have then been deployed to me, from the Security Department, so the date on which he actually would have started at Transnet I would not be able to confirm.     Mr Chair, I confirm that witness 3 did perform driver and CPO services for me, I do however, dispute the date of July 2014.  My recollection would have been that that date would have been closer to around March 2014.      2014, the reason therefore, Mr Chair that I mentioned is that there was a particular incident that led to CPO services being provided to myself, and it was the incident related to actually not to me it actually related to Mr Brain Molefe at the time, and he was travelling home from a meeting which was relatively late in the evening, and he had occasion to travel on the N1 and he was passing under a bridge, and there was a stone that was then thrown onto the car from the bridge above.  And this obviously perplexed Mr Molefe and the next morning, he called me and he said, listen this was the incident that happened, and he does not know why this happened.  But at the end of the day, he was concerned for his and our security, and we were at that point in time negotiating the local contracts.  And that is why it actually sticks in my mind, and that was the reason why witness 3 was then allocated to me for security reasons at that time, which followed this incident that occurred to Mr Molefe.     That is correct.      He would have continued until I – well actually I think he continued a month into my secondment to Eskom, if I recall correctly.     Let us say, end of August 2015, give or take.     That is correct, sir.     Mr Chair, I would confirm that he did drive me to meetings, I am not too sure about the arrangements he had with my personal assistant.      Mr Chair on occasions if we had client dinners or the like yes, it would occur.     I do, sir.     Yes, Mr Chair as I mentioned, I think the issue of the logbooks is actually quite an important one, especially given the context that he raises in at paragraph 33, given the fact that he admits that he used to work overtime.  And the fact that these logbooks do not exist, creates a problem for us to be able to verify his version of the allegations.  In addition to that, Mr Chair, I find it strange that witness 3 will be very diligent to keep the log books that he refers to, but do not or was not able to save that log books that were provided to him by witness 3 that relate to myself.     I think we have addressed that, sir.     I confirm that, sir.     Mr Chair it is an organisation or business or company that provides vault services.     That is correct, sir.     I deny it, I do deny that, yes.     No, he did not.     That is correct, sir.     Well Mr Chair if you had to look at the detail of witness 3 transcripts, he actually vacillates between five, ten, seven, 12, so I would not place any reliance on the ten.     Yes, Mr Chair.     In my assessment, I am also taking also from his transcripts.     And the responses that his provided in that in that testimony itself.     Well it is over a period of time, so yes.     I deny those.     Mr Chair, I deny the allegations contained in paragraph 39 where it relates to the bag, witness 3 fails to describe the bags or the colour of the bags or even provide any details relating the bag.     No, no that is why I am saying, that is why I am saying it did not happen because it fails to provide any evidence and to suggest why it happened.     Not it will not but it would at least add some credibility in terms of what he was trying to achieve.     Yes, and for the record, I also deny the contents of paragraph 40.     Yes, the one that you just read and again, Mr Chair if on witness 3’s version, I was providing money for him to buy lunch, which I occasionally did and it was not only for him, it was for the office staff.  There was no need for me to go and access money from this bag. I had access to money from my wallet, I could have gone to the ATM, I could had another, a number of alternatives to be able to do that.  Why would I access money from an alleged bag in his presence?     Mr Chair, again, if I was making the offer to him, as he suggests, and it was an offer, it was not an obligation, I would not offer if I did not have it.     I agree Mr Chair but on his version as well he suggested that I offered this money for him to buy lunch.  In my case, I am saying there was no obligation for me to offer this lunch, so if I did not have the cash on me, there was no need for me to do it or access the money in the boot.     Mr Chair, with all due respect I think the version is not correct.     That is correct sir, I would not offer it if I did not have it in my wallet, I would not offer lunch.      Mr Chair, I did.     Mr Chair, that exact number I do not recall, but it will probably be four, maybe four to five.     Mr Chair, I do not recall.     There were varying sizes, there were one’s that were probably this big…[intervene]     Probably I mean, they were relatively thin, this wide.     Sorry, sir they were relatively thin.      And they were long.     There was also a one that was relatively long, but also relatively deep.      Yes.      No, I think the length of the boxes were the same is just the depth was bigger.     No Chair, it is probably 30 centimetres.     Of a ruler, yes.     Yes.      But when you say depth?     I think all of them were all the same size, I think all of them were the same size.     As we said it was probably…[intervene]     Probably not, it was probably 50.     Sorry Sir, I am saying there were probably four to five of them, I do not know the exact number of how many were big and how many were small.      But I do recall that they were varying sizes.     On occasion, I think they probably would have been there at the same time.     Mr Chair, I would not recall that.     Mr Chair, they - I mean, the cost is relative given the fact that the nature of the reason for having the boxes is security or safety and so on, I mean at the end of the day in terms of quantum, I would think that they were not more than R2 500,00 a year or R2000,00 or R3000,00 a year.     Yes.     No.     Each.     H’m     As I said I do not recall this Chairperson, I am probably estimating and probably badly so.      Yes it is.     I am not too sure exactly when they were there from, but in I would say 2016 or ‘17 I stopped using the services of Knox Vault.     Probably from 2013 I would say.     2016/2017.      Mr Chair, they were basically for safety and security purposes well in South Africa, you really require safety and security at least, at any given point in time.  They were to store valuables, jewellery, documents, anything that we thought that we need to store and that is it basically.     There was an occasion to store some cash.     I would be speculating.      I said, I would be speculating if I was to estimate that.     I would say that I think it is probably in the region of maybe at any given point in time, maybe a 100 000.     Mr Chair, this would have been an accumulation over a period of time, so it would have been relatively small amounts.     Yes.     I really do not recall Mr Chair.     Yes.     I think I responded to Mr Myburgh probably between 2013’ish to 2016/17’ish.      Mr Chair, the four boxes is easy to explain. There was a box for each one of the members of the family in terms of being able to access the requirements, whenever we needed something for someone.  So it was jewellery for, let us say he wife then it was in a box, documents was in a separate box and alike.     Yes, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, as I mentioned, the safety situation in South Africa was is - was an is a serious concern for everybody, and as I mentioned before, I was deployed with a close protection officer for safety and security reasons.  In addition to that, or again, for safety and security reasons there was security guards that were deployed at my home by Transnet.  So from that perspective, safety and security was a serious concern.     Not very often, sir.     Maybe once a month, maybe once in two months.     Oh, sorry.     Yes.     Yes.      Mr Chair, I think it was – it coincided with my suspension at Eskom and I needed to access – well not having a salary beyond that, it was obviously going to be a problem to maintain these boxes, and that also coincided with my ex-wife and family moving to Durban and living in Durban.  So we needed to access the information and the documents and stuff that was stored for them.  So that was then the reason for us to give up the boxes.     To the extent that I can retrieve the information I will do so.     That is what I plan to do.      Yes.      Mr Chair, as I said I was qualifying that by saying it might be that that approximation might actually be very wrong.     As I recall, yes which might actually be very wrong, as I said,     Mr Chair, I think maybe for the purposes of today, I think it is probably best for me to reserve comment in terms of what the value is until I actually engage and find the appropriate number else we would be pickling.      That is correct.     Mr Chair, as we have discussed, I deny this allegation by witness 3.     No, he did not, sir     No, I did not sir and I think maybe Mr Chair just to give the Commission some background or my nature Mr Chair I am a relatively private person and you will notice as well that from witness 3 testimony, I normally used to take my car, private car to work on a Monday and then take it back on a weekend.  Now that was the reason for that was that so I have my weekends to myself.  So witness 3 would not have for example driven me on a weekend to anywhere, maybe there was one or two rare occasions when that was required, but by and large, that never happened.  So from a perspective of him taking me to deal with my private affairs, whether it be visits to the Gupta residence or whether it be to Knox Vaults or whether it be to - anything that I deemed private I would not use witness 3 for any or any transitory source for that matter.     No.    No Sir.    Mr Chair I am just as startled as you as to how he comes up with this allegation.    Mr Chair I will – I will afford…    I will afford…    Mr Chair      Yes.    Mr Chair if I again can follow a response?    Mr Chair my – my under – my – my view in terms of witness 3’s testimony regarding the Knox Vault emanates from again an issue that was raised from the commission.    I had occasion to read in the media that the commission had taken possession or in some way, shape or form got information relating to the fact that certain individuals implicated in state capture had boxes at Knox Vault and the person in question then had legal issues with the commission and therefore there were legal outcomes associated there from. So again Mr Chair the issue of Knox Vaults and Witness 3 as it relates to myself could have only emanated from the commission itself visa vie those issues that existed within the commission and the knowledge the commission had relative to any individuals that had boxes at Knox Vaults.    Mr Chair in terms…    Mr Chair that is my assertion because as we    Mr Chair the only thing that I know is that the – the commission was in possession of a list of individuals that did have boxes at Knox Vault.    Subsequent to that I then get this affidavit that effectively implicates me in alleged wrongdoing visa vie Knox Vaults coming from Witness 3.  Under the let us say the pressure that had come from as he described it either Transnet or the commission.    Yes.    Mr Chair there was a number of sources I think the – from time to time had occasion to be involved in a family business.  I did in some instances engage in gambling    Ja.    Yes Sir.    Sir and it was maybe the – the activities that I describe was probably in leading up to the Chief Financial    Yes.    I cannot comment on that Sir.    I deny that allegation.    Probably say it is five kilometres.    Five minutes you know.    Sorry Sir.    Yes.    No Sir.    Mr Chair I cannot recall the exact details I said it was an approximate once maybe twice a month – sorry maybe once a month or maybe once in two months but I cannot recall the exact details of why I would visit these boxes.    Mr Chair as I have testified we have never discussed any issues regarding to Knox Vaults and in terms of the visits to the Gupta residence as I testified he has never taken me.    Mr Chair I have dealt with this paragraph in my testimony I deny it and I find it relatively conspicuous that in the next paragraph he basically says I fell asleep.    That I fell asleep.    In the next paragraph.    Mr Chair this is – this is the paragraph that I had referenced previously.  It is – it is for me it is inconceivable that I would be in an irate state, get into a car, listen to the radio and fall asleep within a distance of –    But I am saying to you it is unusual from a perspective that I would fall asleep.  I would not fall asleep.    So why would I fall asleep if I was irate Sir?    For me yes.    Well if it happened.    And I am saying it did not happen.    Mr Chair if I again may offer my view?    In this regard.    If you look at in my view what Witness 3 is trying to allude to or infer from this is that I was under instructions of the Gupta’s.  So soon as they phone I would go.  Because he said this was unscheduled – we changed direction from a scheduled meeting.    Based on a phone call.    No, no indeed.    I am saying his inference.    I am saying his inference is – is such that I would have left whatever meeting we were going to which was Transnet business and deal with this matter whatever the matter was.  And having gone to that meeting dealt with the subject matter of that meeting, whatever the subject matter of that meeting was created me to be in a state of anxiety.  Then fell asleep.  Right.  If you then go to Witnesses – Witness 3’s testimony relative to Mr Pita you find the same inference that he draws.  That they were on a way to a meeting Mr Pita gets a call and there they reverted to Saxonwold.  So in my view again I would suggest that it is probably the reverse coincidence that I am going to fold in terms of saying but it is coincidental that two CFO’s of the organisation gets the same call and they act in the same way.      Indeed Sir.    Mr Chair he did not tip me off that he was going to give an affidavit.  He sought my guidance in terms of what he should do and again I have a view about that but if you would like it I can give it to you but I do not know but no, no he does not tip me off.    Mr Chair I do not think the context of the conversation was in the – in the light of him tipping me off.    It was more in the light of…    Asking for guidance of what should be done.    And – and that is the context in which the conversation then happened.    Ja I had a cordial relationship with him.    Mr Chair again I will be called on to – to give you my view in relation to this matter.  It was also a very, very strange occurrence for me and the reason why it was strange it is for a couple of reasons. The first reason is the fact that I do not normally answer phone calls that I do not know who they are from.  Lately it has been from the media so hence I do not answer those calls but anyway it was an 012 number that – it was landline number from which he had called on the day and the reason for me to having answered that landline call and not knowing who it was that I had occasion to be in a meeting in Pretoria. And the individuals that I was meeting in Pretoria on the day was actually a bit delayed.  So I – my view was this 012 number was them that was calling to say that they are a bit late and they will be there or something like that. So when – when the call – when I eventually answered the call it was then Witness 3 and so that is the second reason why I found it strange.  One was that I answered the landline number but then it was Witness 3.  And then the conversation went on as I suggested.  Now in my conspiracy    It baffles me Sir I have no explanation.    Well Mr Chair I am sorry Mr Chair the only view that I have in terms of a reason why Mr – I am sorry Witness 3 would undertake such an exercise is if he was fearing for his job or was under duress relating to his employment at Transnet.  That is the only reason I can prefer at this stage.  In terms of the detailed nature of his evidence if he was as I have suggested been influenced by either Transnet or the commission investigators then he would end up with relatively compelling and detailed account of his version.    Chair I did…    Mr Chair you will – I did not hear for a period of time.    That is correct Sir.    Mr Chair I do not have direct recollection of the date but I do concede that we did have breakaways as the [indistinct]    Mr Chair if we did have these breakaways that would be the way that it would happen.    Mr Chair I do not recall his giving evidence relating to something that he had seen.  I have no comment.    Mr Chair again he is relaying events that I have no recollection of or first-hand knowledge of.    Mr Chair I deny this allegation.    Mr Chair typically that would not be the case.  I would not have a maroon luggage bag in the conference itself.  The conference room itself would be for obviously an EXCO break away or whatever the agenda for the day was so that bag would be a work bag so it would contain work related information.    Yes Sir.    Yes.    Yes.    No Sir.    Yes Sir.    As I testified Sir I said I normally try and keep myself private so to the extent that I will have the ability to do stuff I do it on my own.    Yes Sir because in all of my instances all my bags are trolley bags so I will it myself.  Even on travels if I travel with a bag I take my bag myself.    Sorry Mr Chair I deny these two paragraphs.    Mr Chair I cannot comment on this as he does not refer to me in any way.    Mr Chair I think as Mr Myburgh has pointed out that Mr Molefe did use his drivers in a certain way I think he has testified to that and Witness 3 would have known that.  So it is not unusual behaviour for Witness 3 to have given a statement like this.    Yes Sir.    I agree.    As it relates to the inference that these bags were related in – to me in any way I deny that.    That is correct.    That is correct.    He would occasionally do that.  I am not too sure if it was exactly in this instance but he would occasionally do that.    Yes.    I do not recall him actually returning any valuables to me at any given point in time when he took the cars to the carwash.    Well there may have occasion to leave stuff in the car like all of us do.    I deny the contents of this paragraph. ADV    Probably Whatsapp but very rarely. ADV MYBURGH    Well the reason why we would communicate either in Whatsapp or sms is because of the fact that I would be in meetings.    So it would be easier for us to communicate in that way.    Yes.    Typically if we needed to.    Well in that case I would have just called him on the phone because I would not have been engaged in any activity.  It was obviously under his version it was the end of the day.  So there was no formal meetings that were un – that was being conducted.  So I would have called him.    Mr – well Mr Chair in my view if I was busy I would either sms my PA or Whatsapp my PA or Whatsapp Witness 3 - Witness 3.  But else I would either pick up the phone and discuss issues with my PA or alternatively call Witness 3.     Sorry, 131?     I am there sir.     No, Mr Chair, I deny this comment.     No, not for meetings.     Yes, Chair.     It was the Gupta family.     No, sir.     Yes, sir.     Mr Chair, I do not but I am assuming that some of them would have been there.  The family would have been there.     As I have stated before.  Ms Naicker(?)who is now my wife.  That is who he is referring to.     Yes, sir.     Yes, sir.     That is correct.     I would agree.     I do sir.     Mr Chair, I would not able to explain that.  However, I did allude to the fact that the coincidences between the similarities of Witness 3’s allegations between myself and Mr Pita is quite stark.       That is correct Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, my response would be that my view in terms of the motive behind Witness 3’s allegations or the motive behind his allegations could only stem from the fact that he was concerned about job security.     And bow to the pressure that he alluded to that he was under in the telephone call with myself.       Uhm....     Mr Chair, I do not have a name.     I do not have a name.     And I do not think I will ever come up with a name.     Because I am not in the business of speculation or tarnish somebody’s credibility and images.     But as you will see, Mr Chair.  In the course of leading the evidence to the Commission, you will find that there will be a continuous – how can I say – challenging of the evidence presented to drive a certain narrative.     Who and why that was done, Mr Chair, I do not know.  I do not wish to know.     But my obligation to you is to come here and point out these difference and to the extent I can and to the best of my ability and so.     I cannot to the extent that I never threatened Witness 3 and I will never do so.     I did sir.     Sorry, Mr Chair.  Are we done with Witness 3, sir?     I just wanted to make a comment on your general ...[intervenes]      ...analysis of Witness 3’s statement in its entirety.  Mr Chair, I would just like to point you to paragraph 20 of his affidavit which is on page 125.  And it relates to the period when Witness 3 was providing services to Minister Gigaba and you will notice that it is the period between July and December 2013.   If you then move on to page 126 at paragraph 22, one would then note that Witness 3 is waiting in a vehicle at the residence and describes certain individuals that he sees at paragraphs 21.1, 21.2, 21.3 and 21.4.   Mr Chair, my point that I would like to try and make here is.  As it relates to Mr Molefe and Mr Ngubane, in my view, I think they are public figures and Witness 3 would be able to recognise them in 2013. My personal view is, in 2013 I did not know who Mr Matshela Koko was.  I only really got to know him or if I saw him in this room, I would not have not recognise him in 13.  Equally so, Mr Chair, Ms Linda Mabaso the former Chairperson of Transnet.  I did not know.  I do not know until she was the Chairperson of Transnet because she was ostensible not a public figure.   The reason why I raise this is because Witness 3 recognises these people way back in 2013 yet these people become public figures in 2015.  So it is just another anomaly that I thought I should bring to the ...[intervenes]      How did he make this connection.     People at that time.     Especially, Mr Chair, and in particular Ms Linda Mabaso because he refers to her as the Chairperson of Transnet.     No.     She became Chairperson of Transnet sometime, I think ...[intervenes]      After in 2015 or so.     Chair, that was my only point.     Can I return this stuff?     [No audible reply]      Yes, sir.     I do so sir.     I do so sir.     Yes, sir.     That is correct sir.     Sorry, I do not understand your question sir.     Yes, sir.     I guess it is an omission sir but I made full disclosure to you which I apologise for sir.     This is the allegations relating to or the inferences that I drawn as it relates to individuals that visited the Saxonwold residence.     As I said, Mr Chair, I think it was omission on my part which I apologise for.     Yes, sir.     No, sir.     Yes, sir.     No, sir.     No, sir, I would not.  If that was the case, I would not have led the testimony I led.     Mr Chair, I might be misunderstanding you but I think the response in paragraph 301 relates to the allegations that he was making to my business.     I concede that that would have been a better way to contextualise the subject Chair.     1507?     Yes, sir.     I do sir.     Yes, sir.     I do so.     Mr Chair, other than the family that was present and other invitees, no one of significance or that I recall.     I do not recall.       Not off hand Mr Chair.  As I said it was probably ten occasions over a period of five to six years.  So I do not...     [Indistinct] [speaker moved away from microphone]     Thank you.       The black numbers sir?     Sorry?     The black numbers?     Yes.     [No audible reply]      So we are going to 31 sir?     Are we going to 31?     Thank you.     Yes, sir.     Correct, sir.     I do so.     Sure.     Sorry, Mr Chair.  I apologise for interrupting Mr Myburgh but I seem to have a cramp.     I seem to have a cramp on my leg.       Is it possible to just take a break?     Two minutes?     Thank you, Mr Chair, I am.     Mr Chair, firstly, in terms of paragraph 24 we note that there is no confirmatory affidavit that is submitted of Mr Basson to this extent.  In addition, Mr Chair, Mr Basson does correctly state that the stipulation as suggested by Mr Bester was in fact dropped.     Mr Chair, the context behind this issue emanates from the fact that the issue of SD and SD being supplied with – or empowerment, as you would describe it, was a particular problem within the environment within which Mr Basson and Mr Bierman operated.  They operated in a division of Transnet called Transnet Capital Projects and Transnet as an state owned company has an obligation and it is contained in its, you know, shareholder compact with the Minister and so on in the corporate plan as well but it would advance the empowerment and supply development objectives and this comment was made in that context primarily because of the fact that the Transnet Capital Projects, as the name suggests, was involved in construction-related activity and one of the issues that was highlighted relating to empowerment and supply development was that Transnet Capital Projects was relatively lagging behind because of the specialist nature of the work that is conducted by the construction company or the engineering consultants.  So in this case, Mr Chair, we are talking about the manganese expansion project.  Now the manganese expansion project after the locomotive project was probably one of the biggest projects that Transnet would undertake.  It was, I think, in the region of about 20 billion if I am not mistaken in terms of the estimated total cost of the budget. So we really saw this as an opportunity to be able to drive supply development using this project as it relates to the size and the magnitude of the project.  So this is the context within which this request was made from a procurement procedure manual perspective which is the document that guides the procurement within Transnet it would not allow it.  So from that perspective it was used as an example for Mr Basson and Mr Bierman because Mr Bierman was the Chairperson of the acquisition council at Transnet Capital Projects to be able to explore opportunities, options, alternatives, to be able to improve TCP’s SV scores, to enable them to be aligned more to our targets and also then try and transform the engineering and the construction industry space as it relates to supply development. So it was not a direct instruction to say listen, you must do this.  As Mr Basson concedes that once Mr Bierman and Mr Basson had briefed me regarding their deliberations, the idea was brought.  The issue was, I was trying to convey to them the seriousness with which they need to look at this aspect to allow us to be able to meet Transnet’s objectives.     Context.     As to whether I said it to Mr Basson or Mr Bierman, that I am not too sure.     Yes.     No, that I deny, Mr Chair.     As I have explained, Mr Chair, I wanted them to explore opportunities, alternatives of methods to enable Transnet Capital Projects to meet its mandates as it relates to transformation and supply development.  As an example, I said why do you not explore this?    Yes, I will.       Yes, Chair, I dispute the context of the statement that I requested DEC  to be…     Or to be SD partners of Hatch.     My view has always been site development partners are the choice of the main contractor.     Mr Chair, I deny this allegation and on Mr Bester ’s own version he is speculating as to what the reason could be.  Secondly, as Mr Bester already conceded in paragraph 23, which I was led on, the requirement was not even enforced.     Mr Chair, I cannot comment, I was not party to those discussions between Mr Bester and DEC  or PM Africa.  I do not recall this request, the request never came from me.     I think also, Mr – sorry, sorry, just one further comment.  Mr Chair, at the outset I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to one fact.  These interactions, whether it be Mr Basson with Mr Bester and Mr Bester with Ms Strydom because I am sure we are going to led with Ms Strydom’s evidence as well, is highly irregular in its nature because these things actually happening, as the Chair will see, these things are happening as a tender process of the provision of these EPCM services unfolding.  It is highly irregular for Mr Bester to engage in this type of behaviour equally so for Mr Basson and for Ms Strydom given the positions that they have in the project.  Mr Bester would have reported to Mr Basson as a Transnet equivalent.  Ms. Strydom was the project manager relating to the MEP,  project, the manganese expansion project.  So they had very senior positions and for them to be interacting with Mr Bester, a potential service provider on these matters during a live procurement process is highly irregular.     I am there, sir.     Indeed, sir.     I do, sir.     Again, Mr Chair, it comes back to the issue of me requesting a principle to be explored or alternatives to be explored and later on you will see that there is a long Whatsapp message from Mr Bierman again dealing with this topic.  But again from that Whatsapp message you will see that the issue that was being discussed was an issue of principle.     Sorry, Mr Chair?     Yes, sorry.     Mr Chair, this again refers to a principle, correct?  It does not mention them by name.     Agreed, sir.     I think …[intervenes]     Yes.     Mr Chair, I concede that after the reading the …[intervenes]     The first sentence of that [inaudible –     Which I will assume is DEC and there is one other, I cannot remember its name.     That there was a request from me to co-hire two companies.     I do not recall the exact events.     You mean since I have left?     And in terms of how things have now unfolded?     Okay, yes.     No, sir, I do not think I can agree with you on that one.     No, sir.     Sorry, sir?     Yes.     On whose – on whose side, sir?     In terms of the actions of DEC or the actions of Transnet or the actions of Hatch?     Yes, yes, exactly, yes.     Mr Chair, in terms of I cannot comment on the actions of DEC or any other SD partner that I have not engaged with but certainly the environment is one where people would ordinarily understand that there are projects that are about to be launched by Transnet, whether it be locomotives, whether it be the manganese expansion project, the port expansion project, pipeline project and they know when these, you know, RFPs go out into the market and they engage actively with potential service providers and that is as far as I know as to how this industry operates.  Like in all industries maybe there are people that, you know, are unscrupulous and would probably use it for other purposes but if you look at this specific example, this specific example, as we, from a Transnet perspective, we wanted to advance the objectives of enhancing the SD criteria and we achieved that.  Hatch was appointed, they agreed to a 50% threshold and it came with an opinion, so from Transnet’s perspective we achieved all of the objectives that we wanted and it was a desirable outcome for us as Transnet.     Yes, sir.     Correct.     And apparently one other.     This is Bester.     The paragraph?     Yes, sir.     Mr Chair, I deny the allegations contained in this paragraph, it is clearly and patently obvious that Mr Bester is speculating again.  He does not – when he is confronted by Padayachee and the other gentlemen he does not enquire from them as to why they say this, so he is now professing and spurious allegation that implicates myself and Mr Molefe.     Sorry?     Mr Chair, again I would just like to highlight that it is again very irregular for now not even Mr Bester but Mr Gray, who is even more senior than Mr Bester, to engage in again these discussions with Ms Strydom during a period of time when this is a live procurement event that is being conducted, every single Transnet tender that is issued with a qualification or a highlight or emphasises the fact that if they are any issues relating to any irregularities that anyone finds whether it be on the employer ’s side, whether it be on the employee’s side.  When I say employer, employee, I am talking about it in EPCM terms.  They are compelled to report this through the Transnet tip-off anonymous hotline.     Sorry?     Mr Chair, it subtracts from Mr Bester ’s version because he was aware of the appropriate procedure to use.     Mr Chair, I have not mentioned any irregularities that involve myself.     Yes.     Yes and I am highlighting it now that even the more senior person in Hatch is engaging in the same activities.     Oh, okay, yes.     Well, that is the reason I go back to 34.     Is that the avenues that Ms Strydom was also aware of was that she should have followed the Transnet trip-off anonymous hotline.  There is a record of this, it is outsourced, it was outsourced I think Deloitte or one of the companies to be able to take record of these things, there was complete – there was a complete policy in how these issues must be dealt with.  So if this complaint, as it is recorded in paragraph 35, for example, reached the tip-off anonymous hotline, that tip-off would have been automatically escalated to Mr Molefe and escalated to the Chairman of the audit committee.     Based on what I have said, I am responding to paragraph 35 by saying I do not believe that that was Mr Bouwer ’s response.     But that is my point, sir.     If there were irregularities that they were responding to…     They would have not raised it with me, I was the one that was implicated.  There would have been alternatives that they would have explored, which is the tip-offs anonymous hotline.  Ms Strydom has access to Mr Gama who is her direct report.     Exactly, so that is my point, if she did not get an appropriate response and this which is being elevated to me, the implicated person, and me making a decision about what implicates me and closing the matter in my view in an inappropriate response, so she would have went and elevated it to Mr Gama.     Mr Chair, that matter was never elevated to me.     47.  Yes, sir.     Mr Chair again I do not have a direct recollection of this meeting, but I assume that the meeting did occur, because Mr Bester attaches a meeting invite for that meeting.  Given the date of this meeting in the procurement – in the timeline of the procurement events that was being, that was unfolding, in terms of the award to Hatch, I can only understand that this meeting was not for us to discuss DEC and whether they included or excluded.  This meeting was particularly called for Hatch to understand the need for us to meet a 50% SD special and for them to actually agree that the 100 or 150million or 0million premium that they had included in the tender all that criteria was unacceptable.  And that is the reason why Mr Pita, who was the Chief Document Officer at the time, attended that meeting.     You asked, you read this paragraph and you asked me my thoughts.        Sorry page 44?     Thank you Mr Chair.  Again Mr Chair I deny the allegations contained in this paragraph as it is made by Mr Bester and I do so for the following reasons.  Mr Chair as Mr – or Advocate Myburgh has introduced this paragraph he makes reference to 54, 55, and 56.  These paragraphs need an understanding of how this meeting came about, so by and large on Mr Bester ’s version this meeting came about as a result of the fact that Hatch was having problems in settlement of their invoice with Transnet Capital Projects.  At the time Transnet Capital Projects was involved in the new market project pipeline project and those are the invoices that they had a problem being settled.  I don’t recall the exact issue, I do not recall the fact that they were not paid, but that is what Mr Bester says.    Now there is two issues, the first issue is Mr Bester in terms of his title was a director for Rail, now why would a director for Rail try and settle ostensibly pipeline invoices, which I would assume within the Hatch hierarchy would be dealt with by somebody else.   So he references two other colleagues of his that were invited to this meeting.  He does not attach any meeting invites for these two individuals, as in an organisation as big as Hatch you would expect that these things would happen as a matter of course through invites, or emails.   He did attach in the meeting with Mr Pita as we just heard a meeting invite.  He does not attach the same here. Secondly ...[intervenes]      Thirdly he attends the meeting on his own initiation, on his own, allegedly with the CFO of Transnet discuss disputed invoice.  For a person that is emanating from the Rail business unit to discuss disputed invoices related to a pipeline project without the benefit of any finance people from Hatch.     Mr Myburgh I have denied the allegations in its totality and I am explaining to you why I have done so.     Mr Chair I deny that the meeting was called.  I deny that Mr Essa was there.  I deny that I met Mr Bester for the reasons he sets out, for the reasons that I indicated.  It is even further very spurious or again it questions Mr Bester ’s objectives or character, having highlighted all of the issues that he highlighted in terms of manner in which he was dealing with him on the confinement matter he now seeks assistance from Mr Padayachee to be able to resolve a problem for him, and you will see Mr Chair as we go through Phase 2 you will find a similar problem in that the same, very same DEC that Hatch is now complaining about is included as part of Manganese Phase 2 as a sub-contractor and that is after two additional interactions with Mr Essa, or related interactions with Mr Essa.     That is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Good morning Chairperson.     Anneline van den Heever.  I represent Mr Singh on instructions of Mr Tshepo Mathopo of Mathopo Attorneys.  He is sitting next to me.     Thank you      Chairperson, sorry to interrupt.     I have indicated to Mr Myburgh that my client does not intend to do any opening statement.  He does, however, a remark that he wish to make before the proceedings commence.     Thank you very much.     No, it does not implicate anybody.     Thank you.     Chairperson, sorry.     Just a point of correction.     The date is 2021 and not 2020 as Mr Myburgh indicated.     No problem, Chair, we can go ahead.     Chairperson, if I am just given an opportunity I will see if I can find…     Yes, Chairperson, I have got a copy for yourself and I have got a copy for the witness.     And we are quite happy too Chair.       Chairperson, at this stage, I do not want to object but it is, with the greatest of respect, an unfounded statement that is put to the witness and for him to answer that cannot be fair in any form or manner.     Chairperson, my objection is to the first part of the question.  It is a bit of a loaded question and especially in the manner in which it is put to the witness.       As you yourself said on many occasions, you are here to interrogate the veracity of some – we cannot just make statements where we have no factual foundation for it.     Chairperson, again, I do not wish to object but I think the answer in the affidavit must be read in the context of who he responds to.     It is not like it is suggested by Mr Myburgh that he responds – that response relates to the frequency of the visits to the Gupta residence.  I think the     [No audible reply]      Chairperson as far as possible we will definitely cooperate – you might not be aware sometimes there is prearranged meetings but we will deal with it as they come up. 
WITNESS:   Anoj Singh.     No, Ma’am.     I do.     So help me God. 
ANOJ SINGH:  (d.s.s) 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now perhaps before I take you to the content of this affidavit and we may go through it on a paragraph by paragraph basis, what is your overall response to the evidence of witness 3?     Yes, but my question was, what is your overall response to the content of his evidence?     Now, Mr Singh, you filed four affidavits in this Commission which the Chairperson has admitted and we have another one which is in the process of being processed and will be admitted.  Can you point out to me where do you deal in the series of affidavits with the evidence of witness 3?     This morning?  So is that then the first time that you have dealt with the evidence of witness 3?     Why did it take so long?     And just to confirm, you were asked to respond to the evidence of witness 3 in a Regulation 10.6 notice dated the 12 November 2020.  Would you confirm that?     And you did so this morning?     Alright.  Now just so we understand this, Mr Singh …[intervenes]     I think that the issue of witness 3 – I am not sure if that is what Mr Singh is saying.     That he still does not have the documents.  Mr Singh?     As I understand it, that was subject to a moving that you made, Chairperson, in relation to further redacting and the like.     Yes, I have a ruling that deals with that.  Perhaps I can share that with my learned friend during the break but to answer your question directly, Chairperson, if I could ask you perhaps to turn to bundle 5B, to page 414, there you will see at paragraph 1.17 that Mr Singh was asked to respond to witness 3’s affidavit dated the 14 September.     That affidavit was provided and that is the affidavit that finds its way into bundle BB14(b) that I am questioning him about now.     If there is any other issues in relation to that we will sort that out.     Could I please, Mr Singh, just take you back to the evidence that you gave?  Do I understand you to have said that witness 3 conveyed to you that he was being placed under pressure by Transnet and the Commission to provide an affidavit?       And do I understand your evidence then to say or least what you are inferring is that the product of this or this affidavit, which you say is false, is the product of that pressure?  Is that essentially what you are telling us?  Is that how would describe the falsity, on your version, of this affidavit?     So I assume you must then deal with that issue of pressure in the affidavit you filed this morning when dealing with witness 3?     Yes but the nub of your case is the pressure which you do not deal then with the nub of your case in your affidavit.     So in your affidavit do you mention anything about the telephone call that you had with witness 3?     And you have said you mention nothing about the pressure.     So then perhaps I can ask you why – why did you never make application …[intervenes]     Yes.     Mr Chairperson, I do not know if you do intend to take a tea adjournment this morning but it does strike that perhaps we need to put this affidavit before you even informally, it will then be formally introduced at lunchtime.     But it is only a page and a half.     Yes.     So if I could perhaps ask my learned friend if she has got another copy of this affidavit that we could then hand up to you but on the basis that it would be formally introduced.     After lunch.     Chairperson, subject to your direction, could we simply refer to this as for present purposes Mr Singh’s affidavit, it was deposed to on the 12 March 2021, which will be admitted into evidence I would imagine after lunch.     I tend to refer him only presently to paragraphs 143 to 152, the last two pages of the affidavit.     Thank you, Chair, thank you.  Mr Singh, you have a copy?     Before we get to this affidavit of yours, can I ask you – I mean, in the light of this telephonic discussion that you say you had with witness 3 and the assumption that pressure was brought to bear on him, why did you not exercise your right to cross-examine witness 3?     So if we have regard then to your affidavit – and you will bear with me that I have not studied this so perhaps I am doing it for the first time as we go through.  So perhaps we could just go through each     Thank you.  Well, let go then to the affidavit of witness 3 and can I take you to page 127 of bundle BB14(d).  I want to pick up, Mr Singh, at paragraph 29, under the heading CPO services to Anoj Singh.  Are you there?     Witness 3 says
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  Chairperson     I am sorry you can finish.  You can finish then I will deal with an issue.    Chairperson     If you are finished at this stage I..    I wish to raise some concerns.    By the statement that comes from Mr Myburgh.    First of all this version is not under oath we do not know who the investigator is and if it is correct what Mr Myburgh is suggesting I would have thought that that would form part of Witness 3’s affidavit or the evidence that he gave.  All we would have been provided at some stage with an affidavit by the investigator stating same and that of course in return would have had legal ramifications pertaining constitutional rights to privacy etcetera.  So at this stage I want to almost go to the point where I say I object to this line of – of questioning.  I do not think it is fair to the witness more so having regard to the fact that it comes via a Whatsapp message from an unknown investigator with the greatest of respect.    Chairperson thank you very much.  Just one further issue we might be on different pages but I could not see what Mr Singh said as an allegation made as such I saw it as an inference that he drew from information that he got.  But I will leave it at that for the point I need – I am thankful I think if the information is supplied under oath.    We can then prudently and properly deal with that. 
MYBURGH SC:  Now did you and your driver communicate by way of sms?
