CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Are we ready?    Thank you.    Yes.    No thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation?    Ms Pillay.    Ms Pillay is your first name spelt with an I after R?    Or with an E – an I?    Yes.  I think that the people who prepare these bundles you have to check. Remember was it yesterday – not yesterday the day before yesterday that instead of writing Mzwamadoda in regard to Mr Mxakwe they had written something else which I did read out just something else and I see here with Ms Pillay in the statement it iswritten correctly but on the divider it is Kre – they must just take the trouble to make sure people’s names are written correctly, their surnames are written correctly.  It is not difficult.    Yes okay alright.    Thank you.    Yes you may proceed.    I am sorry what page is the supplementary?    20?    23.  Well I have just seen what they wrote in regard to Mr Mxakwe which I talked about.  They wrote Mzwamadod instead of Mzwamadoda so – okay, yes.    I am sorry that – that program where the editors have this engagement would it be on SAFM?    From a certain time to a certain time?    And the editors would it be editors within SABC or you would invite editors from outside as well or how was it composed?    Media houses.   But – but the focus would not just be SABC news it would include other media houses their publications.    And their broadcasts.    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Would – would part of what you would be looking at in that program be to what extent there had been fairness to affected parties in regard to each story and so ona?    Would that be part of what you look at to enable the citizenry to appreciate what trouble editors take in order – before a story is issued.    Or not really?    So then within the context of the policy that had just been issued the media statement in relation to the policy about protest pictures that came in in regard to asking the question is it appropriate?  Is it right for the media not to show protest action?  That would be the angle.    Yes okay thank you.    No please stick to Ms Pillay.  Then during the tea break you can – you can revert to Krivani.    Oh.    Oh okay.    Yes okay.    Okay.    Okay. Okay.    Hm.    And it was a matter that affects the public?    So the reference to editors’ forum was a reference to your program?    That is what it was called?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Well I happen to know that in one of the TV channels that shows what is happening in England they have those discussions like that I think particularly I think on – I think Saturday evening.  Well I happen to know that in one of the TV channels that shows what is happening in England they have those discussions like that I think particularly I think on – I think Saturday evening.    Evening for the Sunday ones.    You know preview and look at different newspapersand I think within the country there are other people who do the same.    Ja.    Yes but he did not like that either.    Yes.    But because of that he was now saying the program must go.    Because they are – that is what you say here.  Okay.    Yes. Yes.  Okay.    Yes you must look at me more than at her.    So the program was actually moved?    Can I take you back?  I should have asked you earlier when this - the media statement that told the public about what you later termed the protest policy you said that you only got to know about it from the media.  Was it usual at SABC that if there was to be a new policy on something or if there was to be a change of policy on something there would be no consultation - prior consultations with all those who may be affected by it?    Hm.  On - on this …    On this particular one and the issue that the final responsibility for news now lay with the - with him and I think you have said and other witnesses said that the norm was that the Editor in Chief would be the Group CEO.  Now was that also not notified to the newsroom - to the news people in advance?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You only got to know at the meeting?    Yes, okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Then let us go back to you - you were talking about the reaction of the listeners of the program …    To the cancellation of the program.  If you still want to say something you can continue.    The media statement which had announced the policy did it not make it clear that it was Mr Motsoeneng who had made the decision?    Did it simply say SABC without saying who?    Okay.  Well if it is we will check.  I just …    I just - I just think of this situation where people think you are the one who made the decision.    When you did not make the decision.    Yes, yes.    Thank you.    That is fine.    Actually earlier on I thought I had found the supplementary statement but I discovered that I had not.  Now I found it.   So you say the letter is attached to the supplementary statement?    Okay.  Yes, thank you.    Yes.  Well she can do one of two things.  One, if she able to tell me the main features of the contents of the letter without reading it.  Maybe reading one or two paragraphs that is fine but if you think there is particular importance you know reading the whole letter that will be fine.  What is your own sense?    Hm.    Okay (intervenes).    That is fine.    She may read it.    I - I take it that - that reference to Section 161(a) Chapter 2 in the Bill of Rights may have been a - a typo because the - you must have been referring to the Section 16.    Subsection 1(a) …   Which deals with freedom of expression and so on?    Yes, okay.  No that is fine.    When that happened there had been no response from Mr Motsoeneng to the letter or there had been?    Oh or was that the response?    Okay, hm.    Yes.    The disciplinary hearing.    Yes.    Before we - before we get to the DC what was the charge that the letter that called you to a disciplinary inquiry told you, you were going to face or charges?    Oh -oh is the letter at 27 - page 27 the one that you got …    Or does it reflect the charges?    Oh, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, but you say the charges referred to here …    Are basically the same?   Yes, okay.  Let us - let us hear what the charges are before we get to the actually hearing.  Maybe she can read.    Yes or just say what the charges are.    To the first ones?    Okay.    I am sorry.  Before that …    Am I right to think that paragraph 1.1 which you have just read seems to suggest that even raising concerns with this COO was a problem?    How - how can that be a problem when somebody raises concerns with - with you about issues at work?    Yes.    Hm.    Well may - may - maybe - maybe there might - in certain circumstances maybe there might be something about any allegation of leaking it outside but when one reads there one gets the sense that part of - of the problem is that you raised concerns.    And how - how does it become     Objectionable to these concerns?    And what do you do if you do not understand the directive …    Without raising concerns?    Hm.    Yes, okay.  Alright.  1.2.    Yes, yes.    Yes, okay.  Maybe for the sake of completeness you can read the …    The - the last two paragraphs.    Okay.  Before we proceed I just want to take you back to soon after you had sent the letter to Mr Motsoeneng and to the copies - copied other people including Mr Jimi Matthews.  You said that you had sent the letter on a Saturday and …    Oh a Sunday?    Yes and then you say - you said soon thereafter orwas it the following day Mr Jimi Matthews resigned?    Do -  do you know whether his resignation was connected in anyway with the stand that you would or what you said in the letter as a group or you do not …?    Yes.    You could not say?  Okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry.  What page?    Okay.    Well let me take you back before we proceed, let us go back to that meeting where you were confronted about the protestpolicy as you came to call it.   You said that Mr Krieger did say something, you said that you raised your hand you wanted to say something but you were not given a chance.  Were there other people who spoke at that meeting other than Mr Motsoeneng and I think you said Mr Jimmy Matthews also spoke, were there other people who spoke at the meeting, and if so what did they say?      I just want to make sure I don’t mix up issue, there’s only on meeting, I think that we have talked about so far, did it discuss both the issue of the problem – the editor’s forum and newspapers and the protest policy or was there no meeting at which the protest policy was discussed?      Oh so the protest policy was discussed because of that okay, so I got it right.      Okay so I got it right, okay so only those peoplespoke at that meeting?      Yes, yes okay thank you and I think we were – when I interrupted you we were about to talk about the disciplinary hearing and because I wanted to know what the charge were, we went to a letter that seems to have been a later letter, is that right?       Yes so I just want to make sure we don’t end up skipping the disciplinary hearing, what happened to it.      Yes the one that you got on the Thursday, you said you don’t have here but you would try to get it for us.      Was it the 16 t h of June, I think I saw some date the Thursday…[intervenes].      Okay.      And who was chairing it?      Okay.      I’m sorry, this DC you have mentioned a number of other colleagues of yours that came with you, but that DC was for you only or were there a number of you facing charges in the same disciplinary hearing?      So it was a joint disciplinary hearing?      Okay alright, you may continue.      You got this letter yes.          You were continuing?        Now there was no disciplinary hearing now?        Originally the idea was that there was going to be a disciplinary hearing.        And this letter of the 8 t h of July had said that your response had to reach them by 16h00 on Friday 15 July failing which the writer would assume that you had no answer to the allegations levelled against you.  So one could say well, if there was no response by the deadline, they might have taken the attitude that there’s no need for a hearing because these people are admitting these allegations but the response was filed and one would then have expected that there would then be a date for a disciplinary hearing but you say there was no such date, there was just a decision to fire?        Yes.        Okay something like the response has no merit or something like that?        Ja okay, yes?    We go back to what page?    Yes you must just remind me about the folder…[intervenes].     Because I close when we move to another page, I close completely.     Did you or people in the newsroom raise this to say, you have just said, you know, we are not going to have these newspapers anymore for – as part of austerity measures, how come we have, you know, stacks and stacks of the New Age?        To say is this austerity measures if you bring in this one and not just in big volumes.     By the time this – by the time of your disciplinary action and the removal of other newspapers do you have a recollectionof – about how long the New Age had been around in terms of being made available at SABC being delivered in big numbers?            You can’t remember?        But it had been there for some time?        Okay.     How much more time do you think we need before she’s done?     Oh okay no that’s – I was looking at her statement and I was thinking it’s less than that but that’s fine, I think let’s take the tea break, I think your watch and my watch are not giving us the exact time, mine is still a few minutes before quarter past but it’s okay there’s no point in starting another question now.   We will take the tea adjournment now and we’ll resume at half past eleven, we adjourn.    Yes let us proceed.    Okay thank you.    That is now SAFM?    Yes Okay.   And you would have made arrangements with that journalist about how long before the actual date of the State of the Nation Address?    The analyst that you had to cancel.  You would have made arrangements about how long before the State of the Nation Address day?    So long before?    Yes okay.    Oh you – you want to – you book them before your competitors book them?    Yes.    Yes but you say the instruction came from the top and I see in paragraph 20 of your statement that you say it was an email.  Who did the email come from? MS KRIVANI    Oh.  Oh okay.    Yes.      Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Who gave the verbal instruction?    Oh you heard it from your – do you call them supervisor or manager?    Ja but it did not necessarily come from …    Oh you were not called directly?   You heard it when it had been given?    Okay alright.  But in terms of who exactly it emanated from did you get to know that or was it just speculation?   Who was it?    Okay thank you.    Yes okay.  Let me just go back to this instruction thatthere would be no analysis of the State of the Nation Address.  Were you ever told why that – what the basis was for that instruction?  It just seems quite strange to me.  Well it might be a bad thing but I can understand an instruction that says, make sure you get analysts who will speak favourably.  Because then you know that the person who gives that instruction does not want people who will criticise the State of the Nation Address.  But the instruction seems to exclude even those who may have spoken well about the Nation Address – State of the Nation Address.  I wonder whether whoever gave the instruction had seen the State of the Nation Address and had taken a certain view of it that maybe lots of analysts would be very critical of it.  Did you ever get to understand what the basis was and did you get any information in regard to why this instruction was given?    Or maybe – maybe it was seen as better to simply say there would be no analysis because if you said only the followinganalyst then it becomes more blatant.    Yes okay.    It happens with law students and lawyers too.    Kind of explain.    Yes.  You – maybe you will deal with this.  You will remember Mr Pillay that earlier on I asked you whether you got to know whether his resignation was connected in any way with the letter that some of you had written.  I think in his response to Mr Krige’s statement Mr Jimi Matthews in his response to Mr Krige’s statement I think I read something along the lines that he said there were certain things that he had done of which he was not proud.  I got the impression that he was saying his resignation may have been connected with him coming to the conclusion that he had done certain things that he should not have done that were wrong and that people might not have expected from him.  That is the impression I got.  It might be a wrong impression that I got and that is part of the reason why I was asking whether you knew whether there was a connection because your letter raised certain issues which may or may not have made him to reflect.  Ja okay thank you.    I am sorry.  This thing of prohibiting analysis is quite strange.    Because analysis means you look at all angles of a story and you ask why this, why not that, why that and you comment where you know somebody has done well and – and you criticise wherethey have not done well.  It is meant to be an analysis and an analysis must be to the benefit of everybody because everybody is supposed to want to be exposed to all angles and perspectives to a story.    Hm.      The Portfolio Committee.    I take it that date 23 r d August is 23 r d August 2016?    Okay.  But so this instruction was now coming from …    From – it was coming from the executives?  Well I guess all of them were coming from one or other executive?    Okay so this was another occasion?    Yes.  But now were you told this time also why not?    Yes.    You were trying to make the best of a difficultsituation.    It was an acting GCEO/    At that time.    Yes.    Yes.  Well if you do not remember all of them it is fine I just wanted to have an idea so that one does not necessarily think of somebody who might not have been there, who might have left.    You know for example.  But this was also quite – I know the prohibition of the analysis in regard to this meeting was quite – would have been quite strange because of the job of a Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  The board and the executives go there becausethe Portfolio Committee exercises oversight and they need to get answers on what may be happening on certain things within the SABC and the public needs to know about that.  And there have been problems at SABC for many years and the public is – is supposed to know about that and they are supposed to know what is Parliament doing about it because it has an obligation to exercise oversight.  But that is being prohibited.    Hm.  Well that must be done and you – well being in the media you probably would know that I have said one of the things that the commission needs to do is to see to what extent Parliament exercised its oversight obligations properly in regard to the executives, in regard to various government departments and SOE’s.  So that if at the end of the work of the commission I conclude that indeed there was State Capture I can look at what is it that Parliament could have done? Did they do it?  If they failed was there justification for them failing to do what they could have done because otherwise it may well be that things might have been arrested before they got to where they got to. And also the question of the levels of corruption.  One has got to ask has Parliament and its various Portfolio Committees have they exercised their constitutional obligations the way they should?  And because it may be that if they have not and if they had exercised their obligations properly a lot of damage could have been avoided.    Yes.  Well probably it would be good to even get that kind of correspondence.    An exchange of correspondence because you would have been doing nothing more than saying Parliament must perform its job.    And from what you say it looks like it took quite some time before it happened and maybe if you had not persisted the way Iunderstand you did maybe it might not have happened. So – so that plus any other information that you at SABC and other people at SABC might have that would give this commission a picture of how the communications committee was exercising its oversight over the years if you have got any information then the commission would really welcome that.    Yes.  Thank you.      I am sorry.  Probably my ignorance.  What does it mean to say we have removed news and replaced it with content?    Other than news?    Adverts?    Oh okay.    Yes okay.    Okay.    Hm.    So – so what did this mean?  Look at your editorial policy we have removed news and replaced it with content.  What did that mean?  Did he remove anything in the policy relating to news?  Or what did that mean?  I am trying to understand it.  Firstly I did not understand the – the context which you have now explained but what did it actually mean?  What was there that was removed and where was it removed and what did it say?    Oh, okay.  Okay but the watering down was taken care of in the policy because he says look at the Editorial Policy or …?    Ja.    Hm.    Oh.  In the policy?    Policy?    Okay, okay.  Thank you and the effect of that was - was what at a practical level in the newsroom?    Debates?    Oh you would just report?    Ja.    Without having debates and so on and so …?   But watered down?    Okay.  So at a practical level would you like have to tell your - your guests if they were going to talk to say well do not be too harsh or anything?  How would it work or you would be careful in how you choose them?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  Thank you.    Oh.  In other words more than whatever …    Be prescribed by ICASA?    Okay, which - which would be more in any event?    Okay.    At this meeting was the - was the Acting GCEO there or the highest ranking executive was Mr Motsoeneng?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, okay.    Yes.    Hm.    It was recorded?    Yes.    Huh-uh.   Okay.  So - so this is not just based on your notes?    It was mechanically recorded as well?    Oh.    Yes, but …    But you say …    There was a mechanical recording?    Yes, okay.  Alright.    I am - I am sorry.  Did you say page 1-6?    Oh 1-7.  Okay.    Oh yes, okay.  Yes.    Comply with the instruction?    Hm.    Hm.  Did you understand or do you understand how it is possible to speak of the SABC being independent but the journalists - the individuals not being independent?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    So effectively he would determine where the independence starts and where it - it would end?    And the journalists had to simply that whatever he did he took into account independence and theirs must just be to comply?    Hm.  Okay.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    Oh, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    So he was the finance person?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    Hm, hm.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.  Yesterday I heard evidence from Ms Mokhobo who was Group CEO at some stage at the SABC that within a week orwithin - ja within a week or so after her appointment as GCEO she was taken by Mr Motsoeneng to meet the Guptas who wanted to congratulate him (sic).  As at this time was there any knowledge generally speaking within SABC as to whether Mr Motsoeneng had any relationship with the Guptas …    Or is that something that you - ja.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Okay.    And he was part of the eight?    You - you were permanent?   And he was a freelancer.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Their situations.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Ja, it is - it is - it is a reality.  I - I often express the concern even with regard to the court of the Commission that there must be many people in Government departments and maybe some who in the past were Ministers and maybe some are still Ministers and some who - who may have been DGs, Deputy DGs and so on and CEOs of some SOEs who must have a lot - they know that should be brought before the Commission but who have not done so and some of them may be - it is that kind of situation. They are employed in Government and they have a fear that if they were to come and reveal what they know either they would lose their jobs or they might fear that something else might happen …    To them emanating from whoever they might implicate and it is - it is quite a challenge because on the one hand you do not want to close your eyes to your reality but at the same time you say can we change the country for the better if we do not know exactly what happened.    If we do not know the full extent of what may have happened.    So it becomes quite a difficult thing.  You - it is difficult to criticise people who are in that situation but at the same time you - you know that there - there may be people - there may be still a lot of people who - who can afford to come forward who are not as desperate - who are not as in as desperate a situation as some people maybe but it - it becomes quite difficult.    Striking the balance you - you admire those who are able to come forward because it is because of people who have behaved like that who have come forward who have had that courage that some of the things have come to the fore and without those people come forward.  Lots of things might have happened which did not happen because they come - came forward and the country could be in a worse situation. So - so we as a nation need to make it clear how much we appreciate those in various Government departments, State Owned Entities and just in community who come forward and say this is my country.  I know things that have gone wrong.  There is an opportunity to make a contribution that might help with the change.  I will come forward.  I know that it is not risk free but I will come forward and I will play my role. So - so - but one just does not know what to do to encouragemore people while accepting that there are some who definitely would like to but feel that their situation is too desperate.    Ja.  So - so I understand, ja.  Thank you.    Well I see at paragraph 17 of Mr Matthews’ statement        No, no I understand that – it will be important that media people like yourselves, journalist and people at SABC, they keep track of the progress of the Commission because at a certain stage I would be very interested in getting submissions from various stakeholders as to what they think would be the right recommendations to make in regard to their own situations or their own institutions with regard to may have happened in the past in their own institutions to make sure that if those recommendations are implemented it never happens again.  So it will be important that, you know,  people in the media, journalists and everybody who is concerned with the media, they begin to reflect on what types of recommendations they would like to put forward before me to consider for when I have to make my recommendations in regard to various sectors that the Commission has been looking at.     But I also wanted to ask the question, you referred to some of your colleagues, who, when these things were happening to the newsroom and to the SABC8 came to you and gave you support but indicated that they couldn’t give you open support or couldn’t take the same stand because of their situation.  Those people were fearing losing their jobs, maybe Mr Motsoeneng had the power to dismiss them, but I don’t imagine he had power to dismiss the acting GCEO to the extent that Mr Jimi Matthews may have been acting GCEO at that time maybe that is a different time because I’m trying to understand his fear of Mr Motsoeneng of saying no to him and saying – he says it was difficult to argue with him it was difficult to take a different view to him.  My question is, he was so senior, why was it so difficult, now you may or may not be able to explain that to me as you understood the situation.  It may be that you say, look I know how the situation was, maybe the acting GCEO would tremble when Mr Motsoeneng stepped in or came into the room, I don’t know, I’m trying to understand why,somebody at that senior level would feel that they couldn’t stand their ground against Mr Motsoeneng.  Now it may be that if this was during the time when he was acting GCEO the fact that he was acting meant that he remained as vulnerable as if he was not acting because he could go back to his position in due course and then he could be dismissed.  It may be that he was not acting GCEO at the time, he was just in his position but I’m wondering even if he was not acting GCEO at the position which he occupied which might not necessarily have been above that of Mr Motsoeneng and might not even have been, maybe at the same level I don’t know, whether nevertheless somebody at that level, although it would be unreasonable to have expected that somebody at that level would stand up and say no.        In a long time?    Well maybe others are witnesses – among the other witnesses from the SABC who will give evidence there may be somebody who might be able to give their own perspective in regard to that.  I know that yesterday Miss Mokhobo also testified that there was a time before she decided to leave the SABC, apart from her fights and disagreement with the, then, Chairperson of the Board Ms Tshabalala she said she had lot of fights with Mr Motsoeneng, now Mr Motsoeneng I take it was at a lower level because obviously Group CEO is the ultimate within the executive management but from what she said, I got the impression that Mr Motsoeneng, and I hope I’m not being unfair to him and I hope I’m not misconstruing Miss Mokhobo’s evidence but I got the impression that she was saying Mr Motsoeneng was also kind of pressurising her to leave or making life difficult for her and part of what I’d like to know is,  what was going on,  how is it possible for this person who is not the CEO, who  is the COO, of course that’s still quite a high position to seem to have power to  make   it difficult not just forpeople under him but even those who are above him to just  make life difficult with the result that maybe he was just getting things his way, but you will not be able to explain, maybe somebody will be able to explain yes, thank you.            Yes you can go ahead ja.        Thank you very much Miss Pillay and once again thank you for coming to share with the Commission your experiences and what you know, we appreciate it, if a need arises we will ask you to come back, but thank you very much and you are excused.        Thank you.        We are at ten to one and maybe your watch says we are at eight minutes to one.       Okay, yes I guess maybe we should start the next witness at two?        Because it’s just ten minutes …[intervenes].        If we try to start now we would have to break before much has been said.      Okay we’ll take the lunch adjournment now and we’ll resume at two o’clock, we adjourn.    Are you ready Ms Norman?    Yes.    Good afternoon.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you.      Yes you may proceed.    No Mr Phiri you can …    You can start from anywhere because you know sometimes maybe if you start in a certain way people think you belong to a certain age group.  So start where you want to start.    Different sectors.    Ja.    I am sorry did you say she did not give you reasons    Ja.    Did you say acting COO or acting CEO?   CEO?    Okay in 2018?    And who was the acting CEO at the time?    Oh you forget the surname?    Okay no that is fine I am sure we will find out.    Yes okay you may continue.    The COO?    Chris Maluleka?  Okay.    Who would take the whole process forward?    Hm.   But I am sorry.    Before you go for – forward let us go back to the actual program.  Are you saying that its nature was that you would look for people who are knowledgeable in different sectors?    And bring them in and interview them?    Ja.  If it was something that needed Home Affairs you might bring the Minister of Home Affairs. If it was something relating to energy you might bring in the Minister of Energy and maybe you might bring in an expert on energy, that kind of thing.  That is what is was dealing with.    And then – and then you would ask questions and there would be answers and so on?    That is what it was like?    Okay alright thank you.    So – oh there would be some notice?    Well before – before you proceed.  You said that you were bringing into the program people that the management did not like?    Why did you bring only people that the management did not like?    Yes but were you bringing in a mix of people so therewould – there were some that management liked or should have liked and there were some that they did not like and maybe should not have not liked.    Okay alright.    Is this now between the date when you received the notice to say your program will come to an end in 30 days’ time   Oh this is before okay.  Okay alright.    Oh okay.  Okay.  Ms Norman     I think he had not finished saying what happened.    But it may be that you might wish to finish everything that happened before.    Yes.    Yes because…    There was the question of the process not being taken forward in terms of which he and the COO were supposed to talk further.    To meet and so on.    Yes.    She did not give you any response?    Oh but did you speak to her?  She – did she just stand there and not say anything or did you just send something in writing?    In writing oh okay.    And you did not get any response?    Hm.    But I am sorry.  But actually as I understand the position from what you have said although you had been given notice that a decision had been taken that the program would come to an end in 30 days’ time or so.    There had been subsequent developments namely your meeting with the acting CEO and in terms of that meeting the process was still going to go forward.  You and the CEO were still going to meet?    And I would imagine that it would be reasonable to think that until that process had been taken    Forward you could not take that notice to remainvalid.    Hm.    Because you did not know what would be the outcome of your further consult meetings with the COO?    It could result in you agreeing that the program should come to an end.    Or you could persuade the COO that there is value in the program continuing.    Okay.    From what time to what time did you used to have the program?   Hm okay.  So it was thirty minutes?    But very popular?    Okay.    Oh but did it end or did it not end when the thirty days was up?  Let us complete that.    Without any further discussion?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.   And this was which year now?    2014?    Okay.    Oh there would be proof.    Ja.    Yes.    But I think she was – she was asking before that what you have said is important but I think she was asking how you managed to hide Ms Madonsela herself when she came to the SABC?    Yes.    Yes.    So the day when she was going to have this interview with you and which was going to be recorded happened to be the day when she was going to be at SABC anyway for other programs?    Okay.    I am sorry.    If you wanted to invite somebody to come and participate in your program or to be recorded for your program were you required to notify anybody beforehand that this is the person you are inviting for that day and they were supposed to approve or notapprove or where you free to invite whoever you thought would be good for your program?    And - and it is at that meeting that other people might get to know what your plans are in terms of inviting anybody?    And they can express their views if they want to but normally you decide?    Hm.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    But it is nothing more than advice?    Okay.   No.  Twice you said fighters.    Ja.    As you suspected would happen?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Had cancelled it?    Hm.    Hm, hm.    But the - the tape you were holding onto was the - the second one or the alternative one?    Yes.  So - but …    But those who took the other one may have thought that there would be no - it would not be shown because they were having the tape.  They did not know about the second tape.  Did they?    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay, but he brought back the tape?    Oh, okay.  Hm.    I am sorry.    You were saying that Mr Malema or the EFF when they did not see the interview being shown on that - that evening.  They thought the program or that interview had been cancelled.  I think you were about to say something about whether there is anything they did about it.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.   Okay.    Is that Mr Motsoeneng?    Huh-uh.    Is - is that very quickly?    Ja, okay.  Hm.    He did it like lightning?    Yes.    Now you spoke about somebody moving from being producer to COO.  Are you talking about Mr Motsoeneng when you talk - when you say that?    Yes.  He - did he producer level to COO?    Yes and how many levels are there from COO to C - I mean from producer to COO more or less?    So - so normally to get to COO one could be expected if you got through the ranks as you were saying earlier on to go at least through most of them?    Yes.    Okay.    Maybe before that …   Maybe before that - I am sorry.    Mr Phiri it is - it is really strange it seems to me that the newsroom had at some stage this type of situation that you have described.  Particularly the newsroom of a public broadcaster where you have to - I do not know if you used the word - maybe you did not use the word sneak in but you know bring in people that you think have something to contribute for the listeners or for the public. You have to bring in - bring them in secretly and - and you have to record - when you record them you - you fear that somebody from high up is going to come and demand the tape and you will never be able to have it on air to the extent that you have to - you had to resort to absenting yourself from the building for - for I assume a number of hours and come back at 5 o’ clock just to make sure that the tape would not be taken away from you and that the public would be able to - to view - to watch the interview. It just seems a very strange environment that in - for any journalist in South Africa in 2014 with our Constitution and the kind of democracy that we have it is just - I mean as you were telling me it was like can that really be South Africa.  Could that kind of thing happen?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Well I am sure there will be those in - in - incidents will be told to - to me in due course as well but you did say they are covered in an affidavit that you had prepared.  It is important that one gets the full picture of what is - what - what happened because one does not want a situation where you think you have got the full picture and somebody else comes and says no, no that is not the full picture. Actually what Mr Phiri was telling you was just an exception.  If you - I can give you a full picture and when you have the full picture you will see that things were not as he described them …    But also we do not want a situation where we mightthink it is an isolated incident that you have told me about if it was not an isolated incident.  If there were many more it is important that one gets the full picture.    Okay.  Thank you.    But you say you - you were saying what somebody else told you namely that he had been asked by Mr Matthews to come to the newsroom and stop the program?    Ja.  So what you were saying is what that person said.  Namely insofar as he mentioned Mr …    Jimi Matthews name?    Yes.    Yes.  It is that person who would know whether it is true or not but that is what the person said?    Yes, ja.    Yes, yes, yes.    Yes.  So the part that - that is what you heard being told to your team from that person that remains.    What you do not know is whether …    He was telling the truth in - in saying Mr Matthews had sent him?    That is what you do not know?    When you say your program is not on air.  Are you referring to …?    The - to question time?    You - you wish it to be restored - to come back?    Yes.    Yes, okay.  Okay.    That is all.   You - you were there at the SABC for all the time that Mr Motsoeneng was COO or Acting COO.  Is that right?    Did you have many dealing with him directly yourself?    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Okay.  I - I was just looking for - I was wondering whether you might be able to explain or make us - give us a picture of why it is that it looks like he was very influential within the - within SABC.  Earlier on I heard evidence and Mr Jimi Matthews in his response to the statements of other witnesses has said that Mr Motsoeneng was the kind of person that - it was difficult to disagree with or have a fight with or - or express different views from his and I was thinking you might be able to give me a picture as to whether that was your feeling as well. That was your view and what the basis was for even somebody as senior as Mr Jimi Matthews not feeling that he could stand up and say no I do not agree with you to Mr Motsoeneng.  That is something you - you are unable to - to do.  To give a picture that might explain that.   Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Must be - yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Consultation?    Hm, hm.  Okay, okay.  No thank you.    Thank you very much Mr Phiri.  Thank you.    Yes.    Too good?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Or private interest?    Hm.    Hm, hm.  No, no …    Yes, yes.  No, no I mean the media is crucial in any democracy, I mean the matters that this Commission is investigating a lot of them came to the fore because of the media, because of journalists, courageous journalists who investigated certain things and put them forward then the public began to realise that there were certain things that needed further investigation, so the role of the media is really crucial but as you may have heard when I spoke to Ms Pillay journalists all over are invited to reflect on what kind of recommendations this Commission should consider making at the end of its work that would achieve what you are talking about, so I will be very interested at the right time to receive input from the media people themselves and take them into account in making recommendations that I would make, so all of you can start working.    Yes, yes.  No thank you very much, thank you for coming to share your evidence with the Commission, if we need to ask you to come back we may ask you but for now you are excused.    Thank you.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay, okay.    Okay no that’s fine.    What is happening, I have been talking aboutpeople’s names not being spelt correctly.    G-c instead of G-q?    You will make arrangements for these pages to be replaced by pages that have got the correct spelling?     Yes.    Yes, no that’s fine.  That’s the norm isn’t it, outside of the Commission?   Annexures and just attached without these dividers that you people like.    Maybe let us admit this – the file containing the statement of Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki will be marked as EXHIBIT CC29.    Okay.    Yes administer the oath or affirmation    Thank you very much Ms Gqubule-Mbeki.  Thank you, you may proceed.    Well I see the one is a statement, the others may be ...(intervention)     I see that it was done at a police station nevertheless.    One statement, ja.    Too many to mention.    Ja, you see the humility prevents her from saying all of them.    Okay.    That’s Mr Krige?    Yes.    I cannot remember whether he talked about the contents, the discussion.    Yes, maybe you can deal with that.   This is 2016?    Yes, I just want to locate it in terms of time what you are talking about.    Just remind me what his position was at the time Head of News or Acting Head of News.   And Head of News or Acting Head of News would be Head of News for Radio and TV?    Okay and Digital, yes.    During the Eighties?    I’m sorry is that now still back at the meeting or was it after?     Oh, okay, that is the meeting where he said don’t – the journalists mustn’t show the full extent of what was happening in Pretoria.    Oh, okay, okay.   Okay.    Just give the English version, so ...(intervention)     Yes.    Oh, okay let’s finish that meeting first, how did it end, just give me some more discussion at that meeting where we – you were looking for support and there wasn’t support forthcoming and soon.    You tried to raise it with him but it did not work.    Mmm.    I’m sorry let’s try if you can remember, we know it was 2016, do you remember the month or even the date ...(intervention)     Maybe it is such an important meeting you would remember even the date ja.    (laughing) okay.    Okay, oh it would – before the elections, so the elections would have been May I think.    More or less, they were not in June I think that’s for sure, so they would have been in May or April, I’m not sure the elections.    Or maybe – I may be mistaken actually, I may be mistaken, I think it’s the National ones that are normally held in April or May, 2016 was local government elections, I think those were in August.    Okay but now I seem to remember I think they were  held after May, it might have been even August, the local government elections, if I’m not mistaken, but I wanted to have a sense of roundabout when in 2016 it was, but you’re saying roundabout mid- 16.    No that’s fine, but winter.    The two of you now?     Ja, is this the following day or same day of the meeting where they sought to operationalise the ...(intervention)     But the same day or different days?    Oh okay, alright.  You went to see the Freedom ofExpression Institute?    Mmm?    You had just heard for the first time at this meeting about this policy or you had heard about it before but they had not started operationalising it?    Okay, okay.    Just to make sure one understands at the Freedom ofExpression Institute did you leave there to go back on the basis that they were going to look into the issues you have raised to see how to help you?    Okay, right.  So you went back.    Do you know whether at that stage they were acting simply because they might have seen in the media that the SABC was implementing, they adopted this policy or whether they may have been contacted by the Freedom of Expression Institute or anything or you don’t know?    Yes, okay.  Yes I think I – we interrupted you while you were telling us about the – continuing to tell us about the meeting, the diary meeting I think.    She needed to take a position.      Before you got served with suspension letters both at the first meeting and at the diary meeting did he ever provide whatever it is that he regarded as justification for saying that  1. The protests in Pretoria should not be shown properly the way it should be shown by journalists and 2. For saying that the protests by the right to know organisation should not be shown. Did he provide any reasons?    And did he ever say who the instruction came from?    You knew where it came from?    Yes.  Did it come from Mr Motsoeneng?    Yes.  Okay.    Hm.    Yes.  No I am done you can continue.    Yes.    I guess that if it is the editor who decides that is more acceptable to the journalists in the newsroom than if it is somebody outside of the newsroom, is that right?    Yes.    There are debates and disagreements.    And robust debates.    Yes, yes.  But there everybody is used to that and everybody knows in the end the editor has a job to do and sometimes you will agree with him or her, sometimes you will not agree but what is most unacceptable is somebody from outside deciding?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Now when there were instructions such as these that you were very opposed to and that came from the COO or acting COO did you consider that you could go to the CEO or acting CEO and say but this is what the COO is saying and it is unacceptable to us and that maybe there could be an intervention or was there – was the position that no intervention from the CEO was expected to happen once the COO had spoken?    So was – after that was he like the [indistinct] CEO?    And the Omega.      That is yourself, Mr Krige and Ms Pillay?    Oh Ms Venter.    So does that make four?    Okay so it was yourself, Ms Venter and Mr Krige?    Okay.    One by one.    Okay.[    Yes.    Yes.    So when you were called you were just given the letter of suspension without any discussion of any consequence really or there was some discussion?    The suspension was with immediate effect?    So – but this – I am sorry – was – this was a suspension and not a dismissal as yet.    Okay alright.    And that is – is that the term he used part ways?    Maybe before – I am sorry     I am sorry.  The letter said you were suspended until what would happen?  Until a hearing or what?  Usually you would be suspended pending a disciplinary hearing.    Hm  I…    Okay maybe – maybe she can have a look at it.    But is – do you have any recollection whether it said something along those lines that you were suspended to and you must appear at a disciplinary hearing on a certain date and that these were    Yes.    Insubordination yes.    A hearing.    Oh.    Yes okay, okay.  They will check if you think it is the same.  But if later on there is a chance of getting the one that was addressed to you that would be helpful.    Yes,  yes okay.    But you might not recall the exact wording that was used to describe the charges or what the letter said you had done wrong but you would – do you remember that whatever the wording was it related to the stand you had taken against this policy and against the instructions that have been given that you have told me about.    That much you know.    Ja okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry.  There was – was it Mr Krige or Ms Pillay oh it was Ms Pillay who was asked to submit representations by four o’clock on a certain date I think.    So that did not happen – oh it happened with you as well?    But was the date the same?    Oh okay, okay.   Yes.    Labour court.  Yes okay.      Yes, ys.    Basically the economic implications of what happened as a result of the dismissal of Mr Nene?    Yes.    9 t h December 2015.    This is now in relation to the 9 t h December 2015 where about are we when that happened when…    On the 10 t h.    Okay   And when you were asked to – not to deal with this in your coverage was that something you expected by then that could happen and it could come from the person that came from or it was strange that she came to you – that she came with that instruction or request.    But why was she coming to you?  Why did she like think you were going to say it is because of the President necessarily?    Oh outside.    Okay.    Sorry, sorry Ms Norman.  That instruction is it one of those in respect of which he would say it was not just coming from her it was coming from the COO even though she might not have said so herself or you do not know?    Yes.    That is Ms Nyana.    Molete.    Okay.    Is it Molete or    Yes okay.    Did Ms Molete tell you where she got the file from that she was giving you?    On the first line of.    Paragraph 10 in brackets it is written Ms can you see that in your statement.    That is an error.    Oh it is a man okay.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes did he tell you where he got the file from when he gave it to you?    Gave it to him?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    Yes.  I know there is a lot of ground to cover.    Well there are two possibilities.    Depending on what the situation is tomorrow in terms of witnesses and in terms of Ms Gqubule-Mbeki’s own situation.    We could stop and continue tomorrow or we couldcontinue.  I am available we could continue until five.    If you are available and Ms Gqubile-Mbeki is available.    Yes.    Would that be convenient to you?    Okay alright let us continue then.    Or maybe we should take a…    Some comfort break of ten minutes.    Yes.    Okay let us resume at ten past four.    We adjourn.    Yes.  Let us proceed.    And …    Maybe to also emphasise that that is not to pressurise you not to tell your story.    You know.  You - you would know what you would like to put forward as part of telling the Commission what you experienced and - and so in the end we want to do justice to - to that while - while you are here.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Phew.    The - the first one.  You said it was directed at Ms Venter?    But you did not get it from her.  You got it from another number.  In other words she is not the one who forwarded it to you to see what she had received?    Oh, was shared?    Oh.    Oh.  So - so I was wondering whether - I was wondering it came to you if it was not sent - if it was directed at her and it was not sent to you by her and I was wondering whether the idea was to intermediate, threaten you as well and others by letting you know what was being directed at her but you say that it was …    It was sent to the common WhatsApp group?    Yes.    Oh.  It was sent to her and then she sent it - she - she shared it on the - on the group …    WhatsApp group?    Okay, alright.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    And how - how far was this in terms of time now and date from the date when you were dismissed?  Where are we in terms of time when this was happening?    After you had been reinstated?   Oh.  So this is likely to have happened after you had been reinstated?    These two threats?    Yes.  Oh that is - does that mean that there may have been quite a very tense opposition to your reinstatement and those people might not have wanted you to be reinstated?    Yes, okay.    Yes.    I guess that this was to say we know your - your child.  We know your daughter or something like that as part of intimidation or threats maybe.    Hm.  Okay.   Obviously you would be concerned if people who are threatening you know your child.    Therefore can identify or recognise her …    Somewhere?    Ja, okay.    They took statements, they took your phones.  Did they come back to say our investigation has challenges because of A, B, C, D or we - there is no way we can establish who was behind this thing?  Did they come back to make that report back or anything like that?    Huh-uh.    Hm, hm.    Was behind them?    Hm, okay.    Hm.    Up to today?    So it was just the acknowledgment of receipt of correspondence and saying the investigation was going on but nothing further?    And that was 2016?    And now it is 2019.    2017?    Okay.  Now it is 2019.    Yes.    I am - I am sorry.  Before that did you get to know where the text message came from that went to Mr Moosajee.    You not - okay, alright.    But you had been invited to serve on it?    On the board.  Invited by whom?    Oh of - of the - of a company called …?   Yes.    But when you discovered after he had invited you that the company was going through liquidation or he is the one who told you?    Hm.    Oh after you had started …    Attending meetings there?    Oh.    Yes.    So you had become a board member …    Before it went into liquidation?    Okay.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Was - was she in anyway involved with that company (intervenes)/    She was?    Okay.    This was now a SABC security or …?    Yes.    Without any appointment you knew nothing about this?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.   Huh-uh.    This is in November 2017 according to …?    Paragraph 20.    Would this have been now out of the blue in the sense that it was not closed to the events of your dismissal and your reinstatement?    Yes.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    The - the names of these people the security guy.    You - I guess you would know because he was SABC based.  Is that right?    And then this off duty police - policeman obviously you got to know the name?    Yes.    Was anything done particularly in regard to hisconduct to - from your side to take it further?  As soon as they left you alone you decided you did not want to do anything about it?  Just want - it just sounds very strange that when he is off duty he is engaged in something like that and it is not clear exactly what - why he would be involved in - in that when he is off duty.    Yes.  That is - that is why I want to find out whether anything was done later to report his conduct because how can he being a police officer and then being off duty carry out instructions from anywhere other than from the police.  (Intervenes).    Hm.    Yes.    But - but as far as you know nothing further happened or nothing happened to him after that about his conduct?    Yes.  I do not see his name here.  Have you given the name to - to the Commission by any chance?    Yes.  I - I think - I think that is very concerning and …    Something needs to - that kind of conduct needs to be reported.    Ja.  It - it may well be that if what you have in this statement because maybe it might not be focusing enough on his conduct.  It may be that it is not enough.  It may be that it might be necessary to do another statement that focuses on what his role was in that whole thing.  Alright.    Yes.    But - but you will - you will - you will indicate if it is something you would rather not raise again or - or what?  I am just saying that because sometimes when people have gone through certain situations sometimes they - they do not want to have those things - those stories revisited but it is something that concerns me quite a lot and it is not something that one would wish to just go away like that.    Okay.    That was a very scary thing.  Please tell me about it.    And that in itself was dangerous?    Roundabout when did this incident happen?  2017, 18?    Okay.    You decided to litigate?    Somebody you knew?    Oh you didn’t know him before.  Yes, okay.    But he is also employed by the lift company?    Yes.  So ...(intervention)     Yes.    Yes, yes.    Mmm.    But this is 2018 isn’t it, this is 2018, it is no longer 14, 2016, it is – or was it an old board?    This is the interim board, ja.    By the way you were reinstated within weeks after you were dismissed isn’t it?    Within weeks, so you didn’t stay out of SABC for a long time?    Little less than a month.  But once you got the name of the person who had been chasing you, endangering your lives like that, apart from going to the Board did you go to the CEO, the COO or people like that, apart from Mathebula?    But before a law firm could be asked to do anything I would have thought that the first thing that would happen would be to – for the CEO or Acting CEO to say well if this guy has – is supposed to be employed by the SABC who is in charge of that person, how did that happen, I want that person to come here, I want to find out and do an internal investigation to establish exactly what is happening before you even go outside.  That didn’t happen or you don’t know?    Should be halted?    And was any issue taken up with Schindler, with the life company?    But did the SABC ever call upon this guy to answer to say you know this is what we – what has been found out, what was going on, what do you have to say, as far as you know there’s nothing like that?    Yes at some stage.    Yes.    So as far as you know is this person still, is this person back at SABC even as we speak, or the last time you knew he was back?    Said she must make sure what?    Yes.  What position is she in now, she was acting CEO at the time of the incident?    She has since left the corporation?    And she left before there was finality on the matter?    Mmm.  This is quite concerning because it happened in the context of what appears to have been continued acts of threat and intimidation that may have been connected with the stance you took, you and others took against the protest policy and against instructions that were being given to the newsroom that wereobjectionable.    I mean I – when I read your statement and all the things that you have talked about here and also what some of the other witnesses from the SABC 8 who have given evidence talked about, it just seemed a very strange phenomenon that was happening around the SABC 8.  I mean the manner in which I mean, Ms Venter’s house was broken into in circumstances which appear to have been intimidation, threats and then Mr Chris (indistinct) or somebody was held at gunpoint roundabout the time, that time and then you were receiving as the SABC 8 threatening messages all of which seemed to be connected with this stance you were taking simply about you know certain directives and the protest policy and then you were chased like this, I mean when you read how you describe in your statement and affidavit how you were chased you are lucky that no car accident, no accident occurred as a result of trying to run away from the person who was chasing you and then there is this incident which you were talking about where the off-duty policeman, where they just wanted you to go to the police station and all of that and all of these things all seemed to be left hanging.    I mean we certainly don’t see ourselves as theCommission as people who can solve everything but we certainly should do what we can in regard to particularly matters that seem quite connected with what we are investigating, because it may well be that certain people were prepared to go to very great lengths to try and make sure that people who stood against certain things at SABC were dealt with and if one is going to look at what ultimately might need to be recommended to try and prevent similar things happening in the future, one needs to understand the full extent of what was happening, so I think that the investigators who must follow these things up and the legal team can guide them.    But I think they  must be followed up and I would like to be updated in a few weeks time as to how far they have gone to try and establish, get full clarity about some of these things and some of these characters that were involved, the police officer who was involved in this thing and the handling of the matter relating to somebody that is known by the SABC who chased SABC staffers and almost got them killed because anything could have happened with them driving you know through red robots and whatever, but it just seems like the matter was not being given the seriousness and urgency that it deserved, so I would like if you can take that further and get the investigators to look into all of those things, I would like to be updated before the end of September as to how far everything is.    Mmm.    Yes, okay no that’s fine.    Yes, I think it’s better that we finish.    Ja.    I’m sorry, let me interrupt you. Mr Pretorius, I know we need to meet but I know we need to meet but it may be that if your other commitments dictate that maybe we should rather me tomorrow morning that would be fine.    But I can hear you.    Okay.    Yes so, we’ll continue but if while we are continuing you think let’s rather me tomorrow feel free to leave and then you can talk to me later in the evening.    Okay, alright. Thank you.    Candidates for a position that you had applied for?    The current position?    Okay, hm.    One or the other or two or ja?    And this was when now in terms? This was 2018?    It’s very mysterious. So many things really are mysterious.    When you look at all of these things that were happening to the SABC 8 and some of them happening to individualswho were in the SABC 8 like yourself and Ms Venter maybe more particularly ones which stretched into 2018 and so on. Are you able to say there may be other things other than the stand you took against so-called protest policy and directives that were issued in 2016 that you are able to link this with? To say, it maybe it’s this and that and that and maybe it’s not part of it. It’s not connected with that stance you took or are you only able to say, if it’s connected with anything it looks like it can only be connected with the stand you took then?    You don’t know? Yes.    Yes.    And comparing the 2013 policy and the one that had been prepared by Webber Wentzel, you would have no issues with the 13 one? It was fine as well?    Hm but it had almost been forgotten. Not many people knew about it.    That is Jimmy Matthews?    And who?    Yes, okay    Yes.    Well, I’m sorry before.    Now that you raised the issue of journalists being accountable that they’ve got accountability, you may or may not know that I have on a few occasions complained that journalists and media houses are very much in the habit of giving people about whom they have stories to write very inadequate time to respond, very short notice. We here in the Commission have been subjected to the same thing and it looks like whatever appeal I make to the media to say, not just us everybody please just give people adequate time to put their side of the story. It looks like they say, ah we don’t care about that. You get the impression that if journalists or editors think that they’ve got a scope or whatever they don’t care about somebody else’s rights. Even the kind of notice that they sometimes give it’s like they think everyone must be sitting and doing nothing and just waiting for them to write and say please comment my deadline is tomorrow. And they must drop everything and respond because they give you that short notice so that in the article, they’ll be able to say he did not come back to us. We invited him or her to comment, he didn’t but actually they give you an extremely short notice to do anything and I don’t understand why so many journalists appear to think it’s right to do that. I suspect that it’s their own concerns, maybe selfish concerns about being the one who comes out with the story first and so on. But if the same things were to be done to them, they wouldn’t. They would find this unacceptable. So,you wonder where are these principles of fairness that we are all told are so entrenched in journalism. So, I just mentioned that for what it’s worth because I have mentioned it on a few occasions in regard to other people but in regard to the Commission as well you know. I think sometime early this year or last year the Commission was approached on Saturday afternoon by a Sunday newspaper to say, we must comment. They want to run a story the following day. I mean, what is that? Are we supposed to be sitting and doing nothing and just waiting in case one or other newspaper rights and says, comment? So, we must be available to comment within 24 hours. It’s just unacceptable but it’s happening and something must be found to correct it because nobody would like that kind of thing to be done to them when they are on the other side of this thing. So, I mention it for what it’s worth. You are quite senior in the field and you may or may not be able to say, well this is the justification why people do this in the industry or you might be able to raise it where and whatever fora. To say you know, there is really concern about this kind of thing. I mean whatever the person has done you know, process is different from the merits. Just make sure that the process is fair you know. So, okay alright. That was just my thought.    Yes, no thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes. It’s quite important because even for the professional journalists if I’m the subject of the story that a particular journalist writes. I must be able whatever the story says about me, I must be able to say, this journalist was just doing her job; was just doing his job and it’s nothing personal. And I must be able to say, even though I disagree with this and that and that but he or she is just doing her job and she has followed a fair process. But when I’m not given adequate time, I’m likely to think this journalist doesn’t care about my rights as an individual. He or she just cared about being the first want to come up with a story and I don’t think that’s a good perception that the profession she’d want to have. I would have thought that all self-respecting journalists would want a situation where you might writeabout somebody but that person would be able to say, there’s nothing personal. You are just doing your job and you are not being sent by certain people to write certain things about me. You have not been captured. You are just doing your job. But when some of these things happen, I think it taints the image of the profession because too many people think journalists are not fair. They are driving certain agendas against certain people and it’s not good that the public should have that kind of perception about such an important profession. Okay alright, thank you.    Yes.    The Chairperson of the board of SABC, the current group CEO Mr Mxakwe and now yourself. All of you have spoken about the situation in which the SABC finds itself with no funding coming. And the sense I’ve got each time each one of you I mean whenever each one of you spoke is that the SABC is or may well be on the brink of a calamity which could happen anytime. Is my understanding correct?   Yes.    Are you able to put your finger on whether there are any legitimate reasons that people within the SABC think may be behind this situation or what you may be thinking why the SABC is allowed to be in, to stand on the brink of this calamity when that could be avoided? And from what I’ve heard could have been avoided by funding being provided months ago?    And that is where everything revolves. And well, Mr Mxakwe told me that the situation is so bad that he finds himself, he finds that every week he has to speak to his executive colleagues to ask them not to resign. Which seemed to suggest to me his pleas could anytime become ineffective and his colleagues might say, that’s it. And I think both, I think the Chairperson also if I’m not mistaken indicated the challenge that could happen if that were to happen. And of course, that we don’t know where that could put the SABC other than what we know happens when a calamity happens. I said to Mr Mxakwe if I recall correctly, I’m not sure what if anything I can do at this stage before I finished the work of the Commission. But I’m very concerned about what the situation of the SABC that has been described to me by successive witnesses here. And it’s a situation where one wouldn’t likea calamity to happen and to say, maybe I could have done something. But sometimes it’s difficult to see what one can do. So, but it’s something that is very concerning. I’m reflecting on it, ja. Thank you. Thank you very much Ms Gqubule Mbeki.    For having come forward to share your experiences at the SABC over the period that you have dealt with and to tell me about what happened to this SABC 8 during the period that you have described. I’m happy that you did come forward to give evidence. I’m happy that other people from the SABC came forward including the other members of the SABC 8. You may have to come back at some stage if we have reason to ask you to come back and I’ll still hear other evidence and so on. But I believe that the judgment of the Labour Court vindicated your position in regard to what you stood for. Of course, you have described to me a lot of other things that would have happened after that happened to you. The issue of being chased by a car over a certain period. I think your statements may be saying it was 15 minutes or whatever of being chased. It must have been a difficult time when you didn’t know whether you would crash against a car. But as I have indicated, I would like the investigators of the Commission to look into some of the issues that you have raised. It is very important that we have people who will stand, stand up when things happen which they believe are wrong and because if nobody stands up then wrong things don’t get stopped. I’m really happy that you and the other witnesses came and gave evidence. Thank you very much and the other issuesthat I said should be investigated will be investigated and I will ask the investigators and the legal team to keep you informed. I have no doubt that you will give whatever cooperation to them. And then you would have heard what I said earlier to the other witnesses that I’m very keen for people in the media to reflect on what input, contribution they can make to the Commission with regard to what recommendations I should consider making in regard to what happened at the SABC, what happens with political interference with editorial policies, editorial independence. So, people like you should work on that so that at the right time the Commission can be enriched by the submissions that the media can make. So, thank you very much for coming once again and you are excused. Thank you.    That is all for today.    And how many have we got tomorrow?    Yes.    Okay.    Oh, what’s your estimate when we might finish?    By lunchtime?    Ja.    Okay, okay. No, that’s fine but we’ll start at 10 o’clock then.    Okay.    We will adjourn at the stage and then tomorrow we will start at 10 o’clock. We adjourn. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Good morning Chair.    We indeed are ready Chair.    Chair this morning we are going to present the evidence of Ms Krivani Pillay.  She was part of the ACBC8 all 3.3 Notices were sent in terms of her statement to Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Mr Jimi Matthews.  Mr Jimi Matthews has responded however it is in CC25 his response to Ms Krivani Pillay and that we will put it to her at the end of her evidence.    May the witness please be sworn in    Ms Krivani you have submitted two statements to the commission.    Ms Pillay sorry.  We have become very acquainted – apologies.  Apologies Ms Pillay.    Ms Pillay you have submitted two statements to the commission the first statement being your main statement and the second statement being your supplementary statement.  The purpose of your second statement was to correct mistakes from your first statement.    And also just to put forth additional information that was not contained in your second statement – in your first statement.    Yes Chair.  We will relay that message Chair.    Apologies for that.    Ms Krivani.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Krivani the first page of the document in front of you can you identify that document?    Your main statement?    And if you turn on page 8 of that same document.    Is that your signature?    And when did you sign this statement?    And if we go to your second supplementary statement that would be on page 23.     And we turn over to page 24 is that your signature on that statement?    And can you just identify the corrections…    It is on page 23 Chair.    23, 23    Ms Pillay.    Can you just identify the corrections that you wanted to amend on your main statement?    And other than that though – other than those corrections and additions are you satisfied with both your main and supplementary statement?   Thank you Ms Pillay.      Ms Pillay can you please tell us where you are currently employed?    And can you just give us just a short background of how long you have been with the SABC and just a short career background?    Thank you Ms Pillay.  Ms Pillay in paragraph 3 of your main statement that will be on page 1 the investigators of the commission approached you, can you just identify the purpose of this approach?    Thank you.  Ms Pillay from paragraph 6 that would be on page 2 of your main statement where you highlight theeditorial and political interference.  There was a media statement that was issued according to ban protest policy.  Can you just touch base and talk to that?    Thank you Ms Krivani.  Ms Krivani – Ms Pillay.    Yes.  Ms Pillay you talk about a meeting where you were summoned.  You were summoned with Mr Krige, is that correct?   What was the purpose for being summoned to Mr Motsoeneng’s office?    And who else was in attendance at this meeting?  You have highlighted that on paragraph 9 on page 3 of your main statement.     And in this meeting you state that the meetings were recorded and everybody was aware that this meeting was recorded.    Thank you Ms Pillay.  In paragraph 12 of page 3 of your statement you have highlighted what Mr Motsoeneng had said in that meeting – particular meeting.  Could you just read it out for the record?    And Ms Pillay I have noted that this is in quotations was this word for word of what he had said?  Did you take notes of it?  How was it – how were you able to put this in your statement because it is quotation marks?    Thank you Ms Pillay.  And just to just jump to paragraph 13.   It continues onto page 4 of your statement in terms of what Mr Krige had asked Mr Motsoeneng about broadcasting vandalism of public property and so forth.  Can you just talk to that paragraph please?    Ms Pillay you have just stated in paragraph 13 what Mr Motsoeneng had said just in the second line. “The COO has the final responsibility for news.” Was this the first time that you have heard that the COO has the final responsibility for news or was this a norm?   Ms Pillay and in paragraph 15 of you statement you talk about the cancellation of the editors. What was the aftermath and consequence of the removal of this show?    Hm.   Hm.    Thank you.  The media statement we currently do not have it but during the tea break we can attempt to - to source it Chair.    Ms Pillay just to stay just on top of your evidence.  You mentioned a letter that was sent.  That is attachedon your - on your supplementary statement.  That is on page 25 Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair on page 25.    Ms Pillay that is - that is the - is this the letter that was sent to Mr Motsoeneng after the canning of the editors?    Chair this - this letter is quite lengthy but I find it very critical that Ms Pillay does read it into record.    Chair my own sense is that the entire letter is important because it touches base on the editors.  It also touches base of you know …    The purge and suspension of the othermembers of the SABC eight and so forth …    In that context.    Okay.    Ms Pillay can you just also just identify you know from the top who the letter was sent to, who was also cc’d in the letter and the contents of the letter?    Thank you Ms Pillay.  Did you ever receive a - a response or you know a meeting with the then CEO Mr - Mr Motsoeneng?    Thank you Chair.  What was the consequence if any what - what happened after issuing this letter?    Ms Pillay if you can just turn to page 27?  It is just after the letter.    Is this the letter you - you are speaking about the response that you received for you to go to a disciplinaryhearing?  Can you just talk to this letter?    Okay.    Yes Ms Pillay can you just read the charges.    Thank you.  Ms Pillay on that letter page 28 paragraph 2 it is stated that …    Page 28 Chair.    Paragraph 2.  It is stated that the directive not to broadcast destruction of property in - in protests and so forth.  Was that in line with the Editorial Policy?      And Mr Krieger spoke but did Mr Motsoeneng say to you why he thought it was justified to come up with this policy at that meeting?      Yes Chair.      Yes, Miss Pillay you stated, just for clarity purposes because we have dealt with this subsequent letter you received after the first letter.      You said you received less than 24 hours to appear at the disciplinary hearing, you receive it on Thursday, Friday was supposed to be your DC.  Now with this letter it’s dated the 8 t h of July and you were to write a response to these charges on the 15 t h of July, now that’s more than 24 hours.  When did you receive this letter, the third letter?    Thank you Miss Pillay, so you filed – your legal representatives filed their responses on Friday before 4 o’clock and you were subsequently fired, you said the 18 t h, was the 18 t h on that Monday?        Miss Pillay on paragraph 18, let’s go back to the statement on page five.      Page five of the main statement Chair, that would be under folder 14 Chair.          Folder CC14.        That’s fine Chair, I will remind you.  Paragraph 18 – well the second paragraph just under 18, the subsequent paragraph.  It states that the cancellation of the editors, Mr Motsoeneng justified it, can you just elaborate on Mr Motsoeneng justification of the cancellation of the programme?        Miss Pillay you talk about the New Age newspapers being a stack of ten per table and so forth…[intervenes].      Yes was the distribution of the New Age newspapers, was this a daily occurrence of these newspapers being brought in, was it an astronomical amount, was it, you know a manageable amount, you know, that it’s ne newspaper per employee, can you just talk to that?        Thank you Chair.  Chair I’ve noted that it’s quarter past eleven I don’t know if the Chair would like to take the tea break now before we carry on with further with the editorial…[intervenes].        I think we would take about, my estimation, 45 minutes at most.    Thank you Chair.  Chair just during the tea adjournment I had asked the – our team’s investigators just to acquire that media release by SABC.  They on it and as soon as we get it we will then submit it.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Pillay on paragraph 19 that is on page 6 Chair on your main statement you talk to your editorial woes that had begun.  You emphasise on the day before the State of the Nation Address that was to be given by the President.  Can you just elaborate on any editorial interference that you guys endured in that period?    Ms Pillay you talk about booking the political analyst weeks before was this a service that was paid for by the SABC to book that analyst?    Thank you Ms Pillay.  Apologies just to backtrack a little bit.  I think I might – I have left this out and it is very critical because Mr Matthews has responded to paragraphs particularly paragraphs 14 of your main statement on page 4.  In the meeting where you and Mr Krige were summoned to Mr Motsoeneng’s office where Mr Matthews had stated that if it is cold outside if you do not like this you can go. You have two choices the door or the window.      Can you elaborate what was the response to this?  You said you were particularly surprised why is that so?    Thank you Chair.  Ms Pillay when this instruction was given not to have any political analyst and so forth inparagraph 21 you state that you protested this instruction to the general manager of radio news.  Who exactly was at the time the general manager of radio news?    And what was her response?    Ms Pillay what would have happened hypothetically if you had you know said no I am going to have those political analysts and so forth. What do you think the consequences would have been had you not followed the instruction?    Let us got to the second occasion when this happened that you have highlighted in paragraph 22 of your statement – your main statement.    Ms Pillay just to pick up on that.  What do you think the intention was to prohibit this analysis?  What do you think the primary goal was?    Thank you Ms Pillay.  You also state that that was not the first occasion whereas you were prohibited to include political analysis.  You have highlighted that in paragraph 22.    Can you just talk to that?    Thank you Ms Pillay.  On paragraphs 23 of your statement that would still be on page 6 of your main statement you talk to a pre-election workshop and what was said at that pre-election workshop.  Can you just – Mr Krige has touched base on what the election – the pre-election workshop is about and so forth so you do not have to go in that detail but however you talk to on the next paragraph on paragraph 24 what Mr Motsoeneng had stated in that workshop on paragraph 24 on page 7.  Can you just read that out into the record and comment thereafter?    And…    Ms Pillay on the - more or less the last    And Ms Pillay how did you - what wasthe reaction?  Was there any kind of descenting views from anyone who put up their hand and said well you know I do not agree with this?    Ms Pillay I have - I have noted that in paragraph 24 what we have just read what Mr Motsoeneng had stated is in quotes.  Was this word for word that was said by Mr Motsoeneng?    If we could just turn to page 10 Annexure 1.  Ms Pillay can you identify that document in front of you?    Dated?    6 June 2016?    And if we turn to page 17 of that same document.   In the middle of the document there is a heading COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng.    Is this what was the minutes of what the content in - in which what he was saying?    There is just a few because it is - it is not numbered.  There is just a few particular paragraphs that I want you to give comment on.    1-7 Chair.  Sorry.  1-7.    That would be under the heading of COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng.    The first two lines of - of that document    And Ms Pillay did you feel that you know being the editor that the journalists - the newsroom was lazy or so forth or do you think that his comment was misdirected?    And just to go to the bottom of the last paragraph on that page there are some typo errors and so forth so I am just going to read it as - as well as I could or Ms Pillay can you read that last paragraph …    Starting with journalists?    Ms Pillay so that last line   Okay.    And if we turnover to page 18 still on the minutes paragraph - the fourth paragraph starting with “changed”.  Can you just read that into the record?    Can you give comment on that on the changed Supply Chain Management in that aspect?    Okay; and the next - the next paragraph where it starts with - the next two - well there are two sentences then straight underneath that there is a discussion by him about freelancers.  Can you read that out into the record?    And - and the next paragraph.    And what was his intention to focus on freelancers?  Can you give comment to those two - two paragraphs?    And on paragraph 25 and also to touch base with paragraph 26 that is on page 7 of your main statement.  You stated that Mr Motsoeneng’s instructions at that workshop went against the Editorial Policy and so forth.  Can you just talk to those two paragraphs please?    Ms Pillay you said that there were those who feared to lose their jobs.  Was there anyone - besides the SABC eight - was there anyone that you have - that you had worked with at the SABC that stood up that detested these instructions and actually lost their job?   Thank you Chair. Ms Pillay Mr Matthews had - has answered in terms of a 3.3 Notice that was issued.  That would be CC25 Chair.  On page 20 of CC25 that would be at the tail end of that document Ms Pillay.  At that affidavit under you    15 and 16 that would be found on page 12 of CC25.  Yes, have you got it?  Are you there?    On paragraph - paragraph 15 it states      Thank you Chair and lastly just to -  in response to your statement Miss Pillay, in paragraph 16 Mr Matthews states that, “I accept that I did not stand up to Motsoeneng or voice my  concerns about his decision or his stance and I repeat that it was extremely difficult to disagree with him or take a different view in an atmosphere that was highly corrosive.  I also accept that it was an unfortunate choice of words that I was merely trying to warn the journalists of Mr Motsoeneng’s approach to dissenting views in what had become a trite method of the way he operated.  That anyone who opposed him or voiced a dissenting view would face the prospect of dismissal but I deny any invitation that, by my presence in such meetings I had associated myself with his accusations that such staff were guilty of destabilising the SABC and somehow on my own or by association assumed responsibility for the dismissal of SABC8  in circumstances when my resignation had preceded the dismissals”, Can you give comment on that Miss Pillay?        Thank you Chair.  Miss Pillay we’ve reached the tail end of your main statement and supplementary statement apart from what was said and is there anything else that you would like to disclose or any commentary and so forth, further commentary?        Thank you Chair…[intervenes].        Ten to one Chair.        that would be perfectly fine.       That’s absolutely fine Chair.        Indeed so Chair.

MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Krivani Pillay.    No.    I truly affirm.   No problem at all.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    It is an I – Krivani.    This is the statement that I provided to the commission.    My main statement.    Yes.    That is correct.    On the 13 t h August.    .Yes.    That is correct?    Hm.    My – the correction was the chronological order just to get the date of the time of events which was paragraphs 10 and 11 in my original statement and in my supplementary I added the letter that my colleagues Busisiwe Ntuli and Jacques Steenkamp had sent to Mr Motsoeneng and the news executives.    Yes oh sorry one more thing is in paragraph 20 of my main statement I mentioned that I received an email saying that there would no analysis of President Zuma’s State of the Nation Address the correction it was not an email it was a verbal instruction.

I have a diploma of European Journalism from the [indistinct] School of Utrecht in the Netherlands.  I have a diploma in Advanced Broadcasting from the Thomson Foundation and Cardiff University.  I have a diploma in Essentials in Broadcast Management from the Saul Plaaitjie Institute in Rhodes University and I have a diploma in Media Executive Training Program with Bloomberg and the Gordon Institute of Business Science with the University of Pretoria.    Well it was to find out about the so called editorial interference at the SABC and to get – to share the evidence and our experiences of what we went through in the Watershed time of 16 for about a period of about eighteen months as the so called SABC8.    Okay so on the 26 t h May 2016 Chair we had heard through a media statement that Hlaudi Motsoeneng had decided to implement – it was not – we called it the protest policy but there was not a formal policy where you would ban visuals of protest action and we were not told as a news division officially we all had to find out through a media statement.  And as the executive producer of the show of SAFM Current Affairs I together with my colleague Aubrey [indistinct] we co-manage a team.  At the time the shows were called AM Live Mid-Day Live and PM Live and out team of senior producers decided to tackle this issue on the Sunday morning edition of the program called The Editors.   The Editors is a program that really looks at the media industry as a whole.  We reflect on the decisions we have made as editorial staff.  We look at how our colleagues over the different platforms have covered news and it is interesting to give this kind of information to the citizenry because the angles that certain broadcasters, certain newspapers may take could have to do with who owns them.  You know some people take one angle of covering the story others take a different view and it is – and it is part of our approach in the editors to give our listeners all types and it was a very popular programme.  And on the Sunday the first Sunday after this media statement was issued the editors took to analyse this – this statement.  And when we did so we have editors coming in.  We havelisteners calling in and we have an anchor who manages the program.  Unfortunately that did not go down well with Motsoeneng – Mr Motsoeneng and we were subsequently called in to discuss why we had taken that stance.  I …    Yes it was on SAFM on a Sunday morning.    Yes.      Because the program was a SABC news program we would try our absolute best the senior producers and the producers would try their best to ensure that one SABC editor would be on the program and then the other supporting editors would be from other     Media houses that is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair so sometimes some newspapers will have an exclusive. They would break a story.  For example the Rapport orthe Star we would invite that editor to come that weekend.    To give us the background to that exclusive breaking story.    How did they get the information?  How long did the story take you know from the time they got it to the time that they broadcast it.  Because what happens generally in the media industry is one publication or broadcaster can break a story but once it is out there it is fair play for everybody else to then start tackling the story in their news diary.  So this is one of the reasons we do that.  We find the first people to have – you know have that exclusivity and we invite them on the show.    We could…    Hm.    No, no you are absolutely right Chair.  We would discuss that.  For example I remember when I was sitting in as an anchor for that show.  We did a program where there was a bloodiedpicture on the front page of the newspaper and we discussed the merits of publishing such a picture because you know it is free for all and children are actually also having a look at that.  Because in broadcasting you have Watershed times and you can protect children from some content.  But for example – so we – so I remember on that particular day – so that would be some of the – the discussions we have.  Did that particular newspaper make the right decision in putting such a bloodied picture in – on their front page?  Those are the kind of editorial discussions that takes place.    That was precisely the angle Chair.    Yes.    You can call me Ms Krivani.    That is correct.    The purpose of that was – it was about 48 hours after the Sunday program.  So Mr Motsoeneng was aggrieved that the program criticised his decision because callers that had come in on the program wanted the merits of such a decision.  At the SABC and for a public broadcaster it is rather bizarre when you are supposed to be giving a plurality of views and different perspectives on a story for someone to issue a directive to say we are now banning these pictures.  We are supposed to give and we are duty bound to give the South African public all access to the South African news and you know in all its manner and form so that they can shape their own opinions of the information we are disseminating.  By effectively making such a directive you are choosing then to decide, to edit what the audience, what your viewer, what your listener, what your reader is then going to view.  You are making that decision.  So this is the kind of criticism that went on on that show on Sunday.  And we then called to his office on the Tuesday to discuss Sunday’s program.    It was Mr Motsoeneng, it was Jimi Matthews, the acting at the time he was the acting Group Chief Executive Officer, it was the acting GE of News Mr Simon Thebele, it was Anton Heunis,Anton Heunis was introduced to us as Mr Motsoeneng’s advisor, it was the GM of Radio News Ms Sebolelo Ditlhakayane, SABC spokesperson Mr Keizer Kganyago and then Mr Krige Foeta and myself.      This is actually the amendment that I made to my supplementary.  So this – the point 11 Chair point 10 and 11 of this was actually the recording of a news workshop.    Not the recording of this meeting.    That was the correction that I made.    In my supplementary.     “We are cleaning up the organisation people are doing their own stuff.  There are many journalists outside that want to work for the SABC.  The environment outside is bad.  No person within theSABC is independent.  The SABC is independent this is the new SABC.  You must adapt or find a job somewhere else.  Editors’ forum must go.  Its advertising for rival newspapers.” And then he added. “If people do not adhere get rid of them we cannot have people who question management and this is the last time we will have a meeting of this kind.”    So to be quite honest with you Chair this statement caught me off my guard because I was just in shock that I was actually listening to these kinds of statements.  So this particular statement I had only in shorthand and – but Foete Krige had made very detailed notes.  So when I – when we had done the meeting Foete had tabled – I mean typed out his notes and I compared to my notes and this was verbatim.    So there are some parts where I have also got it verbatim.  Ja.    Yes.    So Mr Krige tried to ask Mr Motsoeneng Chair what empirical evidence do you have for all of these decisions to be made.  We are not averse to change.  Even in the newsroom change is good.  Programs need to be changed.  We need to keep up with the trends.  As long as we follow and adhere to the journalistic prescripts.  If a program does not work it is not popular enough we need to make changes?  So we are not averse to change.  But when it comes to saying the editors must go a popular program that has deep editorial values attached to it.  A program that has a long history.  In fact when I was trying to do research on how long the program was it is – even way before 1994 the editors has been in session.  So Mr Krige tried to find out, well what is the thinking behind such decisions that the editors must just go?  And Mr Motsoeneng was not able to give us an editorially sound reason.  He was not able to rationalise his reasoning.  He basically just said we must defend the organisation.  No journalist is independent.  The COO has final responsibility for news.  If people do not adhere get rid of them we cannot have people who question management.  I remember still having my hand up he refused to even take my question.  He was really upset.  According to him we had brought the SABC or my program had brought the SABC into disreputebecause we were discussing a decision he sanctioned and we were discussing a decision he made.  But we have to be introspective.  We have to be reflective as a newsroom and as an organisation and…    Absolutely.  I mean we are not here for our own personal welfare.  We are here for country duty and we are here for public service.  And he did not seem to get that.    My program.    Yes.     And he made – when he said that newspapers must go Chair he was making reference to two parts of the newspapers.  On a Monday to Friday a program called AM Live hosted by Sakina Kamwendo had a newspapers slot where she would review the headlines of the newspapers’.  We would not got through the newspaper…    Page by page.    But we would look at the general headlines of the day.    And then the editors would also have a few minutes about three minutes where we look at the Sunday papers.  And it is common practice. It is age old tradition.  It is done on international broadcasters as well.  One of the reasons we do this it – actually there is two reasons we do this.    Some newspapers are not national they are only available in certain parts of the country.  It is important for listeners and viewers to know what is happening around the country. That is number 1.  Number 2 it is also important to see what angle the SABC has taken and what angle Times Live has taken.  Or what angle the SABC has taken and what angle the Citizen has taken for example.  It is to give that kind of varying coverage plurality of views and perceptions – perspectives to – I mean this really is what the editors is all about.    The BBC    Yes.    Ja.    It is common industry practice ja.    Well I do not think he – I do not think he had an issue with the program at all itself.    It was just because this Sunday catapulted him to the top of the agenda.  His decision was criticised.  His decision was then being debated and disputed on the show.  And this must have got his attention.    The program must go.    And the newspapers must go as well.  So the newspapers on the AM Live portion of the morning and the newspapers on the Editors program.    This was the first time that I had heard from him that the final responsibility of news because I had only come back to the SABC – sorry Chair I have sorry.    Sorry Chair.  Chair this was the first time that I had heard that because I had only just recently returned to the SABC.  It was a couple of months prior to that.  So when I had heard that I thought maybe he made a mistake.  But then Jimi Matthews was sitting you know right next to him and he did not correct him.  And that is when I had also heard subsequently no but this is the angle in which he is moving toward. He has apparently made changes that – that the Editor in Chief is now the COO and not the CEO.    It was awful.  Chair…    It was cancelled.  It was cancelled immediately.  It was the lowest point of my career because it was left up to me to have to go to my colleagues, my senior producers and producers and let them know what had just transpired in a meeting.  I felt embarrassed.  I felt like I let the team down.  I did try my best to garner reasoning from Mr Motsoeneng that I can take back to my team.  He would not listen to any – he would not even entertain my questions at that meeting and I was basically told you have no choice on the matterand if you do not do it you know my job was threatened.  I subsequently came back to the office and we made the announcement to the team.  I - it did not sit well with me at all.  I had sleepless nights afterwards because when I was a student at Rhodes University SAFM was the program - it was the pinnacle program that a journalist worked toward and the fact that I was now sitting in a position that I had aspired to be sitting in and - and a program of this calibre was removed under my watch I really felt that I let down my team and I let down listeners and I took it quite personally. My colleague Busisiwe Ntuli then after hearing about what happened - Thandeka and Busisiwe had come to my office and Busisiwe basically said what are you going to do about it and I said I cannot be quiet anymore because this has gone too far and that is when Busisiwe Ntuli, Jacques Steenkamp and myself sat down to draft this letter to Mr Motsoeneng and Busisiwe and Jacques said we will support you. It is not our program but we will support you because we believe in the program and - and we also believe that what he has done is wrong.  So we got together the three of us and we drafted this letter.  By this time our colleagues Thandeka, Foeta and Suna were already suspended.  Thandeka joined us when we had our meeting and we looked at the journalistic prescripts. We looked at editorial independence.  We drafted a letter and we asked Mr Motsoeneng we just want you to tell us - guide us as to your thinking as to why these programs in the newspapers arecancelled.  Tell us why you are suspending colleagues who are just debating and - and we sent that letter off and I only felt better once that letter was sent. So we - we sent off that letter but the senior producers I had asked them to keep all the emails and Chair every day without fail every day we were getting emails.  I still have them stored on my laptop.  The senior producers were collecting disgruntled emails from listeners who have been listening for years and listeners who are in rural areas.  Remember radio is a very powerful tool. There is only a few people that are on social media but radio is accessible to everyone and they were very upset and they wanted the program to come back and quite a few listeners including one Anita Jonker as a lecturer at a university she went straight to the BCCSA and the rest of the listeners came to us and we still forwarded those emails to Mr Motsoeneng but nobody was willing to listen.    Yes and no Chair.  Sometimes there is consultation and sometimes there is not.  We have in the organisation what we call rediffusion where everybody from across the country and -all the offices tune in and listen when either the executives of the board get together to - to disseminate information to us or to perhaps talk about the possibility of introducing a new policy to gauge views. So that is one way.  Sometimes it happens but this there was certainly no consultation.  This was a directive.    Yes.    I stand to be corrected Chair.    In my recollection I was not notified via …    Email or via rediffusion …    Or anything.    Yes.    Chair, I also - I received a lot of hate mail on social media which - some of it is still there - where - where people thought that I made the decision to cancel the editors because I am the Executive Producer of the show.  It was very hard for me to have to go through that because it was not of my doing but I was not going to - to undertake a discussion with - with listeners on - on social media. A - a statement was never issued to say that it was Mr Motsoeneng’s decision.  So I had to bear the brunt but eventually obviously with the advent of speaking out and - and with Parliament etcetera then the viewers realised it was - it was not of my personal doing that the - that the program was cancelled.  Also I used to field a lot of telephone calls. My - my office number was circulated and I would sit on the phone with listeners and they were very upset.  Ja, and - and that is the extent of the disgruntled nature of our listeners and which was - it was very sad because this is effectively the people we have to serve.    I …    I - I do not recall.  I wonder if it is here as a …   Okay.    Hm.    It is - public deception is a cruel thing Chair.    Even when a year ago there were changes made to SAFM where current affair hours were reduced drastically from six hours to two hours a day.  I was - also had to bear the brunt of social media bullying because it was very popular programs that were cancelled. AM live and PM live and that too - listeners thought that I was behind that and they - some of them went as far as likening me to Mr Motsoeneng saying that I am as bad as - as he is and - and again I kept quiet.  I blocked people who were bullying me on social media but I never engaged.  I just did not engage with the public on social media.    That is correct.    Okay.  Chair the letter was for attention SABC Chief Operating Officer Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng at SABC Radio Park corner of Henley and Artillery Road.  It was also copied to Jimi Matthews Acting Group CEO, to Simon Tebele Acting GE News, to Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane GM Radio News, to Nyana Molete Acting GM TV, to Angie Kapelianis National Editor Radio Current Affairs, to Nothando Maseko Acting Head TV Current Affairs and to Zolisa Sigabi    No Chair I did not.    16, yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    After issuing this - this letter was issued on Saturday or Sunday.  On the Monday morning Jimi Matthews had resigned via social media.  We all found out via social media Chair and then four days later on a Thursday afternoon I was given notice to appear before a disciplinary hearing on the Friday.  I was given less than 24 hours’ notice to appear.    There had been no response.  That was the first time …    That was the response was the disciplinary hearing.    Yes.    So this is the letter I received after the disciplinary hearing.  There is one letter missing which is the first one which we will try and get to you.    Sorry Chair.  Sorry.    The one letter is the invite to the …    The disciplinary hearing.    Which was a Thursday afternoon to be there for a disciplinary hearing on a Friday morning.  I had not been unionised at that time and my colleagues quickly rallied around me to basically sign union membership forms.  The first union I called was CWU.  I was told that a shop steward would come and meet me.  The shop steward came and basically wasted my time because I subsequently found out that CWU had no intention to represent me. I called BEMAWU.  I was not a member of BEMAWU but BEMAWU already had another disciplinary hearing that - that their shop steward was attending the next day.  I effectively had no assistance.  I waited till 7 o’ clock for CWU to return to my office to assist me in preparing for this disciplinary hearing.  Nobody arrived.  I then looked out of the SABC. A friend of mine is a lawyer by profession.  She then arrivedat my home and upon one look at the notice for DC laughed it off saying it was less than 24 hours to appear before a DC.  That in itself is against labour laws but she did nevertheless help me prepare.  I got to the DC on Friday morning and …    They said that we were - we - we had basically brought the SABC into disrepute.  So that we wrote a letter …    Hm.    So this is similar to the charges that were in the first letter.    Ja.  So that is why I am - I am trying to recall - I beg your pardon Chair …    What was in that first one which …    I will ensure that I get to the evidence leaders.    These are pretty much …    That is correct Chair.    “You are hereby notified in terms of Schedule 8 of the Labour Relations Act Number 66 of 1995 that allegations have been received that you are continuing to commit further acts of misconduct after receiving your letter informing you of your disciplinary hearing.” So these were additional to the - to the first disciplinary …    Letter Chair.  So the fact …    That we were speaking to the media - so   Oh.    That is correct Chair and that is also how …    This is the kind of environment we worked in at that time Chair.  Nothing made sense really.  The - the directives that were issued out, the - just nothing made sense.  I want to say it was the ramblings of a madman.  So - you know to edit it but …    Really nothing made sense. Just us inquiring …    About it and it as a very diplomatic letter in my - in my opinion that we had sent out.    Yes.  We questioned the decision.    And how do you work in a newsroom?   Newsroom - journalistic principles are all about asking questions.  Any story you do you ask a question.  That is how we get out stories and how is it that you can run a newsroom without allowing the very people who are supposed to be asking questions by profession are not supposed to ask you questions.    Well we would not know …    Because we were never afforded the audience or - or …    The response to our letter.    1.2   Ja.    Okay.    Point 2   I beg your pardon Chair.  It was a Sunday.    Yes.    So we - if I correctly remember it was early evening Sunday night Chair.  We had sent off the letter.  We had all met to sign - scan it and send it and on my way to work on Monday morning roundabout 7 o’ clock I received a phone call from another media house asking if I had heard about the resignation of Jimi Matthews and that was how I found it and it was about a couple of hours later that I had seen the social media post that he had indeed resigned.    I found the timing to be quite coincidental …    But I - I could not say for sure Chair.    That was not in line with the Editorial Policy. The Editorial Policy is clear Chair - I beg your pardon.  The Editorial Policy is clear.  The only thing that we are not going to broadcast if something incites violence or racism or things that are against our Bill of Rights in the Constitution.  That is - you know there is - there is just - there is a whole lot of prescripts - editorial prescripts. I do not understand how showing the destruction of property - I want to give you some context Chair.  These protest policy - protest action are service delivery protests that were have - that were occurring across the country.  The timing of this was just weeks before an election.  All the people that we were interviewing that we were viewing that we were - the community leaders that we had on our programs talked about service delivery. They talked about access to water and sanitation.  They talked about homes.  They talked about jobs.  They talked about food.  They talked about infrastructure, right.  They - they then named their councillors.  They named the governing party.  They named Government.  According to them their leaders were to blame for non-service delivery. So when somebody says I am going to ban this, the audio and the video, weeks before an election, when somebody is criticising an administration in power, that’s also running for the same election, how else do you interpret that Chair?   For me that was already the start of a capture.       The GM of radio Miss Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane was there with us, she attempted to defend the show, the editors but he still wouldn’t listen to her even though she was my line manager’s manager.  So very senior person but he wouldn’t even let her finish her sentence as senior as she was.  So he didn’t let her speak and he didn’t let me speak.      This was the one and only meeting I had with Motsoeneng Chair in which he discussed the editors and the newspapers with my programmes and – because those programmes were talking about the protest policy.       The content yes on those programmes.       Yes.       There was no justification Chair, he said he was in charge, to paraphrase Chair, these are not the exact word, it was basically my decision goes.       Yes.       So this is the second letter, 8 t h of July – Chair it’s the second letter.       I don’t have so that would be Thursday’s date for Friday’s disciplinary, Friday…[intervenes].       No it couldn’t have been the 16 t h of June Chair it would have been early – it would have been end June early July.       Chair so I went to the disciplinary hearing with Jacques Steenkamp and Busisiwe Ntuli who had their labour union reps with them and solidarity kindly offered to assist me free of charge because I was, for want of a better word, a lone ranger there on Friday without any union representivity and solidarity had told me that they would represent me pro bono and sit with me in the DC. That DC started and because of the argument that we had…[intervenes].       Chair, I can’t remember but it was a gentleman that was flown in, I think, from Free State Province, flown in specifically to chair this DC.       And –so into it the union representatives argue why the DC could not go ahead and the…[intervenes].    The three of us who wrote the letter to Mr Motsoeneng et al.     It was a joint disciplinary hearing for the three of us.    Thank you Chair and when they argued that this DC could not go ahead for various reasons, it was then adjourned but it was never re-scheduled.  The re-scheduling was the 8 t h of July Chair, this letter.      We got this letter to then provide a written response by the 15 t h of July and then in this letter they added more because they felt because of the media interviews and all of that…[intervenes].     Exactly so there were more charges here and then our lawyers subsequently responded to that letter, meeting the deadline of 4 o’clock on the 15 t h of July but unfortunately they didn’t find our responses good enough and we were subsequently fired on the 18 t h of July.    No.     Yes Chair.     That’s 100% correct Chair.     Chair they actually acknowledged receipt of our response and I didn’t – they – I’m paraphrasing again I don’t know the legal jargon that was used basically to say, your lawyers have sent us a response we’ve gone through it and we’ve taken the decision to terminate.     Absolutely.     On that Monday, I remember it clearly because it was Nelson Mandela’s birthday Chair and that’s a personal hero of mine so it just felt very ironic that the person who encouraged me to get into journalism, I would be fired on his birthday.     Okay so it seems then that the only reason for the cancellation was that the programme criticised, Chair, the decisionof Mr Motsoeneng protest policy.  The argument that Mr Motsoeneng made was that the programme was promoting the sale of newspapers whose editors were interviewed and I felt that, that argument was irrelevant because newspapers are not the direct competition of any broadcaster.  Mr Motsoeneng made this argument at the time when the SABC was promoting the Gupta owned New Age newspaper through its New Age breakfast briefings on SABC TV.  I also want to add that when they cancelled the newspaper, shortly after the actual newspaper was removed citing austerity measures, one of the reasons the actual newspapers we usually use every morning when we’re – you know before we do our diaries, those were removed but there were copious amounts of the New Age everywhere, ten copies per table, you know, almost.  Like the – it was really bizarre because if you’re going to cite, you know, selling newspapers then that newspaper had no business of being there with so many copies.     We didn’t raise it formally Chair, we did speak about it amongst ourselves, the producers, the senior producers we even brought it to the attention of our line managers and austerity was cited as one of the reasons for removing the main newspapers, the ones that we were used to getting every day and when we made the – we didn’t really make a formal argument, we all just, amongstourselves, you know in our…[intervenes].     Absolutely but we also knew which were our battles, if he wasn’t going to respond to a formal letter that senior journalists had written, was he going to answer about the New Age newspaper?     Well the meeting table – meeting table not per desk, sorry.     I can’t really put my finger on the number Chair, I would arrive for my shift and there’d probably be about five or six of the newspapers stacked around the meeting table, there would be one or two around other tables, ja but unfortunately Chair I’m so sorry but I can’t put my finger on the exact number that was there on a daily basis, I just know that there were many copies of the New Age available.     I honestly can’t recall Chair.     No.     Yes as far as my memory – yeah.    Chair – Chair – I beg your pardon. Chair on the – in February 2016 as is tradition for the President to do a State of the Nation Address and part of our public service mandate our teams fly down to Cape Town to give almost wall to wall coverage.  So it would be a preview to the State of the Nation Address and a post analysis and response and reaction to the President’s address.  And we do this every year and it is one of the things that is a main attractor to our station because I would like to say we do it so well.  But in February …    This is SAFM yes Chair.    In February 2016 so the production teams they would plan ahead. They would organise who we call political analysts, economic analysts, social you know anyone who is able to give some kind of post SONA analysis.  And we had an analyst lined up.  We usually find them in the provinces where we have to travel in order to also keep the costs down.  And we were told there will be no analysis of President Zuma’s address.  Obviously that coming from the top and I had to make the unfortunate call.  My team were too embarrassed to call the analyst because they felt that they had not taken that decision and they should not be the one to have to call and cancel the analyst.  So I called and cancelled with the analyst 24 hours before the State of the Nation Address.  And that was…    You mean analyst?    A couple of weeks before because we do…    Long before.      We –and we also because you know we know some of the analysts who are well read who – so we try and book themin advance as possible so that other broadcasters may not have not first dibs – dibs on them.    Absolutely.  Absolutely.    And so this is how the team works, this is how the senior producer in charge of that broadcast would have worked.  They would have booked and they basically told me well if you want them cancelled you are going to have to cancel it because I am not – we have booked them and so I was the unfortunate – had the unfortunate task.  And I had to very diplomatically call and say unfortunately we will no longer be requiring your services.  That – that speech went on without political analysis.  There was only political party response to the speech.    Yes Chair.    It was a verbal instruction and not an email.    I – I was just trying to recall.    And even when I consulted with my colleagues they were like email nothing was done on email.    And then I – they reminded me it was a verbal instruction and that is when I very quickly called the evidence leaders to tell them me.    I think at that time it was the acting GE of news Simon Tebele.  He would have given the instruction then so Mr Motsoeneng would have given the instruction to him and he would have given the instruction to the GM of Radio and you know filtered down.  Ja.    Yes, yes.    I was not called directly.    No, no.    Yes.    The speak at the time was it is from the top that is how we were used to.    Yes. Was there a general understanding who the top referred to?    Yes Chair.    Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng.    No we seldom – sorry Chair.  We seldom pay for services.  We usually only book and pay during an election period because over that period you know we need them – it is wall to wall coverage and we need them you know to be with us for 24 hour broadcasting.  But we do not necessarily pay for analysts.  We – it is done out of good will.  We look for researchers, we look for experts and we invite them to be participants in a program.  So they would join us. They would be part of you know their accreditation we assist with the accreditation etcetera.  But we are not known for paying for such services and if an analyst request payment then unfortunately we would have to let them go because we are not – we do not do that.  Generally all – most broadcasters and publications usually pay for analysists mostly over an election period when you exclusive use of analysts.    Chair I almost admire your optimism that there would be reasons afforded to us for any decision.  Unfortunately we were working in an environment where it was just issued, orders were just issued without justification or reason.  I would also take it that yes if you wanted to promote the President you could say here is a list of maybe analysts that you could use.  But I think given the circumstances of the time, of the manner in which the leader of the time was being lambasted across the media, across he public I can only imagine that the reason would be to avoid at all circumstances criticism against the leader.    Absolutely Chair.    Yes.    I was particularly surprised because even though Chair Mr Matthews and I did not have a close working relationship I knew of him and he was someone that as a young journalist I had admired and almost – you know you – as you grow up in the ranks of journalism you kind of spot the journalist you want to be and you spot them in the veterans.  And Mr Matthews was one of those people …    You know in the television industry that you know – I know that he also had an eye for pictures and storytelling and I was aware of you know his career.  So when somebody like that andyou know you have admired as a student says something like that instead of defending you at a meeting it is confusing and it is worrying and then you start to wonder well what is in it for you?  Why – I mean you have been such a good journalist for so long and then why does the tune change.  You know. And I almost expected afterwards to get a call from Mr Matthews to say perhaps I was under duress and you know.    Explain himself but I never heard from him.    It was Sebolelo Ditlhakayane.    I remember going to her office and I had brought this to her attention and she said she tried to explain it to Mr Motsoeneng – sorry Chair – why it would not work.  Why this instruction would not work and basically he had not – he told her that she had no option and we had no option.    Chair I think I would have been fired much earlier than I was.     it is very strange.    You hit the nail on the head Chair that is exactly what analysis is about.    Not that it was precisely communicated as such but for somebody who has been in the industry long enough and to use my powers of assertion and deduction that there was a view not to criticise President Jacob Zuma.  Not to paint him in a poor light.  Not to paint his leadership in a poor light. Not to show that service delivery failures at the hands of government or the governing party in weeks before an election and for me that is the only deduction.    Yes.    On the 23 r d August Parliament’s Portfolio Committee Chair they met the SABC board.  It was televised live. The board – by this time there was a lot of upheaval about what was going on at the SABC because we had obviously publicly rebuked thesedecisions.  And the board and some of the members of the executive called us disgruntled journalists.  They went as far as calling us liars and we were told there would be no analysis of that appearance before the …    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Again.    Ja.    Another one.  From the top filtered down.    I once again went to my line managers Chair and…    One of the conversations we had we would not have analysis but why do we not get communications experts or broadcast experts or media experts to come in. I was trying to circumvent this issue, move around it, find a commentator, an expert, a researcher, an academic.    Yes. And it was not working and – but I do remember a conversation saying yes we could do that but not a political analysis of it.  Which was a very fine line you know between the two.    Hm.  Now at this stage August 2016 who were the executives in terms of the hierarchy that would have – that you would have expected to have had something to do with this instruction?    It would have been – well Mr James Aguma and Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng were working quite closely together as executives…    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    I think the acting GE was Simon Tebele.  I am just trying to recall I beg your pardon Chair.    Okay sure.    Chair in my opinion Parliament’s Portfolio Committee of Communications failed in their oversight role.  Because if you go back and get the Parliamentary tapes of the 23 r d August even the lining – line of questioning from some of the MP’s was not of an oversight body it was almost of friends speaking to friends.  Or one team mate speaking to the same team mate. So the line of questioning was not to find the whole story and the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the goings on at the SABC. So I also encouraged the investigators to look at that tape of the 23 r d August and to see the line of questioning of that oversight body and to see the kind of responses that the executives gave to Parliament.    Chair I would also like to put on record that the SABC 8 through our legal team Aslam Moosajee and Advocate Steven Budlender wrote to Baleke Mbete the speaker of Parliament to point out these kind of inefficiencies and the failure of Parliament as an oversight body.  And we – we for want of a better word pestered them until we got what we got which ended up being the first ever inquiry into the SABC in Parliament. But it took a while before we could get that.     Sure.    That is precisely what we were doing.    Thank you Chair I will pass the message on.    Okay.  Chair at the workshop Mr Motsoeneng made the following deeply concerning remarks. “Do not focus on negative stories. Reporters at the SABC do not know the world. When they report they mislead listeners. Today I am going to talk to the press club, to all editors.  I am going to tell them they cannot try to influence SABC.I am going to tell them they cannot tell us what to do. Look at your editorial policy. We have removed news and replaced with content. If you as SABC mess up the organisation you mess up your life. I am in charge. News is now part of operations. We change the world. We must have news with content. I am in charge, you must adhere to my instruction. President Zuma is the President of the country. I do not regard him as ANC. You cannot treat him the same. We will give him more time. You can question everyone.” And he referred to Mr Mantashe etcetera. “Except our President. We need to respect him especially you SABC. I expect you to align with my instruction.”    So in the editorial policy Chair when we talk about news content could mean anything.  Content…   Yes.  Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Content could be a music video.    Content could be a kids program.    News has very clear prescripts of what is a news item?    So he is effectively removed it and muddied the waters of what the news prescripts are.    The way I understand it and I stand to be corrected perhaps my other colleagues could give you a better explanation but that news content, news items, news programming was being watered down.   That is where he swapped.  So in the news editorial - in the - in the section of news …    In the Editorial Policy …    Because we have mandate.  We have language.  We have sport and education etcetera in the section of news.  So where we talk about news values or - or prescripts it would be content.    In the actual 2016 changes.    Yes.    It would mean that there would be no robust political …    Debates.    You would just report.    Yes.    You would have debates but they would then     Be watered down.    Chair at the risk of sounding insubordinate …    I actually did not listen to this instruction.    I continued and so did my colleagues.    The producers and senior producers and anchors we continued to work …    As journalists.    Yes.    So Chair in the context of this - this was a pre-election workshop.  So when it comes to election coverage there is something that - that we use that ICASA prescribes and that is equitable coverage.  It is not equal coverage but it is equitable coverage.  It is a formula moved based on the number of seats you have in Parliament etcetera. So obviously the governing party will have a slightly longer coverage than the say the official opposition who will then have slightly coverage to the second opposition party etcetera.  What I understand this to be is that you will give the President more time.  Almost disregarding equitable.    More than equitable.    Exactly.    Yes.    I do remember - I do remember that immediately nobody - people were looking around.  It was almost this unease because some of us could not believe what we were listening to.  Some obviously heard it again and they - like I said they were used to the kind of utterances of this individual.  It was my first time back after a few years as I mentioned. So I was - I know I was bewildered when I saw - I did not raise my hand.  I did not say anything.  We had adjourned for a lunch - a tea break or a lunchbreak and I do remember people not being very happy by that but there was no kind of formal caucus where we then stopped him in his tracks and - and asked him questions. People did put their hands up, asked questions and you know tried you know in a - in a way to - to voice their discontent but this is the kind of individual who commanded this room in this almost way that what I say goes and even if somebody attempted to rationalise or be reasonable with him they would not win.  Ja.    The Acting GCEO was there.  Mr James Aguma was there because I remember asking a question.  I remember putting my hand up to say that one of the things that irks me as an Executive Producer is when reporters do not have the adequate resources to do their work and can only file stories when they come back to the officeand why do they not have the 3G data cards etcetera and I remember Mr James Aguma was there because Mr Motsoeneng said but we have got the money and he must just make it happen.  That - ja that the reporters get the 3G cards …    And they get the resources that they need …    To get the job done.    Yes because ironically I was the scribe at this workshop Chair.    There was - there was a few of us that were asked to scribe …    And this - and this workshop was the recorded workshop.    A (indistinct) was placed in front …    And every single session was recorded …    And we had turns to take notes.    No this is based on - on my notes.    Yes.  I did not - I did not get my hands on the recording.    So these are just my typed notes.    Yes.    There …    A recording exists somewhere.    Ja.    That is the minutes of the workshop.    6 June.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Chair at this workshop would have only been editors, specialists, desk editors, assignment editors, regional editors.  So basically the editorial leadership of the news division.  So the journalists themselves would not have been - there would have been maybe one or two but the journalists themselves would not have been at that workshop. So I do not think he would have said this face to face to the journalists.  He said that to us as editors in the hopes that we would take his concerns about the shoddy camera work.  For example he used - he talked about inconsistencies in camera teams, needing to train camera people.  He said that the journalists need to be passionate.  They need to go back to basics. So he - he said all of this in the hopes that we would take this message back to our teams in preparation for elections.    Chair I do believe that some of his comments are misdirected because to my recollection Mr Motsoeneng never came to the newsroom.  He never - I do not recall him meeting journalists, getting to know them, getting to know their work.  Journalists work under - often long unsociable hours filing and you really have got to understand the nature of the work that we do and he to my recollection never did that. So this was the first time that I - I had his opinion of thequality of news being disseminated but I am not in charge of the input team which is the journalists.  My team - I co managed a team of output producers, senior producers and anchors where they would then use the stories of the input journalists in - in our programs.  So I was not - I am not in a position to assess whether his comments had any validation.    Sure.   “Journalists who belong to an organisation is not independent.  In the new Editorial Policy it is clear that the organisation is independent not the individual.  When we issue an instruction it is an instruction.  We are not asking you.  No one is independent.  SABC has a clear agenda.  The way we report is unique from other media.  If you are not in line the door is open.  Revamping the SABC is not about just content.  It is also personnel.  Need people who support the agenda of the SABC.”    I would - I would understand if you cannot do the job or - or if you cannot …    Exactly.    Then - then out you go.    That is a difficult one Chair …    Because he - I think he viewed the SABC as an entity on its own.    And him being at the helm …    Of that entity …    And whatever he saw that organisation to be …    Is what us as journalists and staff members hadto be in line with.    So there - therein strips the independence …    But to be in line with his vision …    Of leadership …    For this so called …    Independent institution.    That is how I understand it.    Comply.  That is it.    Sorry.  Chair for the record I …    I - I do - I cannot remember if I - if I said at this meeting that James Aguma he was there as CFO …    Not as CEO.   Because I remember the conversation being about we have money for these resources.    You know the - the - to do our work.    Ja, so it was …    Yes.  I would like to make that correction please.    “Changed Supply Chain Management    I - I - I am sorry Chair.  I am unable to do so because I - I cannot recall in - in what context this …    This was said.    I do not know the changes in this - in the - in the Supply Chain Management.   Ja.    “On the issue of freelancers only rude open for abuse is freelancers.  There is no scrutiny. Caution that to do it in transparent manner if not and we know of shenanigans we are ruthless now as far as fraudulent use - use of organisation resources.”    “News has got 1 000 employees.  That - news should have 1 000 employees.  That should be sufficient.  If - if they all news I will worry if you need another 500.  This financial year I will focus on freelancers.”    On the freelance issue I do know that the freelancers Chair had some issues that they had taken to - you know brought to his attention but I - I do not know the details of that communication between freelancers and Mr Motsoeneng and howexactly he was going to focus on freelancers.  Unfortunately I would not be in attendance of freelance meetings as I am a permanent staff member.    Okay.  Chair well Mr Motsoeneng’s instructions went against the International Journalism Code of Conduct, the Editorial Code of the SABC and the legally binding documents of the South African Constitution and the Broadcasting Act and my own personal views. These instructions by Mr Motsoeneng have created a rift between those who want to adhere to the South African Broadcasting Act and those who feared losing their jobs and this is precisely the situation that was as the SABC three years ago and - and I want to on the record state that there were a lot of people that did not like what he did but there were single moms who could not afford to lose their jobs. There were single head households who could not afford to lose their jobs.  So not everybody - it was not that we could afford to stand up but there were some people who the risk - the price was too high to pay to stand up.    I was not aware Chair …    Because at this time I was actually at ENCA.    At the time of Ms Mokhobo’s …    Tenure, ja.    Yes.  My colleague Vuyo Mvoko at least we were reinstated but Vuyo Mvoko’s fight continued.  He was without a salary for almost two years and - and that was a very painful experience.    He was part of the eight.  It was just that his employment contract was different to ours.    We were permanent and he was freelance …    And he bore the biggest financial brunt …    Of standing up.    A lot of people would have wanted to stand up …    And have come to us and given us support …    And explained why they could not afford to lose their jobs …    And - and I - and I hold no grudge against my colleagues at all because they would have wanted to but we have also in this economy Chair …    With - with sometimes the reality in South Africa is one salary …    Feeds more than one family …    And you have got to keep that in mind.    Whistleblowing is often …   It is not a very glamorous …    Task …    And - and there are some heavy consequences that come with it.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Is that paragraphs 15 and 16?    (No audible reply).    This is - this Chair was - was at the - at the meeting that we had when he decided to cancel the - the editors and heis basically confirming what Mr Krige and I have told this Commission in our - in our evidence.  Ja.      Chair this was the first time this response – Mr Matthews response is the first time that I’ve heard of his response to anything that I have presented in public since that May meeting three years ago.  This may have no relevance to the Commission but I’m Hindu by belief and a God fearing person and I believe to err is human and to forgive is divine and that this is the closest of any kind of explanation or even to stretch it to an apology that I will ever receive from Mr Matthews but I do want to place on record that if he deemed and felt this way he had many opportunities to come to the fore, like Parliament and like this Commission itself because it really is important to show, Chair,  how the newsroom was abused because it really was abused.  There’s a lot of trauma in our newsroom that’s very slowlystarting to heal but I accept Mr Matthews’ explanation and I hope that this Commission can in some way or another, in your findings or recommendations ensure that this kind of reasoning will never hold water ever again in the newsroom in the Public Broadcaster.  We need to have unfailing leadership for such a massive institution.  Everybody wants their hands on the Public Broadcaster, it’s the first place you will start if you want to capture a mind or capture a nation or for that matter government and now’s the time to ensure that whatever recommendations you make, Chair, will all due respect, that this newsroom and this organisation is duly protected.     Chair would you like me to take that messageback to our newsroom?     Thank you, will do.     Chair you raise a very interesting point, I mean the GCEO, like you heard from Mr Madodo this week and he is the final accounting officer, he is the final voice and signature for many of the decisions, so it would be very hard to explain the dynamic Chair between Mr Matthews and Mr Motsoeneng.  I hadn’t come into contact with them much at all in fact before being summoned to that meeting.  So I wouldn’t be able to understand the dynamic that exists there but just in this, kind of, new SABC that we’re experiencing with the new executives that on-board, there’s a lot more transparency than we have been used to or have been exposed.  There’s a lot more communication to us than we’ve been exposed or have experienced and I’m not saying that, you know, they are going to take us out – I’m hoping they are going to take us out of our current situation but it’s a refreshingleadership Chair.  I have certainly not experienced this at the SABC.     In a long time, so it would be difficult for – from what I see from the current executives and how they communicate to us to what I’ve experienced with Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Matthews in that meeting is chalk and cheese but to talk about whether – why Mr Matthews, wouldn’t, as acting GCEO stand up to the COO would be very difficult for me to kind of understand why that happened or why it didn’t happen.     Thank you Advocate, Chair I have just before in preparation for evidence today, as you know even though I am giving evidence mostly on SAFM current affairs I am part of the so-called SABC aids and some of us had a brief caucus yesterday and there are a few things that I would like to put on record if you don’t mind?     So despite everything that has happened, during our fight as the SABC8 we have found that the majority of support we’ve had has been overwhelmingly from democracy loving people and we want to place on record our thanks to the South African public and our thanks to the entire journalism community.  It is one event that – we can’t recall in recent history where one of the journalism community came together regardless if you were private or public and regardless of what platform you belong to.  They came together to give us support and our public support was generously – went into crowd funding where we – when we were fired we received asum of money from the public that assisted us but unfortunately what happened here at this Commission was a very generous and innocent crowd funding idea, was then usurped when Bosasa claimed that Bosasa had made a donation to this which was proven to be completely untrue and we want to put on record our absolute thanks to the people who have put together that fund during our time of need.  Also Chair we want to put on record our thanks to Aslam Mussa G and Advocate Stephen Budlender, who over months worked with us pro bono and really stood the test of time with the SABC8 but we also want to put on record something that we are quite disappointed with and that’s the recent editorial inquiry report from Dr Jo Klawe, we are disappointed in the results of that report because we have been to Parliament and have, under oath, stated our experiences of the protest policy of the removal of the programme and we find it very difficult to understand that conclusion.  We understand that there will be no telephone call proof or email proof or photographic proof or video proof but we do find that, that kind of conclusion was quite worrying and concerning to say the least.  We also believe that when the SABC introduced the two inquiries, sexual harassment and the editorial inquiry, our colleagues were guaranteed anonymity to come forward with information, this was honoured by the sexual harassment inquiry but it was not honoured by the editorial inquiry.  The final report published all the names of everyone who came before.  I personally don’t mind because whatever I have brought to your attention is already in the public domain which I have brought to Dr Joe Klawe’s attention but there are some peoplewho stood up for the first time with the anonymity guaranteed and whose names were then plastered all over that report.  My concern and our concern as the SABC aids is that going forward should anybody want to whistle blow or bring anonymously issues to the fore will their identity be secure.  As journalists we have to protect our sources, journalists were the sources here and nobody protected them.  So we want to bring that and put that on the record Chair and finally I want to say that when a programme is removed and when you decide what the public needs to see or hear, who does that benefit?  It certainly doesn’t benefit the citizenry it doesn’t benefit the public we are meant to serve.  When you take out plurality of views and different perspectives and you decide what your audience, your viewer will see and hear, who does that benefit?  Surely all of this amounts to a form of capture, media capture in my opinion.  So Chair I implore this Commission to please safeguard the rights of the SABC newsroom and to ensure its longevity and to help save our organisation and that’s all I wish to submit.     Thank you Chair. 
PILLAY: So this is another correction in my supplementary. 
COMMISSIONER:      Please, please yes, you know, not just the SABC everybody, you know, other media houses, I’m very interested in getting submissions in due course on what recommendations I should consider to make sure that if those recommendations are implemented we prevent some of the things that have happened in the past from happening in the future because that’s very, very important.  So please do take it back to the newsroom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman.    Good afternoon.    Mr Chairman the next witness is also from the SABC and his name is Mr Mwaba Phiri.  I had asked the Registrar to open up Exhibit CC16 before you Mr Chairman.      Thank you.  We will also make reference to Exhibit 25.   Which is Mr Matthews’ statement.    Thank you.  May the witness be sworn in?    Thank you Mr Chairman.    Yes I may proceed.  Thank you.  Mr Phiri you have in front of you a lever arch file and I had asked that you have a look at a divider marked CC16 which contains what appears to be your statement, is that correct?    Yes thank youj.  If you go to that page 1 of that document it has your names, your full names there and then I would like you to have a look at page 6?     Is that your signature?    Thank you.  And then if you go to page 7 did you depose to that affidavit at Brixton 21 s t – on the 21 s t August 19?    Yes thank you.  And are the contents of your statement true and correct?    Yes thank you.  Mr Phiri is correct that you employed by the SABC?    In what position are you employed?    Yes. For how long have you been with the SABC?    Yes.    Yes.    Could you just – just briefly place yourqualifications on record?    Yes.    But just be careful not to…    Yes.    Yes thank you.    And now in terms of your career you told the Chairperson that then you were recruited in 1996.  Before that if you were in Zambia what positions were you holding there?    Yes thank you.  Did you then when you were recruited to South Africa did you – to the SABC rather did you progress through the ranks or were you recruited just to hold positions in the executive or management positions?    Yes.    Yes thank you.  And then in paragraph 3 of your statement at page 1.    Page 1.      Yes you state there that you were approached by the investigators of the commission hence you deposed to this affidavit.  Is that correct?    Yes thank you.  What – would you just briefly tell the Chairperson about the question time program that you deal with in paragraph 5 at page 2 of your statement as to what wasthis program and how long did it last and how did it end?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.     Yes.  And then how did you halt that program?    How did you put an end to the program or why?    Yes.    Yes.  Now we going to talk about that just now.  But I would like you to tell the Chairperson as to how were you told that this program is going to come to an end and what the reasons were for putting it – for halting that program?    Yes.    Yes and …    Oh sorry.    Thank you Chair.  What was the frequency okf this program, Question Time?    Yes and what time during the day?    Half past five pm.  So you walk into your work establishment one day and you are told that it is not going to – your program has come to an end?    Yes.    Yes.      Yes.    Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair.  The name of the person that you forgot just to remind you is that Ms Nomsa Philiso?    Is that correct?    Thank you.  Could you then tell the Chairperson about the incident then in your drive then to bring the people onto your program?  You have mentioned that after the release by the Public Protector of the – of her report governance – when governance and efforts failed in 2014 – February 2014.  So you say you decided that you were going to bring her to your show?    Or invite her to your show?    Yes.    Yes Mr Chair.    The answer.    Yes Mr Chairman.    Oh before the termination?    Yes, yes.    To meet yes and deal with it.    Yes thank you Chair.  Maybe we could finish that so that I do not forget.    Thank you.  You say then the CEO had given sort of a direction that you had to meet?    Yes Mr Maroleng.    You had to meet and resolve the issue but that never happened?    So I would imagine then when Mr Maroleng was not getting back to you you would have gone back to the CEO and say CEO nothing is happening, what is happening with my program?    Yes.      Yes.  So then during that 30 day periodthat you – of notice that was given to you then as a person who was producing this program I would imagine that would be the time for you to be telling your listeners and your viewers that this is going to  come to an end, is that what you did during that period?    Yes.  Was this…    Yes thank you.  How was the popularity of this program?    Yes.    And according to paragraph 5 of your statement it last for almost six years.    Yes. Thank you.  Then let us go back then to the question that – the matter that you were dealing with then.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then let us talk about then the report comes out on governance and ethics fail and you decide that you would want to invite…    Ms Madonssela.   Ms Madonsela to your show yes.  Take us through that process.  What did you do?  And then what happened?    Yes.    But then before you on how would you hide her with coming into the studio?  How did you manage that?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes thank you.  And the date is what you have in paragraph 9 being the 18 t h – Tuesday 18 t h February 2014?    That is the date?    Alright and then – so maybe I should just take you to – then you will tell me if you think that the reference to this article is premature but I think it relates to some of her invitations that were now declined in the sense that they were not going on.  If you could turn to page 9 of that – of your statement.  You will see there is two page.  Page 8 and then there is page 9.    Yes.  What does it say.    Yes and when you said some of her interviews were cancelled are you relating to this?    To this interview yes.    Yes thank you.    Yes.    Yes.  And then…    Thank you.  And then if you go to that page, page 9 let us just deal with that and then we know – then we move on we will not have to come back to it.  If you go back to page 9 you will see the date there is the Sowetan article date 19 February    So this is what you were talking about.    Yes.  Then did you get to know why this show was cancelled?  Even if it was just after you had now recorded her?    Yes.  And …    Yes alright.  But there is some reason that is – well this is – I think this – the spokeswoman for the Public Protector  “We were not aware that the interview was cancelled until we got here. He said Mandonsela spokeswoman Galele Masebi outside the studios were not given a reason why it was cancelled.”    That is what is contained in that yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  And then said then they just gave us an apology and that was it.    Thank you.  So going back then to your recording.  So then you say you ran away and then your program is going to air at five o’clock so you came back at five o’clock and…    Yes and you played?    Then it went on air.   Okay and then what were the consequences of you having done that?  What happened?    Yes; and - and …    Sorry.  Yes, thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So that was the first incident that you had mentioned - you mentioned and then the second incident you deal with it in paragraph 14 and you    Sorry.  Economic Freedom Fighters.    Oh, okay.    No, no I thought you said front, okay.  Maybe I miss …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And who is the GE News?  The name of the GE News?    Mr Jimi Matthews yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes; and - and in any event from what you are telling us he had no business telling you whether to air or not …   That program from - from what you had said.    Now - so the …    Sorry.    Yes.  So then these events - these two incidents they must have been the incidents that really - that is the reason why you felt that look you needed to bring these incidents to the attention of the Commission but what I want to understand is what do you conclude or what did you conclude at the time as to what was happening within the SABC and why would you regard these as changes within the Editorial Policy as you have headed one of the paragraphs?    Yes.    Familiar with it.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you and could just read out what you say to the Chairperson in paragraph 15 of your affidavit please?    Yes, yes 1-5.  That is at page 4.    Did - did you share these views?    Yes.  Then those are the only incidents that you wanted to highlight in your evidence.  Am I correct?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh you mean in the - in the - in Mr Kolosi (?)?    Oh no, no.  Those applications, yes.    Alright, okay.  No, ja - but then can we - can I just take you through to what Mr Matthews says in response to what you say about him?    Mr Matthews …    Thank you for doing a favour.    Yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  May I just - Chair direct your attention to EXHIBIT CC25 which is the affidavit of Mr Matthews?  Mr Phiri you have it there next to you.  If you could please turn to page 2 of that.    Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  After Mr Matthews was sent a 3.3 Notice he responded and this is his response to paragraphs 17 and 18 of your affidavit and he even quotes those - he started quoting from paragraph 16 and he deals with the incident that you testified to relating to Mr Malema and his response to    And then in paragraph 6 then he says I    Yes, yes.  Thank you.    Yes.    Thank you and then lastly Mr Phiri then the current environment that you are in now the newsroom and how matters have been handled now is it different from how it was in 2014 or has it improved and could you just tell the Chair if it has to what extent?    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman that is all from this witness.  Thank you.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman the next witness is the witness Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki.     Her statement is in EXHIBIT CC29.     Mr Chairman whilst the witness is proceeding to take a seat may I just explain to the Chair that this witness was moved, she was supposed to testify sometime next week, but because one witness that was supposed to – that was scheduled for today could not make it today due to an official engagement, we moved her to today, but all the implicated persons were notified telephonically and they had all indicated that they had no difficulty with her testifying today.     Thank you Chair.     Chair there is a few errors in the statement of the witness, her name is not spelt correctly, in fact I think the team that ...(intervention)      Yes, thank you, but what is interesting here Chair I think the mistake was made by the witness herself because if Chair had to go to page 28 where she signed her surname, the first surname is spelt incorrectly, and I think then the team that was binding went – in fact even on the first page Chair you will find that what is on page 28 and what is on the first page is also different, so the team just went with what is contained on the first page.       Yes, and then in 28 there’s Gc and then the witness signed, I think it must have been maybe a computer glitch there, I don’t know, but ...(intervention)      With the correct names yes Chair, thank you.  And then Chair you will find also this affidavit of the witness the witness herself had decided instead of attaching annexures to actually incorporate what’s contained in the Annexures, in the affidavit itself, so the numbering is a bit different.     But she is quite comfortable, I am quite comfortable leading her on her statement, we will be able to navigate it.     Some people like to do that yes.     No that is true Chair thank you.  Chair may she be sworn in?     Thank you Mr Chairman.     May the witness be sworn in?     Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you, Ms Gqubule-Mbeki can you please look at the document that is in front of you, is that your statement, in fact it is an affidavit, but it is written statement at page one is that correct?     Thank you, and if we turn to page 28 of that document.      Yes is that your signature that appears there?     Thank you and then is it correct that your first surname is not spelt correctly there, could you correct it for the record.     Yes thank you, and that is the same at page if you go to page one it also is misspelt there, is that correct?     Yes thank you, yes, we will do, we will have to do a supplementary affidavit but after you have testified today to correct those errors.     Yes thank you, and did you make this statement freely and voluntarily?     Yes, and the contents of this affidavit is true and correct?     Yes thank you.  Could you just tell the Chairperson ...(intervention)      There were others that are incorporated, are various court applications.     Yes it was.     Yes thank you Chair.   Thank you, where are you currently employed?     And what is the position that you holdthere?     Could you please place on record your qualifications please?     Yes thank you.     Yes, thank you ...(intervention)      And those qualifications most of them are contained in paragraph 5 of your statement?     Yes thank you.  Could you then tell the Chairperson that I would imagine maybe even without going into detail into what happened with the SABC 8 because your colleagues have already spoken to it, maybe you could just highlight the areas that Mr Krige and Ms Pillay have not dealt with in their evidence, which I believe you might have had – listened to or at least have had a look at what they testified to the Commission about.  Could you  just highlight those areas that they have not dealt with?     Yes.     He spoke about him largely.     Yes.     So having yourself, having been a lecturer teaching journalism I am sure it must have been shocking, something that was unheard of that you could be told what to cover and what not to cover.     So then he would after the meeting then you would be directed to simply implement that decision that he had taken.     Yes.     So then the next meeting would be the one that you moved to, the one where you were then fired?     I seem to recall that according to Ms Pillay’s evidence it would be between June, around June/July but we’re just looking for the exact dates from her statement.    Yes Chair.     Just as a matter of interest that right to know story did it relate to this policy?     Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Oh sorry I beg your pardon.    Are you finished?  I apologise.    Sorry.  Ordinarily when there is decent as there was at this meeting what usually happens because look you have recorded your disapproval of whatever it is that they wanted to do and the journalists were going to – they wanted to cover this story.  So if then there is that kind of dissenting voice what would ordinarily happen say if you are in a normal environment.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.  So then this is all – then those meetings happened and then let us get to the meeting then where you were finally dismissed.    Yes.   Alright.  So then that is how you – then after that then there was a dismissal that – because you…    That is the suspension that you dealing with yes.    Yes.    I think I saw it was [mumbling]    Yes.    Thank you. Thank you did you ultimately appear then before disciplinary hearing?    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then – and then when – were you then brought before someone who was going to discipline you?    And who was that person?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  And the disciplinary proceeded?    Yes.  And then after that postponement is that the matter that ended up in the labour court?    Yes.  And then – but…    Labour court.    Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I would like to – us then to deal with specific matters because now that you have confirmed what Mr Krige and Ms Pillay had testified to about your having been dismissed from the SABC I think you deal with quite important topics.    In your statement at page 3.  Instances of political interference in the news agenda and mandate of the SABC and you deal there with about two instances and I would like you to just take the Chair through those.  The one refers to what is – was popularly known as the Nanagate and the circumstances around what was supposed to happen in the news about that matter quickly.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Is it even possible not to take into account the political climate when you looking at the performance of the rand or is it something that you can actually just ignore and focus on the fine [indistinct] markets without even looking at the political climate?    Yes thank you.      Yes thank you.  And you refer to that conduct of hers as being illogical and un-journalistic in paragraph 9, is that correct?    Thank you.  And then in paragraph …    Yes.      Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then can you also highlight another incident when you deal with the mandate of the SABC at page – at paragraph 10 page 4 where somebody handed you a file for you to investigate. Could you talk to that?    Yes thank you.    Thank you. Thank you Mr Chairman the time now is four o’clock.  This witness still has some ground to cover.    Yes, yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair I would prefer that we continue because I have a request to make to you Chair about tomorrow.    Yes thank you.    Thank you Mr Chairman thank you.  So then in paragraph 11 in     Just a five minute adjournment.    Yes thank you Mr Chairman.    Thank you.      Thank you.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Gqubule-Mbeki you speak then from paragraph 11 right up to - all the sub paragraphs in paragraph 12 of the threats then that they directed at you and other journalists - the SABC eight.    Yes.  Could you just summarise because the Chairperson has read your statement?  Just summarise briefly those threats that you believe that they are - I am not suggesting that there is any threats are not important but just to summarise the ones that you wish to place on record.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes and then the …    The second one, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Thank you and then you speak about something that happened on Monday, 18 December 2017.    Sorry.  Before you - you move on from that one.  You mentioned something about a picture of your daughter that was linked to the account.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Yes.  Yes and I would imagine with all these threats that you receiving on your phones you would have then had to approach the police?    Yes.  What happened?    Thank you.    Yes and then you make - in paragraph 14 you deal with you approaching a General of Intelligence.    Yes.    Yes.        17.    2017.    Yes Chair.   Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you Chair and then you move onto deal with two incidents of break ins in properties in some of your colleagues which were like two days apart.  The 6 t h of - the 6 t h and 8 October 2017.    Yes.    Yes.    And then going forward you deal with what was now happening with you at work in paragraph 18.    Yes.   Yes, thank you.  You may proceed.  Paragraph 18.  Thank you.    Yes.  Thank you and paragraph 19.  You deal with what …    And audit query?  Was it an audit query?    Yes.    Hm.            Yes.    Yes.  Thank you and in paragraph 20 you deal with a day when you were accosted by the police and the SABC security.  Could you just quickly tell the Chair about that incident?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes Chair.  Thank you Chair.    Thank you Mr Chairman and then in paragraph 21 you deal with an incident when you - you and your colleagues were chased by a car until you reached a certain ShellGarage where then later you were able to view the footage and you got to get to the name of the person who was chasing you and there is currently litigation.    Yes.     If I may direct the witness Chair page 8, 29 January 2018.     You ask why the employee is chasingjournalists and you – well I wrote to the Board members, including my sister in-law Phoebe (indistinct) Gqubule and I asked for a full report.  I never received a report on this incident, but ...(intervention)      Yes, thank you.     Yes Chair.     Thank you Chair, we will do that, thank you.    Then Chair as I have indicated because of the pacing of the annexures then the paragraphs, now we are at paragraph 175, it may appear as if we have jumped but it is actually the sequence.     Yes thank you, then you make mention of your colleague Ms Sophie Mokwena and just tell the Chair what happened between you and her.    Thank you. Sorry, Mr Chairman we’ve gone past 5 o’clock. I’m sorry I lost track of time.    That we finish? Thank you.    Thank you very much. Shall we then deal with the issue where the Sunday World according to paragraph 177 were they publish an article about you and the SIU. Could you talk to that?    Thank you Mr Chairman. Yes?    I beg your pardon, sorry.    Yes.    Okay, yes. Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Maybe now that you’ve dealt with the issue of your appointment and the interview, I should just bring to your attention that Mr Hlaodi Motsoeneng has submitted an affidavit to the Commission. At page, paragraph 128 of his affidavit he says, the Commission amongst other things that he deals with about various employees. He says, The Commission should also check the new appointees and check what kind of processes was followed especially Thandeka Gqubule whom I have been advised never attended any interviews. I know you do deal with the interview issue in your affidavit in particular at page 26. That you could not attend when other people were interviewed but you were subsequently interviewed. MS THANDEKA    Yes, thank you. Thank you, Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes, thank you. And then paragraph 180 you deal with the death of Ms Suna Venter and you are relating her death to the threats that you were all receiving or are you just mentioning the matter?    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you, Chair. Can I just ask before I take you to the last paragraph? As you would, I’m sure you would appreciate that you’ve reached the end of your statement?    Could you just tell the Chairperson because this is a matter that Ms Pillay had raised regarding the report that Mr Joe Tlolo had prepared after having been commissioned to do so by the SABC. And you indicated in consultation that you had raised certain concerns about that report and I would like you to raise those so that when Mr Tlolo comes before the Commission tomorrow, he is aware of the matters that you are complaining about.    Yes.    Thank you. We will raise those. They will be raised with him tomorrow morning. Thank you. Chair…(intervention).    Sorry.    Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you. Just lastly, what you’ve told the Commission for the two and a half hours that you’ve been sitting there, you summarize it at page 27. And I think it’s only fair that I allow you to just read that paragraph into the record because it summarizes everything that you’ve told the Chairperson. Yes, thank you.    Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman. That is the evidence from this witness.    Yes, thank you.    Thank you, Mr Chairman. That is all for today.    Yes, thank you.    Tomorrow we’ve lined up only two witnesses Mr Chairman and that’s one of the things I like to talk to you about.    They are not going to be long witnesses at all.    And that might mean that we might have to finish early.    I think by lunchtime. We should even.    Or even slightly before lunchtime.    Yes, yes Chair.    Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.    Thank you.    Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mwaba Phiri.    I have no objection.    I truly affirm.    That is true.    Page 6.    That is my signature.    Yes I did.    They are true and correct.    It is correct.    I am an Executive Producer in the Current Affairs department.    The SABC recruited me from Lusaka in 1996.    My maths is very bad.  20 – sorry that should be 25 years.    Yes.    Okay.      I hold a Post Graduate Diploma in Business Management from Milpark Business School.  Or am I going about it the wrong way?  Should start from my matric?     Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  And I also hold a Bachelor of Mass Communications Honours Degree from the University of Zambia obtained in 1989.  I matriculated in Zambia in Pati Mufulira Secondary School.    In 1975.  Thank you.    That is all.    Oh I worked in various organisations. I worked with Zambia Information Services, Zambia News Agency and Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation.   No I went through the ranks.  I was initially recruited because the SABC was on a very big program to venture into the continent.  So Channel Africa Radio Station is the one that brought me to Johannesburg.  But then as I was here the SABC started the first 24 hour news channel it was called SABC Africa and then I – I was moved from the radio to television.  From 1998 up to now I have been rising – yes I might say what you call rising through the ranks.    Happened to me.    Paragraph 3.    Yes Chair I have got it.    That is correct.    Question time was a program designed to interrogate news makers of various what should I say, professions.    Different sectors.    It was providing an in-depth kind of feel about what is break – what is making news?  Like right now the violence is making news.  We would have probably brought in the Home Affairs Minister or various NGO’s.    It was that kind of program.    It started just initially with the – with the start of the SABC News channel in 2012.  So we were on air from 2012 up to 18.    Sorry I did not get your question.    I never put an end to that program.  The program was halted in very, very controversial circumstances. During reign of Mr Motsoeneng, Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng the program was quitecontroversial in that we brought people that were not friends of for lack of a better word yes not friends people whom management was not happy about to our platforms and this annoyed most of our managers.  So much so that we used to – we ended up coming in and fulfilling our mandate rather secretly.    Like the instances I have put in my affidavit where we have – we had to smuggle in Ms Madonsela, Ms Thuli Madonsela after she had released the report on the SABC,    I was told in 2018 by Ms Maseko, Ms Nothando Maseko that the program would not continue.  Then I proceeded to request reasons behind that.  She did not have any reasons so I in upward referral…    She did not give me reasons.    But nevertheless because of upward referral I decided to take it to the acting – I thought [indistinct] it was the acting CEO. She called for a – sorry she did not call for a meeting I cannot remember what happened.  I think we …    Acting CEO.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    It was Ms Nom – sorry I forget – her second name Nomsa.    The second name I forget it.    Ja at the meeting we heard – I think we discussed this issue. She thought it needed to be resolved between me and the COO.  The COO.    The COO then was Mr Maroleng, Chris Maroleng.    Yes Chair.  Her directive was never enforced.  He never came back to me despite my queries on whether we would go ahead and do what the CEO had requested of us.    Yes Chair.    Exactly Chair.    And interview them.    Precisely Chair.  Precisely.    Exactly Chair.    That is what it was.      It was a daily program. From Monday to Friday initially – sorry Monday to Saturday initially then we changed it sometwo years into the operations of SABC News into a four day program.      What I would call 17   I was given some 30 days’ notice.    Yes Ms Maseko sent me a memorandum which said next – from next month this program will not be on air.    Which news management did not like.    Maybe I made a sweeping statement.  It is not always but everybody that we brought in was not liked.  But we had the audacity for lack of a better word to bring in even the people that management did not want because we felt they were driving the news.    Definitely so Chair.    Philiso yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  At our daily editorial meeting we decided – my team decided we needed to have Ms Madonsela even if she was giving a report that was quite negative for the SABC.      No this is actually before.    This is before. This is in 2014.    Mr Maroleng had to meet me.   To resolve this issue.    That never happened up to today it has not happened.    I indeed went back to the acting CEO.  I still did not receive any response.    I was not given any response.    I communicated in writing.    Yes Chair.    I did not get any response.    I must admit I was defiant and I thought announcing to my audience that we are going off air I would be agreeing that – agreeing to the wrong decision that the program should go off air.  I had not agreed.  If they were going to give me a rationale of some kind I would probably have gone and told my audience that yes the program is coming to an end but they did not come back to me.    Yes Chair.    Very true Chair.    I get the final answer.    Very true.    Very true.    That is true Chair.    Should go off air.    In the program going ahead.  That is true Chair.    This was one of the most popular programs on the channel.  The marketing department for the SABC would probably give you the data – the evidence that they were often giving all of us.  They said it was the best performing program in the afternoon section of the broadcast.  So on one day when this marketing professional was giving us this talk he was puzzled at the fact that it had been pulled off air.    From half past five in the afternoon to six o’clock.    30 minutes.    But very, very popular.    Yes Chair.    Yes it ended. It was – it was just pulled off air I would say.    Without any further discussion. So much so that I was forced to take the issue to the Joe Tlolo Commission – editorial commission.    It features in that report.    But even then I am still awaiting some kind of action after that.    Ms Madonsela.    Ja there was a very, very stifling atmosphere at the SABC then.  We had a…    2014.    Yes.    2014.  So much so that even the bringing – sorry the inviting of Ms Madonsela was done discreetly.  We did not want the top management to be aware of whom we are – we were bringing in.  But even then we still knew that we could – sorry I forget one thing.  At the time the program was a pre-recorded program meaning we would record in the morning and then put it on air later.  So when we invited Ms Madonsela we had to make sure that between the time of recording and the time of airing nobody interfered with whatever product we had.  So we went about this by doing everything very, very secretly.  Invited – we invite her, she comes, sorry again I forgot something.  We had a strategy in which we first of all informed our colleagues in the“colleagues” in the news media in the [indistinct] media that we were going to have Ms Madonsela on our program.  We were going to record her at a certain time.  This ensured that they would bring in a camera person of some kind who would record the fact that we had talks to Ms Madonsela.  If she does not go on air they would still have the recording.    Yes.  So that is what happened.    We recorded Ms Madonsela but we hid the tape that – the tape is called the FX tape that is the final tape that we have to – supposed to take to FCC.  FCC is supposed to be the final control centre.  These are the people who receive a product and then put it on air for the rest of the public to view.  We hid that tape from everybody.  We wanted to give – to hand it in only at about five o’clock thirty minutes before going on air.  And I think that plan worked quite well because if there was anybody looking for it they could not have seen the tape anywhere.      Okay what we did in this case is the team gave the tape to me to keep.    So I was holding onto the tape and this is a bit embarrassing I ran away from the office.  I had to run away because Iwas anticipating queries.    But where is this tape.  So I had to run away until five o’clock that is when I came back.    And then handed it over to FCC.    Oh I see.  No I would not actually put it in those words.  We did not hide her as such.  She had come – she had come earlier for a program called News At Eight.    It is a radio program.      Now she did not go on air.  I do not know what happened there I am on the TV side.    On the – but we heard rumours that her show which was supposed to have been done earlier had been cancelled so now my team was getting very tense.  If her earlier radio shows were being cancelled what would happen to us?  And indeed even before that again one of my team members came and told me she is supposed tobe on Morning Live but she has been cancelled again.  We nevertheless decided we just had to go ahead with whatever we are doing.  We knew we were going to be in big problems but we decided let us go ahead.    For other programs yes.      18 t h February yes if I recall, yes.    That was the date.    Page 9 Thuli in duck.    Thuli in duck over cancelled interview.    To this interview.   Ja this is the radio interview.    And I am sure if you can see there is a picture of Thuli and Mpho Seduma a presenter.    He was the presenter of this program.    They are coming – emerging from the SABC>    Yes.    Yes Chair that is what I am talking about.    Not formally.  All I knew was that because of the fact that she – she had a report that was negative about our COOdefinitely she would not be welcome.    But I think the SABC did issue their own reasoning behind – they claimed something of the sort that she was not invited properly.  I am not on record.     That is true.    That is true Chair.    That is true Chair.    I came back at five o’clock.    Ja.    Ja then it went on air.    My line manager Mr Themba Mthembo called me and – well he asked for the professional reasons behind me bringing in Ms Madonsela.  I explained exactly that she is the kind of person this program had been made for.  She is making news at the moment.  And people want to find out more about whatever reports she has given.  Mr Mthembo was to me looked quite understanding.  He said it is alright but unfortunately I have to go and explain this at some meeting.  That is what he told me.  My line manager Mr Themba Mthembo called me and – well he asked for the professional reasons behind me bringing in Ms Madonsela.  I explained exactly that she is the kind of person this program had been made for.  She is making news at the moment.  And people want to find out more about whatever reports she has given.  Mr Mthembo was to me looked quite understanding.  He said it is alright but unfortunately I have to go and explain this at some meeting.  That is what he told me.    According to SABC Editorial Policy I am not supposed to but we do have - we do have a diary meeting at which we call an “idea” is handed over and you explain to this - to the meeting who you are going - who you are going to invite.    Yes.  It is at that meeting.    Normally ja because the manager of - of the product or the program …    Decides.    They could give you advice which - which might make you think twice …    And you may …    Decide not to go ahead.    Nothing more than advice.    This incident involved Mr Julius Malema.  The leader of the Economic Freedom Front.  He had just released his …    Economic Freedom Fighters.    The part - it is a political party.    Is it Economic Freedom Front or …?    It is fighters?    Mr Malema had just released his party election list on March, the 17 t h.  My team again felt that he was the right person to bring to our program …    But like I - like I have said the atmosphere in theSABC - this is a month later after the - after Ms Madonsela’s case.    Bringing him in was going to be very difficult.  What - indeed when he came in unfortunately by some coincidence he was coming in as our GE News was going out for a - for the workshop that my colleague Krivani was earlier talking about.  So they were going to - to some hotel in East Rand to discuss election coverage.    Mr Jimi Matthews.    Mr Jimi Matthews.    I hear that - I was not - I do not know what happened but I hear that immediately he saw - he saw Malema going in he looked for somebody to follow him and go and stop whatever he was doing.  So this happened to be Mr Kwesi Sikosana my colleague.  He was also an Executive Producer.    Mr Kwesi Sikosana went after Mr Malema to go and stop whatever interview he was doing but before that another colleague called Vincent Mphondesi came to my office and tipped me off and said your program is about to be - to be stopped.  Go to the studio right now.  So I ran to the studio and indeed I found Mr Sikosana busy telling my team to stop - to halt the recordings.I told Mr Sikosana I would not - my reporting line had nothing to do with him but nevertheless he insisted that he - I should not have a quarrel with him.  It is not him to blame.  He was only passing on a message from Mr Matthews.  I retorted that his message had been received but we were going ahead with our recording.  I had asked him to leave the studio. We - we continued with the recording and we concluded with it eventually …    But given these happenings we knew we would be in big problems.  So we decided rather spontaneously to - to - not it was not spontaneously this.  We decided to have two tapes - two final tapes and then one we hid.  I was having - I was holding onto it.  The other one my team was holding because we were now anticipating either Mr Matthews or anyone to come and request for that tape. Before we could go near - I cannot remember precisely the order of events but Mr Tebele approached my team and asked for the tape.    As I suspected it would happen Chair.  Mr Tebele unfortunately was from a different unit all together.  He was heading what we call the Special Projects Department.  So I wondered why he had to ask for my tape.  Nevertheless by the time I was thinking about that Mr - Mr Tebele had already been handed the tape.  I would nothave handed it to if …    If he had come to me …    But he had gone behind me …    And talked to my - to my juniors …    And asked for the tape.    So they gave him the tape.    There was also some controversy over this.  I remember Mr Malema on his part he thought that - that prerecording they had done on that particular day would go on air later in that day but it was not supposed to be that way.  It was supposed to be the following day.  So when they did not see their - their show on air …    They concluded the SABC had …    Had cancelled it yes …    But it had not been cancelled yet.    I was holding onto the tape like I said.   The second one yes but it was the same thing.    (Intervenes), ja.    No apparently what happened Chair was this.  They - Mr - Mr Tebele viewed the tape and came back to my team and told them he was - he was of the opinion it was alright.    It could go on air …    But he never came back again to come and tell us …    If we should go on air or not.  I did not - I did not wait for him.    He brought back the tape to my team …    The next day but …    True.    True Chair.    Yes Chair.    They went to - to the media and spread the story that SABC had cancelled their interview.    I think that was the story that was trending in - in those two days.    I was sort of not very concerned about that because I knew it would go on air …    In the evening …    Next - on the next day.    So when it went on air I think they silently …    It was not very difficult to conclude although we may be accused of speculating more than necessary but our COO at the - at the time had just been I think confirmed in that position.  Now if you monitored the victory over …    Our COO from I think producer level up to COO position it was some kind of amazing thing.  How a producer would go and become the COO.  Apart from that given Thuli Madonsela’s report I do not know if you - if you are familiar with it.    Ms Madonsela had stated that our COO had no Matric and then she wondered why - what he was doing in the SABC. Given all those kinds - kinds of happenings around at that time you were bound to believe that this gentleman had ties with very, very offices in - in the land. How else did he make - manage to go up in such a very, very - what can I say for lack of a better word.  Such a lightning manner.  At the same time as …    Very quickly yes.    At the same time as he goes into that COO’s office …    Like lightning ja.    As he arrives in the office of the COO the Minister of Communication decides to change the job responsibilities or descriptions of the COO position so that he now has control over the newsroom.  All - all along the COO in the SABC had nothing to do with the newsroom but suddenly he is a person who goes controversially into that position and becomes head of - of the newsroom. That left many of the - many of my colleagues to think he has very, very strong relations with someone in the - in the - high in the political leadership.  So that became very stifling in the newsroom.  You did not - you did not need to be on his wrong side.   I was talking about Mr Motsoeneng.    Yes Chair.    There should be about six - six yes.  Producer, senior bulletin editor, executive producer there should be about six.    Through most of those …    Ranks.    Yes Chair.    On - on paragraph 15?    “The newsroom was at the time a buzz with Mr Motsoeneng’s close ties withPresident Jacob Zuma and inviting a person like Mr Malema who was going to be seen as an affront to our boss’ reputed relation with President Zuma.”    Yes I did.    Yes.  These are the only ones.    I think I raised some other incidents which you are aware of when the SABC eight was asking for a - for a review.    My affidavits are there.    In the Constitutional Court.  No, in the Constitutional Court.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  Those things - I would probably say even worse things happened.    If - if I have to somehow refer to the - the otheraffidavits I am submitted with the SABC eight.    There was times - there were times when somebody would be on air …    And then you get a call that halt that program - stop that program immediately.    So you have to go there and …    Defend yourself.    As - as the program is on air.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Page 2?    Hm.    I would just probably say I accordingly accept the truth of this - of this contents as far as I am concerned.    Recording studio Chair.   Mr Matthews.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    That is what the person said.  That is true …    And he told my team …    To stop the recording.    That remains.    (Intervenes).    That is true.    That is true, ja.   It has definitely improved.  I would - I will give a very bias answer because I am affected.  My program is not on air.  That is why I - I cannot say it is excellent.  It has improved …    But my program went off air because I suspect of the residues of the Motsoeneng area who are still trying to have their way at the SABC.    Question time.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  I have been fighting for that up …    Up to today.    Yes Chair.    Not directly.  Except for times when I would probably invite him to my program.    Ja.    He would come in.    In - influential is I - I think Chair what you are the Judge would politely want to put it.    As far as the newsroom was concerned he was authoritarian.  He was a dictator.  Whatever he - he wanted - whatever he woke up with must be done.  I gave the example not in this forum somewhere else.    Of the fact that the 90 percent South African music …    And director - directorate was not in any way bad but just the way it was done.    Ja.  It - it - there was no strategy.  Somebody just wakes up one day and tells all of you 90 percent.  There - there are quarters - there are local music quarters nearly everywhere around the globe.  You find the French have got something like nine - I think it is 99 percent music must be in - in their language only.    Yes.    So there was probably nothing wrong …    With the SABC going to 90 percent …   But the way it was done …    Was not proper.    He antagonised stakeholders within and outside.    Business could have been partners in that 90 percent …    Felt that (indistinct) by …    Withdrawing their business …    And that is what made it fell …    Because there is no …    No consultation.    Sorry Chair I …    I also wanted to put this on record.  I thought thisCommission needs to look out for - for the fact that state broadcasters around the continent are some - they are the norm on the continent.  As a result even our political leadership he wants to replicate both.  Fortunately for South Africa it has a constitution that is very, very, very - so ideal that I think it goes into the clouds instead of interrupting with the people.  It is - it is too good.    Yes; and I do not think it is appreciated on the - on the ground.  The media - us the news media needs to play our role there.  I think we are very integral to the constitutional requirement or the fact that for - for your - for the judiciary, the legislature and Parliament to check each other.  They must have freedom of expression.  They cannot do that without freedom of expression.    So if the public broadcaster is captured that kind of check would never - will not take place.    We need to have a - public broad - a public broadcaster more than any other broadcaster.  Let us forget about the - the private media.    The public broadcaster whose stakeholdership includes the whole country needs to be protected …    From any form of capture …   From either the state …    Political or even ideological …    Capture.     So I would have thought, I would like to be very stern about our plea that something should happen after this Commission to protect the SABC so well that whatever happened in the last five years should never, ever occur again.     We will definitely respond.    Thank you Chair. 
MR PRETORIUS:  I don’t have a microphone.    I’m in your hands.   So, it depends how long the evidence will go.    I will do.
