CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody.     Before we start with the oral evidence I am going to make an order that has got nothing to do with the witness who will be giving evidence today.  It is an order relating to some application for Leave to Cross-examine.  Let me deal with that and then we can start.  The order that I am going to make relates to an application that was brought by Mr Kevin Wakeford for Leave to Cross -examine Mr Angelo Agrizzi and Mr Frans Hendrick Steyn Vorster who previously gaveevidence in this commission in relation to Bosasa.  I am going to make this order and will only give reasons if it becomes necessary at a later stage.  The order I make is that  1. The applicant’s non-compliance with the time frames provided for in the rules governing the commission’s pr oceedings in relation to the orders set out below and to the extent necessary extending such time frames - okay I am going to rephrase that.  He applicant’s non-compliance with the rime frames provided for in the rules governing the commission’s proceeding s in relation to applications for Leave to Cross-examine a witness is herebycondoned. 2. The applicant is hereby granted in terms of Rule 3.3.6 read with Rules 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 leave to give oral evidence and to cross-examine the witnesses who have given evidence and implicated him names Mr Angelo Agrizzi and Mr Frans Hedrick Steyn Vorster on such terms  as the Chairperson will give at the commencement of the cross-examination.   3. The applicant is granted leave in terms of Rule 3.9 to make written and oral submissions on the possible findings and conclusions that the commission ought to make on the evidence placed before it insofar as that evidence relates to him.   The cross-examination of Mr Agrizzi will take place on Wednesday this week and at the c ommencement of the proceedings I will announce the amount of time that I will give the applicant to cross -examine each one of those two witnesses.Yes Mr Mokoena.    Yes let us do that.    Thank you.    Thank you very much.    Hm.   Yes I was going to make that point as well.     Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No thank you very much.      Hm.    Yes.    That is A and B?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Well if we just say they are Exhibit LLA, Exhibit LLB, Exhibit LLC would that not be adequate?     Yes I can see…     I can see it is just that the way we have dealt with Exhibits most of the time you will recall is that I prefer that what the Exhibit is should be r eflected on the spine of the lever arch file.     So that if I am looking for Exhibit LL1…     I should see that on the spine.    I should not see Exhibit LL and then I have to go through a documents.    Inside to find.   Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Are you under A?    You see what we could do is on the spine we could write Exhibit LL1 to Exhibit LL2 if inside the  lever arch file you have got both Exhibit LL1 and Exhibit LL2.  So at least on the spine the reader is told what is insider.    Yes.    Both of them 1.    So then we can have LL1A     And LL1B.    No that is fine.  As long as what is inside if th ere is different exhibits is reflected on the spine as well.     Yes.    Ja.    And you must just – we must just remember to make sure the witnesses files are also appropriately marked so if we talk about Exhibit LL1A, Exhibit LL1B.     He knows exactly which file you are talking about.     Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    So the third file which is marked Duduzane Zuma prep bundle C.   On the spine will be marked Exhibit LL2 to Exhibit LL7.    Okay.  Yes.    Well the last documents appear to me to be diagrams?    Yes.  Okay.      Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Before Mr Mokoena you – before you start Mr Zuma I just want to emphasise a point that your counsel or one of your counsel made is that you are not here because you have been subpoenaed to be here.  You are not here because you have been compelled to be here.  You are here because you decided last year when your application for Leave to Cross -examine Mr Jonas was being dealt with that you would co -operate withthe commission and that you would make yourself available to the commission to give evidence.  I did say at the time and I want t o repeat today that I think that was a good decision. This is an opportunity where whatever it is that any witness may have said about you, you get an opportunity to put your side of the story and the commission has no particular preferred version.  The co mmission was to just get to the truth.  You put your side, other witnesses have put their side. At the end of the day I will look at all the aversions and decide what I believe the truth is.  So I just want you to – to know that all versions will be looked at and will be considered and you must just put your side of the story.  Questions will be put to you by the evidence leader.  In putting questions he too does not have any particular preference for any version he too seeks to simply try and establish wha t the truth is.  I may ask you questions as well I probably will ask you some questions.  The whole point is just to make sure that I understand what yourversion is.  I understand what other witness’ version is.  I may have – I may put questions that indicate that I have some difficulty with some aspects of either of your version or of another witness’ version but that does not mean that there is any version that is being preferred by the Chairperson.  It just seems – it just means that I want to establish  where the truth lies.  So if you do not understand any question feel free to say so and it will be repeated and I am sure some of these things your counsel have explained but I just want to make sure that you understand.      You understand.  Okay.  Thank you.     Mr Mokoena.    You might …    Just wish – I am sorry to raise your voice Mr Zuma.     Yes or bring the microphone a little closer but not too close.  Ja.      What page?    Thank you.      Hang on one second Mr Mokoena.  I think this lever arch file is too full.  Maybe during the tea break another lever arch file can be used. There is something wrong with this or moving from a pagesomewhere at the beginning towards the end is problematic.  It i s 7?    Ja Okay.    We - we remain with the same file?     Okay.    Well let me ask this question.  On your version and the version of Mr Hlongwane what the three of you were going to discuss that is yourself, Mr  Hlongwane and Mr Jonas needed only the three of you and nobody else.  Is that right?     Now one would have expected that really if your - one of the three of you has a house close by that - that is where you would - you would go because on your version what you want ed to discuss had nothing to do with the Guptas.  So - so I - that is what I would expect because it is just the three of you and maybe what you wanted to discuss could very well be discussed as a very personal issue.  As I understand the position and you m ust tell me if I am - my understanding is wrong.  You were friends with Mr  Hlongwane and Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas had been friends for a long time as I understand Mr Jonas’ evidence as well as Mr  Hlongwane’s affidavit. That - that is what one would have expected. It is - it is something that has got nothing to do with - with the Guptas.  One of you has a house close by.  Why do you not just to go - to that house and sit there and discuss this personal matter among ourselves without anybody?     But of course to the extent that you - you or the three of you wanted a private meeting.  Then if you went to somebody else’shouse there could be - there was always a risk - there would always have been a risk of people intruding and so on.  Whereas if it was your house you would be in charge of the house and if you said you do not want anybody to interrupt the meeting then nobody would interrupt the meeting.  You understand that?     Yes, okay.        I might have missed something.    Did he know that you were going to the Gupta residence when he jumped into the car or is that something he got to know after he had jumped into the car?     On the same day?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm, okay.    Did you say we must go to B?     Okay and what is the page number?     Yes.    Yes.  I have got it.   We    I think it is says “we” Mr  Mokoena.    Ja.    Well Mr Mokoena so you - you say why the two decide.  Is that what y ou intend saying?   Oh.    Okay.    Hm.    Actually I think according to Mr  Jonas the two of you had never met or intro - being introduced to each other until October 2015.  Is that right?    Yes, okay.     Before you move away from the previous question MrMokoena I do want to get the full perspective from your side of your involvement because I think it’s important, it’s an issue that keeps on coming back to my mind as well, namely if as we now know, you had really never met Mr Jonas obviously you might have met in meetings but you have never been introduced to each other, you  didn’t know each other in that sense, and you were just friends with Mr Hlongwane and Mr Hlongwane had been friends with Mr Jonas for many years, it is strange that Mr Hlongwane shouldn’t either speak to Mr Jonas himself about these rumours or get somebody, that, if he can’t fro whatever reason or if he feels that maybe it won’t be – he needs a third person why he didn’t think of getting somebody who knew both himself and Mr Jonas to say, you know both of us, maybe you are friends with both of us there’s an issue between us, won’t you help us resolve this?  So that is that question in my mind and I would like to get your full perspective because it seems strange why somebody who is a stranger to one ofthe parties should be asked to be the one to make arran gements for the two friends to meet and discuss an issue?      In understand you completely, the need for you to bepresent at the meeting to the extent that you might be the one who knew about these allegations or these rumours.      That I don’t have a problem with that, the difficulty that I have is, you being tasked with the responsibility of organising the meeting because that s my understanding of what your evidence it, that is my understanding of what Mr Hlongwane says in his affidavit.  I would understand if, what Mr Hlongwane did was either to speak to Mr Jonas and say, let’s have a meeting or get somebody else to arrange that who is known to Mr Jonas but say you must be present becauseyou know about these rumours, th at would have – I would have understood.  But with regard to why it may be – at least for me, it’s natural to expect that in this situation, Mr Hlongwane – one would expect Mr Hlongwane to either speak to Mr Jonas himself to arrange the meeting or to get somebody who is known to both of them is that, in a way the two parties who have issues need to have confidence in the third party that is being brought in, you understand that?      Now if you don’t know somebody i t might be difficult to have confidence in that person for purposes of helping to find a solution to a problem.  Whereas if it is somebody that you know, and maybe both parties, namely Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas have confidence in that person they trust tha t person won’t be biased, will just try to help them.  Maybe they know that, that person has got skills of trying to help people resolve issues, then it makes a lot of sense tome, you understand, that’s where I’m coming from with my question but you have put your perspective but if you have got something more that you would like to say about it, please feel free to do so.      You understand?     Okay, thank you.     And maybe, I’m sorry Mr Mokoena, maybe just to complete the picture of what I was saying Mr Zuma, in that kind of situation where the two friends – where two friends have an issue they want to resolve between themselves, actually, if the one friend knows that the person being proposed to play the role of helping them resolve this issue is a friend to the other one but a stranger to him, he might be more reluctant to agree to this person but if the person who is being asked to help them resolve the issue is somebody that is either friends with both of them or not friends with any o ne of them but knows them, then there might be more chances of acceptance, you understand?      Yes, yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes, you must just understand when I put questions to you like this, that it doesn’t mean that’s a permanent view in my mind.     It’s simply to be transparent with you to say this is what’s going on in my mind, tell me what you might be able to tell me and my view might change at the end but it’s just to be transparent with you to say, this is what is concerning me, what can you tell me about it.     Okay alright.     Yes we will take the tea adjournment.      Well it is after quarter past we’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at twenty five to twelve, we adjourn.     Yes let us proceed Mr Mokoena.    Yes.     Let us see there have been times when we have had to switch it off because one cannot hear properly.     Okay let us see how we go.    Hm    Okay I just want to make sure I understand that correctly.  Are you admitting that in the affidavit that you deposed to in support of your application for Leave to Cross -examine Mr Jonas you did not anywhere indicate that you did not anywhere in the affidavit indicate that ahead of the meeting you had told him that the purpose of the meeting you were seeking to have was to discuss the rumour.  That is – that is what you are saying?     Yes.   In the affidavit?    Okay good.    Before you proceed Mr Mokoena.  Let me go back to the earlier question.  So you say that in one or other conversation on the phone between yourself and Mr Jonas prior to the 23 r d October you had told him what the meeting was about.  It is just that you did not include that in the affidavit?     Okay.  And when you told him what was his attitude? I take it it might have been – it might or might not have been I do not know the first time that he heard about there being rumours that had reached your ears – maybe reached Mr Hlongwane’s ears.  What was his reaction?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well Mr – Mr Mokeona may have been intending to mention this but let me say.  In one of the statements that I think  Mr Jonas deposed to which is in one of the files he refers to a meeting or an occasion when he met with Mr Hlongwane in the presence of somebody called Mr Bongani More and as I understand it he says on that occasion Mr Hlongwane told him that you would li ke to talk to himand – and as I understand it it was on that occasion that he therefore asked for your number that is Mr Jonas.  I hope I am getting it right.  Is the position that he was the first one to make contact with you between the two of you to make contact with you in terms of either a phone call or a sms?    Between the two of you?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay alright.    Thank you.  You see the context of that question would be – I mean they were meeting that is Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas on that occasion.    Prior to the 23 r d.  If – and I think it was – it may have been October or September I cannot remember.  So if…     Really Hlongwane was concerned about rumours about something that Mr Jonas was said to be – I mean rumours that he was said to be spreading one would have thought that he would havetalked to him about them to try and resolve it  or told him what you wanted to talk to him about rather than say to him somebody that you have never met wants to talk to you about it.  But we have discussed the issue but I just put that angle for the sake of completeness.  But if there is something you want to say about it feel free to do so.     Yes okay thank you.    Yes.    Yes.   I am embarrassed.  Yes so it might be More.    Okay alright.    What page did you say?    Yes okay.    It may be – Mr – I am sorry Mr Mokoena.    It may be that we should – you should try and approach the end of the …    In relation to …     Mr Jonas.    Yes.    As far as you know did Mr Hlongwane know Mr Rajesh Gupta quite well?  I think earlier on there was reference to I think his affidavit that is Mr Hlongwane where he seems to have said he had visited the Gupta residence several times.  So as far you know did he know him quite well?    As far as you know he did not know him quite well at that time?    Yes.    Okay.  And the other Gupta brothers do you knowwhether he knew them quite well?     To that meeting?    Hm okay.    724 yes.    What page is it?    Oh I thought I was there.  In file A?     Well what I have there is not a statement.     Ja.  It is Public Protectors Report. I have seen th at statement that you are talking about but it is not here.  It is not on page 23.    23?    Oh okay no I am sorry I am – I think I am looking at the black numbers.   Rather than the white – the red numbers.    Mr Zuma were you also looking at the black numbers?     Well even the red one is no t the statement it is still the Public Protector…    Mr Zuma your page – your red …     Yes same.    Yes.    Yes I have seen the statement but certainly not on this page.      Ja I think somebody is sabotaging me and the witness.      Yes but I – I looked at that statement last night.     If you want to – if the witness has got it.    You can go ahead and put the question in the meantime.    Well I am sorry Mr Zuma maybe you do need Mr Mokoena to just read parts of this statement.     So that he understands the context ja.     Yes ja    I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr  Mokoena.  I know you are doing that because I said you should …    Approach …    by finishing on this issue.  The - the statement appears to be a media statement.  I think was a media statement …     And at the top it says   I think you can just read the - you know so that he understands the context.    So I - I think Mr Zuma what the context is that after Mr Jonas’ allegations had been published in the media that there had been a meeting at the Gupta residence at which you were present - according to his version - where he said he was offered the position of Minister of Finance and was offered I think R600 million.  After that had come out this media statement was then issued.    It says Oakbay and it says there was no meeting.  That is what the Gupta family is saying.  So that - that is in the context …    And what they were saying here is that as I understand it those who say there was a meeting must come forward with evidence.   Yes.  So I think Mr Mokoena is …    Is asking you whether you wish to comment on this statement?    And not necessarily that you might be able to comment on this but one would have expected that before Oakbay issued this statement on behalf of the Gupta family they would have checked with all the Gupta brothers to see whether anyone of them says - is aware of any meeting that took place and if anyone of them was aware then maybe they would have said there was a meeting butmaybe we were not involved in that meeting.  It involved other people.     No I am saying if Oakbay before issuing the statement on behalf of the Gupta family.     One would have expected that they would have checked with all the Gupta brothers whether they were aware of any such meeting you know and if they - if the information from anyone of the Gupta brothers was that I am aware that there was a meeting but Iwas not involved. Maybe the statement would say there was a meeting but none of the Gupta - there was a meeting at the Gupta residence but it involved so and so and so and so and not any Gupta brother.  You understand?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You were not part of …    Of that?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    And you were not party to its preparation?     Yes, okay.    Hm.    Please just repeat that (intervenes).     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Of - of course maybe this can be said.  As I read one of the affidavits deposed to by Mr  Ajay Gupta he says he was not approached to give his version himself but he initiated.     He said he wanted to give his version and as I read what he says in his affidavit it is - it is almost like he is saying I forced the Public Protector to actually give me - to interview me and - and then so that I could put my - my side of the story and he says what he was given was a superficial interview.  So I mention that to say of course maybe it could be sai d that even if you were not asked you - you could have said look Public Protector I want to say - to put my side of the story as well.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I will - I will - you might not understand why Mr Mokoena was putting that question to you but I think your lawyers will understand and I understand.  You see after the hearing of allevidence at a certain stage lawye rs will stand in front of me and say to me I must accept the evidence of certain witnesses.  I must reject the evidence of certain witnesses about things that have been testified upon about by various witnesses and where there maybe two or more who have different versions of what happened in regard to a particular matter.  One or more lawyers including members of the legal team they might say when that time comes Chairperson there is a problem with accepting Mr  Duduzane Zuma’s version and that is because of A, B, C, D and if they are going to say anything along those lines they need to give you an opportunity to comment on that. So when he says to you why do you think Mr  Jonas would tell an untruth about what happened.  He is actually trying to say if there i s something you know that could be motivate - could have motivated him to say you were party to a discussion or in - to a meeting where he wasmade this offer.  You could then say well I know why he would say that.  This is what would motivate him to say t hat.  So that - that is the idea.  It is not anything else.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Well - well that is - that is the Public Protector of course.    Yes, yes.    So - so we - we do not know.  We cannot provide that …   That answer.  We - we do not know but it may well be that even if the Public Protector who was responsible tha t who is no longer in office.  It may well be that if you ask your - ask your lawyers they might write to the current Public Protector who has access to the records that were there at the time and maybe she might be able to say I have looked I can see why he was not given a chance.  Okay.    Alright.    Okay, but I think connected with the question that Mr Mokoena put is - is this as I understand your evidence and  you must just tell me based on - on your affidavit.  The discussion at the meeting involving you, Mr Jonas and Mr Hlongwane was really restricted to the discussion of these rumours.  Is that correct?    Ja and as I understand your evidence most of the time you played the role of a spectator or mediator in that meeting.  Is that correct?    You do not say in your affidavit and you must tell me if I misunderstand this.  You do not say that you provided the background to the rumours.  Do you?  Is my understanding correct?     I - I understand correct and as I understand it you saythat at the end of that meeting the issue appeared to not have been settled as such but to you know there - there was some understanding.  If I put it in my own words between the parties but there - not that it was resolved completely.  Is that right?     Yes.    And my understanding of what you say in you - in your affidavit suggests that when the parties parted - when the meeting ended they - nobody was unhappy about anything.  Is that right?    Yes.    To - to a very large extent everybody appeared to be satisfied is that right?    Yes.  Now when I - when I see that picture emerging from your affidavit of how the meeting ended I look at the - at what Mr Jonas says.  On his version as you know the meeting involved a - a Gupta brother and the meeting ended as I see it badly - negatively on his version.  You understand?     Yes.  Negatively and then he says if I recall correctly on his way to the airport he made a call to Minister  Nene and I think he made also a call to Minister  Gordhan and - because he wanted to talkto them about what had happened at the meeting which had made him unhappy as I understand the position and he arranged to meet with Minister Gordhan on the Sunday. I do not know if the 23 r d was a Friday - 23 October was a Friday or not but he made an arrangement.  He was going to the Eastern Cape and he made an arrangement to meet with Minister Gordhan on - on Sunday and he made an arrangement with Minister Nene that they would meet on Sunday and he says they did meet - he did meet with Minister Gordhan on Sunday and mentioned what had happened or at least the - the essence. Minister Gordhan has given evidence here and has deposed to statements and he is - he confirms that he was phoned that same afternoon by - by Mr Jonas and that they met on Sunday and he confirms that Mr Jonas said he had been made this offer that he was talking about at the meeting and Minister  Gordhan says he could tellthat Minister - Mr Jonas was still kind of upset or unhappy and Minister Nene also confirms in his testimony and affidavit as I recall that he was called by Minister - by Mr Jonas that same afternoon. They arranged to meet on Sunday but on Sunday they moved that to Monday morning and they did meet on Monday morning at the office.  They went out to the balcony because they thought well maybe the offices might be bugged and that at that meeting Minister - Mr Jonas told him the fact - the essence of what had happened at the meeting on his version. So you get the picture of somebody who came out of themeeting.  Being - being unhappy, started phoning you know people - the Minister - Minister Gordhan and both - both of those people I think were - were connected with the Minister of Finance - Ministry of Finance at some stage or another and ultimately told the st ory and they both confirmed that that is - that is what happened. So - so that - that is something I am drawing to your attention.  You might not be able to say anything about it.  Maybe all you might say is as far as I am concerned when the meeting ended there was no animosity.  There was no unhappiness and - and that - I do not know what he is talking about.     That is what you are saying?     Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You do not know.  Yes.  Of course as far as your role is concerned he does say at the meeting you were quiet most of the time.  So that maybe he might have been unhappy about t he fact that you brought him to the - to this meeting on his version but he does not say you said anything at the meeting that - that made him unhappy, but also he does say that that evening he called Mr  Hlongwane as well and he says he expressed to Mr  Hlongwane I think he said he spoke two times that evening - afternoon and evening from the Eastern Cape.  He phoned him and he expressed his disgust at what his - he - he said Mr Hlongwane had done.  That - that is I thought I will just mention that there is that version.    On your version meeting ended very well.  There was no problem.  On his version the meeting ended in a very negative atmosphere and he was unhappy.  He started contacting other people and later on according to him he phoned Mr  Hlongwane and expressed his disgust. So you - you might again say there is nothing I can say.  All I know is that the meeting ended well.     Yes.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Then just one last question from my side and I - I do not know how far Mr  Mokoena still has questions for you.  He said that when you met at the Hyatt Hotel you made a remark to the - to the effect that I do not know whether he said you s aid you old man but basically your father liked him.  I did not see you - you denying that - that allegation in the affidavit.  Is that correct?     Yes.    Yes.    But …    But it is a remark that you made?     You did not make?   Okay, alright.    Thank you.    On - in relation to Mr Jonas I am proposing to restrict you to five minutes now.    To wrap up.  Is that right?  (Intervenes).     Of the lawyers.    I am sorry.  I think somebody has completely switched off the air conditioner.  It feels a little ho t.  Maybe it should be on but not too high.  So maybe somebody could do the - take care of that.  Thank you.    Yes Mr Mokoena.    Hm.    Yes, okay.    Yes.   Oh, okay.  Comfort break?     Oh, okay.  No that is fine.    10 minutes will be fine?     Three minutes.  Okay, alright.    Ja.  Just to be on the safe side.  Let us 10 minutes.  It is now 25 to one.  So we say we come back at quarter to one.     You said we are moving to something else now?      Yes.     No that’s fine I just mention one thing Mr Zuma and you might have no comment about it but I mention it because it is in mymind so it’s the transparency I was talking about earlier.  On Mr Jonas’ version at this meeting , if I recall correctly he gets told that Mr Nene is going to be removed as Minister of Finance.  Now I can’t remember whether he gets told that expressly or  it’s just implied because according, on his version, he is being offered the position of Minister  of Finance and if I recall correctly he says that the Gupta brother who was there told him – I hope I’m not misrepresenting what he said, told him that if he needed advisors he would be given advisor – they would give him advisors and that’s October 2015,  October 23, and about six or so weeks later 9 December Mr Nene gets removed as Minister of Finance and of course the person who gets appointed is Mr Des van Rooyen and in terms of the evidence that I’ve heard here he comes with two persons – advisors who are alleged to have links with the Gupta family.  So I’m just mentioning, you might not be able to say anything I’m just mentioning something that comes to my mind as I listen to theevidence.     Okay thank you.     That’s the Public Protector when you say PP?      Okay.     You see Mr Mokoena before the tea break I did have a file marked C but certain changes happened during the tea break and the file that was marked C no longer has C.    It’s supposed to remain marked C.     Okay.     Well Mr Zuma you might wish to just reconsider whether that’s the answer – whether that answer reflects what you intend saying I heard you earlier on saying you – I think I heard yousaying you did not attend any meeting involving Mr Dukwana, did I understand that correctly?      Yes now if he says you were present at that me eting – at this meeting and you say you were not present, then you would not know whether this meeting may have taken place but he is just mistaken about you having been present and if that meeting did take place, those things might have happened, you were  not there you don’t know.     Yes, yes so your position is that you were not present at such a meeting?      And are you definite about that or is there somedoubt?     You are definite about that?      Okay.     Well I don’t know if he put that way…[intervenes].      Ja Mr – General Booysen said when he gave evidence about Mr Duduzane he said he is very respectful, I think to adult people so he might have not have put it that way, that he’s lying but he has put his version, is that correct?      What of course Mr Mokoena, was not done, if I recall correctly when Mr Dukwana gave his e vidence is that his evidence thatMr Duduzane Zuma was present at that meeting may not have been tested because there was nothing to suggest that Mr Duduzane Zuma’s version would be different, that he did attend such a meeting.  So I’m just mentioning that maybe we don’t know what Mr Dukwana would say when he’s being told Mr Duduzane Zuma says he was not present there, are you sure he was there.  So I just mention, that’s my recollection.     He was clear.     Ja.     Yes before you do so again, Mr Zuma you might have no comment or anything to say about this but as I understand it Tony Gupta is Mr Rajesh Gupta, is that right?      Yes, that is the same person  that, on your evidence, peeped in at the meeting at the Gupta residence where you, Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas were having a meeting and wanted to check if you were available for a meeting the following day or something.      Yes, now there is a lot of issue as to – if Mr Jonas’ version is correct and an offer was made to him such as the one he has described at that meeting, who of the brothers made the offer and, atleast on your version and Mr Hlongwane’s  version the only Gupta brother that was around in the residence was Mr Rajesh Gupta.  Assuming that maybe he is the one that made the offer if an offer was made it would be – it’s interesting that, according to Mr Dukwana this is now another meeting and Mr Dukwana says, this same person, you know, offered him money in a briefcase.  When he was giving evidence here a briefcase was shown to indicate what type of briefcase he was talking about, lawyer’s briefcase that Mr Dukwana disassociates himself from and he said the bag – the briefcase was full of R200 notes, you know that was offered to him.  So there are just thosefeatures that happened, but again if you were not at the meeting and the version about your meeting at the Gupta residence with Mr Jonas was different, you might have nothing to do but it’s just interesting that there is this meeting happening and apparently Mr Rajesh Gupta is at the venue at both – on both occasions.     Yes thank you, Mr Mokoena.     Oh okay we’ll take the lunch adjournment now, the time is five past one, we will resume at five past two, we adjourn.   I think Mr Zuma the part that I did not include in the observation I was making about which I said you might not have much to say was that as I understand Mr Dukwana’s evi dence including what he said in his statement was also that at that meeting which he says you attended which you say you did not attend if I recall correctly.  He also says that when he said that the document that Mr Rajesh Gupta – Tony Gupta wanted him to  sign.  When he said that in effect that is amatter that should go to the head of department Mr Rajesh Gupta suggested to him that he should get rid of – of his head of department and the call was made and then Mr Richard – what is his surname again?  Mr Richard Seleke.    Ja Seleke – Mr Richard Seleke was brought in and in effect he – you said you know…    This is the person – ja at the meeting.    This is the person you should have as your head of department.  So I mentioned that this simply as part of that observation that you have a situation where on both occasions the venue is the Gupta residence.  On both  occasions Mr Rajesh Gupta is in the house.  On both occasions – on both occasions he at least on the version ofand not necessarily his because we do not know his version. On the version of a person visiting the house – the person visiting the house is being asked to do certain things and he is being offered money for that.  And both occasions it looks like there contemplation that somebody may have to leave a certain position and somebody else might – must take that position.  But I am just completing the  picture.  I think I understand what = what you have said.     Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes. Ja.    I am sorry Mr Zuma I did ask that the air conditionerbe put on but maybe not too high.  I think it is interfering.  I do not know if whether – whether if you raise your voice that is going to make a difference.    Just try and raise your voice.    I am sorry – I am sorry I missed that.  You have been accused of?    You mean what Mr Dukwana says?     Well – yes – well as I understand it he – he is not saying that you gave money to anybody Mr Dukwana?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja well look part of trying to establish what the truth is is exactly hearing both sides.  So what is happening here is part of trying to understand what the truth is.  Up to today certainly I did not know whether your version is that you adm it that you were present atthat meeting or not.  So now I know that your version is that you were not at that meeting.  So this is not the end of the matter there will be more witnesses who will be called.  And the investigation – investigators do what th ey can but the people implicated also they are expected to come forward and say – I know that the commission has been told this and that about me.  In this case I take it that you were furnished with Mr Dukwana’s affidavit.  So they are expected if they do  not agree with what has been said about them they are expected to come forward to the commission to say I want the record to be put straight.  Here is my own statement, here is my affidavit, I deny this. This – I was not at that meeting.  And indeed if y ou have been given somebody’s statements who says something about you or implicates you in anything you would have been given that together with a notice from the commission that advises you of your rights.  And part of the – of those – some of those rights are that you can apply to commission to give evidence yourself and refute what is being said about you or against you and so on and so on.  You can apply for Leave to Cross -examine.  Some people do not apply for Leave to Cross -examine but they send an affidavit saying this is my version.  You know.      So – so 1. This is part of the commission trying to establish the truth and you have now told us what your side of the story is in regard to that.  And that is not the end.  The commission would look at things but you are not expected to sit back and do nothing if it issomething that you feel strongly about.  Indeed if you do nothing about it in circumstances where you are aware that somebody has given evidence or has given t he commission a statement that implicates you if you do nothing about it you might be expected not to complain if the commission at a certain stage takes it that you had no version to put forward.  You had no problem with what was being said about you.  Yo u understand that?    Ja.  Ja.    Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Mokoena you may proceed.    Maybe I should say Mr Mokoena I – I have not put any time limit in regard to questions relating to the other witnesses simply because on my recollection nobody has applied to cross -examine and so on for Leave to Cross -examine or rather he has not applied to – for Leave to Cross -examine them unlike with regard to Mr  Jonas.    But obviously that does not mean you have all the time no, I will be keeping an eye on how much time you spend on each. So I just thought maybe I should just explain that.  So let us do what we can to ensure that the issues are – justice is done to the issues but at the same time we do not necessarily take too long.  Okay.  I am not expecting you to take too long but I wanted to explain that why I have not said anything about time frames with regard to th e other witnesses.    So you can proceed where I think maybe we have taken too long I will mention on any particular witness.     Well is the part that you say is not accurate the last sentence that says you were particularly – he was particularly close to you or is it..    Or is it everything in that paragraph?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is what you are responding to?     Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Maybe let me just with regard to that last one.  You know it says he was particularly close to you.  If we take out particularly and say he was close to you, is that fine, is that accurate?     So he was not close to you?     Okay alright.   Okay alright.    Thank you.    I am sorry it is another page?     Page 6?    56 okay.    Thank you.  Yes.   What page?    Yes.   Well before you go to Mr  Booysen.  Mr Zuma you have read Mr Sundaram’s affidavit.  Is that correct?     You have read it?    Yes.  Would you agree with me that in that affidavit if what he is saying is true then the former President was being briefed in very great detail about a number of many matters relating to ANN7?  Would you agree or would you not agree with that - if what he is saying is true?    Whether - if you read what he is saying you would take the view that the former President was very involved in matters relating to ANN7?   It (intervenes).    Yes.    Hm.    Not speculation.  It is - it is simply when you look at what Mr Sundaram says …     They were doing.  The meetings they were having  with the former President.  The issues that he says they were being discussed and it may be that the former President when he gets achance he will say there is nothing like that.  There are no - no such meetings happened - that happened or there were som e meetings but I was not involved in the kinds of details that this person is talking about. So it maybe that that is what I will be told but I am simply saying if what he says is true it seems to me that the former President - for President’s role or involvement in N7 - ANN7 was not superficial.  It is quite - it was quite - he was quire involved in it.  So I am inviting you to say whether if all of that was true you would share the same view or would you say no when I look at what he is saying I would not  say theformer President was very involved.  I would say since his involvement was superficial.    Yes.  No I want - I want a view, ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    So - so - but you say as far as you know that - what he says is not true?    Oh, okay.    Yes, okay.  Alright.    Alright.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  The reason why I am simply raising that is that in part - somewhere in his affidavit Mr Sundaram seems to - well he certainly says that the former President was much more involved with ANN7 issues than you were.  Despite the fact that you had shareholding in AAN7.  You - you did - you remember that part of his …     Yes, sir.  Your - your own involvement in ANN7 are you - I - I think out of the four meetings you did say there is only onethat you attended.    That he talks about.    Ja.  On the face of it without you putting your input in regard to that that - that seems to go along with what he is saying.  Here is a situation where the  former President and ANN7 people have four meetings with him.  He is not a shareholder but here is the shareholder - 30 percent shareholder. Out of those four meetings only one that he attends but ofcourse there may be other meetings that you were involv ed in that Mr Sundaram does not talk - talk about but I just wanted to - to mention that and just hear whether you have something to say about your - your own level of involvement on - in ANN7 issues.    Hm.    Okay.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.   Yes.  No, no.  I - I think what you have said is important but let me just make sure I understand it.  With special reference to my question you seem to be saying I am not denying that I was not very involved in ANN7 but there was a reason for it.  I decided to pull back but also there were a number of o ther companies in which I was involved.  Is that right?     Is my understanding of what you are saying correct?     Yes.  Ja.  That is what I am talking about.     Yes, yes.  No.  That - that is important because it is -we want to hear all perspectives because without all the perspective s things might seem to be looking in a certain direction but when has all the perspectives it is important because what you are saying is I deliberately try to limit my - my role for - for the reasons that you have given.    Okay, thank you.    Hm.    I am sorry Mr Mokoena.  I missed - I missed the - the question to which Mr  Zuma answered it is not correct.  I believe the first question.    Yes.    Oh.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    I am sorry.  Before that do you have any recollection whether maybe when the mutual friend laid the complaint or asked for the matter to be investigated?  You accompanied him and the - and that maybe that is how General Booysen might have thought both of you were complainants in that matter?    Youi did not (intervenes)?     Yes.    And you - you know of no reason why he would think you were the complainant in that matter?     Ja.   Yes, okay.    Well it …    Ja.  It is - it is somebody who together with somebody else lays a complaint.   Ja.  (Intervenes).    Sorry.    There ought - there - there ought to have been at the time.  I do not know now, but there ought to have been documents.     Hm.    Yes.    I think - I think maybe - maybe I could say that probably for the Commission’s purposes it - it is neither here nor there whether you were a co complainant or not.  I think what is important is you - you had met with him …    On a number of occasions.    Prior to this.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    But - but you see the - the issue in which he says you were a co - a co complainant might not be the type of issue that the Commission is really looking - it might not be the type of issue that the Commission is busy with you know in terms of what it has to investigate.  That is what I am saying.     Yes, yes.    Well you say there is.  At the time that he is talking about …    Oh.  At that time there was a white not a black one.     Okay.  He - he just got - he might have just got the colour wrong.    Okay, alright.   I guess crime scene in inverted commas Mr …     Mr Mokoena?    Because certainly in regard to this meeting theredoes not seem to be a suggestion of any …     Any impropriety or any criminal activity.     Hm.    I am sorry to interrupt you.    So he too knew that the plan was to go to the Guptaresidence?    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, was for going there?    Yes, yes.  I interrupted you while you were continuing.    You may continue.    You know when General Booysen was givin g evidencehere I think I asked him a question about the purpose of the trip to the Gupta residence, because it did not seem to me that it was clear what the purpose was, if you look at what he said happened once he was there, but you say that there was a purpose, is that right?     Yes, yes, go ahead.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   So am I right in understanding you to be saying that in previous discussions or discussion in a previous discussion he hadexpressed an interest in meeting the Gupta brothers, or a particular Gupta brother socially?     Ja, yes, he had expressed that interest.     Yes, and unlike – is it Mr Hower that we dealt with a while ago, in respect of whom you say you are  not close to him.     Oh Mr Chauke.   General Booysen are you able to say as at that time you felt that the two of you were close, had a close relationship or not?    Yes but ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.       Well I can tell you that when he gave evidence here he said he found you to be very respectful and so on and – so that part I can say.   So you took him to the Gupta residence because he had expressed an interest in meeting the Gupta family.       Yes, you see the reason why I am putting these questions is that I want to make sure that I do not misre present what you are saying.      Before you gave the answer that you have just given now the impression that I was getting was that you were saying that it was at his instance that you took him to the Gupta reside nce because he had expressed an interest in meeting the Gupta family, or one or  more of them, so that is what I was checking.        Would it be correct to put it that way?        Yes, he seemed to have a lot of questions ...[intervenes]         Yes, I can take you there.        Yes, okay.       Yes, so it may or may not be at his instance but that is the context in which  ...[intervenes]        He had questions that he was asking about them to you.      Yes, and then from your discussion with him it was – you all agreed that when there is an opportunity you could take him there.       Okay, no thank you.        Did you – is your understanding that he came all the way from Kwa Zulu Natal for the purpose of that trip to the Gupta residence or is the position that he was in Gauteng and there was an opportunity to meet ...[intervenes]     ...and to go there and that is what was happening.     Yes, yes.       Yes, okay.       Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    I am sorry before you do that just maybe to complete maybe what I am saying might be kind of observation, some things that one is noting.  On this occasion there is somebody that you are taking to the Gupta residence, that person – the person that that person meets at the Gupta residence is Mr Rajesh Gupta, Tony Gupta, so t hose are the two aspects, the third one is the one that Mr Mokoena mentioned that what we have is on the two trips, on the two visits to the Gupta residence, one involving Mr Jonas, the other one General Booysen,both of them say they were not aware that t hey were being taken to the Gupta residence, but you have said actually each one of them knew quite well that the trip was going there.  In the case of Mr Jonas that was decided after everybody, after you had met at the Hyatt Hotel in regard to General Booysen you say that – there must be a trip to the Gupta residence, it had been discussed and decided even before you met at the Gautrain station?     Sorry?    Yes.    Well I was about to check that because I seem to have heard somewhere that out of the Gupta brothers he was the one that was quite close to you.    And in regard to him we can say he was particularly close to you?    Yes.    Okay.    Who are you talking about now?        Okay, alright.    For the – I am sorry Mr Mokoena, for the sake of the public and those watching do you want to repeat what they say?     Well when you say you are not sure what he is talking about are you saying you have no recollection of what he says you said to him and he said to you on that occasion, are you saying you are denying that you said to him what he says you said to him, and so on orwhat is the position?       Yes?    But do you admit having met with him on that occasion?    I think he says first you made calls but ultimately the two of you met at St George’s Hotel.    You say there was no such meeting?     And are you sure about that, because it might have been quite a few years back, it is important for you to reflect in case maybe it is true, you have forgotten or are you quite sure that it never happened, that meeting never happened?     Yes, is it possible that the meeting and the discussion did happen but he might have got the venue wrong when he says St George’s Hotel, maybe it happened elsewhere?     Mmm, well I do not know whether you would call this, the meeting that he is talking about, a formal meeting, but in other words you say that you have not at any stage in the past ever accused him or complained to him that you heard that he was bad -mouthing you or your companies and so on, you have never had any discussion along those lines with him?     Mmm.    Yes okay.    Yes.    I am sorry, the paragraphs that you said you don’t know what he is talking about did they inc lude paragraph 11, I’m sorry?       They did?    Oh, okay, okay, thank you.    Before we go to number seven going back to what Mr Ramatlhodi said Mr Zuma ...[intervenes]        Going back to folder five and I am looking particularly at paragraph 11, so I am bearing in mind that you say the re was no such discussion – the discussion he is talking about never happened between the two of you, I bear that in mind, but if one looks at what he says, if that discussion did take place it seems that one of the things – one of the things you wanted to  do in paragraph 11 was to meet – to get two people, that is himself and Mr Ajay Gupta to meet but to discuss maybe rumours of bad-mouthing and so on and I go back to Mr Jonas, you have Mr Hlongwana, you get to know that there are rumours that Mr Jonas is blackmailing, was blackmailing Mr Hlongwana and then you want to bring them together to resolve that, it seems that Mr Ramatlhodi if what he is saying is true is coming up with a situation where you have become aware of rumours of him bad -mouthing your companies and I guess Mr Ajay Gupta as well and you want to get them to meet to discuss the matter, is that right, you understand that?    If his version is correct.    But you say it is not correct.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Yes, yes, okay, thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That should not be a problem, so in other words you want to check before you give any answer in regard to each of  the companies, because there are too many of them.     Ja, yes.    Okay, that should not be a problem.     Yes, there are two w ays in which this can be done,one obvious one is for you to submit an affidavit in which you explain what the position was.       I did not apply my mind to your question Mr Mokoena whether you were talking about now o r you were talking about at a particular time, so when he looks he needs to be able to say in this one I have been a shareholder or director from that time up to now, so is there a timeframe that he ...[intervenes]     Ja, ja.    Ja, that can be done and do you thin k you would need more than seven days to ...[intervenes]     Ja, so let’s say today is Monday if at all possible if that affidavit could be delivered to the Commission not later than Monday next week.    Ja, okay, alright.   You are done?     Okay.  Before I release or allow your counsel to say something I just want to ask one or two questions g oing back to Mr Jonas and the meeting in the Gupta residence.  Mr Jonas said thatamong other things he said that the Gupta brother who was in the meeting told him that I think told him that they would make him rich or he would be rich or something to that  effect and said that – said something along the lines that you had become a billionaire or they had made you a billionaire, I am not checking now the exact wording, and that you – I think he said they said to him you had been able to buy a house in Dubai at that time.  Now of course the question that immediately arises would be in case those things are factually correct how would Mr Jonas know them or were they publicly, were they information that was publicly available, so I just want to raise thatbecause it is in my mind as well.  I don’t know if you are able to say anything?       Yes so ...[intervenes]     Yes.    But part of my question would be whether leaving outwhat the position is now of what is publicly available whether at that time that was publicly ...[intervenes]     You are not sure.    Okay, okay, thank you.   Thank you.  I think counsel wants to say something?     Okay.    Yes that is alright, I wanted to say to you earlier on you asked for a comfort break but I wanted to say the Chairperson needs to be au fait with all the terminology because sometimes it is comfort break, sometimes it is an opportunity to wash hands.  Okay we are at twenty to four.  We were goin g to, we normally stop at four but sometimes when it is necessary we go beyond that.  We do have some witnesses tomorrow but they are short so depending on how much time you need I just want to mention that subject to everybody being agreeable there is an opportunity of finishing tomorrow morning.     Well I can say that certainly my contemplation was that we should be able to finish with him in one day but that should we not finish we would continue the following day before other witnesses, but as things stand you know Mr Mokoena has no furt her questions, if we – there is room for us to try and finish, there is room for us subject to what Mr Hellens might have to say there is room for us to finish tomorrow morning.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes, I don’t have problem with that, if he has no problem with that, yes.Okay then is that fine with you, would that be fine with you?     That will be fine, okay, so I think we must then take the comfort break and then come back and then Mr Hellens will then have a chance to re-examine and then when we finish then maybe wecan adjourn to tomorrow morning.    We are nearly at quarter four, let us just adjourn until four o’clock, is that alright?   Okay, we adjourn.     Yes.  Mr Hellens you may proceed.    I think Mr Hellens if I am not mistaken to be fair to General Booysen he does say that the two of them had severalmeetings.  So - so the extent that what you have said to the witness might suggest that his version is that there might not have been much interaction between them before that.  I am just saying my understanding of his affidavit is that he does say before that there had been quite some interactio n between the two of them.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Thank you Mr Hellens.  I - I see Mr Hellens that you kept to your 10 to 12 minutes that was - that is to be commended.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   No that.  Well one, adjou rning is fine but we - we might not need to start at - at 9 o’ clock.  We might be fine with starting at 10 o’ clock because the other witnesses that are scheduled for tomorrow will be very short.    So …    Yes.  No, no I understand.  No.  I - I understand.   Yes.  So we will start at 10 o’ clock.  We - oh I am sorry.  Mr Zuma.    You want to say something?     Yes.    Ja.    A glaring omission.    Oh who has not been mentioned here?  Who has not been include here?    Yes.    I think - I think what may have been intended - maybe we should - we should adjourn.  Your counsel hears what you are saying and I think they have started talking to Mr  Mokoena.   They will discuss and tomor row morning I will be told what happened to your concern.    It is possible that it was thought that you might be asked to come back at another time but Mr  Mokoena will - will deal with the …    The concern and then tomorrow morning I will be told.     So we - we are going to adjourn or before we - we adjourn.  Okay.  Maybe we can deal with this tomorrow.  We will adjourn and then tomorrow we will start at 10 o’ clock.  We adjourn.

Fundamentally Mr Chair Mr Zuma was also informed that today he will be expected to answer questions in relation to six witnesses that testified before this commission and their e vidence was previously led through different members of the legal team.  For completeness Chair those witnesses are the evidence Mr Jonas, Mr Dukwana, Advocate Ramatlhodi, Advocate Muofhe, Mr Booysen and Mr Sundaram.  And that correspondence was duly ackno wledged and received by Mr Duduzane Zuma’s legal team.  Mr Duduzane Zuma is here today.  He has available himself to come and answer those questions.  He is being represented by different legal teams depending as to on which matter one it is referring to ma y I allow them an opportunity to place themselves on record Chair?     Mr Chair surely this proceedings will beconducted in terms – within the ambit of the Rules of the Commission and I think the one that is also paramount would be Rule 3.2 whereby questions should be posed in order to assess and in order to get to the truthful of the evidence of any witness that appears before the commission.      For the purpose of this se ssion Mr Chair we will be referring to a number of documents. Before you Chair there must be three arch lever files.  You will see Chair that at the spine of the two files you will find that the one it is marked as A and the one itis marked as B.  Those are the documents which were referred and relied upon when Mr Jonas was led.      Yes. And you will see that there is …     That is A and B.    That really relates to Mr Jonas and for ease of reference.    We propose that that A and B.    Be referred to as Exhibit LL1.  You will see when you open – when you open a folder of the first thick file Chair there must be a divider that already has marked it Exhibit LL1.  But forease of reference you can also refer to them because they are marked at the spine as A and B simply for you to be able to locate it with much more ease.      It might not because when you now deal with different witnesses we have now created a separate f older for each.  Even though the numbering might be – might be continuous but for convenience it becomes much more easy if you know that LL1 it is for document in respect of Mr Dukwana.  LL2 is the second witness,LL3 is the following witness’.  If you go to the document Chair…    That is A.  Yes.    Yes.    It should be …    Yes.    Definitely Chair.    That is one – that is one had hoped that has happened but Chair we will deal with that file.  But for the purposes of the questioning in this regard you will see that the first file goes from page 1 and the numbering that we are relying on because these documents were used from time to time they might be having different numberings but.    We are going to restrict ourselves to the red numbering.    That you will find on the left hand side.     And then if you go to the first file it must be going from page 1 and it ends up at page 334.     I am under A Chair.    Ja we can mark the two files A and B.     As LL1.    Yes.   A.    And LL1B.  Yes it makes sense.    No that – the third file is the one that now have Exhibit – the LL2 up until LL7.    So for now let us mark as the Chair hasproposed. The first file.    As LL1A and the next file dealing with the matters relevant to Mr Jonas as LL1B. An the third file is the small file Chair.      Yes.    Yes in fact while I am still addressing the Chair someone can simply do that while I am still addressing the Chair.    Not even in tea time.   Because it is going to be easy for now for reference.    And the third file Chair you will see the one that was only marked C on the spine we can then refer to it as because it is having – it is having LL2 up until LL7 we mark it on the spine to be LL2 to LL7.  No the Exhibits.     Yes.    Yes.    Now that file Chair the one it is LL2C you will see if you open it it is divided into sub -folders.  Folder number 2 it is all the documents that you are referred to when Mr Mxolisi Dukwana was led and folder number 3 relates to all the documents which were relied upon and referred to when Mr Sundaram was led.  And folder number 4 relates to the documents which were referred to when Mr Booysens was led.  Folder number 5 relates to all the documents which were referred to when Mr – when Advocate Ramatlohodi was led.  And folder number 6 – folder number 7 Chair relates to only two documents.  The first document it is a documentdepicting the directorship of Mr Duduzane Zuma in various entities and the second document relates to – depicts the shareholding which was held by Mabengela Investment which is an entity that was owned by Mr Duduzane Zuma.  And two last documents Chair for ease of reference we have also produced the A3 size documents.  I am not sure if they found themselves in file because they are far mu ch more legible.    The diagrams.  Those are the ones that you are referring to.   Those will be the documents Chair  that we will be referring to from time to time.      And Chair we are ready to proceed.  May the witness be sworn in?     Thank you Chair.    Mr Zuma I have a very limited time to canvass a number of issues with you.  What will assist the process in order to short circuit your evidence is if we can agree on the common cause issues?  Common cause issues are those which after having read all the documents it does not appear as if there is any dispute around them.  Do you understand?     Yes.  The first one is that a meeting did take place on the 23 r d October 2015, correct?    Yes.  You are the one who arranged the meeting?   Yes.      The meeting…     Yes.  The meeting did take place at the Gupta residence, correct?    Yes.  And you are the one who suggested the Gupta residence as the venue?     Yes. And you are the one who also drove Mr Jonas from the Hyatt Hotel to the Gupta residence?     Yes.  At the time you know if you can just clarify for me – at the time when this meeting took place on the 23 r d October 2015 would I be correct that you were already conducting business with the Gupta’s?     Yes.    Okay.  And also at the time when thismeeting was arranged I mean it is common cause that your father was still the President at the time, am I corr ect?    Okay.  Now the common cause issue is that when this meeting was arranged Mr Jonas was the Deputy Minister for Finance, am I correct?     And Mr Nene was the Minister of Finance?    And on the 9 t h December if my memory serves me well I think on the 9 t h December 2015 two months after your meeting Mr Nene was then dismissed from  his position, am I correct?     Okay.  Now when you arranged this meeting with Mr Jonas you were not friends, am I correct?     With Mr Jonas?    You did not conduct any business with him?    Yes.  You did not even sit in the structures within the ANC, am I correct?     Now having dealt with those common cause issues I just want to now move to another topic which is the Gupta residence as the chosen venue for the meeting, correct?     You have made or delivered an application in this commission and you have deposed to an affidavit in support of your Rule 3.4 application, do you recall?     Yes.  Now I want to refer you to a bundle and for ease of reference you can look at the spine is the one that wehave referred to as LL1B.  And if you may turn to page 735 concentrate on the red numbering so that you are not confused Mr Zuma.     Page 735 Chair.    You will see that on page 735 this is the statement which you have provided to this commission is support of your application in terms of Rule 3.4 where you applying to participate in these proceedings and also to cross -examine Mr Jonas.  But if you may refer to page 737 Chair.  On page 737 paragraph 7 you told the Chair through your statement that…     737 Chair with particular reference to paragraph number 7.      Are you there Mr Zuma?    And then in that paragraph you s tated    So you would agree with me that at least from having read that paragraph there is no ambiguity pertaining to the agreement as far as it related to the venue.  Am - am I correct?    And when you agreed at least on your version with Mr Jonas to meet at the Hyatt you did not raise anyconcerns that the Hyatt Hotel is not private enough.  Am I correct - to discuss the rumour?    Yes; and I - I just want you know I mean from your own independent recollection and knowing the Hyatt Hotel would I be correct that if there was a need to secure a private venue at the Hyatt Hotel that could hav e been easily arranged.  Am I correct?     Yes.  So in other words there could not have been any need to do - to go to the Gupta residence while theHyatt Hotel could have offered another private  venue?    Okay.  You - it was you and Mr Jonas - and Mr Hlongwane who decided on the change of the venue.  The change of the venue had nothing to do with Mr  Jonas.  Am I correct?    Yes.  Mr Jonas has agreed with you - I am simply you know trying to clarify and - and following the sequence of events.  Remember that you and Mr  Jonas have agreed to meet at the Hyatt Hotel.    No issues of privacy were raised with Mr Jonas?    Yes.  It is only when he arrived when he is being told that a private venue is being sought.  Am I correct?     When you arrived at the Hyatt, yes.     That is the only point.  Am I correct?    Yes.  Now I take it that at the time yourself, Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas were members of the ANC.  You were comrades.  Am I correct?    Yes.    And in fact was there any reason why the three comrades could not have actually suggested to meet at Luthuli House to discuss the rumour?     Yes.    But I am saying that at least the three of you were comrades …    Who belonged to that organisation. There is this rumour that appeared to be troubling either you or Mr Hlongwane and I am - I am posing this question in the light of Mr Hlongwane - what Mr Hlongwane has said.    Maybe let me refer you to the same file - the same number file number B.    If you may turn to page 5-1-7 and you will understand why I am posing  that question.  Why you have chosen the Gupta residence and Luthuli House.    Page - same file Chair.  We are in the same file.  Page 5-1-7.    Now if you were to go to lines number 19 and 20 - by the way simply to orientate you.  This is the transcript Mr Zuma which recorded the interview between Mr  Hlongwane and the Public Protector and the date of that was on 11  October 2016 and during his interview if you go to lines 19 and 20 that is what - he said the following to the Public Protector.  “The meeting was essentially a meeting between us as comrades - ANC comrades - to address the issue that was disturbing to me.  Duduzane knows the people in that space.  I do not.”  So that is the basis of the question as to instead of havingchosen you know the Gupta residence would this not have made sense in line with what Mr Hlongwane has said that this the meeting between the comrades you know and to choos e?    Does not make any sense to you?     Alright.  At the - and at the time also when this meeting was arranged would I be correct that you were either a shareholder, a member or a director in various companies?  I do not have to go to their names for now.  I am just saying that as at23 October 2015.  Am I correct?    They also have offices and boardrooms.  Am I correct?    It did - it did not make sense to you also to arrange the meeting there rather than the Gupta residence?     Yes.    Alright.    Now when you talk to proximity duringthat time am I not correct to say that you in fact owned a property in Saxonwold and to be more specific you owned a property at number 18 Griswold Street in Saxonwold and on my little research it is 600 metres  from the Gupta residence and it is almost seven minutes’ walk from the Gupta residence. Why was that not the logical private place to meet and why choosing the Gupta residence?     Ja.    I was addressing you know your last statement when you talk about proximity.     When I said Luthuli House could have been a logical place to go.  You said that well because you were at the Hyatt Hotel in Rosebank it made sense for you to go to the Gupta house …    And yet you had another house …     And according to you was it not privateenough - your house?    Oh, but was - but was the reason not - the logical reason why the Gupta residence became appealing and the logical venue you know to hold this meeting was it - was it not because there could have been one of the brothers of the Gupta to be part and parcel of the meeting?    Okay.   I mean just piggybacking on what the Chair you know was trying to inqu ire from you.  We know as a matter of fact also that during that time you were a member if not a shareholder of Mabengela Investment.  Am I correct?     And I am sure that you have conducted a number of meetings in that Mabengela’s Offices?     Was it also not another option to hold this meeting among the friends and you know deal with it in a private atmosphere of your own company?     Yes.    You and Mr Jonas there is no ambiguity?     You have agreed.    Yes.    I see.  Now may I refer you to file - the very same file if you can go to page 5-0-7?  Just to close up you know the point that I was making in relation to your residence and let us see what Mr Hlongwane told the PP on page 5 -0-7.  If you go to line number    Okay.  You will see Mr Hlongwane also proceeds on the very same page.  If you go - if you can go to line number - line number 25 and up until page 5-0-8 line 15.  He said …    Page, page 5-0-7.    Alright.  Go to the last line of the page.     Because it was convenient for one of the Gupta brothers.   What I am saying to you is that the meeting was planned and agreed upon you …     With Mr Jonas to meet at the Hyatt Hotel?    And for reasons which you tried to explain the meeting was moved to the Gup ta residence?    And I am saying that it was moved to the Gupta residence not to your house, not to the private venue in Hyatt Hotel, not to any of your offices where there might have been pri vate facilities.  Simply to accommodate that the must be a Gupta brother present in the meeting.    Okay.  Now I want to share with you but I know that you might have read it also.  The version  of Mr Jonas you know pertaining to how he arrived at the Gupta residence.  If you can close File B and go to File number A.  Give you go to File number A sticking with the numbering on page - oh, the red numbering. Page 6 Chair is the relevant page and Mr  Zuma if you canread paragraph 15 into the record.     Page 6.  We are now on File number A.  LL1A.    And if you go to paragraph 1-5 and simply to - it is easy to understand what you would be reading.  If you go to page 1 of that document - page 3 of that document you will see is the statement of Mr Jonas which is submitted before this Commission atthe time when he adduced his evidence and if you may turn to paragraph 15 now page 6 and if you can read simply paragraph 15.     Read it.    Yes.    Yes.  He is accurate.  Do - do you agree with him that this is what happened?     Well identify to the Chair which ones are you in agreement with and which ones are you not in agreement with.     Yes.  Well he was here as well.  He - he did testify not only in evidence in chief but he - I mean he was consistent in as far as that version is concerned even under cross as  to the fact that when the venue was changed and when he - you decided to drive with - drive him to the Gupta residence he was not told that he was actually heading to the Gupta residence.     Yes, because he said that if you look at the preceding paragraphs he - he said that he thought that you were going to take him to go and meet other people.  He did not ask about the venue.  You took  him to the Gupta residence.    Yes.    A phone call came in and that is when the change of venue happened.  That discussion was had between myself and I call him “Uncle  Fana” Mr Hlongwane and I passed thephone over to Mr Jonas.    I will shortly take you to Mr Hlongwane’sevidence but if - let us - let us - while you are still on that same page simply to contextualise you know the evidence of Mr  Jonas and I am giving you this opportunity to react to it you know.  It is paragraph 14.     Yes.  Now the next topic that I need to address with you Mr Zuma is you know why - why you, you know.  Why were you the one chosen to facilitate this meeting to discuss you knowthe rumour and that is the theme that I want to interrogate with you.  Maybe let us start that by going to File B - File number B.  LL1B.  If you go to page 6-1-3.    L - yes.  LL1B Chair.    Page 6-1-3.    Now you will see that is the affidavit of Mr Hlongwane the person whom you refer to as the uncle which was submitted in support of his Rule 3.4 application to cross -examine Mr Jonas and to participate in this Commission’s proceedings.  The relevant page that I want to take you through is page 6 -1-8.  6-1-8 Chair.    Paragraph nine - paragraphs nine and    “The detail of such business relationship is …”   “We …” Sorry.    Yes. “We in fact - we in fact …” Thanks Chair. “We in fact tried to negotiate a number of transactions in the past.  The detail of such business relationship it is not relevant to the issues at hand and I will therefore not burden this statement with further details relating to this aspect.  The objective facts are that we knew each other well in October  2015.” Now that is what Mr Jonas (sic) at least informed the Chairthrough the 3.4 affidavit.  What is quite cle ar from paragraphs nine andis that him and Mr  Jonas were friends they knew each other from long time ago.  Am I correct?     Yes.  Now what simply escapes one’s mind and I am - I am sure you are here to explain is that why would the two friends that knew each other from this long time decide that you must be the one who arranges a meeting simply to discuss a rumour.     No, no.  Why he …     Was chosen.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    And - and that is exactly you know what I am trying to understand.   Me and you have agreed that you were not friends with Mr Jonas.  Correct?    You did not interact with him on any social level?    Yes.    You also do not ev en have his cellphone number?   Yes.  Yet you become the person that must facilitate this meeting.    Yes.  Why - do you know why was it difficult?  I mean at the time they were still friends Mr  Jonas and Mr Hlongwane.    Why could one friend not call the other and say …   And say that there is this rumour which you know it is disturbing.  Can we meet you know to deal with this rumour?    Why you become the third person to be the one to facilitate a meeting simply to discus s the rumour?     Yes but there’s nothing that is stopping one friend…[intervenes].    Maybe to help me understand, as you have attempted to make the Chair understand, if I may refer you to page 737 of the same bundle …[intervenes].     Ja and this rumour, since it was troubling Mr Jonas so much and I think you also were troubled with it to the extent that you know, there was this meeting that you had to facilitate, did you approach any of the other senior ANC members, you know, to tell them about this rumour amongst these comrades?      Mr Chair is this the appropriate time to take the tea adjournment.    That was deposed to in support of the 3.4 you know application.  I did not seem to recall seeing that during that exchange of calls, sms’, you told him that the reason for the meeting it is simply to discuss the rumour.     Yes.    Yes.  And I am posing this question because he seems to say to the PP – the Public Protector but he hadmet Rajesh before.  He knows him and he is definitely sure that the person that came in was Mr Rajesh.  And on the one hand you are saying that well it was Rajesh.  And I am simply putting that so that you know one must at least know what really transpired on the day and who was present on the day.  And both of you are certain about what you are saying.  But now both versions unfortunately cannot be r econciled.      Okay.    Yes.  Now may I refer you to file A.  File A if you may turn to page – if I am correct – page 23.  Now beforeputting you know clarifying questions with that document would I be correct that you were either directly or indirectl y you know part and parcel of the Oakbay investment either through other entities or in your personal capacity?    Chair it is a document immediately after Mr Jonas’ statement – witness statement.  It follows immediately on file A.     (Intervenes).   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And - and the second portion that I was    Yes.    Ja.  The question is not what w as discussed or who was present.  The question simply is that you know they - you are saying and you have told the Chair that well the meeting did happen.  They …     Yes and they are saying  that the meeting did not happen.  We are trying to simply and you were at - at that point part and parcel of Oakbay Investments.  Am I correct?    Yes and this statement was made on behalf of Oakbay.    By Oakbay.    Yes.  Now which is the correct version.     Was there a meeting or was there not a meeting?  Who was …?   I see.    Okay.    I am trying to jump a number of things that I would have actually wished to convey with you - to - to canvas with you.  Mr Jonas informed the Chair about the events you know post the meeting of 23 October 2015.  He went at length you know informing the Chair how he arranged the meetings to meet with Mr  Nene in order to tell him about what happened. I mean in his version is that - he said that there were offers that were made to him - monetary offers and - and a Ministerial position.  He also contacted Mr  Gordhan.  He contacted the ANC General Secretary at the time.  He went to Luthuli House and informed Mr Zizi Godo. He informed the ANC Treasury General about the events of 23 October 2015 and what you know I simply d o - do not understand from all these things if these offers did not happen why would he go to such an extent and the length of you know informing people in thoseimportant positions about what he said happened on the day.  Do you know why - why would he fabricate these lies against you?    You do not know?    Yes.    His answer was that there were offers that were made on 23 October …    2015 which were disgusting to him and which were made by people who did not - were not - not even supposed to make those offers and he was also made offers of money - 600 million.  If he accepts the offer of Ministerial position 600  000 on the spot and that is the reason after the meeting he took su ch an effort to tell those other individuals. Now that is - that is why and your version is that he - he is lying.  Those things did not happen.  My question is that why would he go to such extent to fabricate such lies against you.  Do you have any reason why he would - he would lie about you?    Yes.        Yes.  If you may turn to File number A.  I am not sure which file you are having with you.  Page 11.     11 - 1-1.    Yes Chair.    Is it the five minutes of Judges or of the lawyers.   Page 11 paragraph 31.  It simply to contextualise the question that I was going to put but the Chair has already done that.  It is not as cool as you say Mr  Zuma because to Mr Jonas the meeting did not end as cool as you say - suggest.  He    Yes.  Now the other point that I wanted to clarify with you.  I mean you were saying that you were  not - not given an opportunity by the Public Protector to place your version youknow to her and you know that maybe you were treated unfairly.  One would not be able to comment on that but you had other avenues you know that you could have actually explored at the time. I mean here is the person according to you spreading lies about.  These are serious allegations that were made against you.  Do - do you agree?    Definitely, yes.  Did you ope n any case against Mr Jonas?    Sorry.    Yes, but I am saying that now that youare testifying I mean from that time 23  October 2015 to date did you open any criminal charge against him?     Yes.  Did you bring any action for defamation against him?    Yes.  Did you lay a complaint against him at the ANC about these lies?     Okay.  So that - the short answer you did not do it?    Okay.  Now …     The last question on this aspect of Mr Jonas.    No.  I thought that there is something that maybe my learned colleagues wanted to raise.     We know as a matter of fact and youhave also dealt with it I think when we started with your questioning.  That two months after that meeting you have already said you now agreed with me that Mr  Nene was removed and he was replaced by Mr Van Rooyen.  Was this simply a coincidence?     Thank you.  Mr Chair I am moving now to Mr Dukwana.    Yes.    Chair it may be difficult to compute three minutes.  Maybe 10 minutes might be better.      Yes, do you confirm what he says that, you know you guys used to frequent the Gupta house you used to visit, you also being in the company of the Gupta brothers?      For ease of reference in future Chair, if hey mark it LLC.     And you’re present, that’s why I’m saying that, that’s why you’re given a Rule 3.3 notice.     Yes.  He testified before this commission and related to the Chair the events which took place in four meetings which he refers to in his statement and he says that three of those meetings were held at the presidential residence in Pretoria and one of them I think the last one – the fourth meeting was held at ANN7’s offices in I think he said in Sandton.     Yes.  Now we have now established and it is common cause that you are a shareholder in Mabengela may I call it?    And would I also be correct that Mabengela did conduct business with our government?     Yes.    Infinity Media Networks did conduct business with government.    The individual that you saying – I mean those that are identified on paragraph 18?     Yes.  You were also co-directors with Mr Ashu Chawla in Oakbay?    Now let us dissect you know what you have just said to the Chair in the light of what Mr Sundaram has said. Firstly if my memory serves me well your father the President M r Zuma did not dispute that he played an instrumental role in the establishment of the TV station when he appeared. Do you recall his testimony?     Yes.  Now let us move on to para - topage 62.  Paragraph 28.18  and to afford you a chance - an opportunity to respond to that. “At this point Ajay asked me to go back to the office while Atul, Nazeem and Duduzane met him for discussions about the newspaper and commercial issues.  I was told the next day that - I was told the next day by - next day by Nazeem and Atul that they had secured R20 millions worth of business the previous evening.  By this time I had decided to resign as editor at ANN7 and go back to India afterthe launch.  It was happening without the exten sive training I had suggested.  It was happening with our test runs with all systems and equipment in place but what really pushed me to resign was the violation of editorial integrity and dubious commercial dealings that I had seen with my own eyes.” Would also be this one of the occasions where people are simply placing you in the crime scene as you have suggested with the other witnesses?  You were not part of this meeting as well.     Yes and you were not part of it?     You were simply placed on the crimescene as well?    Yes.    Alright.  Now let us turn to page 63.  Before we go to page 63 while you are still on page 62 so that you are able to familiarise yourself with the context of what I am - I am about to put to you.  This is now the fourth meeting which happened at Midrand.  The offices of ANN7.  On 19 August 2013 were you part of this meeting?   Mr Zuma.    Were you part of this meeting?     Yes, yes.    Yes and in paragraph 30 Mr  Sundaram    So you are part and parcel of this …     Activity, yes.    If I may refer you to page 65 paragraph 30.12.  It is right at the bottom. “He stood at the PCR for another 15 minutes and then moved towards the door.  Laxmi, Atul,  Nazeem, Duduzane and I saw him off.”  I take - I take that him was the President - the then President. “He said he was happy before he left.  Atul assured him that the station would be run as per his guidance and wishes.”  Do you recall this happening?     Yes.    And then the rest you can recall?     Alright.  Now let me conclude on this evidence of Mr Sundaram and simply wrap up you know what appears to be his testimony at least in as far as it relates to you Mr Duduzane Zuma.    We know and you can take it from me that when Mr Zuma testified he did talk about the importance of a TV station and his role before the Chair and we know that you were the shareholder in Mabengela Investment.  Mabengela connected business with Government and Mabengela Investment held the shares in Infinity Media Networks.  Would I also be correct that Infinity operated thechannel ANN7?    Yes.  Now the channel ANN7 benefitted through advertisement from Government.  You confirm that?     Yes.  Mabengela was partly owned by Tegeta?    Let us check that.  In turn Tegeta owned(“OCH”) Optimum Coal Holdings?     Optimum Coal Holdings is the holding company of is the holding company of Optimum Coal Mine?     Yes.  Optimum Coal Mine supplied coal to Eskom?    Yes.  Alright.  Can you now proceed to deal with Mr Booysen?    Thanks Chair.  Mr - Mr Zuma I was justabout to move now to the evidence of Mr  Booysen.  He testified before this Commission.  He informed the Chair that he joined the South African Police in 1976.  It is folder number four.     Yes and he told the Chair that he was promoted to different ranks.  I mean starting from the Colonel, Brigadier and Major-General.  He told the Chair that you were once a complainant in a criminal matter that involved Mr Ian Endres concerning a fraud line betting scheme.  Would that be correct?     That is incorrect?    And how did you encounter Mr  Booysen?    A mutual friend?   And under what circumstances?     Just an introduction?    He says that to the extent that Mr Booysen says that he was once a complainant in a matter involvinga fraud betting scheme …     And he says that is incorrect …     But he admits that he did meet Mr Booysen I think under different     Circumstances.    Yes and we just about to interrogate …     Those circumstances where you met Mr Booysen.  Do - can - can you share with us?    So this issue that he is telling the Chair about is not your issue but it is the issue of a mutual friend?     Oh.  So that is how you met.  In those circumstances?    Ja.    You do not know about that?     Now Mr Booysen …    Yes, but flowing from what the Chair was asking you.  He says that he did not meet with you once but on many times when you would inquire about the progress of the investigation in this matter.  Is he also - he is - he is not telling the truth?     It - it was just on a social basis?     Okay.    He relayed one such meeting that tookplace in Sandton.  Can I refer you to page 3 of his statement and he    I do not know.  Maybe we will ask Mr Booysen.    A co complainant must be a person that launched a complaint together with you.     Yes.    Yes.    A few times.    Maybe to take that point further with the Chair.  If you turn to p age 4 you will see the importance of why you were sent a 3.3 Notice.  He proceeds at paragraph 1 -5-9 and I will read that to paragraph 1-6-4 for you to react at once in those - on those    Oh a white?    Okay.   I just had to ask that question.    So that I was - you - you do have one or you did own one? “Duduzane had suggested that I get into the vehicle with him.  I told my son who was with - with me at the time that I would be driving with Duduzane and that he should follow us.  My son followed us in his own vehicle.  I took it that we were going to his office in Sandton.  We chatted about odds and ends.  There was no discussion about his fraud matter.  Prior to our arrival Duduzane had made no mention that we were in fact going to the Gupta compound or anything regarding my interview into the position of National Head of the Hawks.  Thenext moment we pulled up at the residence in Sandton which I recognised - recognised as the Gupta’s Saxonwold compound.  I alighted from the vehicle by which time my son had walked up to me and asked me whether we were there - whether we were where he thought we were.  I responded and told him that I thought so.  Although I was caught by surprise I decided to see how things would unfold.  We were escorted by security guards and entered the house where the - where we handed ourcellphones over to them before entering the lounge.  Tony Gupta was the only Gupta brother present .  There were also house staff present which I gathered were from India who served us some light Asian snacks.  Tony spoke to my son who is an IT specialist and told him if he wanted to go into business a venture he should speak to them.”     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.     Mr Chair the two that are remaining it isMr – it is Advocate Ramatlhodi and Mr Mofe.   You must have read their statement.  The legal team took ...[intervenes]      That’s your guy?   I am just about to move to the statement of Mr Mofe.  The legal team of the Commission took the view that the two of them mentions your name but they do not implicate you, and ...[intervenes]      Yes, and ...[intervenes]      Now if you turn to page – to folder number 6.   
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair I appear for Mr Zuma together with MrJoubert in – on instructions from Mr Van Der Merwe who sits next to him.    Mr Chair if I may perhaps say the following.     We – Mr Zuma has not been subpoenaed to be here in terms of the Act.    Yes.    That means that there are certain limitations on the proceedings.    And what our learned colleagues can ask of Mr Zuma and what he is legally obliged to do in that regard.     I want to give you the assurance.    That we are not going to take any technical points.     However there must be a basis laid before our learned friend and of course you have to give  permission.    For cross-examination.    Mr Zuma is here as I say not under subpoena but because he wants to be here.    And we would expect our learned colleague  to be interested in what he has to say.   And that our learned colleague will not present a case against Mr Zuma as if they are in opposing camps.     And I take it that this commission will als o be open to accept what Mr Zuma has to say and you will make your findings in due course.      So once again these are not adversarial proceedings they are inquisitorial and we are merely here to assist in the process.    Thank you Mr Chair.     Yes Chair I would have thought that we have right of re-examination just shortly, I have got about seven points.      Mr Chair we understood in fact that we were going to be here for two days and that – we have a difference on our side ofthe fence, we understood two days and our colleague understood one day.     That is excellent thank you.    So sorry.    Sorry.  Excuse me.    Excuse me.  Mr Chair we spoke on this side and there is no chance of completing my side of the work today …     And we …    Thought of asking you whether you could perhaps commence at 9 o’ clock …    Tomorrow morning.  Then I should be done by 10 o’ clock.    I thought …     It might just assist in getting the job done.     So it will be 10 o’ clock then. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS: Mr Commissioner I appear on behalf of Mr Duduzane Zuma on all issues in respect of he will – of which he will be cross-examined save in relation to Mr Mcebisi Jonas instructed by MDK Attorneys Mr Krause.     Mr Chairman may I make a suggestions, nofingers pointed, we thought it was one day, tomorrow is difficult for me, I have about five areas to cover which I don’t believe will take more than ten to twelve minutes.     So if I could go before Mr Louw I would finish today and if Mr Louw needs to run into tomorrow then he can do that and I don’t have to be here because he is dealing with Jonas and I am not involved with Jonas.     Thank you.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Zuma you will have heard the phrase on the scene of the crime a few times.  Now no one isactually suggesting I think that a crime w as committed but they using the phrase in inverted commas to say at a significant moment you were there and yet at a significant moment again you were there and what is sought to be painted I think is a pattern which is undeniably something that must be questioned and is ominous. Do you understand that that in my submission is the - the theme of those questions?     Now to test whether you actually were at the places that people say you were and doing or s aying what they say you were doing or saying it would appear to me that this Commission is - it is incumbent on this Commission to investigate whether there could possibly be any truth behind that which is being described by - by the witness. Do you have comment?  That is a leading question I beg yourpardon.  Now let us take a concrete example.  Mr Dukwana is - said that someone at Saxonwold said that yo u were getting money from a mine in Jagersfontein and this was a good indication that it - it is suggested that there would be something in it for Mr Dukwana moneywise if he also climbed in to this effort with Mr Magashule - Magashule - to - to make money. I can give the appropriate section but we all know what weare talking about.  Do you remember that evidence?     Do you have any interest in a mine in Jagersfontein?    Do you have any knowledge of a mine in Jagersfontein that you could possibly be said to be receiving money from?    Do the Guptas with whom you are negatively linked have a mine in Jagersfontein?     Would you invite this Commission to investigate what mines there are in Jagersfontein to establish whether it would be remotely possibly for you to get money from a mine in Jagersfontein?    Now it would seem explicable that if you were not getting money from a mine in Jagersfontein and this was a portentous or ominous allegation made by a witness led before this Commission and before the public that that investigation as to the possibility even of you receiving money from a Jagersfontein mine had not in fact been investigated.  Would you agree?     Now to conclude on Mr  Dukwana if it is found that there is not the remotest possibility of you receiving money from that source then it would appear outlandish that anyone would make such a suggestion and then it would  bear on whether Mr Dukwana is talking the truth at all as to your presence at a meeting where you say you were not present.    What is your attitude finally about the investigation into the Jag ersfontein money?  Do you invite it?  Do you ask for it?    Mr Zuma I have noticed you are very polite.  You say I am very disappointed.  You say I do not know what he is talking about and when you are asked more closely what do you mean by that.  You say I deny it.  I take it that is your politeness coming through?     Ja.  Now let us just talk about Mr  Booysen.  The Chairperson said well the issue is not whether you were a co complainant leading to your association with Mr  Booysen.  The fact is there was an association and you went to the Gupta house.  You yourself asked the question but do these documents still exist. Can it not be established whether I was co complainant in a matter being investigated by Lieutenant  Botha in KZN.  Do you invite such an investigation?    And if it is found that you are not a co complainant in the matter that would suggest that Mr  Booysen is completely mistaken or not honest about how your relationship with him arose.    What possible reason would there be for him to be not frank - not honest or even mistaken about his relationship with you and how it arose?    But if the background was not that you were co complainant that he came to be talking to but as a result of a friend ofyours being a complainant he got to know and in that context the conversation came to well you talk about the Guptas.  Why do you not come and see them?  What would your comment be then?     Mr Booysen pictures your relationship as being - he comes to meet you in a semi-official capacity or official capacity as a co complainant in a criminal matter.  Right?     Were you a co complainant in a criminal matter?    What reason would Mr Booysen have to be mistaken or even to be not honest about that?     Your version is that you became friendly.  You met because a friend of yours was a complainant in a criminal matter.     Right?    And thereafter you became friendly?  Mr Booysen does not characterise that relationship you had as a friendship or a fairly close acquaintanceship.  He does not characterise it as that?    He says you - you unexpectedly took him to the Gupta home.    And what is the truth?    Mr Chairman without asking the witness let me make a direct submission if I may.     We invite the Commission to - to investigate whether Mr Zuma was a co complainant.  If it is show that he was not it would colour the background reason …     To Mr Booysen explaining that they met and how they met and it would give impetus to Mr  Zuma’s evidence.  Namelythat …    We were friendly and he wanted to see the Guptas at my suggestion as I understand it …     And so I took him there.    As opposed to it started off as and then …     Something formal and then out of the blue.    The investigation of co complainant …     Would contextualise and     Destabilise we submit Mr Booysen’s evidence to the extent necessary …     To make far less onerous - ominous the trip to 5 Saxonwold.    That is the point and then in conclusion.  Mr Sundaram, he mentions you but without a purpose because you do not appear to have done anything in any of these meetings at all.     But you get a mention.    Ja.  Sometimes when you are not there and once when you were there?     And then Mr Ramatlhodi too.  There does not seem to be much point in him pulling you in.  It is just that you are on the crime scene as Mr  Mokoena loves to say.  Coincidentally apparently.    Thank you Mr Chair.    I have been around a long time. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes that is fine.    Duduzane Zuma.    No.    I do.    So help me God.    I understand thank you Chair.   I understand Mr Mokoena.    Yes Mr Mokoena.    That is correct Mr Mokoena.    Okay thank you.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes Mr Mokoena.    You talking about the actual business relation?    That is correct.    That is correct Mr Zuma.    That is correct Sir.    Yes Sir.   That is the time frame yes that is correct.     Friends with who – Mr Jonas?    No not at all.    That is correct Sir.    That is correct Sir.   Yes Sir.    Yes I recall.    Yes Sir.    [Indistinct] Sir.    That is correct Sir.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct sir.    That is correct sir.    That will be incorrect.  We all agreed to move the venue.    Yes.  That is correct.    At that point no.   When he arrived at the Hyatt?     Yes, yes.  That is correct.    That is the only point.  Yes that is …     That is correct.    Yes.    No.  They would find that a bit strange because Luthuli House is a political office.  It has got nothing to do with myself at least.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    That does not make any sense to me sir.     No.    That is correct sir.    That is correct sir.    At that time it was a proximity and a timeframe issue.    So we had to - chose the closest possible area to meet.    So that is why we met at the residence.     I think what we need to understand is I have conducted many meetings from the Gupta residence.  On a daily basis that was a preferred meeting place outside of an office environment. My residence purely was a private residence for my - for my stay.    I have never conducted any meetings out of my - my private place.  So we did not go there.     Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I do not conduct meeting from my private residence.    No.  That is not the case.    That is correct.    I - I see you now.  I understand what you are saying Chair but it was a private meeting between the three of us.  There was no one else present.    I understand.  I understand.    That is correct sir.    That is correct sir.   So Mr Jonas was coming from a Nedlac meeting.  That is where we agreed to meet in Rosebank.     Right.    No, no.  I am just …    I am just trying to point out because the distance between and my office - Rosebank and a private venue which was the residence …     Is vastly different.  It is much closer and then there was a third party who was coming to the meeting.  I am assuming from his own home in Hyde Park.  So we were all in that part of - of Johannesburg and the closest place was the place we met.     That is correct sir.    Number, number 20?    Yes.    So I (intervenes).    Now I want to ask.  I just want to ask a question.  When you say it was convenient you are saying that the meeting - the meeting at the house was already pre - pre-planned by the time we got to the Hyatt?     Yes.    Yes.   Yes.  That is correct.    That is not true sir.    Sorry sir.  Can you just repeat what, what (intervenes)?    Yes.  I am there.    Okay.    Yes, yes.  I am there.    “We drove in Mr Duduzane Zuma’s car which appeared to be a two door Mercedes Benz.  I did not know the surrounding area very well and only gathered when we arrived at our destination that we had driven to the Guptas residence in Saxonwold.  Mr Duduzane Zuma did not suggest to me that we had left - that we left the Hyatt and that we were going to the Gupta residence or that we meet the Guptas.  AsMr Duduzane Zuma parked his car I noticed that Mr Fana Hlongwane had also arrived at the Gupta  residence.”    Which portion is this?  There are portions that I may agree.  There are portions that I may not agree with.     I am in agreement that he jumped into my car. I am in agreement that we arrived at the Gupta residence but I am in  disagreement that he did not know where we were going.     So he jumped in my car and decided he was - he was going to go where I take him?     He knew exactly where we were going and he -he knew exactly who we - we were going to meet and why.    Yes.    Yes.    So there was phone call that happened in the interleading time because we were the two sitting at the Hyatt.    Ja.  On the same day.    So this was after - this is during …     Our first interaction at the Hyatt Hotel.    So there was notably a third gentleman that was not there.  He was on his way.     A phone call came in.  Yes.    Yes and we had a discussion and there was a mutual agreement to where we were going to meet …     And then there was decided that we will jump into my car and then the rest is documented.     Thank you.    That is exactly what I am saying sir.     That is correct.    Firstly I was not chosen.  I - I decided - I decided to put the meeting together and the reason for that is on the one side yes and they very good friends.  They have known each other - that is common cause - for a long time.  You have a situation where there is a number of things being said in the backgroun d. The one person is not aware of it and the other one is alleged to be talking about it.  So I would raise these matters over a period of time with Uncle Fana to say look you had a good relationship with Mr Jonas.  Why am I hearing that there is - these murmurs and theserumours behind the scenes?  Why am I hearing that and you are not coming across it?    So by the third time of asking I said to him can we resolve this and he left the matter in my hands.     So I was the one left responsible to put the meeting together which I did.    Yes.    Yes.    Not at all sir.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Exactly as it happened, yes.    Yes.    Because the one …     (Intervenes).     As I’d said sir there is one person that’s aware of it and one person that’s not aware of it.      Of course not.     Of course not sir.     That’s correct sir.     Yes that’s my version sir.     Thank you Chair from my side, with all respect to you Chair, I don’t see it as strange that an unknown entity tries to resolve an issue.  I have been in meetings where people hav e put me together with other people in the room where I did not know the third party and similarly I’ve done this, not just with this matter with Mr Jonas but on numerous other occasions.  Sometimes everyone is known to each other in the room, sometimes th ere’s strangers in the room but the common issue is resolving the issue.  Now when it comes to whyme, I’m the one who raised the issue with uncle Fana, as I call him. Now the difficulty is if, in my view, if he approaches Mr Jonas at some point he’s going to ask where’s this coming from so now as – I mean I’m obviously the younger guy in the relationship so as the younger guy I said to him, look this needs to happen and he said if you’re putting your neck on the line you need to be part of that meeting bec ause when he asked me, who’s listening to people saying stuff he is going to ask who and that person is me.  So as part of the meeting set -up as part of putting the issue on the table they needed the horse’s mouth and I was the horse’s mouth.  So I don’t s ee it strange being in a meeting with an unknown person regardless of how long their relationship has been.  There is an awkward issue, I’m the one that raised the issue, I’m the one that put the issue across that the meeting either resolve it or didn’t resolve it and that was it, it’s that simple.      Yes.     Understood.     I understand.     I understand.     I understand Chair, if I may just…[intervenes].      I was tasked with this, it was a simple – if you’re raising this my laaitjie you run with it.      That’s exactly what I did, you resolve the issues if you are going to raise these sorts of matters then you need to put your skin in the game and that’s exactly what I did be cause I needed to stand by whatever it was that information was being passed around and I needed to communicate.      Now I strongly disagree with you Chair that – I understand your point that there’s a certain way certai n meetings are conducted.     This was informal, these sorts of meetings happens all the time, like I said I’ve been part of meetings where I haven’t known certain people in the room but I was asked to attend certain meetings, we’ve either resolved the issues or we haven’t resolved the issues and we’ve moved on and this case is exactly that case it’s not the first time it’s happened and will continue to happen, just purely to put matters on the table to try and resolve th em Chair.     No not at all.     I appreciate it Chair.     Your view looks like it’s changed so [indistinct].     Yes as I said earlier on I haven’t disagreed with any of the questions that you’ve put forward, I haven’t disagreed with me having to have agreed with you that I met them for the first time whether it was via SMS, whether it was  via a phone call that was the first time I met them and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  How do you meet people, you make contact and it’s either they want tomeet you or they don’t want to meet you for whatever reason and we met?     No it was no one else’s business it was between the two of them and I was trying to resolve it.      Thank you Chair.    Yes he has a soft voice.    That is correct Sir.    That is correct Sir.    Sir can you please repeat that question?     Yes I understand the question that will be a fair readings.    No that was discussed.   Yes the meeting is to discuss an issue between himself and Uncle Fana.    I am not sure if it is there or not – can I just reflect on it?    Yes.    That is correct if you look at my affidavit Sir.     There is no detailing of any sms’, or phone calls either.    So I did not touch upon any of th ose topics at all.    What I am saying is that and many other topics that may have been discussed telephonically or sms – or by sms.    I have not included in my affidavit.     That is correct.    That is correct Sir.    That is correct.    That is correct Sir.    His – his reaction the whole time was very relaxed and calm.  I think he took his – his understanding with the relationship that he may have had with Uncle Fana at that time.     That that face value to be nothing untoward.     So it was not – there were not any – any apprehensions of any sort.  It was like okay if that is the case we will do so.    Not subject to scheduling an availability thatonly happened a bit further down the line.    But there was no hostility of any sort from anybody.    I would be…     Chair I do not recall.  I will have to check that.     But I am inclined to say that I probably contacted him first.      I will have to check that I am not sure.     Yes.    It is September?    No I think we have covered that point.  Thank you Chair.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.   Sorry it is 517?    Thank you Sir.    I believe looking at the events and the versions from what the uncle is saying – Uncle Fana I cannot – I cannot give an opinion.  I cannot give a view on it.  He was the re, he was saw what he saw.  He did see what he did not see.     I know what I saw.  I know the lay of the land in that house very well.  The gentleman that walked in was a Mr Rajesh Gupta.    How so?  How so Sir?    I can only speak for what I know.   Thank you very much.    At that point definitely not.    Yes I am the one that introduced the two of them so I know they did not know each other.     Well that is correct.    My understanding is I do not think he had met them prior to this event.    Or – ja that is correct.    Thank you.    That is exactly what it appears to be.    We are reading the same document but I was not there when the Public Protector meeting was happening so I cannot comment on that.    74?    724 okay.      That is correct.    Through other entities correct Sir.     Yes correct.    Yes.    Is this the Public Protector’s interaction?     No which file is it?    A?    It Advocate – the Advocate Madonsela’s start of her [indistinct].    I am on the same page as you.    The line 2 is where the Advocate Madonsela starts.    Um.    Sorry Mr Mokoena page 22 is the end of MrJonas’ statement.    Page 23 starts off with the opening of the meeting of Advocate Madonsela’s interview.     Yes I see it.  The one liner.    Yes.    A meeting with who?  Is the question.     The meetings most…    Yes please Sir that will be helpful.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is helpful.  Thank you very much Chair.     So your question I am trying to - I am trying to - to get a bit more clarity from your side sir.     Most definitely did, yes.    Yes.  In one way or another.  That is correct.     On behalf of the Gupta family by Oakbay.     Yes.    Hm.    I point out you to the same line on behalf of the Gupta family.  So I cannot be attributed to a response that was made on behalf …    Of the Gupta family.  From my side I stated very clearly there was a meeting.    Who was present in the - present in the meeting I have made that very clear sir.  Thank you very much.     Sorry.  Who - who was not involved?  Sorry Chair.  Maybe who was not …?     Yes Chair.    I understand.  It is …     It is definitely open to …     Interpretation.    I think just for - for clarity.    The statement as - as I said was on behalf of the Gupta family.   Who discussed …    How they conveyed that message.    (Intervenes).    I was not part of …     (Indistinct) present in the meeting.   Interpretation from my - my side would be …     They were trying to state …     They were not part of the meeting.     There is another alternate hypothesis that is being put forward.    That they knew.  Why did they not mention that and that is something that you - you have expanded on.    I cannot comment on that.  I can comment on - on my involvement.  Now …    Me being a - a shareholder - a cold shareholder in Oakbay and whatever else - whatever other companies exist.  That is - that is a matter of fact but this statement it cannot be attributed to me though.  I cannot be drawn into the same - the same boat.    Most definitely not.    Thank you.   When - when you asked him what did you say Mr Mokoena because I cannot give you an answer on that?     I do not know.    What - what response did he give if you recollect.   Yes.    I - I have no idea.  I do not want to - to jump into speculation …    But if I may just add something to that as well.     I think another question that should be posed is why did not anyone ask me for my - my view - for my version.    I am saying from the other side I mean I als o need to ask why my view or my version was not requested at the time because there is emphasis on a timeframe.  This was raised in themedia.  There was media statements put out.  The man went out on TV and said whatever he needed to say.  I am not taking  away from why he did it.  I do not know.    He did what he had to do.    Good for him.    I have no issues with that.    Now what I am saying is it is the first time I am being asked this question.  The only time I - I came across it was in 3.3.  I was not given an opportunity by the Public Protector.     You do not see my - my record in the Public …    The Public Protector Report.    Did you ask why?    No.    Hm.   You absolutely - absolutely correct Chair.  If I may just touch on that as well …     And I am glad you raised it because I did get an invite …    To - to go and attend the - the meeting with thePublic Protector and her team.     Then it - within a matter of days it changed into a summons or a subpoena.  Whatever it was at the time …     And my - I got a telephone - phone call - I got a telephone call from I think it was her PA at the time …     And I was travelling at that time and I told her look I am travelling.   You know I was not - I was not in - in the South African space for a while.    I still am not …     And I - I told them I am travelling but I will be back within the next week and a half two weeks.  I will come and see you when I am back.    I have got other commitments now.     And she said fine.  Let us know when you are back.  We just want to have a discussion.     Before you know it the - the report is wrapped up.  I did not have a chance to give my …     My version of events.    It is the first time I must come and speak in front of everybody …     And then I am being questioned along the lines of why I was - what do I think of - of Mr Jonas and …    And then - and why he did it …     And no one is concerned about me not getting a fair - a fair shot.    So I just want to put that across.  It is not a complaint …     In any manner …     But I just - I just want it be in on that.    I have complied the whole time.    I am being asked these sorts of questions.     I appreciate the questions.  I will answer …     With no issues …    But let us be fair on me as well please.    No and I agree.  It is not …     I am not somehow being …     Adversarial about it.  Not at all.     With all due respect sir.   If just - just one point …    And I just and I raise it purely because you know a lot of the evidence pack …     Revolves around the Public Protector’s Report.     Maybe you can shed some light …     And you mentioned that Mr Ajay Gupta had to basically force himself to go and - and have the discussion.  I gave my - my version of why I am not reflected in the documents.  Can you just help me out and - and maybe make me understand why I would not have been since I am integral to a lot of what is going on here. Why was I not invited and y ou know there is a whole report that came out and I am massively implicated.  Why do you think they would missed out on that step?     Alright.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    (Indistinct).    Thank you very much.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  That - your understanding is correct.    That is right.    Chairperson.    That is correct.    Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I understand.    That is exactly what I am saying.    I am saying that just to be clear that after the meeting everything was cool …     And as - as I have mentioned in - in my affidavit I bumped into him.  This is Mr  Jonas.    Once or twice.    Subsequent to that meeting …     And my view was there was no hostility at all.     So that is - that is the way I took it.   What happened behind the scenes the phone I - I do not know.  I cannot comment on it.     Yes.   Yes.  I - I confirm again and - and I stick to what I said …    Earlier on Chair …     And you know you also mentioned that he had called me afterwards …     To basically give me a mouthful as (indistinct).     I should not conduct myself in that way.     You now the meet - the way the meeting happened it should not have - whatever - whatever it is …     That he said that I said …    And that phone call never came through.  Sothe point I am trying to make is …   The communication that happened telephonically I - I cannot comment on.    Some of it may have happened.  Some of it may not have happened …     But - as - as I said to you everything at that point the meeting, the contents of the meeting went the way they did.    Whether issues were resolved or not.     That is a different story …     But when we all emerged from that room …     It was all cool.    I did not include it in my affidavit.    As I said there is a lot of SMS’ phone calls.    That were not included.    There is (indistinct) information as well.  I did not include.    No that is not a remark that I made.     Most definitely not sir.    Thank you Chair.    Page?    Thank you.  Got it.    Yes.  That is correct.    Most definitely, yes.    I will be exploring the avenues.  These avenues you are talking about.    These are the avenues that you are talking about.    No.  I did not sir.    No sir.  I did not.    It was none of the ANC’s business.  It was a personal matter sir.   As far as I am concerned neither did he.     I believe so.    Sorry.  Sorry.    May I please have a comfort praise sir.     I just need to …    Comfort break please Chair.    Thank you.    Three minutes maximum.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you for that Chair.     Okay I agree thank you.     That’s correct sir.     I’m not sure I’ve never met him there.     Not at the Gupta residence.     No I do not know Mr Dukwana.     I may have in passing but in this relation no I have not, I do not recall meeting him.      I’m not sure what Mr Dukwana is talking about that’s my comment.     I do not agree with each and every part of the statement, paragraph by paragraph.  I do not agree that this meeting took place, I do not agree that his placing all these wonderful people in this meeting, so in entirety I completely refute.      That’s correct sir.     I appreciate the clarity and I take your view and I agree with your view.     That’s correct.     No, no definite.     Yes sir     Thank you.     Ja that’s not the way I put it, I gave my view and I gave my version.     That’s correct thank you Chair.     That’s right sir.     That’s correct sir.     That’s what I’m saying, that’s correct.      Clear and there was no uncertainty on his side.     I’m being conveniently placed at a supposed crime scene yes.     Ja definitely we don’t know.    Yes he did mention me.     Reading his version of events I felt that at the time and obviously through consultation that I was mentioned and I was not implicated in any allegations that may have come to the fore.      Yes.     Correct and as I said I was – I didn’t believe, I still don’t believe I was implicated I believe I was mentioned, the meeting, as I’ve said I’ve got no recollection of it, it did not happen. So that’s the angle I took.     That’s correct sir.     That’s correct Chair.     I see your point then, one would find it even more interesting that I’m always placed in the middle of these discussions and I happen to be a couch or a lampshade in the meetings. I didn’t see anything, I don’t say anything so I find that more interesting than the point you’re making but I take your point Chair     Said he was brought into the meeting.     Okay.    Yes.    That is definitely the narrative that is outthere.    And I am being like I said I am being placed a t the crime scene.    Most times.    But whilst we are still on that if I can just refer us back to point 55.    No I mean it is just the paragraph that deals with the Jagersfontein mine.  The – look I am not sure you know a lot is said – a lot of accusations have been laid on my table. But just a point of curiosity I mean with all – with all due respect Chair …     Okay.    Okay I will do that Chair.  Thank you.  No I mean it is just a point of curiosity.  And I say it with all due respect.  There are a lot of accusations that have been labelled and placed and on me and I am not sure what the investigative  processes have been but you know I would just like to ask you have heard what I have had tosay about my non-attendance in this meeting – my denial of this meeting.  But when it comes to procedural points I have been accused of receiving monies from they said – by Mr Dukwana – has the commission…     Of receiving money from a mining project in Jagersfontein.  Yes I just wanted to ask did the commission follow any  due process.   Did they look into it?  Did they investigate?  What is the status on that?      Yes.  Just as a point of – of getting to the bottom of it.  The reason I am asking is…     If I ever made a statement [indistinct] Chair.     No the reason – reason I am asking is there are a lot of accusations that have been thrown around.     You know true or false.    That is for the commission to     To decide.  So this specific poi nt.   Whether the commission decides to believe my version or Mr Dukwana’s version or whoever else.     Due process by – from an investigative perspective.    By the commission have they actually looked into you know activities in Jagersfontein?  Is there – are there actually mines that exist there?  Are there any linkages that are linking this specific – because this is a very – very serious allegation?     Yes.    I understand Chair.    Thank you very much for the clarity.    Yes I do know him thank you.    In Midrand.    Ja.    I only attended one of those.    Yes.  That was in Midrand.    In Midrand at the ANN7 studios.    That is correct.    That is correct Sir.    From an – ja yes they did, that is correct.    Well no ANN7 did not Mabengela.    So the TV station did not my company directly.     Yes.    That is correct Sir.    I do not know about that Sir.    No.    That was a studio visit so it was walk around the studuo.   That is correct Sir.    No I do not know about this presentation.    No I am not.    It was no secret Sir that is correct.     It was no secret that is correct Sir.     To the best of my recollection I think the majority would have been present.      The role of which specific persons?     Yes, yes.    Yes, yes I responded yes I.    Okay.  Mr Ajay is a co-shareholder.    That is Mr Ajay Gupta sorry.  Mr Atul Gupta was chairman of the group.    Okay.  Mr Ajay Gupta is a shareholder.     Mr Atul Gupta is chairman of the group.  Mr Nazeem Howa was Group CEO if I recall.  Mr Moegsien Williams was the Group Editor.  Mr Arun Agriwal was the co -shareholder as well from India.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes if I recollect at this point he possibly wasja [mumbling].    That sounds correct Sir.  I will have to che ck that at that point but it sounds correct.     That is correct Sir.    No that is not accurate.   No not at all.    I am – it is a…    It is both points sorry I was particularly responding to …    The last part where my relationship with him.     Were said     Yes I am responding to that and I would like to also respond to the point where it said he had lived in South Africa for many years.    And was a Gupta’s point man.    For any co-ordination with the President and the South African government.  I am not aware of that.     So I am refuting that as well.   No he is still very cold ja.  Still cold no.    He was not close to me.    That is correct yes.    Thank you.    I can confirm that.    That number may have changed but I confirm it is around that number yes.    It did.    Is there anything specific that you would like to know?    Look I think there is a lot of creative writing in this paragraph.    The simple – the simple fact is governmentadvertising well for us to be in line for government advertising should never be an issue.  The conflict myself being the son the President at that time – my father being in office I think that is an unfair point to make by Mr Sundaram or anyone else.  The fact of the matter is it was a TV station – it was a new TV Channel.  It was a start -up an just like any other channel I implore government to support any start-ups.  So when it comes to government ad spend revenue just like any other outlets that exists out there you name them, they getting government support via advertising revenue.    So I completely refute this those whole paragraph.    If that is what you saying I will take your word for it.    That is correct Sir.    That is correct Sir.    Which facts?  The facts that you have just put to me?    No I do not think so.    Sorry Sir.   I do not think so no.    No just to put it into context.    So it is not taken out of context.  If – I will answer your question.  If we go back to 28.6.     Which is page 58.  And I will just read the first    That is correct.    Just give me one second.  Let me just; this will be part of the same meeting correct.    No.    That is correct sir.    Yes.    (No audible reply).    Yes sir.    Just give me two seconds please.    Yes.  This is a meeting that I was part of.     Very clearly sir.    Yes.    That is correct, sir.    I recall the event - seeing him off.  That is correct.  That did happen.   Yes.    No.  The rest I was not part of that .    Yes sir.    Yes.  I was the vehicle.    Like any other channel around.  Yes.  That is correct.    I will have to check that.  I am not …     Yes.  That is correct.    That sounds correct sir.    That is very correct, sir.    I have - I have taken a look yes.    Yes.   Sorry.  Just to be clear you are asking me to - to give an opinion - a speculative opinion?    That is a very tricky question Chair.     I do not - I do not have a problem answering but …    But that is - you are asking …    For a view and opinion a speculation which I am not comfortable giving.    Yes.    Chair I see you pushing me to give a view.  I will give you a view.    Yes, but I would also like to place it if this Mr Sundaram’s version of events was not true.     Is there anyone else that can give that same speculative.    Anyway to answer your question.    I would have to agree with you most - most definitely.   Yes.    No.  I am answering your question.  I was just putting …    Putting my view across …    As a - as an alternate but to answer yourquestion since you …    You - you have pushed me to do so.    I will answer it.  My view is I would have to agree with you.  Yes.    Yes, yes.  I remember that.  I remember that clearly sir.    That is correct.    Yes.  That is correct Chair.    Yes.  I will - I will respond.    Firstly he mentioned that I was part of a number of meetings but then he mentions that I did not contribute to any of the meetings.  So he cannot have it both ways.  He needs to decide whether I was there.  I was active or I  was not there and as I am saying to - to the Commission is I was not part of those meetings.  That is the first point I want to make and Chair the second point is besides ANN7 a lot of other companies that I have - as Mr Mokoena pointed out.  I was a share holder/director whatever the case was at that time.  There has been a prevailing narrative up untilthis point about State Capture, corruption, influence outside of Government, appointing of Ministers and whatever else.  Now I made the decision to pull back  and not to be active in - in a lot of roles.    To my detriment.  So I could not grow with my company …    And not just Mr Sundaram.  I am sure there will be a lot of staff …   That worked in the offices.  They would have said then …    We have not seen this gentleman around in a long time.    I would make some - some visits from time to time …    And give my input …     Where I could.    Now the point I am trying to get to is if it wasthe other way around …     And I had been in all these meetings.     I had been there …     Directing traffic …     Whatever - and whatever purpose I need to be in that meeting for.   Today I would be sitting here and you would be asking me the question on …     You have been placed at these meetings.     There is no editorial interference from shareholders.    What would I say about that.    So I would rather be sitting at this point saying …    I am not sure what Mr  Sundaram is talkingabout …    Because if it was the other way around.     You would be asking me and you would actually be putting to me.    That as a shareholder I was part of these meetings and I was interfering editorially.     So I have spoken in a roundabout way but I just wanted to make that point.    Yes.    Yes.  You are correct.  As - as well as me having to have limited my roles as well.     Yes.  You are correct.  You are correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.    Thank you very much.    Yes.    That is incorrect.    That is - yes.  It is incorrect sir.    I met him through a mutual friend of ours.     Yes.    Just an introduction.    Yes.    So there is the issue that he is speaking about which is not my issue and I ha ve denied it.  There is a mutual friend ofours that was handling his own matters at that time which relates to the issue that you just raised which is not my issue and that is how this whole thing arose of the meeting.    That is correct.    In those circumstances.  So it was purely by chance …   And it was just a social. ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA    I do not know about that.    No.    No.  I said …    No.  It had absolutely nothing to do with that …    Specific subject matter, yes.    No.    Confusion but I - I do not know.    What I am saying is I met him a few times - numerous times if you wan t to put it that way and it was purely on a social basis.  There was no discussion of any pending cases of any sort.  I was not following up any cases of anybody.     That is correct Chair.    Sir.    Before I answer that.  I will answer that.  If I may just ask a question.  What does co complainant mean?     Okay.  That is true.    Yes.    So that document would be available if I am correct.    That document or that (intervenes).     Then I think we should pull that document up then.    That will answer that question …     And then moving onto - I mean I think that it is- it is clear that we have met a few times.  We have not disputed that.  I once again deny that I was a co complainant and I wish those document - that - that record could be pulled up.  As for the meeting happening in my Sandton offices.  I do not recall.  It could have happened.  It is possible but I do not recall.    Yes.    Chair …    May I humbly disagree with you Chair.     I think that is quite a focal point here because …    The theme of the - of the meetings and the - the subsequent meetings …     Is based on me being a co complainant which I have said I am not.   So …    Okay Chair.    Thank you.   Not a black Rolls Royce but there is a white Rolls Royce, sir.    Yes.        Yes.  At the time, yes.    Ja.  I was - I was doing well Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Please.  Give me a chance please.  Give me a chance please sir to respond.    Impropriety.     If I may be allowed to res pond thank you.   But then to start off with is like I said the interactions between myself and General Booysens were on a social basis, that’s the the engagements we had, we discussed a lot of weird and wonderful things but it was on a social basis.   I h ave detailed that is to how we got intouch.  Now on this specific day then what leads to it is he would always ask questions about the Gupta family, which a lot of people ask, friends, family, strangers, and he is obviously a career policeman so he has got a level of inquisitiveness or quite an investigative nature, even when we had discussions on general stuff, random stuff, he would always enquiry from a policing perspective.  I mean that is his history. So in a few discussions prior to this eventful da y he’d raised a question like how are the guys, you know what is their situation, or what’s their story, like I said the usual questions, and I said look one day if there is an opportunity I will take you to meet them, just like I have taken a lot of people to meet the guys, just like I have taken Mr Tony to meet a lot of other people, friends, family, just to get a perspective, because a lot of people don’t have that perspective, an inter-personal engagement.So this leads us to this day and I may be wron g but if mymemory serves me correct this would have been a weekend and not a week day, so for me to – for there to be a suggestion that we are going to the office I am not too sure about that.   By the time we had arranged to meet at the Gautrain, if I re collect he was coming from either Midrand or Pretoria, the plan was to go to number 5 Saxonwold, and that is exactly what we did.He arrived, we ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes?     That was the only plan for that day.      That was the plan.     There was nothing else, like I said I m ay be, I stand to be corrected but it was definitely a weekend.      I mean we have met a few times you know and there’s times where I have met him in Pretoria.      So there is no issue of the venues we have met in interesting places.   This specific day was ...[intervenes]      Yes, this was that we had agreed, okay if youcome through I will take you through to meet Mr Tony ...[indis tinct] I would  like you to meet him, and he said okay if that is case, whether it was inquisitiveness, whether he thought I was joking I don’t know but that was the plan for the day.     Yes, thank you Chair.     Okay, so that covers that point.  So moving on he is correct there was no discussion about any fraud matter, like therewas not any previously.  Let’s move on to pa ragraph 163, definitely general discussions, there was some specific discussions with the son, obviously on him being an IT specialist and opportunities around that nature of what he does, the usual pleasantries.  Getting to the point where – because what paragraph 163 actually, forgive me but it doesn’t make sense to me.   If you read the whole thing, the whole paragraph it takes you from an accusation of prior knowledge to a Hawk’s position or prior knowledge to an interview for a Hawk’s position or short list.   Then it goes on to say that this popped up in The Mercury at the time so it could have been public knowledge, then it winds off to an impression creation of information being known beforehand and then it ends off with a reiteration, a firm reiterat ion that the statement was not made directly.  It is a very confusing paragraph to me, so I cannot respond to that.   It has got a whole host of things that don’t make sense to me, but what I can say is that was not discussed and that wasdefinitely not the issue, that is on paragraph 163. Yes, I think that’s what I comment to respond.      That is correct.     Yes, and I will reiterate it if you will allow me to.     The purpose on that day was very specific.      By the time we agreed to meet up at the Sandton Gautrain Station we all knew where we were going to.      That was discussed prior to us getting, and the discussion was preceded by a discussion.      On enquiring about the nature of the Gupta family and so on and so forth, and I would say look that’s my guy, just as much as I have a good relationship with him, I was starting to build a relationship, I believe at least, with Mr Booysen and if the time arises I would love for you guys to meet and he said no it is cool, and we will meet and that was that specific day so the purpose for the meeting happening was purely a hello, how are you, it was a meet and greet, there was no other specific purpose.      Socially yes, that is correct.     Yes, after discussion definitely.     Mr Chauke.     Obviously we do not have a long -standing relationship ...[intervenes]      From the interaction over a period of timeleading up till then I think we had a very good report definitely, yes, yes, yes.     And I hope it is still that way.     So if Mr Booysen is watching ...[indistinct]      Let me make it clear, due to prior discussions there were discussions around the Gupta family, so it was not him who decided let’s go meet the guys.  After discussion it was – you know I raised it and said look if you are asking all these questions you can ask them directly.   He seemed to – you know, so, ja so afterwards he is like if there is an opportunity to I would honour tha t opportunity I will do so.  I said okay fine.   So that day is the day that we went, we met up specifically to go and fulfil this exercise, for him to get a sense of who this family is, where they live, I mean it has been a major talking point and people are inquisitive about it, so I feel even with his background he thought okay, let me go and check it out and that is exactly what he did.    Yes Chair.     Yes.     If I may answer it, not, if I may just answer in this way.   There were questions, there were discussions and I said to him these are open people ...[intervenes]      Ja, if you would like to meet them at any point let me know, and he could have said no, he said yes.     So if you are asking me, if you’re saying at his instance I am not too sure about that, but this is the way it panned out.      Yes, there was a build-up to it yes, correct.     Like many other people Chair.    That is correct Chair.     No, then that is not true sir.        Yes, that’s what I am saying, I mean would it make sense on a random weekend we decide to meet up, to drive all the way from Pretoria to Johannesburg, and meet up a t the Sandton Gautrain station, the offices are closed on a Saturday so reasonably you cannot expect me to be taking you to an office.  It can happen, I may have the keys in my pocket, but it is a Saturday.     Ja, 100%.         But the specific discussion was we are meeting in Johannesburg, I can – if you want to meet the guys I can take you through and there was that agreement.       Yes.     Yes, I do not want to put other people’sbusiness in the street, but he was in Gauteng at that specific point.      Some of the meetings that we have had have been in the Gauteng space.     More specifically Pretoria.       This given time he honoured me and he graced me with his presence in Johannesburg so he made the trip, and I appreciated him for doing that because he did not have to.      And from there we went through to the residence.     Yes that is correct Chair, I think it is – it may not be well known, it may well known, I do n’t know, it was pointed out in the company organogram that Mr Tony is a business partner of mine.      Mr Tony Gupta is a business partner of mine.      Yes, and he is also a very dear and close friend.    that is correct, the reason I am pointing that out is because I spent a lot of time with him, on a daily basis.      More than particularly close, that is my guy.      Thank you.    Yes sir.     Yes sir.    No I have got nothing to ...[intervenes]      If I may start from – I am sorry – if I may start from point number two, and that states that following my appointment Ireceived many congratulatory message s including one from myself, I do not recall that but that could be true.  I will take it as that being the case, it sounds like something I could have done. As far paragraph 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 I am not sure what he is talking about.     The position Chair is that I am denying the points that I mentioned now.     This version of events as placed in this document do not reflect the reality at that time.      On which occasion?     No, no, no.     There was no such meeting, the only times I have met him have been in passing, there has been no formal sit -downsor get togethers.     Yes I am quite sure, I mean he is detailing a lot of events that have happened, that happened in that timeframe, and none of that is reflective to that so me meeting him at St George’s Hotel to discuss the subject matter that he is placing forth, becaus e that is what these paragraphs are about, is entirely not true.     As I am saying any formal sitting with Minister Ramatlhodi has never happened, whether at St George’s or anywhere else, unless I have stated I have bumped into him in a number of places but that has been in passing.      No, I haven’t had that discussion with him Chair.    More than that it is an environmental issue because now we have spent a whole page printing a whole bunch of stuff that should not be here.     Yes sir.     Yes they do.     Yes, I read it Chair.     No I cannot react on this point.     Folder five?    I see your point.     Yes, yes, and that ...[intervenes]      That is not correct and it fits into the narrative of course.     Which is ...[intervenes]      Which is to one being, myself being anorganiser, a conduit to meetings and influencing whatever else it is and the second point being I am always there trying to put people together to resolve you know issues that are non-issues via rumours in the atmosphere, so I take your point Chair, and where it comes from.      If I may make a request, because obviously I will need to check, a lot has changed ...[intervenes]      Over a period of time, so I don’t want to givethe wrong information.        Looking at some of these companies yes I have been involved, some of them I am not too sure what the situation is, so far I can request that if I – whatever question is being raised I can pointedly go through one by one and I can submit it to the Commission as soon as possible.     Because I won’t be too sure at this point.      Everything active not active, share register the whole thing.     Yes sir.     Thank you.     I will do that, I will do that.     Okay.     No, no, most definitely not Chair.      Will do Chair.     My only comment at this point is I am not sure where you would have got that information from, but there has been a great deal of publicity around my financia l status, I mean it is not secret, I mean that is one of the reasons I am sitting here.      And that is for the claims that I have been made this wealthy person and then secondly is property in Dubai, t hat has also been – I am not sure if you have seen it or not, but unfortunately I have, it has been well publicised.      In the media space so I think those ideas that have made the rounds over the past few years.      Like I said I am not sure.     I am not sure.     Sorry, sorry, sorry to do this again toeverybody but am I the only one who needs to use the bathroom in this room?     If we may take a comfort break.    I understand sir.    No that is - that is the Commission’s duty I believe (intervenes).    I do sir.    No.  I do not sir.    No sir.    No sir.    As I mentioned earlier that I thought that they - they had done.  They clearly had not but I definitely invite them to do so.    I agree sir.   That would be correct sir.    As I said earlier on it is - it is a point that I had raised and with all due respect to the Commission.  I am slightly disappointed that it was not looked into but we are sitting here today and if there is a possibility of that being revisited the Chair did make his comments, ja.   I believe so.  Yes sir.    I most definitely do sir.    Yes.  That will be correct sir.    I do not know.    You can just repeat that question please.  What did you say?    Yes.    No.  I was not.    I am not sure.  He may have been confused.  I do not know.    Yes.    That is it.    I like to believe so, yes.    No.  He does not.    That is what he said.    That all along as I detailed before when I was asked by the evidence leader  that day in question there was an agreement for us to go through to the said meeting.     Yes sir.   Honourable every time.    Yes sir.    Yes sir.   So sorry to …    Yes please.  Just a concern from my side and it is quite a big concern.    Just from the evidence pack that has been presented today …     And that I have been questioned on.  There is a glaring omission.  I am not sure if there is a mistake.     Omission of - of a witness that testified in frontof the Commission and …    Correct.  That will be an Ms  Vytjie Mentor.  So I am not sure where that …     Line of questioning will be.    Okay.    Alright.    Okay.    Thank you Chair.

ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   To call the other friend.     To say that there is this rumour comelet’s discuss this rumour they don’t even need the third person, am I correct?     Yes, now from your own version you say, if I understand it very well and I’m simply paraphrasing, is that the meeting of the 23 r d of October 2015 was simply for the three of you to meet and to discuss a rumour, no thing else there were no offers that were made and that’s your version?      Chair just a few questions I just want to wrap up on this issue I see that we are getting to quarter past.  I have referred you to page 737 simply to close on this issue that we’re debating with the Chair and piggy backing on it.  If you read paragraph eight, just one line, and that’s really what troubles me about how this thing was arranged, you are saying there, it’s your affida vit,“I met Mr Jonas for the first time at the Hyatt Hotel asarranged by telephone discussions, SMS exchanges betweenus”,And I think, that’s, you know support what the Chair or at least you know also brings into light the questions as to why you – you are meeting with them for the first time, you don’t know each other, you are coming to discuss this rumour and that’s why we are posing those questions to you so that we can at least make sense of what you are saying that, why you, why were you the chos en one?     Yes.    I might have stepped into some of the minutes of the tea adjournment.    Thank you Chair.   Except Mr Chair that we might have competition with the air conditioner and I know that at some point you see that my voice is fading.    I will try to raise my voice but I will also Mr Zuma to try his level best.      Yes.    It interferes yes.  We will try.    Mr Zuma I want to explore the last topicyou know on the issues pertaining to Mr Jonas and what transpired on the 23 r d October 2015 and clearly that topic is that you know simply to explore who was present at th e meeting and what really happened at the meeting you know and that will be my last topic out of that. Having in mind the fact that your version is quite clear that the meeting was simply to discuss a rumour and it was between amongst the three of you at Gupta residence, am I correct?  That is?     Yes ja.      And if I may refer you to file A – A Chair.  And if you may turn to page 4.  That is Mr Jonas’ witness statement which he submitted before this commission.  And I will try to summarise what is contained in there in order to save time.  If you look at paragraphs – you know from page 4 paragraph 3 to page 6 paragraph14 Mr Jonas gives details specifications and times when different calls, exchange of sms’, even the missed calls which you know occurred between yourself him and you know Mr Hlongwane at some point.  The question that I simply – and if you look at that detailed narration  of what transp – what according to him transpired and the exchange of the telephone or of the cell phone calls and the sms’ you will not find at least from his version where he says that prior to the 23 r d October 2015 when you called him you disclosed to him that the reason for the meeting was to discuss the rumour.  Would I be – would that be a fair reading of your statement?    The question is if you read Mr Jonas’ statement those paragraphs that I have referred to you will not find anywhere where he says when he called you; you disclosed to him that you know the purpose for this meeting was supposed to be to discuss the rumour, would that be a fair reading of Mr Jonas’?     Yes.  Now I want to know from you I mean having regard from the time when you started inviting him to the awards up until the 23 r d October 2015 did you disclose to him that you wanted to discuss with him a rumour and if so you know I might have missed it also in your affidavit.  If you can point me to your affidavit where you have said that?     You told him?    Okay.  And then is that what you conveyed at some point in your affidavit?  I might have missed it.      Okay.    Ja because I seem to recall – I mightyou know I am speaking under correction that I have read your affidavit.    Yes.    Yes.    And this …   Yes.  And if you look at you know those paragraph of Mr Jonas he is detailing you know even the text of the messages that were exchanged between the two of you.  He gives you the time frames around when this text message were exchanged and also the telephone calls that were made between the two of you.  Now what I want to understand is that all this effort was simply made in order to discuss the rumour and that is your version?     Okay.  Now you also state in your affidavit before this commission that at some point during that meeting one of the Gupta brothers did peep inside the room in order toascertain your availability for the next d ay in a different meeting.  And you say that was Rajesh Gupta, am I correct?     Chair the…    Chair we do not even need to speculate about the chronology.    If one turns to page 4 where I have referred to page 4 and paragraph 3, 4 and 5 and I think that would assist and bring light to the questions of the Chair.   “Mr Jonas is at on or approximately 27, 28 August15 when I was in Luanda at an African caucus of finance ministers.  I recall being contacted by Mr Fana Hlongwane whom I knew relatively well telling me that Mr Duduzane Zuma would like to speak to me to invite me to an awards ceremony.  4. I subsequently met Mr Hlongwane during October 15 in Johannesburg in the presence of Mr Bongani …”   Chair you are referring to him as More     May I think I would be safe to mention to him as More.    It might be More Chair.    Yes.   “Bongani More and who told me that Mr Duduzane Zuma wanted to meet me.  During the course of the conversation he mentioned that the Gupta’s were important to him.  I indicated that I would not want to be associated with the Gupta’s.   5. I asked Mr Hlongwane to provide me with Mr Duduzane Zuma’s number.  I had not previously met Mr Duduzane Zuma nor had any previous interactions with him.”And that is what you know the context about the questions of the Chair.  Now moving to the topic that we dealing with is that you say that you were sure that the person who peeped in – in the room was Mr Rajesh Gupta?    And you say that you are certain that it was him definitely?    Now may I refer you to file number B.  If you could put file number A away.  File B page 517.      Yes, yes Mr Duduzane.    We did visit this transcript before but for different reasons.    Page 517 Chair.    Yes.  If you go to line…     Yes.    This line.    Yes.    I will try to – I will try to do that Chair.  517 Line 19.    I will just read to you what Mr Hlongwane told the PP in relation to who might have been present or not and I will do it quickly.   In order to save time I will read it.  From   Yes.    Because Mr Hlongwane says that Rajesh never came in it was not Rajesh.  And you say that it was Rajesh.     But I mean he appeared to be very sure from what I have read you know when he told the PP he was clearly sure that it was Rajesh – it was not Rajesh that came in and he saidthe reason why he knows it was not him it is because he has met with him before.    Yes.    Now let us also deal with another point that is not quite clear while you are still on that file and I am trying to move as fast as I can because the Chair have told me to wrap up this issue.  If you turn to page 724     Or maybe you can even leave that.  Goto 729.  That is the affidavit of Mr AJAY Gupta which was also submitted before this commission.  The relevant portion Mr Zuma is the one that appears on page 733.  If you can go to page 733.  A nd I just want to read paragraph 12 so that we can clear up what really happened and who was present.  Paragraph 12 Mr Gupta says to the following to the Chair. “I also gave evidence under oath to the Public Protector denying the allegations and the versio ns claimed by Mr Jonas and I also depose to an affidavit in the Minister of Finance application in the highcourt Pretoria which is self-explanatory.  I point out that it is highly unlikely that the meeting took place because if it did in the manner allege d by Mr Jonas he would immediately have reported it to the nearest police station as he – as any other ordinary citizen was legally obliged and duty bound under the law to do.” Now here is an affidavit which was deposed to years after the incident in question and Mr Gupta is now saying that he doubts – he say that I point out it is highly unlikely that the meeting took place.  I am sure that you do not agree with him.  I mean your version is that the meeting did take place?    Sorry.    I am correct?    Now there is this press release if youcan look at the date is the 13 March 2016.     Page 23 Chair.   23 File Number A.     File A Chair.    Page 23.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    It happens as we proceed in the day.     File A.    Ja A.  And go to page 23.  Concentrate on the red numbering.  I know that it might be confusing because these documents were used.   Yes.    Mr Chair for some odd reason mine – I do have the file – it was handed in as Exhibit C2 by Mr [indistinct].     Yes mine is 23 the legal team is 23 as well of Mr …    For a moment I was thinking that I am looking at different files altogether Chair.     Yes.    Yes.    Now this – this is the press release which was made on the 13 t h March 2016 and the essence of the meeting – of this press release I do not have to read it.  It was read    Yes that one liner.    Now was this correct what was conveyed by Oakbay on the 13 t h March 2016 that there was never a meeting at all?    With yourself, Jonas, Mr Jonas and Mr Hlongwane?   I think so Chair.    I was avoiding to do that.    Let us read it.     “Athol Gupta not even in the country on the 27 March faceless, perverse of this lies should produce evidence to support…”      We are moving...[intervenes].     You know respecting the time limitations I’m moving to Mr Dukwana.     Mr Zuma the last question I asked when I dealt with the issues of Mr Jonas whether or not did lay a criminal charge it was also put to Mr Jonas as to why didn’t he lay charges right, I’m just putting that to you.      Now let’s move on to Mr Dukwana, Mr Hlongwane when he was interviewed by the PP he told the PP that heused to frequent or visit with him to the Gupta residence…[intervenes].      The Public Protector yes.     And do you know whether Mr Magashule, you know, did also visit the Gupta residence?      There was no occasion where you met Mr Magashule at the Gupta residence?      And do you know Mr Dukwana?     You’ve never met him?     Yes, now may I refer you to the very small in comparison to the other files i t’s file number C – LLC Chair and I will try to be as quick as I can and if you may refer to…[intervenes].      I think that they were trying to assist the Chair with those files that you are not able to navigate through but now…[intervenes].     And we’ll be dealing with the documents from folder number two and I think that is the first folder and I was referring Mr Zuma to page 18 of t hat document. With particular reference to paragraph 52 and simply to save time Mr Zuma I will put to you what Mr Dukwana told the Chair when he testified there contained from paragraph9 52 to 59, let me read them so that you can react to them at once and teen I can pose questions so that we can be quickly he said that,“I was ushered into a room whilst Tony and Magashule went  to a different room.  After a while they joined me and  accompanied by other people and the notable was Mr  Duduzane Zuma.  Tony in the presence of Magashule asked  me to sign a document purportedly prepared by me on the  letterhead of my office addressed to Lulani Management  Services appointing them to run a whole project I presented  in the cabinet meeting on the 10 key bases, I r efused to  append my signature”,If I may pause Mr Zuma he says that when all these things were happening the were happening with you being part and parcel ofthat meeting and in your presence and he says that, “In the said letter my surname was written Dukwana, Dukoanaany Magashule knew that is how my surname is writtenbecause I always preferred and wrote it as Dukwana, and hesays Dukoana is a Sesotho version of my otherwise Xhosa surname.  In an effort to try to persuade me to append mysignature to the said letter Tony intimated to me that bothMagashule and Duduzane Zuma were recipients of monies incash from a mining project from Jakalsfontein Mine.  NeitherMagashule nor Duduzane Zuma disputed Tony’s claim theyboth nodded their heads in agreement.  Further Tony told methat Magashule would not benefit from the project because itbelonged to me and him (Tony).  Magashule did not disputeTony from this project, Tony told me that I would receive amonthly payment of R2million, I was told  by Tony that if Iappend my signature at the time an instant payment ofR2million would be given to me.  In this regard a gentleman  of Indian decent was called by Tony and Tony whispered  something, words in the language unknown to me.  The  gentleman left the room and came back with a black pilot  bag, this same bags frequently used by lawyers, I distanced  myself from that Mr Zuma and 57 it says, I still persisted that  I cannot sign the document to which Tony said that he had  spoken to Magashule tha t upon my signature the provisional  cabinet will gratify the appointment.  Tony then opened the  pilot bag which was full of R200 South African banknotes  stating that the money was mine if I signed the document.  Istill refused to sign, I went to the extent of suggesting that itbe prudent that the letter I was being compelled to signshould be referred to Mr Venter, Provincial Legal Advisor inthe office of the Premier to give a legal opinion about the legality of the contemplated appointments.  A fter thatsuggestion Magashule mumbles something to Tony to whichTony asked that I give him back the letter, I had intended tokeep the letter to refer it to Mr Venter”, And that is what Mr Dukwana informed the Chair and what is your comment on these issues?     Yes, when you say you are not sure, you are saying either you are not sure what he is talking about orwhether you don’t agree with what is stated in those paragraphs or that all of the things that he is saying in that statement did not happen at all?     Now piggy backing on what the Chair have, you know, canvassed with you, if I understand your evidence is that, when Mr Jonas testified about the offers which were made in your presence clearly your answer is that he is lying, that never happenedam I correct? MR DUDUZANE     Mr Chair the version is either you are correct or Mr Jonas is correct.     Yes, it can never be both of them thatare correct because you are saying that it did not ha ppen and he said that it did happen, is that correct?      Yes, Mr Dukwana also told the Chair about the offers and he says that you were present there was no uncertainty about him or about your presence at that meeting and you are also saying that he is incorrect, that did not happen?      Well it was put to him Chair and at least mine it’s not only premised on that event but when reading those documents again it was clearly…[intervenes].      And simply the point that I was makingwas that, now we are having two people, Mr Jonas and Mr Dukwana who are talking about the offers that happened in your presence at the Gupta residence and both of them, according to you, they are simply fabricating this evidence?     Yes, and I’m sure that none – myself and you would not be able to proffer any answers as to why would they really fabricate this evidence against you, we don’t know?      Okay, now you have provided with obviously the statement of Mr Dukwana to the extent that it implicated you in terms of Rule 3.3 am I correct?      Yes, and he did also have the opportunity to read it and also to decide whether or not, you know, to challenge that version or not, you did not, you know submit any version contradicting him nor did you apply in terms of Rule 3.4 at which that challenges his version and also to cross -examine him am I correct?      Yes, but if a person says that there were those, I mean, unlawful or illegal offers at least on the version of Mr Dukwana, that were made and he was made to sign certai ndocuments when in fact he could not have the authority to do so he was made to sign those things by individuals who were not even officials of the government, surely you know, in that meeting it was not a meeting where one does not actually attribute any  illegality on it, isn’t it?      Yes, now let’s move – Chair I want to move to Mr Sundaram…[intervenes].     Chair I’m told that we have now approached the lunch adjournment.    Seleke.    Chair I will try to move as quick as possible in order to short circuit the remaining issues which I wish to canvass with Mr Zuma.  Mr Zuma I was just about to move to deal with the evidence of Mr Sundaram.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Mr Sundaram used to work for Infinity and at a later stage Mr Duduzane he was the editor of ANN7, doyou know him?    In Midrand.    Now did you attend all of those meetings or any – or some of those meetings?     One of those   And the one that you attended is it the one where was it held?    And in turn Mabengela held shares in Infinity Media Networks, am I correct?    Yes.    If I put it the other – if I say that Media Networks –     Yes.  Now the idea of the TV stationwould I be correct that the person who was much more involved – I mean if I compare you and your father it was your father who was m uch more involved in the TV station than you?     You do not know about that?     Okay.  Now in the meeting that you attended was your father also present – the President?    So he was present?    Thank you.  Can I refer you to bundle C.   We are now going to deal with bundle C only.  You can ignore the other bundles.  If I may refer you to page 36 with particular reference to paragraph 9.  I just want to establish whether were you aware of these presentations or at what point were you inv olved with the TV station or your company conducting business with government through you know any of your entities.  Now in paragraph 9 Mr Sundaram says that  “I had earlier been told by Mr Atul Gupta to prepare a detailed presentation about all aspects o f the TV project for the President.  Three copies of this report were printed and bound by Aslam Kamal an employee of New Age and close confidante of the Gupta brothers.”Did you come to know about this presentation?     You are not part of it?     Now if you move onto paragraph 12 of    Sorry?    Correct yes.  And if you move on also to page 37 simply to verify certain issues with particular reference to paragraph 18 which simply identifies different role players.  Mr Sundaram says that the first meeting with Mr Jacob Zuma was attended by Mr Ajay Gupta, Mr Atul Gupta, Mr Nazeem Howa, Mr Moegasien Williams, Mr Ashu Chawla and Mr Arun Agawan and me.  I know that you said you did not attend this first meeting but maybe the last meeting.  When there was this studio visit were th ese individual also present?  To the best of your recollection.     Okay.  Now did you come to know whatwere their role in the TV statio n?    Ja.  No I am saying that do you know  what each role was – I mean was played by these individuals, do you know?    Can you tell us – can you share with us Iam sorry?    Yes.    If you can – slowly.    Yes.    I think you have jumped one n ame.    And then I am sorry Mr Ashu Chawla he was I think director at one of our IT companies yes.    Would I be also correct that you were co-owners with Mr Chawla in Mabengela?     And you – would I be correct that Mr Ashu Chawla was the CEO of the Sahara Computers the Gupta owned entity?    Yes.  And would I also be correct that you were a director in Sahara Holdings?     Yes.  To sum it up also would I be correct that you had close business relationship with Mr Chawla?     Yes.  Now can I refer you to page 39.  Paragraph 19.4 Mr Sundaram says that Ashu was the CEO of the Gupta owned Sahara Computers.  He had lived in South Africa for many years and was the Gupta’s point man for any co -ordination with the President and the South African governmen t.  He was particularly close to President’s son Duduzane.  Would that be accurate?     You are not close with him?     Okay.      That is fair.   And if I may refer you to page 56 – 56.    You only business relationship with him?     Now if I may refer you to page 56.     Yes it is 56 Chair.    56.    Yes.      25.17. “I later asked Nazeem why President Zuma insisted on lecturing us on editorial and personal matters.  Do you not know has not Lex Magee told you already he has a big say in this venture.  His son Duduzane holds 30% in the company.  His involvement is very critical to the first year of our operations.  If we are able to get government advertisement we will be able to break – we will be able to break even in the first year he told me.  If this were true it would explain alot and it felt as though everything was falling into place.” Can you confirm that you did hold 30A% of the company?    Yes.    Yes.  And then did the entity get any business from governmen t?    And then we can move now to paragraph 56 – page 56 Chair.    The very same page.    If – let us go to paragraph 25.18. “The news channel was heading would be a pro ANC pro Zuma channel that was promoted and run by not only people close to the President – to President Zuma but by President Zuma himself.  If Nazeem had his [indistinct] and Zuma held the shares through his son he would be projected positively in the news bulletins.  In this scenario I could see how he would use his position as President to ensure government advertisement – advertising for the station.  Theimportant part which I think is relevant is that  is also seemed if this was true that there was a clear conflict of interest as his son had a stake in not just Gupta owned newspaper but also a proposed TV – the proposed television news channel.”  And I am affording you this opportunity to comment on the  contents of that paragraph.    Which of the portions of that paragraph do you dispute and which ones are accurate?     Hm.    Yes.   Yes.  And then – that is the first point.  The second point is that you own shares or you have interest in the TV channel itself directly or indirectly, am I correct?     Yes.  The TV channel was getting business from government you have just simply confirmed that, that iscorrect?    Now would that not be any obvious conflict from the analysis of those facts?     Which I have just put to you yes.    No conflict at all?    You are saying there is no conflict at all?     Yes.  Now if we can move to page 56.  I want to move over from page 56 to page 59 Chair.  Paragraph 28.8 and I will read with – to you also paragraph 28.10 and 28.13  simply to – to    Yes.    yes.   I am simply putting to you what Mr Sundaram has actually told the Chair and to give you a fair opportunity to [indistinct] to it.  So your answer it is simply that you are not part of that meeting?     Yes, now to sum – to sum up what you have testified in regard to this paragraph, I understand you correctly to say that indeed you did meet him at Gautrain, you did take him to the Gupta residence, and he did meet a Gupta brother on the day in question, and had discussions yes.      Yes.        But he seemed to say, I mean from the paragraph that you have read that when you fetched him at the Gautrain he was not aware that you are going to take him t o the Gupta residence.    Yes, and I mean that is also you would recall that we also traversed that questioning in light of Mr Jonas, he also said that he did not know that he was  going to be taken to the Gupta residence and you say that is not true.      Yes, but you can take me to your house?     And not to the Gupta residence.    Mr Ramatlhodi and Mr Mofe.     Yes, however you are given a 3.1 notice.        You might have read their statement, both of them, I mean Mr Mofe simply confirming what he was told by Mr Ramatlhodi.        Then we can stay with Mr Ramatlhodi, do you need – do you wish to react to any of the  contents of his statement?        Yes Chair.   Let’s go to folder number – it should be 5 I think.  If you go to folder number five and you go to page 2, the relevant portions where your name is mentioned appears to be paragraph 2 to 11 and as requested by the Chair let mecontextualise them and simply you know by reading only those relevant portions.      So all these details that he is putting from these paragraphs he is simply imagining them, they never happened?        Paragraph 4, ...[intervenes]      If you go to the next folder, that is the statement of Mr Mofe, and if you turn to page 5, paragraph 4 he is now relating to the Chair what you now happened in relation to you as     Yes lastly Mr Chair I just want Mr Zuma to confirm if you go to folder number seven ...[intervenes]      Now folder number seven, just for you to confirm you see that the first diagram it is having a face right on the centrefold, can you see that and there are a number of entities, I have gone through them, I just want you to confirm whether were you the director or have you any stake in those companies, if you want you can tick them one by one or just take us through.        Yes.    If you can also do the same in relation to Mabangela.        Chair that concludes the questioning for Mr Zuma.     No, he ...[indistinct] just look at the company and whether he knows that at some point he was a directorand he can give us the timelines of it yes.      That will quite help.     I am done Chair. 
ZUMA:I gave my view, I gave my version…[intervenes].
