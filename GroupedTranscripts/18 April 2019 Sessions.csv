CHAIRPERSON: Good morning, good morning everybody.  Thank you let us proceed. Your mic.  Put on yours as well Maj or General Booysen.  Thank you.    And which block are we on today?     27 okay thank you.    Did you say …   Did you say page 15?     Okay.    H’m.   H’m.   I am sorry he – did he…    As far as you know did you – did he then send thatopinion to Advocate Mgwebe?     Yes okay thank you.    One can say that in the first paragraph  in that letter that document it is a letter from Advocate L S Mgwebe dated 9 January 12 addressed to Advocate W Miller at regional head CCU Durban and a copy sent to Advocate Mlotshwa acting Director of Public Prosecution Kwazulu Natal.  And in the firs t paragraph he says that his office that is Advocate Mgwebe received on 6 December 201 - it says 201 it must have been 2011 – must have intended 2011 his office received representations from the lawyer representing Colonel Madhoe in the abovementioned matters.  He then says a copy of the said representations is attached here for your information.  So it wouldappear that arising from some representations made by the lawyer for Colonel Madhoe he then decided to make certain enquiries.  Okay thank you.    Excuse me.      Well I am not sure why you think he – he should deal with that. Somebody a lawyer is instructed by an accused person and – and the lawyer decides to make representations.  If he are indeed the – is the lawyer who decides where he will or she will send those representations.  Even Advocate Mgwebe does he have a – does he have a choice of whether he receives them or not.  If they are sent to him they land on his desk, they land on his desk.      Well I am not sure you might know something that I do not know yet but an accused lawyer decides that on behalf of his client or her client he or she wants to make representations to the NPA. He or she decides to make representation to the prosecutor  or she – he or she decides to make representatio ns to somebody much higher up I am not sure that it is something that we really want to spend time on at this stage.    By whom – followed by whom?     Yes but if the accused person decides not to follow or does not know how does that assist us?  Or does not know what the correct procedure.  It is different if the point being made is something about Mr Mgwebe.    Is there a point that is sought to be made about Mr Mgwebe?    And what is the point?     Ought not to have been?    Well are we at the stage where they are being considered?  All I know is there has been – Mgwebe had received some representations and he is asking for comment from t he prosecutor.    Ja maybe otherwise maybe at some stage later maybe there might have – there might be a proper foundation for – for what you or Major General Booysen might have in mind but as things stand it does not appear to me that it is really something that one can make much point about representations being sent to a wrong person by anaccused lawyer.    That is assuming it is a wrong place to send them.     H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    H’m    H’m   Yes.  No it may well be I do not know.  It may well be that it was a wrong procedure.  It may well be that it w as a wrong place to send them to on the part of the accused’s lawyer.  I am just saying at this stage it does not appear to me that there is proper foundation for anything for us to canvass more.  Maybe when other aspects of MajorGeneral Booysen’s evidence have been dealt with we might come back to it if there seems to be something.  One – I do not know what the procedure is.  Do we know?  Do you know Major General whether there is a procedure set down in policies or regulations or the statute the relevant – the statute?    Ja.   Ja, ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja, ja.   Ja.    Ja.    Ja. Okay what we will do I think canvass other matters later on see wheth er there is proper basis to come back to the question.  Okay let us see whether the other evidence will provide anything.  One has got to bear in mind if there are no rules or statutoryprovisions or policies that specify where representations should be directed and maybe there is just a practice.  One must also check whether there is a discretion to refer or not to refer or whatever and what we want to make of it – what is sought to be made of it.    Ja.    I am sorry where is that?     92.  Yes thank you.    I think going back to w hat we were talking about and this is for later on if we look at the issue it may be that Major General you want to say nothing more than simply this that it was strange that this is how this – these representations were dealt with or that this is the person who dealt with them because the practice following and you – maybe you say no more than that.  But you will decide if you want to say no more than that or whether you want to infer something more.  Soyou – you can just – it depends what you have in mind.  So if you want to say something more than that it looks strange or something like that then you will say so and then we can – we can look at that and then.    To put it that – yes.    Yes.    Yes. Yes.    Yes. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Yes, yes.    Yes.    YEs.   Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes yes okay, okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you.     Yes.    H’m.   H’m.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Okay thank you.    H’m.    Ja.  There is – there is a limit to where – how far onecan go with matters which are based on what someone else has said and we just need to tread with care.     Okay.    Well before – I am sorry before we – we got there.  Advocate Mgwebe requested information from the prosecutor in the Madhoe matter and the prosecutor furnished a comprehensive responseat the end of which he said  there was an overwhelming case against Madhoe, Colonel Madhoe.  We should – we should – I want to know what happened – what decision if any was taken after that as far as you know and what happened out of those representations and so on, do you know?    Yes.  Tell me.    H’m.  But you do not – you do not know the circumstances you just know that the charges – there was a new provincial Director of Public Prosecutions and soon after – after that appointment the charges were withdrawn? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    That is what you know.    Yes.  Okay thank you.    Did you – I am sorry – did you ever enquire in one way or another from the NPA what the basis was for the withdrawal of the charges?    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    Yes.    Okay.  Ms September will direct you to that part of your statement if – when he wants to do that because it would be good to know.  And did they stay withdrawn – they have never been reinstated, those charges?     H’m.   Yes.    H’m.    Hm.    Late.  No that is fine.  That is fine.  Thank you.     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm and the police officers who were involved in arresting Colonel Madhoe who observed what happened in thebasement on the day in question have at all material times being available to give evidence.  I would imagine.     Obviously you have been available?     Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Just, you mentioned earlier on - and maybe Ms September was still going to deal with that but I just want to know now – you mentioned that you learnt at some stage that ap parently Mr Panday was bringing a review application in relation to the decision to reinstate charges.  Did you ever receive any court application papers as an interested party to see that indeed there was a review application and you had to deal with it?    So that matter has been – that review application has been pending as far as you know for - for how many years now or from when?    Ja.  Well I mean you mean the criminal matter or the review application?   Ja.    Huh-uh.    Oh, the criminal matter?     The review matter?    The review matter has been in court a few times .  Isthat what you are saying?     But you say it has been struck off the roll?     Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.  Okay, thank you.    Ja.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.   Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.    Yes.  So – buy you think it was after?    Ja, okay.    After the withdrawal of the charges.     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Meetings?  19 meetings?    Between the two?    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    By – and do you know who made the decision to withdraw this time?    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Okay, thank you.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    In court.  Hm, okay thank you.    Thank you.    There will be an N before the Y.    There is an N for Nellie before Y.  I think you omitted the N.  N-K-O-N-Y-E-N-I.   And Mabuyakhulu is M-A-B-U-Y-A-K-H-U-L-U.    Because it is here.  You can even just give the spelling yourself Ms  September.    Okay.    So he must have felt quite very – quite strongly?    Ja.   Yes.  Okay.    Yes.    I am sorry Ms September.  Let us – the two investigators went to see Advocate  Mrwebi?    Yes.    Oh.  Yes [intervenes].    Yes, okay.  They did – ja, the investigator plus the person from the forensic investigation team?     They went to see Advocate Mrwebi.   And Advocate Mosing.    Yes and the report you got was that the two advocates were saying that there was no evidence against Mr Mabuyokhulu and Ms Nkonyeni.     Ja, a verbal report that you’ve got ja.     Yes, yes, now what I want to find out is whathappened subsequent to that meeting, what happened to, is there any decision that was taken by Advocate Mrwebi and Advocate Mosing or pursuant to those views that they expressed according to what you were told?    It was a change of leadership?     And Advocate Mlotshwa had been acting Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions.    Yes.    Yes, and the replacement was it on an acting basis?     Yes, okay alright, thank you.   Mmm.  So he seems to have shared the view that  you mentioned earlier on that somebody said there was overwhelming evidence or was that in regard to the other case of Madhoe, I thought you said somebody, I don’t whether Mhlotwa or somebody said there was overwhelming evidence but I may be confusing the  Amigo case with the Madhoe case.    Yes.    Yes, yes, okay.  And from what he told you AdvocateMhlotwa was confident as well?     Yes, okay thank you.    The withdrawal of the charges against Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe it did also happen after Advocate Noko had replacedAdvocate Mhlotwa?    Yes, yes.    Madhoe, okay, thank you.    Yes. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Okay.    The prosecution has never been pursued even againstthose other accused who – against whom now withdrawal happened?     Oh, it’s proceeding against those.     Okay, okay.    Before you start with that just to go back on the Amigos case that’s been pending for a long time and did you say it was roundabout 2010 or thereabout when it started, as far as you know?     So certainly when you were appointed in 2010 it was already pending?   In the sense of it being under investigation with no appearance in court already, or do you think there had been appearance in court already by the time you were appointed?     Yes, ja, ja.    So to say the list it’s been going on you would say no less than nine years?    Or even ten years.  And as far as you know are  you able to say or maybe you are not able because you might not have looked at the evidence, are you able to say roundabout when as far as you know there was enough evidence for the trial to proceed?    Okay no that’s fine.  I do seem to remember that there may have been a case involving Mr Savoy, which went up to the Constitutional Court, it may have had something to do w ith ...(intervention)     Ja, no I think I remember that case because I would have sat in the matter, but that might be part of the reason for the delay in the finalisation of the matter if there was a challenge to the statutes that might be part of the reason for the delay.    A long time ago.    Yes, okay, thank you.  I think let’s take the short adjournment, and we will resume at half past ele ven.  We adjourn.    Major General Booysen yesterday I intimated that we might use two hours today to hear your further evidence.  Two hours would take us to twelve o’cl ock.  Is it fine with you if we go up to half past twelve?    Okay you – you said they came to you one of them was Mr Madonsella and who else was – was with him when you asked ifyou could make copies of those documents?     The documents that they came to show you were they documents that they had obtained by following your a dvice?    Oh okay.   Okay.    Okay.  Yes.    You made notes – you made notes    Yes.    H’m.    Is it 131 of Exhibit ZA?     Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    hm.    Hm. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I am sorry the instruction as you understood it from General Phiyega was that the docket that Brigadier Madonsella had in regard to this investigation should be taken away from him.     Yes Okay.    Would that amount to saying he must not continue with the investigation if that docket was taken away or there may have been different dockets he could still continue with the i nvestigation.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.  But now they were taken away from by whomand where were they taken to?  Do you know?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes okay.    Okay.    Oh okay.    Hm.    So he was much more experienced than the personthat was given the dockets?  So he was much more experienced than the person that was given the dockets?     Hm okay.  Okay alright thank you.      Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.  Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   hm.    Hm.   Hm.  How long ago was that when you handed that over to Mr McBride?    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Well he told us I think last week when it was – he was called for the first time Boss.    Yes but he did not say it was you it was somebody else.   Oh okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.  No thank you.    All you are saying is you found it strange that documents of witnesses that you – I mean statements of witnesses that you had seen which incriminated a particular individual were all now not there in the file when you saw it?  That is what you are saying.     Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm,  Thank you.    Who had investigated?    Yes okay.    Yes.    Hm.    The – I am sorry the – as you understand it the – the idea was that the Minister was unaware of what?     Hm okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So you say the source of the funding was the wrong source.  The amount expended was the wrong amount insofar as wrong amount that was paid by the state because it exceeded R100  000 and the procedure followed – you say – was a wrong procedure because this issue is supposed to be handled by the Department ofPublic Works and not through the Secret account?     Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Do you see he did not know that it came from the Secret fund account?    Yes, okay.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Hm.   Ja, okay alright.    Thank you.    I am sorry.  Just in case I miss something.  Going back to the investigation that Brigadier  Madonsela was doing.  Thedocket was taken from him and given to somebody else much junior to him and then at some stage you understand that the docket was sent to the IGI.  Is it the IGI?   The Inspector General and then when it came back there were no notes to indicate that any work had been done on it and is that how far you know about what happened with that investigation?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Oh, okay.  So I got some of these steps in the wrong sequence?    Okay.  I thought that when the files – docket was taken away from him that was after the – well when they were taken to - the docket was taken to the Inspector General that was before the 205s– he applied for the 205s?     So he applied for the 205s after the docket had come back from the IGI and then at a certain stage the docket was taken away from him and given to somebody much junior to him toinvestigate?    And has – and that is where the whole thing ended as far as you know?    Or stopped?    McBride yes, but Mr McBride would have been investigating the conduct of police officers in relation to thatinvestigation and not doing the actual investigation?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Ja, okay.  Thank you.  So for all intents and purposes as far as you know that investigation does not appear to have been taken further after the docket was taken from Brigadier  Madonsela and given to somebody else?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay, thank you.    Huh-uh.   Start it even if we do not finalise it.     Just use the time.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    To respond to the allegations?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    So specific instructions had been given that you be handcuffed?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    In the docket ja.   You know what it is.    So the review application succeeds?     Yes and the decision to charge you is set aside, wasset aside as a result of the review?     Yes.    Ja.    So what I am interested in is what was the actual order, the effect of the order in the review application?     Mmm, mmm.    Yes.    Ja, what’s the order, is the order a short order, is it a long order?   Ja.    It’s the order that I am really interested in.     Oh, and the prayers ...(intervention)     Ja, okay.    Okay now that’s fine.   Ja, okay.   Okay no that’s fine, I will have a look.  So the review application was successful, and after that the criminal proceedings against you arising from that were gone?     They were withdrawn in court.  That might be the convenient time for us to adjourn for today, and then when we resume then we can continue, but at least we’ve reached a point where you brought a review application, an d it was successful and the criminalcharges were withdrawn and then we can take it further next time.     Is that fine with you?    Okay alright, we are going to adjourn, we are not going to sit next week, we will continue on the 2 n d of May, so you can then continue with your evidence.  Is there anything Mr Pretorius wants to say?    Okay, alright, thank you.   Yes we will start at ten o’clock on the 2 n d of May, we will then adjourn.  We adjourn  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Good morning.  Yesterday Mr Booysen we ended your evidence on you telling the commission about Mr Toshan Panday and Colonel Madhoe having been arrested on criminal charges rela ting to bribery / corruption, is that correct?    We remain then to be with use of the timeline on Exhibit ZD page 3.      In that regard can I ask you to turn to page 15 in bundle ZA of your main affidavit while keeping this particular diagram page open.      So it is…    Page 15.    To start I know direct yourattention to paragraph 49 of your statement.  General Booysen following the arrest of Colonel Madhoe and Mr Toshan Panday are you aware of what transpired following the arrest?     Please inform the commission about what you know?    If I can then ask you to turn.    Apologies.    In that regard can I ask you to turn to Annexure JWB5 which starts on page 91 of that same bundle ZA.  This particular document is titled Internal Memorandum and it is sent from Advocate L S Mgwebe Special Director SCCU to Advocate W Miller Acting Regional Head SCCU Durban and cc is Advocate Mlotshwa Acting Director of Public Prosecution KwaZulu Natal.  It is dated on thefront page as 9 January 2012 and the subject title is referenced as Colonel Navin Madhoe with particularity to additional details.  Notwithstanding the date on this particular page if I  can ask you to just turn to page 94 – 94 of that same bundle.  There is in fact a date mentioned there though the 4 December 2011 and it is signed off byAdvocate L S Mgwebe or rather not signed off by Advocate L S  Mgwebe.  Is this the particular documen t that you were referring to?     Thank you.  Is it correct that this particular document concerned repre sentations that were made to his office as you have previously indicated?  MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Thank you.     Thank you Chair.  Can you just very simply explain what exactly does representations mean? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    In that regard can I then ask you whether or not Advocate Lawrence Mgwebe ought to have receivedthese representations directly from the a ttorneys of Colonel Madhoe.    Ja.  Chair, Chair this particular witness will be talking to the proper channels that ought to have been followed in this particular process.    By an accused person and in this particular instance.    That is…    The point is that through theevidence of General Booysen the representations ought not to have been considered.    Ought not to have been considered.   As it pleases Chair.  Can I – can I maybe just rephrase my question to the General instead?     As it pleases Chair.      General Booysen in your experience what was the proper channels to process the representation?    As it pleases Chair.  I have just got two quick questions in relation to this then.     If I can ask you to turn to page 92.  Can you read paragraph 2 into the record please?     Just – not the sub-paragraphs.    Just the top paragraph – first headliner.   On page 92.    Is it correct then that following on from the paragraph 2 there is a list of various points for analysis bythe prosecutor?    In that regard could I then also just highlight that paragraph 3 on page 92 asks very particular factual detailed questions which runs for at least one and a half pa ges, is that correct?    Then can I ask you to turn to page 96 of the same bundle.  It appears to be a document which is marked Memorandum.     Can you please ident – and it is dated sorry 22 January 12 presumably 2012.  It is an eight page document.  Can you please identify what this document is?     And is it your understanding that this was in fact the memorandum of response to the letter from Advocate Lawrene Mgwebe?  MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    If I can then ask you to quickly turn to page 103 and read the conclusion into the record?     Thank you.  Do you know what is the current employment status  of Advocate Manyathi?    Do you know whether or not whilst Advocate Manyathi was still part of the prosecutorial service whether or not he was promoted in any way?     As it pleases Chair.    During June 2012 there was a change to the encumbrance to the acting DPP p osition.  We are now on page…    Following the withdrawal of the charges can I ask you to turn to page 105 please?      Thank you Chair.  Just before the adjournment we were about to start on the next investigation that you were involved in and that takes us to page 19 of your affidavit which is in bundle ZA and in particular paragraph 62.  You have titled or rather named the investigation Looting of the Secret Services Accounts.  In very simple terms can you please explain what this investigation concerned? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Can I just interrupt you there for a second?  Is it then our understanding – is then your evidenc e sorry that you assisted Brigadier Madonsella?     In his investigation in relation to the KZN arm of the looting of the Secret Services Accounts?     So were you formally involved in the process?    Can I just at this juncture take you to page 131 of your affidavit please?  Not of your affidavit of bundle ZA.      Yes Chair.   Is it correct then that you do not conclusively know the reason for why the statements incriminating Richard Mdluli and other police officials were not included in the bundle of documents you received?     If I can then take you to pageof your affidavit and in particular paragraph 64.     So it is page 20 of your affidavit paragraph 64.  Can you please inform the – or rather your evidence in your affidavit focusses on one particular example in relation to the looting of the Secret Services Accounts?  Can you  please inform this commission of this particular example you refer toand why it – why this particular example was so important to highlight?     Where was this fence built?     Can I interrupt you there then and take you to excerpts of that Ministerial Handbook you refer to which is at page – starts at page 113.  Thank you.  Is it correct thatthese are extracts of the Ministerial Handbook that you were refe rring to?    Can I ask you to please turn to page 115 and read only the first sentence into the record?    In correction to your reading it is not Ministers but members.    Is that correct?  Can I then ask you to turn to page 117 please?  Is it correct that member at the top is defined to include a minister?    Is it also correct that National members means minister, a minister amongst others?  MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    And in the definition of private residence which is the sixth definition it is d efined to me in a privately owned house, is that correct?     And then at page 120.  Can I ask you to read paragraph 11 into the record please?    Do you know where the private residence of Minister Nathi Mthethwe is situ ated which benefited from the building of a fence?     Thank you.  And it is correct that your testimony was that the cost of the fence exceeded R100,000,00?    Ought the – or rather – where was the funds for the payment of the building of a fence ought to have secured from? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair.   Page – sorry block- we moving onto block 27.    To an extent I am Chair.    Chair soon after both had been arrested and had appeared the commercial crimes court in Durban the investigator officer alerted me that the prosecutor in thematter Advocate Bheki Manyathi had received a communicae from I do not know in what form – well I did not know at that stage in what form, had received a communicae from Advocate Mgwebe from the NPA head office.  He was I think the head of the commercial crime section  at the National Prosecuting Authority.    And he showed me a letter which Advocate Mgwebe had written to Advocate Manyathi.  The extent of the letter was basically interrogating why Madhoe had been – Colonel Madhoe had been charged or prosecuted.  There was onereference – in the - this communicae stating besides a scrap piece of paper what other evidence is there against Madhoe.  I think the scrap piece of paper they probably referred to is the note on which I wrote the date at the funeral.    After that Advocate Manyathi penned a detailed legal opinion comprising a number of pages setting out the extent of the evidence against Madhoe and he concluded his legal opinion by stating that he intends indicting Madhoe in the high court for corruption.    I know that he did do that Chair.    That is the document but I have it as Advocate Lawrence Mgwebe that is how he is known.     Chair I specifically mentioned this in my statement because Advocate Mgwebe his namewill crop up on a few other occasions later in my statement.     Normally if you want to make representations     Who was the head of the office in Durban.    Chair not in terms of statutes.  Not in the National Prosecuting Authority Act neither in the Constitution but the protocol that we have been following over the years.    The protocol is…     Go to the DPP.    In this instance he should have gone to the head of the office Advocate Miller     Then the DPP.  If they were still not satisfied then go to the NDPP.     And I do not have a problem with the fact that they had sent it directly to the NDPP’s officeto Advocate Mgwebe.    My concern is why did Advocate Mgwebe deal with the matter instead of referring it back to the DPP’s office/My concern is why did Advocate Mgwebe deal with the matter instead of referring it back to the DPP’s office.     The completeparagraph?    Okay.    Okay. “In order for this office to meaningfully respond to the said representations the prosecutor dealing with the matter must please ensure that the following is submitted to this office.”     That is indeed so Chair.    Chair I am happy to stay – to proceed.   The reason – and as Chair will see later on     There is a whole chapter that deals with certain prosecutors at the National Prosecuting Authority.    That were always invariably involved in these    And Advocate Mgwebe was one of them     So this was merely to set the tone    Where I started to experience     Some sort of I do not want to call it interference in this instance     But later – later on     It is clear to me that there was definitely interference.  So this is merely setting the tone     For what is going to happen later on when I discuss the prosecutors.    That is correct Chair.    Chair this is the response I referred to earlier on that was penned by Advocate BhekiManyathi the prosecutor in the matter.     Chair what I can say is I bumped into Advocate Manyathi at the high court in Durban during one of our appearances and he actually called me aside.  He sent someone to fetch me and we went around t he corner.  And he said tome General you know I am not happy with what is happening here he said to me.  Because at that time we were being prosecuted.  And he indicated to me that his stance in this matter had caused him to be overlooked for promotion.    And that he intended resigning from the NPA    Which – and I saw him a couple of months later on the beachfront and he stopped by and showed me his car that he had bought and he had told me that he had actually gone into private practiced.     So as far as I know he is currently in private practice.   Chair I am being – I am testifying now what I have been told by Advocate Manyathi.  He was short listed for a promotional post but after he had penned this legal opinion he was overlooked for promotion and either removed from the post or overlooked for promotion.  The indications were that he was going to be promoted.     And what I understood from him is that because of his stance in this matter he did not get promoted.    I do Chair.      Chair soon after this event a new acting DPP was appointed in KZN Advocate Moipone Noko and a month or two I cannot recall exactly how long aft er herappointment she withdrew the charges against Panday and Madhoe.     That is correct Chair.    The second thing is the investigating officer reported to me that she did – Advocate Noko did not want to return the docket.  So she kept the docket with her.     For quite a period of time.   Much later she issued a media statement and I do quote that in my affidavit Chair.     That she hadwithdrawn the charges in the interest of justice or words to that effect but that I do have the exact words.     Chair I do speak to that a bit later on in my statement.  What happened is about two years ago.    I – and in conjunction with a journalist had written a book about my what happened to me and the book had appeared online I think the Monday and I think that was the Thursday.    We were on our way to Cape Town to attend the launch of the book.    And then she told me that was now Jessica Pitchford we were both going to Cape Town forthe release of the book.  And she had just watched the – on the cell phone the news.  It was then announced by Advocate Shaun Abrahams that Panday and Madhoe would be prosecuted.  I had not heard anything about it again until much later when I bumped into another journalist in Durban Tania Broughton and she said to me she had seenthe lawyer of Panday and Madhoe at the high court and enquired from them what they were doing there and he then told her that they were – that they had filed a review application for the decision to prosecute them and that case referred specifically to the at tempt to bribe me.    It was a verbal report that I received.    Yes, and the way I’vearticulated that in my statement is that they went a long with the notion that the evidence was not sufficient to proceed against those two whereas du Plooy felt that there was enough evidence and that’s why he said to the Advocate it looks like you’ve made your mind up already.     Chair not by the two of them but there was a ...(intervention)     There was a significant change on leadership in KZN when Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa was unceremoniously pushed aside in my view and replacedby Advocate Moipone Noko.    That’s correct Chair the appointed DPP at the time was the current NDPP, Advocate Shamila Batohi who had then gone to The Hague and and to the International Court.    Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa was appointed as the acting and at this juncture he wasrelieved of his duties and replaced by Advocate Moipone Noko     Also on an acting basis Chair.    Chair exactly two weeks, exactly two weeks after Advocate Moipone Noko took up her post she would do the charges against only two people of a number of accused, Mabuyakhulu and Peggy  Nkonyeni, and I still asked I think it was Mr P du Plooy Colonel du Plooy how muc h evidence is there and I think someone still made the statement if she had really gone throughthe evidence that there was it would have been equivalent of reading a bible per day for 14 days.      No, no in the Madhoe case it was my view, in this matter it was the view of Lt Col du Plooywho reported to me.    He was confident that they had a strong case.    Absolutely Chair.    That is so Chair.    Yes Chair, within two weeks after Advocate Noko taking up a post as acting DPP she withdrew the charges against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.    And then I think about two or three months later she withdrew the charges against Panday and Madhoe.    Chair obviously the investigator is giving me feedback I knew who the advocates  were that were dealing with the matter so the advocate that dealt with the matterat that stage was Advocate Ndunjwa.     Chair as far as I know there was at one stage a review application in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg and I cannot recall who brought it, it could have been the DA, I don’t know what that was about, and I've also been informed by the investigating officer that Mr Gaston Savoy, I suspect that he wants to bring an application for a permanent stay of prosecution and Idon’t want to speculate, I’m merely talking from what  I’ve heard from the investigators because his argument is why are they withdrawing charges against those two and not against the rest of the accused, but I do not know the detail of that matter, but as it stands ...(intervention)     No I think it’s proceeding Chair against those.    That’s so Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    Chair I was appointedas the head of the Hawks in KZN in 2010, and I think that case when I inherited it with Du Plooy being the investigating officer it could have been a year prior to that, or even more, but I cannot recall.     That’s right Chair.    No Chair when I was appointed by then I can recall  they had the – all the accused sitting there in the box, there’s a newspaper photograph and that’s where the name Amigos came from.    So when I inheritedDu Plooy with his investigation that al ready appeared a number of times.    I would even say ten years Chair.    Chair when I – when Du Plooy came over to me from Commercial Crime what I did not mention is prior to them coming over to me I was a Brigadier in charge of Organised Crime and my counterpart for Commercial Crime was Lategan, Brigadier Lategan.  Now once every quarter or eve ry now andagain we had to – the two of us had now to go and give feedback pertaining to our investigations to the person who was then my immediate supervisor, Commissioner Pat Brown, General Pat Brown and I could recall, although I did not take much notic e of Lategan’s feedback but I could recall that there was discussions between him and Brown that they were getting questions from I think it was the Portfolio Committee, I’m not too sure because I did not really pay attention to his cases, because it didn’t concern me at that time, where questions were asked about the detail of the investigation, and I recall that Brown always used to say to Lategan just give them the necessary, the casehas been remanded, or still under investigation, but when I – when Du Plooy came over to me by then the investigation was complete and I say this Chair for the following reason, they were charged for racketeering ,now in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act I think it’s Section 21, you can only prosecute a person f or racketeering if there’s an authorisation by the NDPP, so the NDPP would not have authorised that investigation if it had not been completed, so in my view when Du Plooy came over to me with his investigation and having already having been – having appeared in court, as far as I’m concerned the investigation was complete.    No Chair I know aboutthat, Mr Savoy they applied to the Constitutional Court to say that certain aspects of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act were unconstitutional, I actually attended that p articular case at the Constitutional Court but I cannot remember the phrase but they say it was an academic argument, they should wait for such a case to come and then argue it.    That could be Chair but I think that matter had been disposed of ...(intervention)     About seven years ago.    Chair I am in yourhands.    Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Okay.    Yes.    That is right Chair.   No I was not Chair.    Chair there were three people well two of them I knew very well.  It was Brigadier Simon Madonsella and then there was another person as well as Lieute nant Zungu and they also had working with them a Captain Heerlal.  Heerlal was from Pretoria and Zungu and Madonsella originated from KZN.     No Chair.    At that juncture Chair they were all affidavits.    And some documents, police documents.    And Chair I made – I wrote down..    I made notes.  I wrotedown the name of each witness in that – of each statement that – that was filed in the docket.    So I would write down and if it was a police person I would write his or her persel numberdown so it would be easy to locate them afterwards.     And if it was a private person I would write his contact details down and then I would just write a little [indistinct] of the witness or person said in his statement.     Chair those are my contemporaries hand written notes a copy thereof.     I know his children,he know my children, he visits me, I visit him etcetera.      And he would frequent my office and they knew that I was assisting him.     And advising – not assist him but advising him.    In this particular matter.   This thing carried on about having these documents provided to him from Crime Intelligence.  So eventually he took up my advice and he applied for a Section 205 subpoenas which were granted.    And I recall him coming to my office and saying to me he is going to court now.  That particular morning the magistrate had made a ruling that they must submit the dockets and he was very excited that he was eve ntuallygoing to get those dockets to formalise his investigations.  And then the next moment he left for court and the next moment about an hour later he phones me.  And I said to him – we call each other Mfoytu.  I said to him Mfoytu where are you now?  He says, no I am on my way back to Pretoria.  I said, I thought you at court.  He says no when they arrivedat court a senior officer from Crime Intelligence had come to court and told the magistrate that there was an agreement of some sorts.     But it is not necessary any longer for the documents to be released.     So he phones meback from Pretoria and he says to me – he is very upset now because – I said to him what happened?  He says no when he arrived at Pretoria he went to General Mothiba’s office and he was told to hand over  all the dockets, all fifteen dockets to General Mothiba.      He then said to me Mothiba said to him well this is an instruction from the National Commissioner at the time Ria Phiyega, General Ria Phiyeg a.    And I think he stillsaid to me that Mothiba had told him he can clarify this with General Godfrey Lebeya who is the current head of the HAWKS.     So Simon got into his car according to him and he went to General Lebeya and GeneralLebeya confirmed that General Phiyega had given an instruction that those dockets must be taken away from him.  I recalled sometime afterwards I was in his…     That is what Madonsella told me.    Chair.   No.  No General – Chair it was taken away from him and that was not the first time.     Because on a previous occasion those dockets had been taken away f rom him and I cannot recall the exact details and it was sent to the Inspector General.     And I remember there was a fallout in the media about the dockets being sent to the Inspector General and now my view is the Inspector General cannot adjudicate upon dockets.  That has got to go to the prosecuting authority.  But be that as it may I think Simon told me it was either six weeks or threemonths that those dockets were – were with the Inspector General a nd they were eventually returned to him with not a single entry made in those dockets.  So he proceeded up until the time he applied for the 5’s and then he was called back and for the second time the dockets were taken away from him.    And according to him what he was informed by General Mothiba and General Lebeya that those were on the instructions of General Ria Phiyega.     Chair they were taken away – physically taken away from him.    And they were handed over according to Madonsella and a person that for a whil e still remained on the investigation they were handed to Captain Heerlal.     And I do speak about Heerlal a bit later on Chair.   Because there was some developments later on.    Which also becamevery suspicious to me.    But the point I am making Chair is that this is a high level inves tigation.  It is allocated to a Brigadier.    Who is doing what he has to do.  It gets taken away from him and then handed over to a less experienced investigating officer.     Chair I would say if you can – if I can draw a parallel Madonsella would have been like a SC and Heerlal was like a junior lawyer who finished university.     Chair I recall a while after that there was some investigation about those dockets.     And BrigadierMadonsella was visiting me at my son’s house in Pretoria.     And they received a phone call and I can understand a little bit of Zulu.     So – but I could hear he was very annoyed.  So he put the phone down and I said to him, what was that about Simon?  He said to me, no he was phoned legal services they now need a statement from him about what had o ccurred there.  And he said to me General I am gatvol and he told this person he is not going to make a statement.  I said but Simon make a statement.  He said but who is back me up?  I say I can guarantee you General Lebeya will back you up.  He says but I do not have Lebeya’s number.  I have him General Lebeya’s number I said speak to General Leberya.  So he phoned General Lebeya, the current head of theHAWKS and Lebeya confirmed with him on the phone that he will – he will support him.  He will make a statement that it was indeed General Phiyega who instructed that those dockets be taken away from him.     Chair then much later when Mr McBride came on board he got to know about those dockets.  So he approached me and asked me would it be possible for me to get hold of those dockets.  I said well look I can try.  So through my contacts I made enquiries and Zungu was also part of the investigation.  I do not know whether they approached Heerlal or be  that as it may hesaid no they will see what they can do.  And then a week or so later Zungu came to me with – with what was supposed to be copies of the dockets.      But when I saw himapproaching me I realised there was something wrong because I knew the volume of the docket before and what he – he was bringing to me on face value was less than I had seen previously.     So I went through the statements and compared it with – with my list and every single witness who implicated Richard Mdluli and a number of other officers all those statements were removed from the docket or from – they were not part of the docket.    I then made an affidavit describing as I described to Chair now the circumstances.  And I listed each witness and what they more or less said and I handed that with a copy of my [indistinct] notes to Mr McBride.     So I suspect that they still busy with that investigation Chair.     Chair I would sayabout eighteen months ago.    But in between I have been engaging with Mr McBride.    But between him and myself then we suspended, then he is suspended, then I a m back and then he is suspended again.  And then when he gets back I will enquire from him.  Then he tells me no things have gone missing out I will testify later on about an Exhibit.    That I handed to him in a very, very serious matter that after when he returned from work he phoned me and he said to me, he calls me chief and I call him boss.  He said Chief that exhibit.    No Chair we…    No we come from the same area in Durban.  He is from Wentworth and I am from Amanzimtoti.    So we grew up on thewrong side of Durban.    So he said to me hey Chief have you got – have you still got a copy of this – this recording?  And I said no I do and I said what happened to the one I gave you?  He said no while he was suspended when he got back it had gone missing.     So I – I do not know what happened to those fifteen dockets the investigations regarding that.   I have not spoken to him recently about that.    I do not Chair.  I can only speculate.   That is true Chair andsomething I omitted to tell you.  There were also correspondence which I saw in the dockets and it was correspondence from a General Godfrey Lebeya who at that time was a Deputy National Commissioner in which he gave certain instructions, those were copies of those instructions that there should be an investigation against Richard Mdluli and there were a whole list and I think I might have listed some of the names.     So everyone thinks he has left the police but in the meantime he is an agent.     So what they did with the – in the Secret Services Account they would appoint people likethat as agents.  Some of them I think so me of them had never even seen the inside of a police station but all of a sudden they now agents and some of them were promoted as far as I know up to the rank of Colonel and I know individuals that still hold the rank of Colonel who had been promoted in terms of the Secret Services Account.  So that ishow they abused it.    Sorry?    Chair one of the transactions that at some juncture had been investigated wa s a fence that was built around the residence of the then Minister of Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa to the amount of R195  581,45.      It was built around his private residence I think around about Empangeni Chair.  Now Chair at the time when the looting of the Secret Services Account surfaced it was reported that the fence had been paid for through the SecretServices Account, their funds.  And it common cause at t he time because it had been reported in the media that the matter had been investigated by the Auditor General at the time who exonerated the then Minister of Police.     The Auditor General.    But Chair in my view and I have – I am including documentation in my statement.     The understanding was that the Minister at the time w as unaware.    Now subsequent to that there was an engagement with …    So Chair if I can digress a little bit.  Recently there was a radio interview between myself and Karima Brown  from 702.    Where I mentionedthis and no sooner had I arrived home the Minister – the then Minister Nathi Mthethwe had made contact with Karima Brown from 702 and said to her that I am clasping at stra ws and I am basically – he basically said that I am not talking the truth.  So she invited me back to the studio the following evening because she said she would invite theMinister.  So I said – she asked me if I would come so I said well tell the Minister I will meet him the studio tonight.  I went back to the studio he did not pitch.  So they did a radio interview with him.  Now during that radio interview he once again said that I am clasping at straws and he explained that as Minister he was entitled t o security upgrades at his house in terms of the Ministerial Handbook.  And that the Ministerial Handbook says that he can get security upgrades to R100 000,00 and he was unaware that they overspent.  The point I am making Chair is I went and I had a look at this – at the Ministerial Handbook.  According to the Ministerial Handbook he is entitled.  TheMinister is entitled but it must be at his request number 1.  Secondly there must be a risks assessment and then thirdly the Department of Works will then deal with the matter.  And the Ministerial Handbook is clear it says security upgrades up to the amount of R100,000,00.     Any amount in excess of that will be for the account of the office bearer.     They are Chair.     “This handbook is a guideline for benefits and privileges to which Ministers and their families are entitled in execution of their duties.”     Sorry, sorry Chair.    It does Chair.    That is correct Chair.    “Cabinet approved on the 11 June 20 03 the following provisions of the above policy.  The Minister of Public Works may approve a state contribution of a non-recoverable maximum amount of R100  000,00 or the total cost of security measures not exceeding R100 000,00.  Should the cost of the sec urity measures be more than R100  000,00 the difference shall be borne by the Public Office Bearer.”      “Security measures may be implemented at Public Office Bearers private residences occupied on a regular basis in the areas other than Cape Town or Pretoria.”    It is in the area of Empangeni Chair.   That was my evidence Chair.
BOOYSEN :That is my interpretation of the document Chair.   Chair my understanding of representations are that if you as an accused feel that there are no – that there is no evidence against you or that there might be a prosecution for ulterior purposes that one could then bring that to the attention of the NDPP or in this particular instance I would have thought it should have been sent to the DPP and if they had not  had any closure that it would then be advanced to the NDPP.   In certain investigations.  That is my understanding Chair.  That is -    He was the prosecutor, this investigation had a number of legs there was one in t he Eastern Cape that I recall and we had the KZN leg, and Advocate Ndunjwa from the DPP’s office in KZN he was dealing with the matter, and I know for a fact that Advocate Ndunjwa also felt strongly about the case and after the charges were withdrawn the d ocket was taken away from him and handed over to Advocate Wimbane from the Commercial Crimes Court in Durban. Chair this investigation related to the abuse of the Secret Services Accounts.  The Secret Services Account is monies that must be utilised by crime intelligence for covert operations specifically for organised crime.  The Secret Services Account is not – is not being audited in the similar fashion as the open account is being audited.  Although there are committees at parliament that have – that has oversight over their budget.  But be that as it may some time ago and I cannot recall the exact period this – the whistle blower in this whole matter was a person by the name of General Mark Hankel from Crime Intelli gence who wrotea report about how this fund was being abused by individuals within Crime Intelligence.  And at the time I think General Dramat was the head of the HAWKS the national head and he appointed Colonel Kobus Roelofse from the Western Cape who I would describe as the Chief Investigator in the looting of the Secret Services Account.  Thatinvestigation pointed fingers towards the then head of the divisional commissioner of crime intelligence Luietenant General Richard Mdluli.  So that investigation had been going on for quite a while and I also know at the particular juncture within that investigation that General Shadrack Sibiya from Gauteng had also reopened the – an investigation into the murder of a person.  I think it was in Vosloosrus I cannot  recall exactly where – in which it was alleged that Richard Ndluli also had a hand in.  That investigation I am not privy to that investigation although a lot of reporting about that had been done in the media.  But where my involvement comes in is at a m uch later stage when this investigationhad been initiated the then acting National Commissioner at the time from the police General Mkwanazi.  I do not know whether he had been informed by sources within Crime Intelligence but he instituted a separate leg of investigations relating to the abuse of the Secret Services Account in KwaZulu Natal.  I had a Brigadier at some point who worked with me in KwaZulu Natal Brigadier Simon Madonsella.  He is not related.  I was – being asked the question but he is not r elated to Thuli Madonsella the Advocate.  So his wife had taken ill and he asked for a transfer to Pretoria which I arranged for him.  When he arrived in Pretoria one of the first investigations they allocated to him I think itwas allocated to him by General Mothiba was to investigate the case at [indistinct] of the looting of the Secret Services Account by Crime Intelligence.  I recall Madonsella coming to me expressing his frustration because Crime Intelligence failed or refused to make certain documents available to him to – to assist in the investigation.  So I –he would often come to me in Durban because we had – we were quite close and we are still close. And I would say to him, Simon the best way to get these documents is to – to 205 it and just for  – to explain 5 again.  It is Section 205 subpoena in terms of The Criminal Procedure Act whereby we obtain documents from institutions or individuals that can assist us in our investigation.  And he would continuously say to me no they promised they wou ld give it to him and then he would come back and say no they frustrating him.  And I recall at one juncture they came to  my house and they showed me the dockets and I asked Brigadier Madonsella if I could make copies of thedockets and he said to me no I cannot make copies of the dockets. And I asked him if he would mind if I take notes from the dockets.  He said no that is fine.    So Brigadier Madonsella got into his car and he drove back to Pretoria.   That is my understanding Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  As it pleases Chair.  I would like the witness though to clarify to us whether or not it was in fact wellwithin the right of Mr – of Advocate Mgwebe to consider the representations as he did?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  That is in fact the point Chair.    As it pleases Chair.    Can you please proceed then to just explain as you were explaining the order of what you had documented and the nature of its contents?     Can I then take you to page118.  This document is titled Annexure E and named Policy on Security Measures at the Private Residences of public office bearers.  Can you please read the first – the first line beginning with the word cabinet and then paragraphs 1 and 2 into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my experience and were a number of years and I have canvassed this with a number of prosecutors.   And I have extensively canvassed this with a number of prosecutors.     Chair I do deal with that extensively later on.    That is the media’s – that is right Chair.    “Earlier this year the provincial prosecution boss Advocate Moipone Noko instructed that the chargesagainst him and supply chain unit police Navin Madhoe involving an alleged attempt to bride KZN Hawks Head Johan Booysen with R2 million be provisionally withdrawn.  She said that while there was a prosecutable case she had concernsregarding “justice” based on representations which Panday had made and which needed further investigation.”    “But State Advocate Dorian Paver said the state could not proceed “because of problems regarding their preparation of evidence”.”     Chair I am not a prosecutor and I do not want to pretend that I am a prosecutor.     But I have worked with prosecutors.    For more than 30years.    After I joined the detectives more than 30 years ago.     I think I am in a position to more or less say when there is at least a prima facie case and a prosecutable case.  In this particular instance Chair every conceivable type of evidence is in that docket.     Physical evidence.    I.e. fingerprints.   Act 70 interceptions.    A 252A authorisation by the DPP.  Eyewitness statements how the money was put in the boot of my car.     There is even a banknote.    In the notes that linked with an account of Toshan  Panday.    The evidence was overwhelming.    But in spite of the overwhelming evidence.    The charges were withdrawn.    Chair every single witness from the.    Yes.  Every single witness.    Had been available all along. One witness unfortunately passed away I think now in December.     Len Sheriff.   But over and above that all the witnesses every single one of them are available to testify.     Chair I also deal with that a bit later on but I can answer you now.     What happened is I found it strange at the time that there is a review appli cation and I am not even aware of it.  I would have at least expected myself to have been a co respondent.  Subsequent to that I received a phone call from Advocate Mxolisi Nxasana who had informed me that he had seen the founding affidavit deposed to by C olonel Navin Madhoe in the review application and I cannot remember who favoured me with a copy.  Imight have gotten it through a journalist and I read the founding affidavit and the founding affidavit number one Madhoe lies under oath there because he says that he is a witness in the Cato Manor case which he is not.  He has never been on the witness list.  He has never been a witness but that is not the real problem.  The real problem withthe founding affidavit is that it is an attack on Advocate  Nxasana, an attack on myself, an attack on Mr  McBride from IPID.  According to the founding affidavit it was a conspiracy between myself and Advocate Nxasana to have them re-prosecuted and they also made certain allegations against Mr  McBride.  Now the fact that we were not co respondents I was expecting Advocate Abrahams to at least deny the allegations and ask us for confirmatory affidavits or at least inform us to make affidavits to support him in opposing the review application.  The review application was opposed but the fact that we were kept out of the loop tells me that I suspect it was a paper exercise but theynever intended prosecuting them but what had happened Chair I established about probably about two months or three months ago that the matter had been struck off the roll.    No Chair.  It was struck of the role now.    No – so they took the decision to prosecute by Abrahams.     On review.  That was – so they must have been informed two years ago when they decided toprosecute them.  They were going to take the matter on review.     So it had been in and out of court for a while and about two or three mon ths ago.    No the review matter Chair.    The review.    That is right Chair.    It was struck off the roll.    And my understanding is that Advocate Wendy O’Brien from the Commercial Crime Court in Durban they are preparing to now re -prosecute Madhoe and Panday.    For the attempt to bribe me.    But Chair at this juncture maybe I must just also make it easier to understand.    There are different cases.    That we probably – that I mention in my.    My statement.    The main corruptioncharge of R60 million.  That case was declined to prosecute a good couple of years ago.     And when I eventually went back to work after my suspension was lifted.     I wrote to the then new NDPP Advocate Nxasana.   Giving my views on those charges.    And he had appointedAdvocate Gerrie Nel.    At the NPA Office to review all those – all those cases.    My understanding is and once again I am not officially being informed of this.     My understanding is that and this I also learnt through the media.    When it – when it was reported that the review matter for the criminal case of attempted bribery had been struck off the role the journalists then approached the National Prosecuting Authority to ask them why are they now not proceeding with that matter and the answer they got was well they are waiting for the – for the other matter as well. That is the  60 million one.    So that matter had also been taken review.   So in my view the attempt to bribe me can proceed without t he other matter.    That is still under review.  Chair what had happened is on and off there were attempts to have the 15 million released.  Fortunately for myself and unfortunately for Mr  Panday I had someone from our Financial Department who would tell me there are moves afoot to have the money released.  They devised a number of strategies.  For instance they tried to have the money paid out of National Office.  They were communicating directly to National Head Office.  I do not know whom at National Head Office and at one stage I had asked this person and I do not even want to disclose the – the gender of this person because that person would be ostracised.    At one stage I had been informed – I had asked this person is it possible to have money paid out at National Head Office if it is a Provincial matter.     And I was informed it was indeed the case.  So between myself and the Head of Finances at the time Brigadier Kemp.    We agreed that that person would go in at night and check on the system.     Because it would be logged at night.    And then it would be paid out the following day.    So for a protracted period of time I had this person going at night to see if it  was loaded.    On the system and if it had been.    I would have beencontacted.  So that I could prevent the money.    To be paid out.    I also approached General Ntanjana at the time.    The one that passed away.  And I told him because I know that there - and I managed to get hold of thecommunication between his office and our Legal Department and it was clear from that that they were contem plating paying out the money.    And I told him – I said to him if you guys are going to pay out this money while it is a subject of a corruption investigation you are going to make yourselves guilty of corruption as well.    But Chair that.    What then happened is I get a frantic call from a person – well in our engagements with Mr Panday’s lawyers they threatened me with all types of things and I told them well let us go to court then.     If you can prove that the state owe you the money.    I will be happy to release the money.    And then it was on 1 January.  I cannot recall the year.  I got a frantic call from a person by the name of Captain Stevens.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Chair I suspect it was after.  I will just have to check the timeline.     There were so many.    Events happening at the same time and some of them I only learnt about afterwards.     I think it was after Chair.    I think after they were withdrawn.    Chair so I got thisfrantic call and I recall vividly I was at the dam on the day.  It was 1 January with my family and when I left the dam – when I had reception on my phone again I saw I had a number of missed calls.  So I phoned the person back and it was a Captain  Stevens and he told me that he had been approached by Mr  Toshan Panday and Toshan Panday wanted him to assist him to have the money released – the R15 million.    So Toshan Panday devised a strategy or a plan to have the money released.  So he said to Captain Stevens you from police side you must create documents and Iwill create invoices.  So he was going to create invoices for R15 million.    But you cannot just send invoices if there was not a service required from the police.    So he said to Stevens you must fabricate.    Call up instructions for policeman.    During the soccer – World Cup Soccer period.    And then I will do invoices.  To match those figures.    Then we can present it and then the idea was then that Booysen would b e happy to release the money.  I immediately on 1 January phoned Captain Pelser once again.  I said to him get us 252A authority which he did and I told   Chair my understanding of 252A authority it is the Criminal Procedure Act.  It authorises an ostensible illegal act.     And we normally use those in sting operations.    So Chair we had this 252 authority and having had experience of how they operated I called in the investigators and I said to them you need to do – not that theyhad not done it previously but I wanted to ensure that everything was done according to the book.  I enlisted the assistance of Crime Intelligence and there were  subsequent meetings between Mr Toshan Panday and Captain Stevens.  There were probably about 19.  Of the 19 about six.    That is – that is correct Chair.   Between the two.    So we had Stevens wired every time he met Panday.   With a camera.    And a recorder.    So the recordings were audio and visual.    So there – over these number of meetings 16 of them were  recorded audibly and visually.   At one stage Stevens had a problem switching on the camera and.   That particular meeting was not recorded.    But every time that they met he would report there before the time to the investigators.     It would be reported to the DPP dealing the 252A.    And during some of these meetings Panday was getting anxious becue Stevens was workingtoo slowly.    And Stevens was making excuses by saying well there are people  who need to cooperate from supply chain management.  So Panday at one stage gave Stevens R2 000.    As a bribe to be paid to one of the people at supply chain management.     But Stevens came back with the money.  We took the money.  Put it in an exhibit bag and it was kept as an exhibit.  At a subsequent meeting Panday once again complained that Steve ns was taking too long.  So Stevens said to him well look some of these documents have to be signed by a Brigadier.    Now the person incharge of deployment at the time was a Brigadier  Vernon Hunter.    So Madhoe says to him but you have to – well then you have to forge his signature.  Now Chair there was a previous matter completely unrelated to this thatPanday had been involved in but completely unrel ated to this.    It was a civil matter in which he had put in false claim.    And the – when we did the Act 70s we picked up on the Act 70s that a coupl e of million Rand was going to be paid out to him.     And that there was aproblem with the claim.  So we enforced – informed the insurers and in that particular instance what he had done was he had cut a nd paste the signature of.  Of a deceased person.  So he tells Stevens when you forge these signatures do not cut and paste.  You must make different ones.     So it looks authentic.    We then went to – as part of the 252A operation went to Brigadier  Vernon Hunter and we told him look this is what is going on.  Your signature is going to be forged.     Which he agreed to.   On the particular day that that was done we had the LCRC.  That is the local fingerprint office come to – to the office.    And in their presence each document that had been created by Stevens was photographed before the signature was.    Placed thereon andthen afterwards.  And Hunter was present as well where his signature was forged as part of the 252A operation.  Chair what also happened is in this process Panday was getting quite frantic because Stevens was taking too long.  So Stevens said to him well you know I have to print this stuff and Panday then – they were close to Gatewaythen.  I cannot remember whether he had gone there himself.     Or sent someone to buy a – a computer and a printer from Dions and he gave him the whole bag with the computer and printer and everything with the receipt stillinside there.    So Stevens came back and he handed that over to us as well.  That was also handed in as exhibits.    Chair this continued for a period of time and eventually there was enough evidence.     To arrest Panday onceagain.  He was arrested eventually.    He appeared in court but unfortunately that case ha d also been withdrawn.    Chair this time I thinkthere might be – and I do not want to cover me up for the prosecutor.     But I think there might be a little bit of a valid explanation from the prosecutor’s side.     To give them the benefit of the doubt.    A number of these recordings had to be transcribed.    And I think it was a White person who had done the transcriptions and.     There if you do notlive in Durban and if you do not know the language how the Indians talk you might.    You might get it wrong.  So because I could see from the transcriptions it was an Afrikaans person.    Who had transcribed it.  So the prosecutor was not happy with that.     What subsequently happened to that case it was sent – at a later stage I will talk about that as well.  They were provisionally withdrawn by Advocate  Dorian Paver.    Chair much later when I – and I will speak to this later on.   When Mr McBridestarted investigating all these issues.     I handed the docket over to IPID.    My understanding was that they had – and I speak under correction – that they had the recordings transcribed again - once again.    But to date no onehas appeared in that matter.    Chair before I respondto that I just want to add when the invoices that Panday eventually created the understanding is that we owed – well according to him we owed him R50 million but if my memory services me correctly the invoices that they eventually created amounted to R70 million.  Chair as far as I am aware to date that R50 million has not been paid out.     Chair what happened is when – when the Hawks were established they combined Commercial Crime, Organised Crime and the Scorpions.  That was an interim arrangement and they then formed the Hawks.  So I inheri ted - for lack of a better description – the investigation from the Commercial Crime Section.  There was this one investigation that was known as the “Amigos” case which related to the fraudulent acquisition of waterpurification plants for hospitals.  I k now in KZN and a few other provinces as well.  There were a number of accused.  One of them – a prominent accused in this matter was a Mr  Gaston Savoi.  I think he was a Bulgarian businessman and he was charged inter alia with two politicians – Mike Mabuyakhulu and Peggy Nkonyeni.  They were bothpart – members of the legislature in KwaZulu-Natal at some time or other.    Nkonyeni is N-K-O-Y-E-N-I (spelt) and.    Sorry Chair.    So Chair they were among the accused – Mr Savoi and Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  What happens on a monthly basis - I will call the investigators and then theyhave to give feedback es pecially on the high profile cases and the investigating officer in this particular matter was Lieutenant Colonel Piet du Plooy.  So the investigation had already been in an advanced stage when Du Plooy came over to me.  So I was not privy to the extent of the evidence in the docket but nevertheless ChairDu Plooy then reported to me that the then Acting DPP in KZN Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa there was pressure on him to withdraw the charges against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  So I said to him Piet what does the evidence look like and he said to me no sir there is – there is a solid case.  I never – I never physically checked the dockets but he assured me that there was a solid case and I said to him what is the position of Mr Mlotshwa in the matter – Advocate Mlotshwa and he said no Mlotshwa is proceeding with the matter.  He is – he is going ahead full steam.  So I was happy with that.     I am aware Chair.    If my memory serves me correctly it was also Pricewaterhouse Cooper.   Chair Colonel du Plooy had reported to me at some stage that he and one of the forensic auditors had been summoned to Pretoria by Advocates  Mrwebi and Mosing and the meeting was about this particular investigation and I can recall when they had come back that Du  Plooy was unhappy.  I didnot go into the detail of the – of what had occurred at the meeting but they conveyed to me that when they arrived there that it was clear to them that there was a notion that there is no evidence against Nkonyeni and Mabuyakhulu and I think it was Du  Plooy who still said well to either of the two advocates – either Mosing or Mrwebi.  It looks as if you have made up your mind already to - to not proceed and he basically excused himself from the meeting.     He did Chair.    Du Plooy did feel strong about it.    Ja Chair that – that was when I became the Head of the Hawks in 2010.     No Chair.  It was theinvestigator Lieutenant Colonel  Piet du Plooy.  And the forensic investigator from the audit company.  I cannot recall.     Who that person was.    That is correct Chair.    And Advocate Mosing.    Anthony Mosing.    As far as I’m aware it’s still on the roll.    So Chair that is basically what I did.  I made a short praisee of what each witness said and I kept those notes. It was common cause in KZN especiallyamongst the Crime Intelligence Fraternity that Brigadier Simon Madonsella and myself were just more than colleagues we were actually personal friends.    So whether it was taken out by Heerlal or whether it was taken out by someone else I do now know but every single statement that incriminates Richard Mdluli and other senior officers were sanitized from the docket.     Of where – that the money had come from the Secret Services Account.   Chair it is my understanding that it should have at least have come from an open account and not from the Secret Services account.  That is the first call.    Secondly it should have come in my view from the Parliamentary Budget.   Or then secondly the police’s budget.    Via the Department of Works.    And then the Act says I think it is R193 000 should have been borne by the officer bearer which was the Minister at the time.    Those are the points I am making but there is one extra point I would like to make Chair.   During the conversation with Karima  Brown on 702.  The Minister attempted to justify the building of the fence around his house which I do not have a problem with.   But he at least now knows that the money came from the wrong funds.  I  do not know whether any attempts were made to.   Reallocate those funds and get the funds from the proper budget.   And whether any attempts were made to – to repay the R90 000-odd.   Which was in excess of the R100 000 that he was entitled to.  That is my understanding of what – what came out of the Auditor-General’s report at the time Chair.    That is the date Chair.   Chair can I just get the sequence right?  Madonsela wasinvestigating.    And then when he started probing.    The dockets were taken away from him and sent to the Inspector General.   I think it was Faith Radebe at the time.    There were quite a lot of complaints in the me dia about it.    Then it was either sixweeks or three months later.    The dockets were returned to Madonsela.    Simon Madonsela.  With no entries whatsoever been made.  So they were basically like there for that period of time without any progress whatsoever.    He then continued with the investigation.    Sought my advicewhich I gave him.    Came to my house that is when I made the notes.    Eventually applied for the 205s.    They were authorised but when he went to court to now get the documents he was recalled toPretoria by Jona Moteba.    Dockets were taken away from him and then handed to a junior member.     Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Until I.    That is where it stopped Chair until my affidavit to with my notes over to Mr  McBride.    Chair not really.  What happened is when McBride came on board.     When he phoned me and asked me what was going on and I gave him a – described to him what was going on and he asked me for a report which I did the same evening.    And he immediatelysent an investigators down and.    He set the wheels in motion to have all these investigations.    Which had become dormant to.    To rekindle them.    And while we were having these discussions he still joked and he said to me watch I will be the next one to be suspended.    And I said no they willnever suspend you because you – you have – you have got the right credentials and lo and behold he was eventually suspended.     Chair according to me those dockets have gone nowhere.    Even whilst being atIPID.    I am alive to what has happened at IPID with Mr  McBride.    His suspensions and trying to keep him out of his job.     So there were other investigations also that we communicated with – to each other.    That I know- and he expresses his frustrations at some points and I will perhaps talk about that later.    That when he gets back from suspension things had gone missing.     People from his office had been suspended or fired.    So what happened to those dockets.    I really cannot tell youChair.    (No audible reply).    Chair after I had arrested Colonel Madhoe or had him – caused him to be arrested for the attempt to bribe me Chair would recall that he had shown me some photographs.It was in early December 2011.  Major General Deena Moodley the Head of Crime Intelligence atKwaZulu-Natal came to my office and he said to me that there were two reporters from the Sunday Times - Stephan Hofstatter and Mzilikazi wa Afrika.    The way he describedit to me it sounded like he had actually been part of this meeting.  That is now General Moodley.    And that they were going to run a story that Sunday that I am basically the head of a death squad.    That this one unit that ultimately reported to me – Cato Manor – had committed extra judicial killings and that I was the leader of the so cal led death squad.   And they were going to phone me - I think he said the Saturday evening for my comments to basically catch me off guard.    And then proceed with publishing the story the – the Sunday.  I immediately asked – immediately asked my attorney Mr  Carl van der Merwe to contact the then editor of the Sunday Times Mr  Ray Hartley.    To ask him that we want in terms of the audi alteram partem rule.    We would like a proper opportunity to.   To explain what.    What the.    That is right Chair.    Which they agreed to and then I think it was on the Wednesday – following Wednesday – Mr Stephan Hofstatter arrived at my office and wa Afrika was not thereand he dialled in and so wa  Afrika was on the line.    And they started with all the allegations and we had a long discussion and it made it clear to – to Mr Hofstatter that the photographs that they had which I had seen some of them were not even scenes where Cato Manor had been involved in.  One particular one which was eventually published and I think it is one of the most gruesome ones was spread over almost half a page of a number of people who had been shot dead on a light delivery vehicle and I indicated to him that look the photographs thatyou guys have not all those people were shot by Cato Manor.  They then came with a story that – and this eventually becomes the nub of one of the complaints against me Chair.  They said to me that their information is that in a shootout in Howick on the – on the freeway.  I cannot now actually recall if it is N1 or N2 – that I was in a policehelicopter and that I basically blocked the vehicle and my guys came and shot the people in the car almost like in the movies.  So I said to them look you have got a version.  I have a different version.  My version is I was sitting in my  office at that time.  I only heard about it afterwards.    And I then went to the police’s air wing and where I took the police chopper and I only arrived there quite sometime later.  I said what you nee d to do is to establish the objective facts.  Just go to the police’s air wing.    And find out what time they picked me up because it is all logged in the helicopter’s logbook.  They also then indicated to me that they had interviewed Mr  Madhoe.    Who by now is an accused.    Who accused me of all sorts of things and that he was – according to Madhoe he wasactually investigating me for atrocities.     Which I thought was a joke because he is from supply chain management.  I do not even think he can investigate shoplifting.   And I said to – and Madhoe accused me of not handing in the exhibits to the police’s exhibit register and I said to him – I looked out of my window – I said there is the police station – Durban Central – go and ascertain the facts.  Chair it was clear to me that the nature of the conversation they had already written their story and they are not going to change it.     Which they did.  They following week on 11 December 2011 the article appeared – big heading“Shoot to Kill” and I still phoned General  Dramat my immediate head.  I said to him look this thing is in the paper.  He advised me a day or two later that he would be appointing General  Jan Mabula from North West and also two other Generals – General [indistinct].  I cannot recall her first name from the Eastern Cape and General  Lindsay [indistinct].  I think she was from one of the other provinces – just to come and investigate the articles in the newspaper.     But Chair a couple of days later only Jan Mabula arrived at my office – General Jan Mabulawith a Colonel Manu.  Colonel Manu I later – he has since passed away – I established that he was actually of torture in a diffe rent matter in the High Court here in Gauteng.  So I said to Mabula – Jan – I said Jan because I was expecting him to investigate.  So I said look I will make my office at your disposal if you want to use my secretary of typewriter– have anything typed or make photocopies and I also instructed whomever at my office to cooperate with Mabula.     He departed and then – that was just before Christmas.  He said no they will be back after Christmas.  So after C hristmas they come back again but they are very evasive Chair.  I mean we are colleagues.  We are generals together and I have done him favours in the past.     But all of a sudden heis – I could just sense that there was something and I could not put my finger on it.  Then later on I get a call from one of my – the same Warrant Officer Mostert who had engaged Panday and he said to me General one of my informers phoned me and they had been – the informer had now been approached by some of Mabula’s team and they are putting pressure on them to make certain statements.   That was also reported by Mostert to Colonel  Hoosain and Hoosain still wrote a letter expressing his concern that the informer had now being exposed.    But then something else happened Chair.  The San  Zungu who was involved in the – in the looting of the Secret Service’s account investigat ion he was now with Crime Intelligence.  So I receive a call through a colleague of minesaying that Zungu wants to see you.  At that time I was very suspicious about what was happening.  So I did not know what to make of - because I had not seen for quite  some time.    So I said to this colleague of mine tell Zungu to meet me outside Kentucky in Amanzimtoti.  So I drove out to Amanzimtoti and I – because I did not know what the purpose of the visit was I decided to record the conversation but Zungu was a bit – he was faster than I was.  So he was waiting under a tree while I was sitting in the car busy preparing toget the recorder right.  The next moment he knocked on my window.     So I said Zungu jump in the car.  So he said to me General I have got a serious concern.  I said what is wrong Zungu.  Now since that day Zungu’s name is Kentucky.  I call him Kentucky.  So I said to Zungu what is the problem.  He says to me no General Mabula’s detectives who are now investigating the so called extra judicial killings had called him to their hotel where they were staying in Durban.  In one of the cases where it is alleged that Cato Manor had done – committed an extra judicialkilling was the shooting of a person by the name of Bongani  Mkhize.  Zungu was the investigating officer in a different matter where Nkosi Zondo was murdered and which suspect had been sought and Mkhize was one of the suspects been sought fo r the killing of Nkosi Zondo.   So – and he had made an affidavit in one of the dockets that – that Mkhize was been sought.    So they tried to get him to change his statement – Mabula’s team tried to get him to change his statement.    And he refused and he says when – he says eventually he just said look his – I amuncomfortable what is going on here now.  He is going to excuse himself.    And he said almost like in a – it was like a veil threat.  We will be back.     And that is when he left and he decided to come and inform me.    Chair I then started towonder what is going on here.  They are supposed to be objective in their investigations.    Now they are trying to get people to change statements.   They are going to informers.  I think that recording might still be available where one of the informers had a second meeting with them which we re corded.    So they were putting pressure on people to implicate detectives of Cato Manor in wrongdoing.  Then I received a strange phone call from a journalist.  I cannot recall her name.  She was from a television station and I recall at one stage she also spoke on CNN but not about our case.    But she always used to come and talk to us in Durban and then she said to me General I believe they are going to charge you for racketeering.  So I said to her you must be joking.  They do not know what racketeering is because I have been trained in racketeering by Michael Johnson from the US.  I have been trained by prosecutors.    Here in South Africa.  They surely do not know what racketeering is.    So Chair so this whole thing carried on and on and on and then on one particular day I was informed that Mabula and his team were done here to arrest some of the Cato Manor guys.  So I told – I phoned Colonel Olivier who wastheir immediate Commander and I said to Willie get the guys together.  They are going to arrest them.  Let them hand themselves over.     So they all went to the office and Carl van der Merwe the attorney then phoned Mabula and said we understand you want to arrest the guys and Mabula and them denied it initially.  Some reporters would phone the m because the reporters now had got wind of this story and they could see the activity at the one hotel that they were staying at but they all denied that they were about to arrest the Cato Manor guys but they remained at theoffice throughout the night an d then early that morning some of the detectives of Cato Manor’s wives started calling in to say look there are armed police outside the house here and – so they all decided to go home and as they went home at or about – most of the instances the media was already waiting there.  They were arrested in full view of the media.  They were then taken to a central point at the airport – at the police’s air wing where they were paraded in front of the cameras.  Chair subsequent to that they had to reappear in cou rt in August.  I think they appeared in June – June or July.  They had to reappear in August.   That was 2012.    Chair I get this callfrom a – he as then Colonel Barraza Ncube.    And he says to me General can I see you but by then I had gotten uncomfortable and I had written to Mabula and his team.  We had written to the Prosecuting Authority.  If they want to arrest me by all means.     I will present myself wherever you want me.    And we did that on more than one occasion.    And on this particular day I was driving in my car and I received – I got a phone call from Colonel Barraza Ncube.  He said to me General I would like to see you.  So I said to him well do you want to arrest me.  He says oh maybe.  So I said to him well it is not a joke.  If you want to arrest me tell me.  He says no he has got a warrant for my arrest.  I said fine.     Where would you like me to meet you.  So I suggested we will meet at my office.     Drove back to my office and I sat there in my boardroom.  Then I went to all my staffbecause I did not want them to come barging in there and.     So I called all my staff and I said look this is what is going to happen.     So do not be upset and go back to your offices and carry on with your work.  About 20 minutes later I phoned him I said I am still waiting for you.  He said no they are coming now.  So in the meantime I got a phone call from a member of the Special Task Force.   Now the Special Task Force are people who deal with terrorists and hostage situations and I happened to work with these guys over years.  They all knew me.  So he said to me General we are on our way to come and arrest you.   I said no I know.  I am waiting for you guys.  He said but we have got instructions to handcuff you.  I said well then you have to comply with your instructions.  And then a fewminutes later they arr ived at my office in the boardroom.  By then I had summoned my attorney.    Yes Chair.   Yes.    So they arrived there with the Special Task Force in their camouflage and I sat in my office and Brigadier Ncube sat across me and he showed me the warrant of arrest.  I said well I am entitled to a  copy.  He gave me a copy.  I then asked him for a copy of the founding affidavit and he did not even know what a founding affidavit was.  I had to explain to him what a founding affidavit was.  Chair it was actually a farce the way I was arrestedbecause it looked like I was arresting him because I was taking all the notes and he was just sitting there.  It was clear that he was under instructions and after the formalities had been concluded he said look they have – we have to go but they have to handcuff me.  So I said to him Colonel you have got the Special Task Force.  These youngsters are fit and strong.    I am much older than them.  I mean – surely I do not pose a danger.  No, no, no they have got to follow rules.  I said well then do what you have to do.    They then took cable ties and tied my hands in front of me and then they escorted me out of the lift.  The cleaner was still there and the clean er often comes to my office.  I give him some of my sandwiches and he looked at me – whatis going on now.  We got into the car and we drove to my house and I looked around and there was an entourage of media people following us.  So they obviously altered  the media as well.  We arrived at my house.  My domestic she is used to that I bring people home and she always offered them water and she still offered them water, but when she realised no there is something else going on she got nasty with them.  I said no Dorothy [foreign word] and stay calm.  Chair we went to my – they ransacked my house.  I do not know what they were looking for and then at some point Ncube says to me where is your official firearm.  I said you see Ncube you are only interested inembarrassing me by handcuffing me in front of the people and dragging me out of the office.  But the most important thing you should have done is to look where my firearm is.  So I lifted my – my pants and I said there is my firearm.    And he still said you could have shot us.  I said exactly.     And then I handed my firearm to them but I first said to them I want them to take a photograph.  Which they didbecause they had the police photographer there.     And I said I want to see the photograph and I had a look at it and I could not see my bathroom in the background because I wanted to use that photograph.  I had to ask them to take another one which they did.     And then Chair we went to the air wing.  Chair I have – I am one of the police officers that have probably flown – who is not part of the air wing – that hasprobably flown the most in the police helicopter over the years.  The police air wing is a secure place.  It has got a probably a four metre high fence.    When you enter there you have got to buzz and they look at you and they identify you.  They open this huge gate and then you proceed.  On this particular day and after they had arrested me that gate was standing open.  We drove in and it looked like the Oscars.  It was just paparazzi and cameras.  So we drove around the back.  They took me in the back and a few of theother guys who they had also now arrested.  So we went in and they started with the – but it was clear to me that Ncube – and I still said to him you are playing with time here because I need to – I want to go and apply for bail.    And then he would look halfway through the forms and then he made a mistake.  Then he would start all over again clearly playing for time.  Then a Task Force member came into my office.  He said to me they have just been admonished by – by General Mabula.  I said why.  He said no because we did not take you in the front where the media was.  So I got up and I Barraza excuse me one second.  I went to Mabula I said to him – I said to him Jan I do not mind if you arrest me or investigate me but do not make a circus of this thing.  Then he said no i t is not him.  It is Len Angus from IPID.  I went to Len Angus I said to Len Angus listenyou want to make a circus well let us put a tent around this place then.  So he said no, no, no.  He has got no problem if we leave that we should go around the back again and then when they finally processed us by now it is too late to go to court.  So I knew now tonight I am sleeping inside the – the cells.    Myself and a couple of my colleagues.    So – and Anguscomes back to me and he says to me Mabula is adamant we must go through the front.  I said now well then we go through the front where the media is and I was walking in the front with the rest of my guys behind me and then Angus came to me.  He said to me General if it is going to make you feel more comfortable I can take your coat and put itover your head.  I said to him Len I have never had any reason to hide  my face, I am not going to hide my face, I w ant to walk out and I will face the cameras, I turned around and I said to my guys those of you who want to cover your faces, you’re welcome to do so, I am not going to do that, and we all walked out and the flashes going and Chair it was actually embarras sing, not the media, the media knew me, but going through that passage with junior police officers, constables, sergeants, all standing there with their cell phones, here comes the General in handcuffs, that to me was probably the most embarrassing. They put us in a vehicle and we were taken to Durban NorthPolice Station ,where we were detained for the night and the following we appeared in court and we were granted, well they did not oppose bail and we were granted R5 000 bail each, and then Chair later on we were charged for racketeering ,those were the charges against us and the main allegation was that a number of shooting incidents over a period of three and a half years they alleged that those shootings were extrajudicial killings.  At least Chair five of those people that they were accused of having killed unlawfully at least five of those matters inquest proceedings had been finalised and magistrates had made findings ruling in favour of the Cato Manor members. In other cases I’m aware of, had alre ady been to the DPP for decision, they were nolle prosequi declined to prosecute, some were still under investigation.  So Chair as Chair is aware once you are prosecuted you are entitled to copies of the docket, so they provided us with copies of the dock ets and at that point Chair I thought when allthis is going on you start to doubt yourself, and then you start to wonder where did I do something wrong, and you toss and turn in bed and I thought okay the thing it can be they must have fabricated a case against me and they must have taken false statements. So I took the dockets home and now I’m reading through the dockets, there were 23 dockets Chair, but I don’t figure anywhere, I’m not finding the statements that I thought were fabricated statements.  There were three statements where my name appear, the one is from a Captain I think it’s Pillay who says he went to the Howick shooting scene, when he arrived there he saw the police helicopter standing onthe freeway, and he also saw General Booysen there,  that’s the sum total of his evidence.  The other one was the crew of the helicopter who says they picked up General Booysen at the Airwing, we flew there, we landed, Booysen had a look at the scene, we flew back.  That was the full extent of his statement.  There was a third statement, that person’s name was Cochrane, there was a third statement by Shamila Williams from IPID in which she attended to a shooting in Durban North at some stage.  I happened to arrive at that scene five hours afterwards and sh e merely mentions in her statement that after she had attended the sceneI also saw her and I think at that stage, I can’t remember if it was a Brigadier or a General but she says I saw General Brigadier Booysen, but that is much later.  That was the sum t otal of my names in the docket.  So Chair I immediately approached my attorney and I said to him look I’m not happy with this, I mean how can you charge a person or racketeering, I have been trained Chair in racketeering, I’ve ...(intervention)     I know Chair and as  Provincial Head of the Hawks we have seen a couple cases through of racketeering, I know what it takes to  convince the NDPP to sign that Section 21 certificate, so I took the matter on review Chair, the decision to prosecute me on the basis of legality and irrationality.  Ifiled my founding affidavit and then in the answering affidavit of the then acting in DPP Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba she files three extra statements that did not form part of the docket, the one is of a deceased person who does not implicate me in the offence that I was being charged for, he merely mentions somewhere that he had heard – now this person is now dead Chair, this person had heard two other people saying that they shoot the people in the taxi violence issues and then they collect money and then they pay Cato Manor and big boss boys.  Now Chair as far as I’m concerned that’s hearsa y twiceremoved, but I won’t go into that, but the two people that they mention are – well up until recently were both still alive, they were never approached to confirm those discussions, to the contrary when those statements were discovered to us through  Crime Intelligence I gave it to Colonel van der Vyfer I said do you know these people, they theneventually traced them and showed them the statements, and they then went to their attorney, which was Malloy & Partners and ironically who then spoke to Advocate Stix Mdladla who then took statements from those people that apparently had said that they collected money for Cato Manor and when which they disavowed every single aspect of the statement, in fact the person that, the deceased person that apparently had made that statement was out on bail himself for murder.  So that statement is one of the statements which Jiba attaches, there’s another one, an unsigned statement from a Greek citizen, who happen to be a friend of mine, he is no longer a friend of min e Chair, in which hemakes wild allegations but nothing pertaining to racketeering.  It’s more mischievousness than the commission of offences, but that particular document is not signed, and then there are two statements of a Colonel, a very controversial  colonel in KZN, Colonel Rajen Aiyer, but Chair if you read those statements it looks like a – it’s incoherent to say the least, but nowhere does it talk about any offence, it’s pure, pure office politics.  But Jiba then says she considered evidence unde r oath, evidence in the dockets and evidence under oath.  I – and then the one statement taken from Aiyer was dated two weeks after she hadauthorised the prosecution.  The one of Dannicas is not under oath, it’s not signed, it’s for all intents and purpos es no one knows where it comes from at that time, so I filed a replying affidavit in which I accuse of being mendacious and I explain to her how could you have considered evidence which objectively seen could not have existed atthe time that you took the decision.  She did not take up my invitation, long story short Chair Judge Gorvan ruled in my favour, he said none of the evidence in the dockets link me to the commission of any offence, none of the statements that Jiba belatedly added links me to the – well they don’t link anyone to the commission of an offence.  Subsequent to that Chair normally the police are supposed to be ...(intervention)       It succeeded Chair.    No the – Chair so in order to prosecute a person for racketeering there must be two predicate offences.    So what they did is the one incident that I had gone to Howick for.   And sometimes I wonder where, how senior advocates understand the law, forracketeering you must have committed two predicate offences, now what they did in that particular instance they alleged that at the Howick matter where I flew to, the allegations that I flew there and I planted an AK47 on the scene, but Chair in the book that I wrote th at’s what – I put that on the cover because it was taken by a newspaperphotographer to – I still can’t find the AK47 that I was supposed to have planted there.    But Chair what was set aside, the Judge set aside the predicate offences that was murder, because they alleged that I – there’s a common purpose for the Howick matter and possession of unlicensed firearm, the AK47, possession of unlicensed ammunition for the AK47 and defeating the ends of justice for planting the firearm.Chair there is not even remotely a suggestion or nothing whatsoever in the dockets that remotely suggests something like th at, it’s something that they made up.    They were withdrawn in court chair.    Thank you Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL B OOYSEN:  And I understand the Chair’s concern about the attorney writing directly to the NDPP office they could have been – been unaware of the procedure but my problem is that I feel that Advocate Mgwebe should not have entertained the representation.  He should have referred it in its entirety back to the DPP’s office to deal with it.  If the accused was still not satisfied he could then escalate it to the NDPP’s office.  That – that is how I have experienced it over the years.  So I just found it a bit o dd that Advocate Mgwebe would entertain this – looks more – rather a complaint than a representation of the attorney of Mr Madhoe.    Of People that had been promoted in terms of the Secret Services Account.  So what they do Chair if there is a covert investigation they take a profile of aparticular individual if it is for instance in a drug related matter – I will identify a policeman say in the Western Cape that fits a profile of a drug dealer.  I will recruit that policeman and he resigns from the police.  They take him off the system.  He then becomes an agent.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BO OYSEN:  For the very first time     That is correct Chair.   Chair the conclusion itis in paragraph 26. “In my view the case against Madhoe is overwhelming and I recommend that he must be indicted in the high court.”  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSE L BOOYSEN:  Chair two significantthings occurred at the time.  The investigating officer enquired from her as to why the charges were withdrawn and she would not respond to the investigating officer.  She did not give reasons at that time.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then by the direction of the Chair take you to page 105.  Is that the media statement that youreferred to earlier?    This media statement is dated 3 April 2013 and it is titled “Graft c harges against Panday withdrawn”.  It appears to have been published on the iol.co.za website.  Can I ask you to read the last two paragraphs into the record please?     If I can then ask you to turn the page and read the third short paragraph – sentence rather into the record.    So is it to be understood that despiteall of the evidence that had been investigated and collated Advocate Noko shortly after her appointment as the Acting DPP withdrew the charges against Colonel  Madhoe and Mr Toshan Panday?    Please do.        Thank you Chair.  That then leaves us with the last block on the time sheet – timeline sorry.  If I could ask you to just turn quickly to EXHIBIT ZC and in particular page 2.  At paragraph 6 you document additional evidence relating to the Toshan Panday corruption investigation and in particular regarding the release of the R15 million.  Can you pl ease inform the Chair about such evidence?   Can I – can I just interject and askyou did – did you receive this call before or after Toshan  Panday and Colonel Madhoe were arrested?    Sorry.    Apologies.  Not arrested – before or after the charges were in fact withdrawn.  Can you recall?     After they were arrested or after the charge [intervenes]?    Okay.  Please proceed.    Can I just interrupt yo u again?  Just clarify again what Section 252A is.    Thank you very much.    If I can just interrupt you and ask youto turn to page 3 and please identify who was the actual – apologies – page 3 of ZC.  On the top of page 3 you were informed that the charges were provisionally withdrawn.  Please identify who the prosecutor was.     To your knowledge has the R15 million been paid to Mr  Toshan Panday?    Can I then take you to page 18 - 1-8 – of your affidavit?  It is at this juncture that you deal with additional investigations that you were involved in.  Perhaps not in as much detail as the Toshan Panday investigation and in that regard the nextinvestigation that you deal with in your affidavit is one which you have titled the “Amigos” case.  In very simple terms please explain what this “Amigos” case concerned.    If I can just interrupt for the record can you please spell Peggy  Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Are you aware as towhether or not a forensic investigation was conducted in this parti cular matter?  Who conducted that forensic investigation?    Are you aware of any particular events relating to the involvement of Pricewaterhouse Cooper’s and the prosecutors involved – and prosecutors involved in this matter?    You said that you inherited this matter.  In what year did  you inherit the matter?  If I could take you to paragraph 58 [intervenes].    Okay and in paragraph 61 which is atpage 19 of your affidavit you document what the current status is or rather what the.    Thank you Chair.  You have just mentioned about the change in leadership, I’m not quite certain if you dealt with this part, but have – what in fact happened shortly after the change in leadership?    Are you aware General Booysenwhether or not there was a change to the prosecutor who was assigned to this particular case?     And then just for the record if I can take you to page 20 paragraph 65 of your affidav it.  You refer there to an interview on Radio 702 on 17  October 2018.  Is that in fact the date of the interview to which your evidence concerning the interview relates?    Thank you.  If I may just at this particular stage place something on record Chair.     Paragraph 68 of the witness’ affidavit refers to an Annexure JWB10.    Which is in the enclosed part of the bundle.    It is a document marked “secret”. It has a stamp on it which declassifies the document.  However we are in the process of just clarifying the actual status of this document.     And so that evidence is not going to be referred to at this stage until such proper confirmation is sought.     Thank you Chair.    If I can now take you then to page 23 of your affidavit which starts the next investigation that your evidence concerns and that investigation.    Chair before we move onto the next investigation and guided by your direction of course.     I am not sure if this particular chapter would finalise by the time that you have directed and so I am happy to.    I am happy to continue.    Okay.  No problem.  So at page 23 of your affidavit paragraph 75.  Are you there General  Booysen?    You talk about another investigationalthough your involvement in this particular investigation was quite different.  This investigation you have called the Cato Manor investigation.  In very simple terms please explain what this investigation entailed and in particular what  your involvement in this investigation was and is.    Of which year if I may interject?     Thank you.    Chair to just assist with the review.     Noting the time though, at paragraph 154 a copy of the actual judgment appears.     Chair if I may with your leave just read quickly.    At page 180 which is paragraph 36,    The order is that save for theinterdict which Mr Booysen sought the remaining prayers were granted ...(intervention)     In that ...(intervention)     In that, if I could it states that there    And then   Save for the interdict.    As it pleases Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is Advocate Noko who withdrew the charges against those two particular individuals in this case the same Advocate Noko who withdrew the charges against Colonel Madhoe and Mr Thoshan Panday?    What is the current status of the criminal matter against the two individuals whom you have mentione d, such being Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu?    Just to make sure I too understand it’s proceeding against all other accused other than Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhula against whom th e charges were withdrawn?    Thank you.  That then takes us to the next investigation that you deal with in your affidavit, from page 19 paragraph 62 to 74, this particular invest igation you have marked as looting of the secret services account.  Is that correct?     Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  No Chair, thank you.    I presume we start at the normal time, ten o’clock?
