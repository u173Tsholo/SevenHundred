CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning Mr President.    Good morning everybody.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius are you ready?    Yes.    Sorry.    Oh yes, no that is fine.  Before that is done I just want to say a few things. Mr President we are happy that you are here representing the ruling party.  We are happy that the President of the party is the one who comes to give evidence to the commission but I also want to say that your appearance before this commission is not a result of a decision taken recently it is a decision thatwas taken in 2018 as you will remember because soon after the commission had started its hearings I realised that the commission could not properly complete its task without the ruling party appearing before the commission because the ruling party is the party that was given powerby the voters to form the government for – so it was important that the ruling party should appear before the commission and say what it knew about all sorts of allegations that have been heard in this commission when it knew it and what it did about those things and also to indicate what it is prepared to do to make sure that those things never happen again. I also realise that it would be important that the current President should appear because during at least part of the time when these allegations – these things werealleged to have happened it was a time when he was Deputy President of the ANC and Deputy President of the country so that he could indicate also what he may have known and what he did not know and what was done to deal with purely allegations of state capture and the high levels of corruption that we have seen.So towards the end of 2018 I had a meeting with the President where I conveyed to him my view that it would be important that the ruling party appears before the commission and that he or the executive should alsoappear to deal with these matters and the President agreed that he would appear before the commission and he indicated also that the ANC would appear.So I thought I must just remind everybody how it comes about that he appears today.  It is not a recentdecision.  But I want to also take this opportunity to indicate Mr President that the commission appreciates the support for the work of the commission that both you as President of the country and the ruling party has shown.  So that is appreciated.  Thank you.  Mr President you will need to take the oath or affirmation depending on what you will be taking.  Which one would it be Mr President?    You will take the oath.  Okay may you please stand.  I do not know whether you would like to takeoff your mask.    Well – well if – if we can hear you with it on clearly you can keep it on but what has happened in the past is that usually we cannot hear people clearly.  But …    If we can hear you and you would like to keep it on that would be fine.  Please give your full names for the record Mr President.    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? PRESIDENT    Do you consider the oath binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    Thank you.  You may be seated.  Yes Mr Pretorius.   Mr Pretorius I just want to – I do see that there is social distancing between many people but I think some can do with some more space so we just need tomake sure.  There is a lot of space available in the room.  Okay.  Ja I see some are sitting next to each other so – well just – we all know what the social distancing is I am just reminding everybody if – if there is social distancing between people that is fine.  Okay you may proceed MrPretorius.    Do I need it immediately – Bundle 2?    Okay.    Please switch on the mic Mr President there..    Yes.  Mr Pretorius I think it would convenient – it would be important before you start to for the benefit of the public to explain what will be covered and what will not be covered with the President this time.   That is fine – that is fine.    That is fine.   Okay alright.      Is that BBB?    The affidavit of President Matamela CyrilRamaphosa which starts at page 6 will be admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BBB1.    Thank you.  Well Mr Pretorius you have said that you will deal with other matters with the President towards the end of the month now the public does not know towards the end of the month.  They know mid-May.    Okay let me say this about that becauseMr Pretorius forgot that it is – it was not public yet it – there was something that I discussed with him.  Mr President currently you are due to return to the commission wearing your cap as President of the country in mid-May I cannot remember the exact dates but mid-Maybut I indicated to Mr Pretorius that we will have to advise your office that those dates will need to be moved towards later in May because there are still a number of witnesses that the commission would like to hear and – so that was something that was still to be done but I do not know Mr Pretorius may have spoken to your team about it but that was – that is something that is in the pipeline.  So you might also have been wondering why he was talking about towards the end of May but – so those dates will change and we will move you towards the end of May.  Yes  Thankyou.  You are done Mr Pretorius?    For the moment obviously.  Okay Mr President if you wish to make an opening statement this is the opportunity for you to do so.     Thank you, Mr President.  We are at nine minutes past eleven, we normally take an adjournment at quarter past eleven, I think we should take an adjournment now so that when we resume then we can continue.  We are going to take the adjournment now, we will resume at twenty five past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Let us continue.  Of course it is a Presidential Commission in his capacity as President of the country and not as President of the ANC.     I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, you said page 12?     You explained to the President the black numbers and red numbers?     My page 12, Mr Pretorius, starts with    Is that the right page?     Okay.     You may keep mic on, Mr President.     Ja.     I am sorry, Mr President.  What is the importance, Mr President, of this deployment committee having the power to recommend as opposed to simply identifying potential candidates and encouraging them toapply like everybody and be considered and if they are considered, the most deserving, they get appointed.  So what is the importance of the committee having to recommend as opposed to simply saying we know there is this position available, we would like some of our membersthat we know are qualified and we think are suitable or, as you say, people in society that the organisation is aware of that it thinks should be encouraged, encourage them to say you apply and you compete with – like with everybody.  So if you did it that way, the people that the deployment committee thinks are appropriate will be the among those who will be considered but they will not be coming with the recommendation from the deployment committee that the minister knows about, they will be coming like everybody but the deployment committee and the organisation shouldbe covered because it has made sure that people that it thinks should take those positions are there with others and competing there.     Yes.     Well, that question arises in my mind because it would seem to me that where a minister is the appointing authority, for example…     And he or she knows that among the candidates there is this candidate who enjoys a recommendation of the deployment committee andremember, the deployment committee is chaired by the Deputy President of the party and the Deputy President of the country because that is how it works at the moment.     It seems to me that it might put somepressure on the minister to take this candidate unless one of the other candidates really excels.  So, in other words, this candidate seems to come with an advantage that nobody else knows about other than the deployment committee and the minister.  So the other candidates think we are all competing on an equal footing but this one already enjoys a recommendation from the deployment committee, of course a recommendation that has been made by the deployment committee, not knowing the strengths and credentials of other possible candidates andthen the minister is aware, the committee chaired by the Deputy President thinks this is the person who should – or recommends that this person should be appointed.  Would you want to say something about that?     Yes.    Now the two approaches, you said they are not mutually exclusive.     And I agree.  I have already indicated what possible criticism can be directed at the approach as you have described it.     Namely that the candidate recommendedby the deployment committee has this added advantage, and I assume that is not known to anybody, other than the deployment committee and the appointing authority, the minister. I may be wrong on that.  What criticism would youhave with the other approach, which simply says your interest as an organisation in making sure that you, that certain strategic positions are occupied by people who understand your policies and so on and so on. That would be taken care of if you encourage candidates, suitably qualified candidates to apply, but once you ... once they have applied, why do you not leave it to the process and the appointing authority and the appointing authority is your own cadre who is supposed to understand the policies of the ANC and he or she will thenlook at all of this. But in that way the candidate does not come with some extra added advantage.  Would you have criticism for that approach and say it would not be suitable?    Who comes to you. MR    About the ministers.    Yes.     Ja.     I want this one.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay.    Yes, yes.     Mr Pretorius?      Did you say 182 Mr Pretorius?    Paragraph 122?    Page 122, okay.     What page Mr Pretorius?     Thank you.      Well, in passing I must just say Mr President that the commission has struggled a lot to get previous performance contracts of ministers.  We to the best of my recollection, we got documents which reflected how they were supposed to look like, and I am not sure that we ever got the ones that were actually signed, but maybe some units of the commission has, because we wanted them at a certain stage, starting from 2010 or 09.The information I was given at some stage was it looks like nobody knows where those contracts are, but maybe they have been found, I am not sure.  But it would be good if the ones that have been signed are kept properly with the public or a commission like this wantsthem and they can get them.     I also hope Mr President, in the box will be included performance assessments of ministers during that time.     Now, ja.    Alright.      Ja.     Mr Pretorius?    Would those members of the judicialservice commission who may  be members of parliament, ANC members of parliament, not be expected to talk to the ANC, to say here are candidates for various positions that will be interviewed in due course. Does the ANC have preference in terms of candidates?  Do you know whether anything like that does happen?    Okay.    Okay.  Mr Pretorius?     Oh yes.     Okay.     Well, I should have asked this question earlier, Mr President, what does the deployment committeerecommend, does it recommend that a particular person be appointed to a particular position, does it recommend that a particular person be considered for appointment to a particular position?     It is the latter?     Yes.     And the processes.     Okay.    Yes, okay.     Let us take the adjournment and we willresume at two o’clock.     We adjourn.     Before we proceed Mr Pretorius I think we must have in mind how far we would go this afternoon and I do not know whether the arrangement with the President and his team is that we would stop at four or five or whether if necessary he would be available for us to proceed beyond that time and I do not know your own situation and your team.I am mentioning that because  1. I do not have an evening session this evening.  So ifthe situation was such that we can beyond five o’clock I would be available but the President might have other plans because he might have worked on the basis that we would stop maybe at four or five. But tomorrow we do have an evening session. So I am mentioning that in case if we do not use some time after five – after four today tomorrow might not be enough.  I am just giving that information so that while we proceed everybody would be ready that when we come to four o’clock whether the answer would be we can go up to five or we stopat four or whether what the position would be.So you might have canvassed that with the President or his team.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Well Mr President you will indicate what your situation is when either now or later on.  So all Iwas saying is tomorrow we have an evening session so we would have to finish by five o’clock but in case tomorrow might not be enough we might go beyond four o’clock; beyond five o’clock today but only if that suits everybody because there might have been other plans if that had not been discussed.But if we have to stop at five that is fine as well.  Okay alright.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Well we could stop at fourstrictly speaking the day session goes up to four but we normally stretch it a little bit but if from your side you are comfortable with going up to five maybe we should do that.  But it just depends I do not want you to be under pressure because four o’clock is generally the normal time.    Okay.    Okay no that is fine.  Even at four o’clock we – I will ask.    What the position is    And if we have to stop at four we stop at four if we can go up to five then we go up to five.    Okay alright.  Thank you.  We may proceed Mr Pretorius.   Are you back in his affidavit?    Okay.    Sorry Mr President.      Ja no it is not yours Mr President.  Will everybody please switch off their cell phones.  Okay let us continue.     It is after lunch, Mr Pretorius.  [laughs]     Yes, continue.     May I ask this Mr President?  Does theDeployment Committee ever go public about people it has recommended for appointments in terms of speaking publicly.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes. PRESIDENT     Well, I raise that because and maybe that can be dealt with later but you may or may not know much about it because I think you would not have been Chairperson of the Deployment Committee at the time.  We – I have heard evidence in this Commission relating to, for example Mr Siyabonga Gama, who at a certain stage, I think 2009/2010, at a certain stage was one of theapplicants for the position of Group CEO for Transnet who was suspended as CEO of TFR, which is a division of Transnet.And in the media there was a lot of talk about him and that position and various allegations, but there were reports in the newspapers of a number of senior ANC leaders who reportedly went public saying that Mr Gama should be appointed as Group CEO.  And I wondered whether that might be because the Deployment Committee had recommended him and that was maybe the reaction ofsome of its members who, if they were – if they thought if he was not being appointed.So I thought you might be able to say whether they ever go public when maybe their recommendation does not seem to be accepted.  But you say, as far youknow, they do not?     H’m.     Well, just because we have touched on it.  When Mr Mantashe gave evidence we have touched on it as well.  But this was a case where, at least at a certain point, there was a black candidate who had been recommended by the Board of Transnet who was seen as a credible candidate but Mr Siyabonga Gama had not been recommended.And the then Minister, namely, Ms Barbara Hogan was supportive of the candidate that had been recommended by the board but there were reports of criticism of why Mr Siyabonga Gama was not the one who was recommended or who was not been appointed.  I thinkMr Mantashe told me that he had not been aware of a black candidate having been recommended because I think, at least from his point of view, he was looking at the issue of black managers been given opportunities to lead some of these parastatals.  So there was that concern to say, who – if the problem was that there should be change in the CEO’s of parastatals, what was the problem?  Because here was a black candidate ...[intervenes]      ...who appeared to be credible and nobody appeared to have issues with him who was recommended by a largely black board that had been appointed by the ANC government.     So what was sort of the issue?  But as I say, one, you might not have personal knowledge and two, you might not have been a member of the Deployment Committee at the time.     Ja.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    Would it include appointing somebody who, as you have put not fit for purpose, who is notqualified of the job or maybe just basic standards, the requirements but the other people who meet and surpass those standards but particularly one who does not qualify because he or she will feel that she or he has been done a favour and therefore owes the appointing authoritysomething, loyalty.  Because otherwise, he or she could not get this job and therefore the appointing authority thinks there are good chances that such a person will be compliant.  Does it include that in your view?     Ja.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, he would be manoeuvrable.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     Mr Pretorius.     Of course, Mr President, now that we are touching on the boards and the role of the deployment committee on the appointment of boards of SOEs, when one looks at what has happened, as the evidence has revealed in his Commission over the past two and halfyears, what has happened in various SOEs, Eskom, Transnet, SAA, PRASA, you name them, over a certain period, you are bound to ask the question how is it possible that in each one of those, these SOEs, the types of boards that were there did not do a, b, c, d.  How could all of these things happen while they were there?   And that raises the question of how were they appointed?  What criteria were followed in selecting people to be put into those boards?  How could these SOEs be where they are now or be where they were a few years agobut in some we can say now when they were – they had boards?  It is like – it is like there is something common, common problem with all of these boards that made it possible for the SOEs they were supposed to run to be where they are and therefore, as the Commission, one of the things we – some of the things we want to look at is how do we – what recommendations should be made that would try and make sure that in the future if anything like this were to happen, it should just be one, not all of them.     So obviously you go back and say who were the people who were making appointments here?  What was going on?  So I am just highlighting that as you share with me what the deployment committee’s role is and the ministers, there is that question to say the same thinghappened with SAA, the same thing happened with Eskom, the same thing happened with Transnet, the same thing happened with Denel, same thing happened with PRASA.  What was really going on?  But there were boards?  So you might want to say something, I am just saying that those are some of the questions we are asking ourselves.     With a view to saying if we do not want to see the same thing happening to SOEs again in the future, we have got to identify what caused these problemsand seek to ensure that we recommend measures that will make sure that the same problems do not happen.  But as you were saying a few minutes earlier, we have to go to identify where the problem is or what the weakness is in order to be able to make an appropriate recommendation.     Well, I mention this for the session that will come later probably end of May, Mr President.     And the legal team may or may not haveincluded this in the scope but I mention it, that one of the things that I want to know is, in regard to various SOEs, is what the executive know because this the situation was deteriorating from a certain point, one expects that there would have been regular reports to the relevant ministerand to cabinet, you know, to the President and to the cabinet to say this is what is happening in that SOE, this is what is happening in that SOE and I would be interested to know, apart from the President, what was cabinet saying about the situation as it was deteriorating over a certain period of time?  So that would be very useful because one wants also to see whether the situation could have been arrested at a certain stage if certain information was known to cabinet and cabinet did not act or what the position is but I am just mentioning it, that that would befor the next session.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no, that is fine.     Okay, alright.     Well, talking about the fact that the ANC acknowledges that there were certain shortcomings, there were certain things that it might not have done properly and so on, I think that is quite important, thatacknowledgement but I would like you, maybe before you finish today or even tomorrow, I would like you to identify the actual areas where you say, as a party, we have done our homework, we think this is where we did not do what we were supposed to do properly, this is where we did something we should not have done, so we identify exactly areas where, as a party, you say here we did not do things the way we should have and we acknowledge.  So why that is important is because while an acknowledgement is good and it should be given its properweight, it is even better if one knows what you are talking about because when one knows what the party is talking about and says this is where we accept we went wrong, then one can look at what should be put in place for the future so that there is no repeats.  So it is something youcan deal with either today or tomorrow, it is fine, it is just that, as I say, it would be useful so that it does not go – it does not get limited to simply acknowledging without being specific.     Yes.     Ja.  Okay, no, that is fine.     Ja.  Yes, no, no, that is right, it will give you enough time also to look at it properly.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius?    Or maybe, Mr Pretorius, you could say something briefly about it so that when the President comments everybody can follow what it is about.    Yes, yes and of course and I am not talking about this particular case, sometimes when the courts do their job, same people are unhappy to say thecourts are telling us what to do, how to run certain institutions. So yes, okay.  Mr Pretorius?    Well, the president I guess confirms that four o’clock or ...[intervenes]     No, no ...[intervenes]     No, no it is fine, we will adjourn at four o’clock then.  But I do not know Mr Pretorius and yourteam, you are in a better position to make an assessment whether tomorrow there may or may not be a need to go beyond four, maybe up to five because if there would be, it would be better that we talk about it now, so that the president then knows that tomorrow he could give up to five.     But it may be that your own assessment is such that we will not need to, but I would like us to use as much time as we are able to, subject to the president’ssituation.    Is that from the president’s side?    Yes, no, no that is fine.  We could even start at nine if that was suitable.      Ja. Well, because the president says even nine o’clock would be fine, let us start at nine o’clock.    Mr Pretorius, if the president says nine o’clock is fine ...[intervenes]     You are from the commission, you cannot complain.      Okay, so that is fine.  We will stop at four this afternoon and tomorrow we start at nine.     Expectation.      Expectation.    Of course Mr President, when it comes to a company such as BOSASA, a question that arises when one has regard to the number of years that it was enjoying contracts with government departments, number one...[intervenes]     Number two, having regard to the fact that allegations of its involvement in irregular and corrupt contracts in government departments were all over the media over a long period of time, a question arises whether the ANC which ought to have been aware of whatever was in the media, like everybody whether it turned a blind eye because it was receiving donations from BOSASA.That kind of question arises.    Yes, yes.     No, that is fine.     You will address, yes.  Yes, well for what it is worth I just mention in passing that when I washearing evidence relating to parliamentary oversight a few weeks ago, maybe not a few weeks ago but at some stage, I heard evidence which was to the effect that when the Chairperson of the relevant, I think correction services portfolio committee was doing his legacy report, that is what I understand they are called, which portfolio committees prepare when their term ends, to enable the next committee to see what they were busy with, despite the fact that when that committee started in 2009, they were given the SIU report in relation to correctionalservices and BOSASA, and they looked at the report and the whole committee, almost the whole committee felt that it was shocking, what the report had about the allegations of corruption.  When the legacy report was prepared by the Chairperson, he did not mention anything for the next committee to take this issue further.  Mr Freund is here who was leading evidence he is familiar with that.  So there was that, I mean the whole committee says but this is shocking. But during the term not much seems to be done by the committee about this, and then when the legacy report is supposed to be prepared so that the next committee can see what issues should be taken further, this very important issue is not mentioned in the legacy report. So, but you will be able to deal with what you are able to deal with next time.     Okay, Mr Pretorius?    Yes, no, no, that is fine.  I think we will stop now.  So Mr President, just to re-affirm this.  The dates that you had been given for mid-May you can use.  Other dates for appearance to the commission, before thecommission. Other dates will be given, which will be towards the end of May.  So the current dates that have been given for you ...[intervenes]     You can go to the beach Mr President.     So we will look at other dates towards the end of May.   Parties, thank you very much.  Mr President, we will then adjourn and tomorrow we will commence as agreed, at nine o’clock the morning.    We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Yes we are ready Chair.    The President will testify today and tomorrow.  I will introduce the bundles in a moment if thePresident could be sworn in please?    If the President could be sworn in?    Thank you Chair.  Mr President a few housekeeping matters.  Before you is a bundle – Bundle 1 and in that bundle is Exhibit BBB1 Statement of the President together with annexures.  Then there is a second bundle Exhibit – containing Exhibit BBB2 which is a collation of certain documents that are relevant to the evidence.      Thank you Chair.  So there are two bundles as I have said Bundle 1 and Bundle 2.  Bundle 1 contains the statement of the President, Bundle 2 contains certain additional documentation.Bundle 2 has only been recently compiled and I will explain why in a moment.    No you do not need it immediately Chair.   May I then ask Mr President if you would take the first bundle, do you have it?    Oh I had planned to do that next Chair.    If that is okay?    And I will do that in full.    At page 79 and we will refer to the black numbers in the top left hand corner is a page with your – with a signature above your name could you please confirm that that is your signature?  Page 79 black numbers in the top left hand corner.    And if you would go please to the same bundle at page 5 and particularly at page 6.   Is that the beginning of your affidavit?    And are you satisfied that the contents of that affidavit insofar as you are aware are true and correct?    Thank you.  Chair may the affidavit and annexures and I see each page has been initialled beadmitted then as Exhibit BBB1?    BBB we have been through the alphabet 3 times in this commission.    Yes.  And then Mr President I believe that you wish to make an opening statement but just before we do that if I may place certain matters on record Chair.There is a statement that we have just placed on record as an affidavit.  It is attested to in your capacity as President of the ANC and former Deputy President of the ANC am I correct?   And there is a further statement that will be placed before the commission dealing with matters in our capacity as President of the Republic and former Deputy President of the Republic but that is yet to be obtained.  Is that correct?    We received your statement on the 22 n d of April 2021 and we proceeded to undertake the necessary research that process is not yet complete andaccordingly we may have to deal with certain issues on your return towards the end of May.    In these first two days of your evidence Mr President we will deal with our terms as ANCDeputy President and President.    And those facts or facts relevant to that are contained in your affidavit just admitted.  I will deal with certain matters and then Advocate Freund will deal with certain matters tomorrow.In these second two days towards the end of the month we will deal with matters related to your office as Head of State and there will be questions from the legal team Advocate Seleka, Soni and Myburgh in relation to thatas well as questions from myself. And that is just the background I think that the DCJ wanted placed on record.    Yes I was leaving that to you Chair it is an announcement from the Chair.    For the moment Chair.     Thank you, Chair, Mr President.  By way of introduction it appears from your statement and your opening statement in addition to public statements that there are indeed three issues that the Commissionshould properly investigate.The first is to understand what happened in the period under review and we have three years of evidence before the Commission and we have certain statements in the opening and in your general statement in that regard.But the second is perhaps more important for present purposes and that is to understand how things could have happened and it is that regard that many of the questions will be put before you, Mr President.  In other words, what were the circumstances and events thatallowed these things to happen which appears by public consensus, as you say, to have conceded to – be to conceded to have happened.And the third element that is also very important, it may have to stand over to a large extent to the second session of your evidence as how can these things be prevented from happening again.  So we will cover all three issues but concentrate principally on issues two and three.Of course we will also ask questions of what you knew was happening in terms of the – or in relation to theterms of reference and in relation to the third question, we will also ask what you, as President, the ANC and the executive which you are leading are doing or intend doing or think should be done to prevent it happening again and many of those elements are already in progress, forexample matters in relation to law enforcement agencies, the Political Party Funding Act and others but there are other questions that will arise out of that and the object will be to ask on your part for evidence that will allow the Commission and the Chair in particular to understand what best are the remedies that it can recommend.  But having said that by way of introduction, Mr President, there is a unique element to this evidence, this is your Commission, this Commission is reporting to you and in that sense it is a unique situation but notwithstanding we hope that youwill help us do our job for you properly.       Yes, well that is also true, Chair, so maybe I should reserve that question for the next session.Mr President, what we have done in response to your statement is look at certain paragraphs in the statement and to deal with matters arising from thoseparagraphs and in particular your statements in those paragraphs but if we leave anything out in the sequence please alert us to it so that we can then go back and everything can be taken in its proper sequence.  So the first issue that we do have to raise is on page 12 of bundle 1, EXHIBIT BBB1, but if there is anything before that you no doubt will alert us to it.  This is the introductory portion of your statement.     Page 12.     Yes.  We will be dealing – there are two sets of numbers on each page, we will be dealingwith the numbers at the top left hand corner and we have taken the liberty of using the acronym CR there.     Yes.     Yes.     In paragraph 21 on that page, Mr     Thank you, Mr President.  It may seem what you have said should be taken for granted but perhaps is should not be taken for granted.  There are two things that flow from that statement, particularly the latter part of your statement that there is an expectation on the part of South Africans that the party will lead in dealing with policy, problems, solutions and the like and we will come back to that point later.But the second is that the electorate would then beentitled to know how and what – how the ANC intends to go about its business and business of the country, the people and what it is doing in that regard.  Is that a fair statement?  Obviously there are exceptions, but…     Then, Mr President, after certain introductory structural remarks concerning the ANC’s structures and processes you deal with cadre developmentand deployment beginning at page 15 and in paragraph – well, perhaps I should presage that with a summary of the evidence – a very, very broad and perhaps superficial, but if it is superficial you will tell me, summary of the evidence in relation to cadre development and “cadre deployment”.On the one hand there has been evidence that the policy goes far beyond mere recommendation and in fact is a policy implemented on the instruction and mandate of the deployment committee.  That is one view and there is certain evidence in regard to that.  Whether that isexceptional or the rule, maybe we can deal with in due course when we come to detail.The other view, which is reflected in your statement and other statements, Mr President, is that the deployment committee goes no further than make recommendationsand abides by the formal selection processes that take place for example in the public service.   Those are the two extreme views and whether either is correct or not, Chair will have to consider and decide.  Or it may be that neither is correct as a general rule and that there is quite a large grey area between.  What would your comment be?     Whether it always happens that way or not we can explore in due course with some of the more detailed evidence that we have been given but I understand you to have said that the whole process does require some form of statutory or other regulation and wecan explore that issue as well in due course.  But, for the moment, in paragraph 25 on page 15, your statement    122.     No, no on page 122.    Is this the deployment policy of the ANC?    And does it have a date or is it a developing document?  Has it grown over time?  I see if you look at page 138, there is a reference to 2018 in paragraph 67.      Right.  That point we can deal withperhaps at the end in more detail Mr President, but if one could ... if I could ask you please to go to page 105.  This is a different document.  This is the ANC constitution.      105.      To paragraph or Clause 25 17.20.  This is the ANC constitution.  That is how it is identified in your statement.      This, paragraph 25.17 appears on the face of it to be a list of active misconduct, which would apply to members of the ANC for which disciplinary proceedings or in respect of which disciplinary proceedingsmay be instituted.    Understood.  Would the contract of employment have any substantive provisions setting out the duties of the public representatives?    Would it be fair to say or would you accept that the electorate which elects the person to public office, would be entitled to know by what contractual provisions their representative is bound?    Including presidents.     May I ask you to go back to thedeployment policy at page 124?      Paragraph 9 of the deployment    It does talk about positive impact.    Rather than direct control.    Right, and then in paragraph 10 the    For example the entire civil service is mentioned here.    Well perhaps a closer integration between policy and practice may be looked at.     If I could take you to another paragraph, on page 133.  Para 47.  This refers to strategic    And again there appears to be at least on the face of it, and you may correct me if I am wrong, a disconnect between what the policy reads and thepractice.  You concede that?    The JSC, the judicial services committee, positions on the JSC.  Are they subject to the activities of the deployment?    No.  Then a second point is made which does not necessarily relate to the first point.  It     Well, it says two things, it suggests in the first sentence that there is an expectation that cadres and deployed cadres might accumulate personal wealth, whether that is in Government our outside Government it doesn’t say but the second point is that there’s a thought, at least expressed here, that the policy says that, well we should at least or consider whether that money should come to the movement, is that an appropriate clause?     Paragraph 56.1 on page 135, again black number, I’ve just made the mistake of reading rednumbers myself, 56.1 it says, “Cadres should be ready to be deployed where the movement deemed it necessary to deploy them”,That is quite a strong statement and veers towards the hard interpretation of the deployment policy, do youhave any comment?     Well, perhaps, as you’ve pointed out, Mr President, in a modern and democratic economy as opposed to the history or the historical situation in which the party found itself, perhaps it could be qualified or…[indistinct – dropped voice].     Paragraph 60 on page 136, this is perhaps more of a commentary rather than a strictexpression of policy, but it reads, “The ANC’s range of national and regional deployment committees ebbed and flowed over time as the movement battled intra organisation positioning, optimisation of state governance, factionalism, careerealism and over the page opportunism, desperation for employment and the organisational dilemmas of having to act against corrupt comrades”,Clearly – or perhaps I’m being presumptuous but if Iam, you will tell me so, Mr President, clearly this is an expression of the problems faced in fact, in the history of the application of the deployment policy, am I correct in that?     Well, how would factionalismarise?     So, is it fair to say that in the history of the party in implementing and developing the deployment policy it has had to face particular factions seeking to further, legitimately, economic interest?     And, to get to the third large topic, how can it be prevented from happening again, these experiences, I understand from your evidence inform the degree to which regulation is required?     Moving between categories again, not to be confusing, Mr President, appointments to Law Enforcement Institutions for example the National Director of Public Prosecution the Commissioner of Police, the headof HAWKS, the head of IPID, SIU and others, we know, and perhaps it put a – obtained a mention that in the appointment of the NDPP most recently, a completely new process involving public participation was directed by yourself but let’s go back to trying to understand how appointments in the past – and I’m now going before your reign Mr President, in the past did the deployment committee involve itself in appointments to Law Enforcement Institutions, for example NDPP, Commissioner of Police and the like?PRESIDENT     Right, and of course, there has also been evidence about the direct power to appoint being used for purposes that are, to put it quite plainly, illegitimate and these appointment in Law Enforcement Agencies and the like are the subject matter of otherevidence and do not involve evidence concerning the deployment committee and will be dealt with separately but we should not forget about those in an overview in relation to appointments to offices of state but may I raise a further question because we’ve spoken about how the deployment committee should work, it’s architecture and design, as it has developed over time.  We’ve spoken about how it might not have worked or did not work in the past in instances and the extent of those instances may be debated and we’ve spoken about the need in relation to policies andlegislation as you’ve stated in your statement and have spoken about now needs to be looked at it and perhaps even rewritten but there is a view that has been expressed before the Commission and perhaps your comment on this view would be useful by more than one witness and a viewthat has been expressed publicly that there is no need for a deployment committee anymore and if I may just put those views to you and then ask for your comment.  In her testimony, Barbara Hogan stated, “However, the usefulness of such a deployment committee these days is debatable, how can, just a handful of people possibly have the institutional knowledge and resources to pronounce on suitable candidates, for every senior position in Government and the private sector.  It cannot be that closenessto or membership of the ANC or an of its alliance structures or to fractions within these structures should be the determining factors in the selection of candidate for senior positions.  In this day and age there are a host of capable black and white professionals, women, and men from which to choose who clearly understand and have an appetite for making the economy grow.  Directorships on Boards should never be granted to the favoured few as a reward for loyalty to a partyor a faction of a party or as a retirement benefit for the well connected”,There are several items or views in that passage, and you may want to consider it at more length, but do you have any comment?    One of the points that Barbara Hogan makes in that passage that was quoted that perhaps there are selection committees with expertise more concentrated and more thorough to deal with selection to, for example, particular state owned entity Boards, should it not just be left to them, that was the statement?     Would there be any warrant for the regulation about which you speak later on in your statement making special provision for positions which are highly specialised requiring specialist skills andexperience, is that catered for or would it specifically be catered for?     Chair, I see it is one o’clock.     It is only one o’clock.     Thank you.    Yes Chair it has been rather tentatively raised with the President’s team on thisunderstanding that he does have a country to run    But…    I am sure that they will express their views.    Either now or when the time comes.    I wanted to move on Mr President to a statement made by Mr Enoch Godongwana in an interview he gave to a television station on the 15t h of April 2021 I do not know if you are aware of it.  But he said the following and pointers first one ultimately“The objectives of the time were to change the demographics of the Public Service.  Secondly to ensure that the transformation agenda is carried out.”He is talking about deployment. “The question one may pose and the current conjecture is have these objectives been achieved?  If we look at the demographics of the civil servants as we speak they are clearly transformed from that perspectivetherefore that objective had been achieved.If we look at the second transformation orientation I think there is no doubt that it diffused into the public service as a whole.  So somebody may then say is there is a necessity to continue doing so?  These are debates that we should be engaged on as you are aware the moment the Minister of Public Service is looking at introducing a policy of what is called aprofessional civil service.  The debate which is taking place in South Africa at the moment will impact on the form and content of the deployment policy.”Simply put he is speaking about theprofessionalization policy which perhaps we can talk about later not now in this context.  But he is asking the question and I would like to ask you whether this question is being asked within the ANC at the moment is whether deployment is necessary at all?    In paragraph 32 on page 17 you…    Yes Chair.    Another issue is raised that maybe significant in this discussion Mr President and that is the quote you had placed there by Matheson of the OECD that is the Organisation for Economic and Community Development times and it is an international organisation that has many countries as members.  Is South Africa a member?  I know itis quoted in the survey?    Anyway the quote here deals with the issue of the political loyalties of public servants.    The responsiveness of public servants to the policies of the current executive and what    Right.  Mr President you have spoken about a move or intention to introduce a policy of professionalization of the civil service what problems wouldthat move seek to address and what is envisaged?    Yes.  In your preparation Mr President you have no doubt been forewarned that the answer to the Parliamentary question by the Minister of Public Service and Administration Mr Mchunu in a reply to a    Mr President thus far in relation to the issue of deployment we have dealt with elements of thehard definition of employment that it is much more than recommendation.    And we have dealt with the softer definition which is that it is recommendation only and we have looked at the exceptions that fill the space between and I think there has been a fair statement on your part if I may comment that regulation in the form of legislation and policy reform is – is underway.  But there is an aspect of appointments that may well fall right outside the question ofdeployment and that is what has happened in the period under review in the past and we have heard some three years of evidence of appointments which may have something to do with a definition of patronage – you have used that word patronage and we will come to that in due course in a different context.  But if we look at appointments particularly within state owned entities in the past ten years and I am going to just recite a few for you and ask for your knowledge and comment.In Transnet Mr Molefe, Gama, Ramasobudi, Peter,Singh, Sharma, Makwanazi, Shane, Seleke, Mabaso, Denel the entire board including the Chair.  PRASA, Eskom, Molefe, Singh, Koko, Matshela, Ngubane, SAA, Dudu Myeni, Law Enforcement, Arthur Fraser, Tom Moyane, Bernie(?) Ntemensa(?), Shaun Abrahams.  Now, clearly it would beunfair to discuss with you all the evidence related to each particular appointment but there is a common thread, certainly, in the evidence that goes through all of these appointments and the dismissals associated with them that have been linked with, certainly, a definition of patronage.If I could ask you, please, what your knowledge was of these, what your comment is?  Let me say, if anything to do with the deployment policy, at the existence of the deployment policy, have any relationship to these appointments and dismissals.  I know that I am making acardinal error in the questioning here but this is a Commission not a...  And I am rolling up a whole lot of questions... [laughs] ...if I carry on the DCJ will take me to task.     [laughs]     Maybe I will be excused for that reason.  What was going on here?  What was yourknowledge?     Now, perhaps the problem lies with the question in that it is too broad and too general and inthat sense to ask for a particular approach, to put the least, that is least optimistic.  But the first point is that there has been evidence that there were appointments influenced by or made by the former President to fit another purpose, an ulterior and illegitimate purpose.  Areyou aware of that?  Is that evidence known to you?     One interpretation of Pastor Wentz(?), Mr President, is that the Deployment Committee, certainly, for a significant period of time during theseappointments and you were Chair at the time of that Committee, as I understand it, was entirely bypassed in these appointments.  In other words, the ideal, as it should have worked, procedures that you have outlined today were not applied and in fact the Deployment Committee was not involved.  Was there not then a duty on the Deployment     Alright.  Insofar as they did happen and insofar as you have stated you took this up with the former President.  The response was an acknowledgment and mea culpa, as you say?     Fortunately or unfortunately, we do not have time to go through each one but the general principles are clear.       Thank you.  To return to the Gondwana[?] interview Mr President.  In the context of deployment, once again, and we have now returned to the former deployment policies and your application.  You spoke about patronage creeping in under the guides ofdeployment and to the best of my recollection you have used that term in this and other contexts.  What is patronage?  How does it work?     Of course, there is the further self-perpetuating element to patronage that a patron receives favours or even receive financial gain, becomes morepowerful and then in a greater and more powerful position as a patron.     Has this happened and if it has, how is it intended to be dealt with?     In fairness to those who have given the evidence and in fairness to yourself, Mr President.  I need to put to you certain passages from the evidence that have told the Chair of the hard interpretation ofdeployment.  In other words, that it goes much further than recommendation.  And then I would like to put to you, certainly of your own statement, which quite frankly highlights the problems that you face or have faced and do face.  The evidence of Lynne Brown in relation to SOE boards, more     And this was in the period 2014 to 15, at least.     Yes, Chair, I might just add that although I have approached it in general terms in the context of the questions that are now being asked, they will be dealt with to the extent necessary in detail byindividual evidence leaders at the second session.     And the second point that I wanted to make in relation to the role of the Commission is that in August 2020 – and in fairness to you we will put these statements before the Chair, you made some very strong statements in newsletters and elsewhere about corruption and what was happening at the time and if I may say your language was quite unequivocal in that regard but what you did say was that there is no room anymore foroutsourcing, that the party must take responsibility for acting and acting decisively. And in relation to that statement of yours, Mr President, was that or is that if one looks back, the evidence has been quite strong and I think you have all butquite frankly spoken about, is that there were improper or improperly motivated appointments and you have quite fairly made a number of statements and I will remind the Chair of those statements that you have made in that regard, whether these went through the deployment committee or whatever process was followed, ultimately I think is – well, I do not think, ultimately I suggest that the party must take account of it and take account for it.  Is that not a fair proposition?     Yes, thank you, Chair.  The three big headings – you in fact reflected in your August 2020 newsletter of what happened, how did we get there and where to from here.  You will recall those headings.   They mirror precisely the principle headings of the inquiry that has been outsourced.  I know that labour law does not have a good connotation, but it is here.   The middle part of how did this happen, could it happen?  There seems to be an acknowledgement that those things that should not have happened, corruption,fraud, state capture, it happened.   There may be a question of degree and debate but for the purposes of the further questions, I am not sure how important that is, whether it is decisive of the answer to the question, how did this happen, how could it happen and only with an understanding of that will the outsourcee have the wherewithal and the ammunition really to make proper recommendations.It seems that with your party hat on, with an understanding of what happened, already one has movedto the stage of making sure that it does not happen again and perhaps we will explore that later but I think in fairness to yourself, it is appropriate to put at least three or four of your own statements to you that have recognised problems and if it is – they all follow the same pattern andif you do not mind, I could read them all them out and you can ask me to break it up.  In your January 2020     In your August 2020 newsletter to     Thank you, Mr President.  I wasgoing to refer to other evidence that deal with the hard definition, as we have termed it, of deployment, not recommendation but compulsion in appointments.   There is the Amathole Municipality case, of which you are presumably aware, there is statements by Barbara Hogan and there is statements by Dr Ngubane that have been given to the Commission but in the interests of time, we have covered it in principle, I am going to move on to a different topic.     Yes, if you would.     Yes.     Or the mayor, I think,     This is a quote from the judgment,    Yes, one final point on the issues we have been discussing today Mr President.  You know the eye of a needle document no doubt.  It is a document    Hopefully we will have time tomorrow to deal with your August 2020 newsletter, you used much stronger language than tar hitting the road, but we will leave that until tomorrow.    If we may then, Chair in the meanwhile I have received a very stern note from the right hand side of the room, your left hand side of the room.  The office of the president, saying four o’clock and not five o’clock.      They control his diary.    Yes.    I forgot to add in the bargaining process, there is an offer to start at 09H30 tomorrow.     Yes.     I think it was George Benatshowi who said, he has friendly apologised.  He did not have time to write a short letter.  He apologised for the long letter, sowhat I will do tonight is concentrate on trying to do precisely that.     I have no answer Chair.     I will not, Chair.    Thank you.  If we can move MrPresident to a new topic and that is party funding.  You deal with that at page 25 of the affidavit.  Paragraphs 51 and 52.  I must just say in closing off the first topic, that perhaps it would be apposite to talk in more detail at some stage if we get the time, about the solutions, that third category that are envisaged. But in the meanwhile if we can move on to party funding.  If I have left anything out, you will draw my attention to it if you need to Mr President.     Paragraph 51 the principle has    “There is an exception based on the ANC ...” ...[intervenes]     Sorry.    Not exception.  There is an    We can deal with the example of BOSASA, Eastern general terms.  It must have been knownto parties in government, in the administration and in the executive that BOSASA was heavily reliant on government contracts, certainly the Department of Correctional Services, if not other departments as well. It must also have been known that the ANC itselfbenefitted, at least in that elections war room and in a certain well publicised events that replace the former president’s birthday party for example and there were others. It may have been as you say that evidence about bribes, those events took place in dark corners.  But how could it happen than that the party continued to receive benefits from a company that relied heavily on government contracts without a thorough investigation of what was happening there.    And the same principles would apply to the activities of the Guptas being known as least in the media, and the receipt of donations by the ANC from the Guptas.  There is evidence to that effect.  It is in the Bundle 2 which you have.    And perhaps in the morning you could deal with the CR17 issue as well, in fairness to all concerned and yourself.     Then I would also need to deal tomorrow with the Dirco issue.  I do not know if you are aware of that perhaps.  We should try and get to the affidavits of Nyameko Koso and Francis Maloyi, who have submitted affidavits to the commission, stating that shortly after their diplomatic appointment to very senior positions,Mr Koso to consult general in Toronto in 2013 and ambassador Maloyi to Sudan in 2015. They were sent debit forms by the ANC for monthly contributions to the party.  So if we could deal with that ...[intervenes]    As well tomorrow.  There are other examples the Free State Asbestos scheme and the like, which is a particularly glaring example of how things could go wrong in procurement, but perhaps two months before it would be unfair to ask for an answer.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I will take the oath.    Is it safe to do so?    It is okay    My name is Matamela CyrilRamaphosa.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    Okay permanently?    Yes indeed it is my signature.    Yes.    Indeed.    Yes they are.    Yes you are correct.    Yes that is so.    Indeed.    Yes indeed.    Thank you.  I will be here.    Thank you Chairperson and thank you Mr Pretorius.  I appear before this commission as you have stated Chairperson at the request of the commission but I also appear to assist the commission in its work and I wouldlike make this opening statement on behalf of the African National Congress.When I was confirming that I would be appearing I happened to be talking to one of my colleagues who is also Head of State; we had to attend to some matter and I said Iwould be appearing before the commission and his reaction was Ah how can you do that as Head of State?  I said this is how our democracy works.  It works in such a way that when there are important matters that affect the state and the government and indeed the governing party we will not shy away from appearing before commissions so that we may shed light on the matters that the commission is dealing with and also be able to assist the commission in its mandate.So I appear here in my capacity as President of theAfrican National Congress having been elected to this position in December of 17 at the ANC’s 54 t h Conference.Yesterday our country celebrated 27 t h anniversary of the advent of democracy. On that day we ushered in a new era and as a nation we made a decisive break to the horrible past of colonialism and apartheid.The ANC working together with many anti-apartheid formations led and facilitated a process of crafting a new constitutional dispensation that is today the bedrock of ourdemocracy.This month marks 25 years since the first hearing of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into apartheid era human rights abuse.It was a remarkable moment in our history to holdthat commission the Truth and Reconciliation Commission demonstrating our determination as a nation to unearth and confront the crimes of our past so that we may make a decisive break with those violations of human rights and so that we may forge a better future for all our people.This commission on inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption, fraud in the public sector carries a similar responsibility.  This commission is the instrument through which we seek as a nation to understand the nature and extent of state capture to confront it.  To holdthose responsible to account and to take the necessary measures and steps to ensure that such events do not occur ever again in our country.State capture and corruption have taken a great toll on our society and indeed on our economy as well.  They have eroded the values of our constitution and undermined the rule of law.  If followed or rather if allowed to continue they would threaten the achievement, the growth, development and transformation of our country.  It is for these reasonsthat the ANC’s 54 t h National Conference in December 2017 resolved to support the establishment of this commission.The ANC has consistently expressed its support for the objectives and the work of this commission.  The National Executive Committee of the ANC has expresseditself in that regard and we continue to do so.The ANC has taken this position knowing that the organisation would itself be placed under great scrutiny and that the process of examining these matters would very likely be difficult and painful for the ANC.Nevertheless the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort to end all forms of state capture and corruption.The ANC’s position has been that it is the responsibility of ANC members and indeed all SouthAfricans to assist the commission in its work.Therefore I appear before the commission not to make excuses or to defend the indefensible.  The ANC has agreed to not only support the work of the commission but to assist the commission in every way possible to fulfil its mandate.My submission other submissions made on the ANC’S behalf are a number of my comrades and colleagues are therefore intended to provide whatever information context and explanation the commission may require.Corruption is not a new phenomenon in South Africa.The apartheid system was morally and systematically corrupt. Not only did its legal provisions appropriate to a small minority their assets and the resources that rightfully belonged to all South Africa’speople but there was also a prevailing culture of corruption within the apartheid state also within its state owned enterprises but it also went broader than that into private business establishments and the numerous Bantustan administrations that had been set up to organise our country.The advent of democracy in South Africa was an opportunity to make a decisive break with that past through the adoption of a new constitution we established a new era of transparency, accountability, ethical conduct andrespect for the rule of law.The experience of the past 27 years shows that endeavour to have been for the most part successful and its success can also be measured by the establishment of this commission which is in a very transparent and open manner opening up a can of worms of corruption and state capture.Our country has a National Parliament and Provincial Legislatures elected by universal suffrage and regular and free fair elections.  We are proud to have astrong and independent judiciary.Our democracy is supported by robust institutions and we have a free and vibrant media.An important aspect of the ANC’s approach to corruption over the years is a recognition of the extent towhich some ANC leaders and members were advertently and inadvertently complicit in corrupt actions and this recognition was well articulated in our conferences where we did say that we need to openly and publicly acknowledge that these are the problems that we have to deal with.And as a consequence the extent to which corruption contributed to practices, patronage, factionalism and the manipulation of organisational processes in the ANC is a matter of effort.The recognition of these facts does not mean that the ANC is itself corrupt or uniquely affected by corruption.  There are other institutions in society, various political and social formations as well as the private sector companies that have to confront corruption within their own ranks.  Nor is South Africa alone in the world in having to deal with pandemic corruption. Many other countries have to deal with corruption in the political, economic and social spheres and it is clearly not sufficient for us to recognise the problems.The task of any organisation like the African National Congress especially with its history of principled struggle, its values and its mission is to address the problem.It should be noted that why there is broadconsensus within South African society but a process of state capture took place over the course of several years.  It took some time for the term state capture to gain currency and for the phenomenon it described to clearly recognised as such.Therefor even though some of the incidents that I refer to in my submission may be regarded as instances of state capture they were not necessarily recognised or described as such at the time.And even as the term gained currency there wereindividuals in the ANC and in society more broadly who contested both the use of the term and the existence of the phenomenon.In my submission I outline how allegations of state capture arose within the structures of the ANC and how the organisation responded at different moments.Without going into detail in this opening statement it is worth mentioning that one of the earliest claims made within ANC structures of the possibility that members of the Gupta family may have had an improper role thefunctioning of the Executive was a statement by Minister Fikile Mbalula at an ANC meeting in 2011.To my knowledge the matter was not taken further by the NEC or in any structure of the organisation after he had mentioned it.At the time the statement did not prompt any specific concerns about the capture of the state.  With the passage of time more reports began to surface in the public domain about the alleged capture of public enterprises by a private interest and the undue influence of certain individuals notably members of the Gupta family in executive decisions and appointments.As the volume of evidence began to mount in the public domain the issue of state capture even if it was not described in those terms at the time began increasingly asubject under discussion in the National Executive Committee of the ANC and ANC structures.It was also a matter taken up more directly by ANC’s alliance partners, South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.  It was also ANC veterans and other outside structures of the organisation including service society formations including religious organisations.  Corruption is by its nature a covert activity.  Those who perpetrate corruption and related to crimes, generally, seek to keep their actionshidden or masked and disguise their intentions without direct evidence, without any investigative capability and mandate and in the face of the vehement denials.It is difficult for any structure to confront such activities.  In addition, the ability of any organisation butespecially a political formation to act on allegations of maleficiis relies not only on its formal rules and procedures but also on the balance of power within a structure.  The alignment of use within such an organisation is further influenced by access to the offices of state where the ability to appoint and to dismiss and even to dispense patronage is concentrated amongst a few individuals.  For the ANC this was compounded by its own subjective challenges.  The ANC took time at its 54 t h NationalConference to reflect on these subjective challenges and recognised the erosion of its organisational integrity as processes had been manipulated to advance the material interest of certain members and associated by that companies and individuals.This manifested itself in weak and pliable branches of the ANC.  It also manifested itself with both buying and gate keeping, factionalism and open conflict.  This provided fertile ground for state capture and corruption.  As I outlined in my submission, Chairperson,the ANC has over the course of several years recognised the existence of corruption within the state, within its own ranks and within other parts of society.It has taken a number of resolutions on measures to prevent corruption including on issues relatingto state capture.  These are evident in the statements of ANC National Executive Committee particularly from 2016 onwards which included a call for an independent investigation by competent authorities into these allegations.The question that arises is whether these resolutions and pronouncement were followed by a meaningful action to fight corruption and state capture.  In answering this question, we must acknowledge that the issue of state capture was a matter of great politicalcontestation within the ANC.  Differences over whether indeed state capture existed, its extent and form and what should be done about it, contributed to divisions within the National Executive Committee and other ANC structures.  These divisions were evident also in government, in Parliament and other sections of society and indeed the issue of state capture and corruption was prominent in the contestation that took place ahead of the ANC’s 54 t h National Conference in December 2017.  However, we would argue that over the course of time, through political debate and democratic contestation, the organisation took active measures to confront state capture.  This is evident, for example, in the events that unfolded in Parliament from late 2016 and into 2017, wherethe ANC and other parties initiated a number of inquiries into allegations of malfeasance and some state-owned enterprises and parts of government.  It is clear from the affidavit submitted to the Commission by the former ANC Chief Whip, the late Mr Jackson Mthembu but the determination by the ANC in Parliament to probe these allegations was both a response to the evidence of wrongdoing that was accumulating in the public domain and the implementations of the decisions taken by the ANC’s constitutional structure especially withNEC.The ANC’s 54 t h National Conference was in many ways a watershed moment in the ANC’s effort to confront state capture and corruption within its ranks.  Much of the discussion at the conference on the issues of state capture was framed by a diagnostic organisational report presented by the then Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe, on behalf of the National Executive Committee.  This report directly addressed the allegations of corruption and the involvement of ANC members andleaders in the broader context of state capture.  The conference consequently resolved to demand that every ANC member accused of or reported to be involved in corrupt practices should account to the Integrity Commission immediately or face disciplinary processes.  It also resolved to summarily suspend people who failed to give an acceptable explanation or to voluntarily step down while they face disciplinary investigative prosecutorial procedures.  Also, resolve to publicly exhaust this associate organisation from anyone whether business, donor, reporter or member accused of corruption or reported to be involved in corruption.It further resolved to ensure that ANC members and structures cooperate with law enforcement agencies, to criminally prosecute anyone of corruption and further itsaid it requires the ANC deployees to Cabinet.  That is National Cabinet.  Especially the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Police of Justice, the Correctional Services to strengthen state capacity to successfully investigate and prosecute corruption and account for any failure to do so.Now these resolutions, in more ways than one, signalled a clear determination by the membership of the African National Congress to acknowledge the organisations failing, to make also a clean break with corrupt practises and to initiate an ethical, political, andorganisational renewal of the ANC.Now following the 54 t h National Conference and in line with its resolution, the ANC embarked upon a process of organisational rebuilding and renewal.  This included corrective measures both within the ANC andindeed the state by the latter I dealt with more extensively in my statement to the Commission in the capacity as the Head of State which was presented.  It is important to note that these measures were informed and inspired by the mandate of the ANC’s National Conference which, as you might be aware, is attended by thousands of members of ANC branches across South Africa.In one of the areas in which the ANC has taken clear action is to require that members of the ANC who areformally charged with corruption, other serious charges must immediately step aside from all leadership positions in the ANC, legislatures or government structures pending the finalisation of their matters.Such members who do not step aside may be summarily suspended.  Furthermore, members of the ANC who are reported to be involved in corrupt and other criminal practises must go to the ANC’s Integrity Commission and provide a credible explanation for these allegations or reports.Should members fail to give an acceptable explanation, they may be suspended subjected to disciplinary processes.  In line with the ANC constitution, ANC members who are convicted of corruption or other serious crimes must resign from leadership positions andface disciplinary actions.It is worth mentioning that some of these requirements, especially on the so-called step aside provision, have in the past been the subject of much contestation within te organisation.  However, there is now broad support within the organisation or its implementation.At its most recent meeting on the 26 t h to the 29 t h  of March, the NEC directed that all members who have been charged with corruption or other serious crimes muststep aside within 30-days, failure which they should suspended in terms of Rule 25.70 of the ANC’s constitution.The ANC has embarked on a process of renewal to build a movement characterised by integrity, accountability and the highest standards of ethical behaviour but the process renewal is by itself a process.  It is not a one-day event and it is a process that is ongoing.The rate or progress is determined not only by the existence of political will and organisational capacitybut also by the continued existence of invested interest and resistance from those who have much to lose from the corrective measures mandated by the ANC’s 54 t h National Conference.I will now turn to some specific issues that theCommission has asked me to address.  The first of these are the ANC’s approach to pave the development and deployment.  This issue has been covered in some detail by the ANC National Chairperson, Mr Gwede Mantashe.  His testimony before the Commission, Mr Mantashe described the evolution and the development of the ANC’s policies, the principles that informed this approach under structures and processes that the ANC has put in place to manage cadre development and deployment.Since even before the advent of democracy, theANC has said that in transforming the public service to reflect the values of our democracy and the demographics, or better still, the diversity of our country, we must emphasise professionalism and competency.  This is reflect in our earliest policy pronouncement which were part of the ready to govern document which was release in 1991 as the ANC was preparing to enter government knowing that the level of support that it had would give it a mandate to do so but it was also confirmed at the 54 t h National Conference.The ANC fully embraces the principle that all public servants should undertake their duties in a fair, balanced and non-partisan manner.  It should be noted that the deployment of cadres to strategic positions is not unique to the ANC.  It is practised in various forms andthrough various mechanisms even if not always acknowledged as such by other political parties in our country and also in other countries.In our view, cadre development has acquired such prominence in part because of the perspective that there should not be political interference in the selection of people who work in the public sector.However, international practise suggests a more nuanced approach to this matter.  For example, an OECD working paper on publicgovernance published in 2007 written by a number of scholars including one called Martinsen, said that with specific reference to appointments of senior public service     With reference that you make to paragraph 21, indeed the ANC characterises itself as a liberation movement which we really have been from formation and largely because we were set up to achieve certain objectives and those objectives remain current, to be executed and you could say, in part, some of them have been – now have a democratic dispensation but we still want to pursue a truly non-racial South Africa.  That hasnot yet been truly achieved.  We are also a liberation movement because we seek also to attain a non-sexist South Africa, sexism is still rife in our country and it is also compounded by a continued violence that is perpetrated against women.  Butmore importantly, also, to attain a prosperous South Africa, that is an overarching objective and that remains what the ANC has as its objective, that characterises it as a liberation movement.  But in the midst of all this, it still has to be a political party that contests elections and in doing so, it then is supported by millions and millions of South Africans, so when it acts it needs to fulfil the mandate that it has set itself out to achieve which is informed by the ordinary people who elected because as we craft our manifestos, we do not do it just merely for ourselves as aparty, we go out and gather the views and aspirations of ordinary people and therefore, when we are then elected, we represent the people of South Africa and it is for this reason that we say we hold power not just for ourselves, we hold power and execute power – exercise, rather, power in the interests of the people of South Africa, the many millions who elect us and it is for this reason that we say – and it has been conceded that we are leader of society and what the ANC does and says quite often determines the mood in the country, determines the direction that thecountry should go, so it is the role that is given to the African National Congress by the majority of the people of this country and they expect the ANC to act in a way where it will lead government and it will lead transformation and achieve the objectives as set out by itself as a liberationmovement.     I would concede that, yes, they are entitled and in other ways we also describe ourselves as the ANC as the parliament of the people.  When the ANC was formed in 1912 we – the leaders of past then characterised even that moment as the creation of the parliament of the people because the people, as the wholeof the majority were excluded from the so-called parliament that existed there.  So yes, people are entitled to know and that is why the ANC for the most point has been one of the very few parties in the country that has been willing and prepared to open, as it were, its chest, its heart to thepeople of South Africa and admit its own mistakes and also set out the ways it seeks to correct much as sometimes, because it is a political movement, there will be contestation of some of the issues.     Okay, I will do so.     The deployment committee, as I said in my statement-in-chief, should really be seen as committee that recommends, the recommendationcommittee and having been the Chair of the deployment committee as Deputy President, the process that really gets underway is as follows, and maybe I am simplifying it.  The minister concerned, for instance when it comes to say state owned enterprises - or state entities, would come forward and say I need to appoint the CEO of one of the key state owned enterprises and in doing so, they will then have that post advertised, as they should in terms of the regulations and corporate governance and so forth and a message will then be forwarded to yes, the ANCdeployment committee, that there is a position that the minister will come to the deployment committee with to articulate what position they need to fill but then they will have triggered the process of – the formal process of filling that position.   So the advert then goes out so thatwhomsoever applies but then internally in the ANC people will then be encouraged to apply that there is a position, if you qualify, you could be one of those who are either shortlisted or whatever.  So the minister will then say we have shortlisted a number of people and in the short listing these are people who have been shortlisted.  Some of them may not even be ANC members, some of them may well be ANC members and what is then looked at by the deployment committee is to say we really need someone with experience.  For instance, if it is a railway entity of railways and who has been well-trained and well-prepared and all that, and having done that, the deployment committee could well say well, in our view so and so fits the bill.  It could be an ANC person, it could be an non-ANC person, completely unattached to the ANC, that we believe that this person can do the work.  And then it then goes off, it goes off to the selection – final selection process, that the minister then gets involved in with her colleagues in cabinet because an interviewing panel then is put up and if it is,for instance, a Director General, it happens in cabinet, if it is a state owned enterprise it happens in terms of company rules and what have you.  So that then ensues.   And then at times, Chairperson, the desires of the deployment committee are not even fulfilled.  They maywell have said we want so and so and it may not happen and we say that should be in terms of the prescripts of the law, corporate governance and the prescripts of the selection process in, for instance, in the public service. So having chaired the deployment committee, I know that for a fact that in some cases the deployment committee wishes may not happen.  So it is for that reason that I describe in the main a deployment committee as a recommendation committee.  And it takes into account a whole number of considerations.  You could ask are someof them political?  Yes.  For key positions where we seek to advance the mandate of the governing party?  Yes.   But where, for instance, the requirements and the experience of a candidate overrides that.  We then say we rely on this person as an South African to execute the task.     The process of selection of -let me put it deployment of people – has evolved, has been evolving and has been a subject of discussion even in our past conference and in recent time, the last conference, the issue of professionalising the civil service, professionalising state owned enterprises and getting people who are fit for purpose has become accepted and has become more current.  And as it has evolved, it has evolved from a past that did not necessarily subscribe to that.   So, as everything evolves, as everything improves and gets better, this is now where we are.  And to thiseffect even the Minister of Public Service has now embraced this process and it is now in the process of being fully implemented in government so we now have a new era, a new dispensation that is going to see to it that we have people who have fit for purpose.  So what the deployment committee will now to be doing is to yes, seriously ask itself whether people are fit for purpose.  Even as it will recommend certain people who could head any state owned enterprise or head any department as DG, it has to this as a filter and ask itself is that person fit for purpose as it recommends?  So I see – I do not see the two things as mutually exclusive, I see this process as being seamless.Chairperson, we do so because we are serious about correcting what has gone wrong in the past and thisis an important plank that we are working on to make sure that we build this up as an important pillar of improving state capability.  So when I will speak as head of the state I will talk about how we are going about improving state capability and this is one of the areas that I will address myself.     With respect, Chairperson, I hope you do not think that I am pedantic when I say maybe the two are not mutually exclusive.     And I say so advisedly because as previous chair of the deployment committee we did have a situation, some situations were – thedeployment committee will have identified two or three really suitable candidates and would say all of them, their names should go forward and in the end the final decision is then left to the final selection process in government.  So what you are saying is that could the deploymentcommittee not just identify instead of recommending, I would say the two are not mutually exclusive, it is impossible where two or three names have been sent forward and in other situations it has been a recommendation of one or so, so – and I take that and it is not impossible for the deployment committee to function in that way because all that it really seeks to do and should seek to do is to get whoever is fit for purpose, particularly now in this new, if you like, reformed era of making sure we do have people who are really good and fit for purposewho would be able to execute the task at hand without feeling that they need to pursue – advance certain side interest.     Yes.     Yes.     I do indeed.       I do want to say something, Chairperson, and I will paint to you the practical experience that unfolds at the deployment committee and it is good that you actually cite the situation of a ministerwho will come to the deployment committee.  Quite often ministers come to the deployment committee, having gone through a process, a pre selection process themselves and the various other officials or committees embedded in their own ministry, where they sift through a number of saypossible names. When they come, they seek to convince the deployment committee about certain candidates who may be short listed.  So in the end, quite often it is not even at the instance of the deployment committee.  It is at the instance of the minister, who knows and should know the skills, the experience that are fit for purpose for the task that they manage or they run in the ministry. So they would know for instance, the CEO of an entity what the requirements are and the deploymentcommittee does not know in full.  So they come to the deployment committee and seek to convince the deployment committee and even put up a pitted not fight, but argumentation of why the persons that they may want to see appointed should be recommended by the deployment committee. So that is the practical experience that I have had.  So the deployment committee, in the end it will tell people that apply, there are these positions and but it is the deployee in that ministry or in that who manages that stateowned enterprise, who would know in greater detail, in finer detail precisely what is required. So they seek to convince the deployment committee.  So if you like, the deployment committee therefore plays a recommendation role, but it also playsmore of a reactive type of role.  You could ask is there any desirability for the deployment committee and we would say yes, there is because it should serve as a filter.  We are a political organisation and what we do in government is very political, so you do need that political filter but it should also not be a political filter that will go ahead and appoint people who are not fit for purpose.  It should be a filter that will make sure and if you like, it should be a quality type of assurance, that in the larger scheme of things we are going to have people in seniorpositions who are going to execute the mandate as set out in the manifestoes of the governing party.      The – I think this is impractical, wholly impractical and to the extent that this may have been inserted here it could have meant thatthose who may well have been put in certain positions in the economy are meant to manage those centres very well, because it is improbable that anybody once you have accumulated capital for yourself you know acting in the economy you would then account to the organisation.   Itnever happened.     No, it is wholly misplaced because as I say it is improbable and could never have happened because if people are in business, they do …[indistinct] on personal accumulation processes and if they so want to donate money and give money to the movement then they should be able to do so and not that they should inherently be expected they should because they never would.     Well, this really should be seen in a historical context and this is where the ANC acting as a liberation movement when it was banned and in exile you were deployed wherever and you could not question where you were deployed and if you were – for instance Umkhonto we Sizwe you would be told you were going to be deployed on the Mozambican front or Lesotho front or wherever and you go, no question asked because you are the NS soldier and similarly people who were notin the armed forces would be deployed anywhere you’d be deployed to London, to Moscow wherever and this is a remnant from the past but today you actually do engage the discussion with a comrade and say, we would like to deploy you wherever but when – as President I appoint Cabinet, I say this is where I want you to go and quite often no question asked in fact no question asked, people are deployed as they are informed by their upper leader.  So, in other situations there are discussions because you have to take into account the circumstances of thecomrade.  You’ve got to take into account their skills space, you’ve got to take into account a whole number of other things.  So, my answer to this would be, yes and no and the no part would represent the considerations that you need to have and the yes part, in certain deploymentsituations you’ve got to agree to go where you are deployed.     Precisely.     Yes, you are correct, I mean,as you correctly say, Chairperson, this is commentary and this is apt commentary because truth be told we have had to deal with issues like that, the deployment committee and as the ANC broadly, careerealism, opportunism and some of these deployments have caused internal ructions within the ANC because we are a living organisation composed of people with interests and people with aspirations and ambitions. So, in the end you’ve got to manage all of that, very, very delicately and carefully so it is apt commentary.     Factionalism arises because members of the organisation, like it happens in any organisation would have different perspectives, different interests and some of the perspectives may be ideological some may be just organisational and some may even be economic where people have economic interest and they then cluster around those interests and become, say, a grouping within the organisation and become a faction that then feed on things that happen in the organisation be theysay, different deployments or appointments.  So, that then involves into distinct groupings that could be pitted against each other but then there could also be groupings that have a minimum – minimum sort of agenda that pulls them together but at the other end both ends there are differentones, ideological, economic, or organisational.     Well, that does happen and as any organisation would attest to, it is something that can be faced but it really beholds on the organisation whether it recognises that as a challenge and addresses it and I can never say that it has not affected the ANC and ithas and it is this that we’re now involved in, in our renewal process that we need to rid the organisation of elements, factions that pursue certain divergent interest to our broad strategic objective of advancing the interests of the people of South Africa.     Regulation, Chairperson, isrequired, regulation at a state level but because the ANC is so broadly supported, it is the leader of society, it has to do things not so much for its own interest but for the interest of the people of South Africa.  It, therefore, needs to embark on a renewal process so that it corrects allthese maladies within the organisation and if you like, clean up its own act so that it is much more presentable, even electorally to the people of South Africa and I comment on this in my document that over time we saw the electoral support of the ANC going down largely because of the corrosive corruption that our people found abhorrent and it is this, even at our 54 t h conference that we sought to address.  That we’ve got to arrest this and reverse it and it is for that reason that we embarked on a renewal process to renew the organisation and organisations do go throughthese ups and downs and that’s what we’ve also gone through, renew our organisation but renewal should not just be in theory it should be in practice, which is precisely where we are now.  We are putting into practice the entire renewal process and we – as it were, trying to herd everyone, everyone in the same direction and that is why I referred to the resolution that we passed at our 54 t h conference, were supported by thousands of members of the ANC who came from right across the length and the breadth of the country. So, what remains now is the fullimplementation as we move.     Ja, because I do recall once where vacancies were mentioned and it was just in passing, I should say that it was in passing and as itshould that the deployment committee would look at where are vacancies, but it never resulted or descended into saying this one would be good that one would not be good and so forth and it was just in passing.  So, I thought I should correct that.    But having said that my – under my Chairpersonship there was no involvement with Law Enforcement Agencies, like Commissioner of Police, NDPP and so forth, that never was the case.     Yes, I do, having listened to what you have referred to as put forward by former Minister Barbara Hogan I would say that, when dealing with these types of matters it’s better to be circumspect and not to throw the baby out with the bathwater because if there is something that causes an irritation it does not mean that you just chuck everything out because the deployment committee has a number of considerations that it needs to keep in mind.  One of those is, just having in mind the developmental nature of the state that we are creating thatwe need to focus on this, what we refer to from the OECD paper of the political aspect which, in our book, would be the developmental side of the equation where we need to keep an eye on the mandate that we’ve been given in terms of our own manifesto in terms of support because you want – let me give you a good example. You want, for instance, the CEO or even Directors, say of an Eskom, you know right at the beginning we wanted an Eskom to electrify the country and make sure that even our people, mostly the majority black people who never had electricityin their lives to have electricity.  So, that person must have a developmental as well as a commercial orientation and if you just have someone who has commercial, my grandmother in Limpopo would never have had electricity because that person would just be infused or you know,focusing on just the commercial that she will never be able to pay because she’s a pensioner and dah, dah, dah but you want someone who you know is going to be developmental who is going to have a very clear developmental agenda as well as a commercial one to make sure that that happens.  So, in the end it’s not necessary that they should be ANC members, no and in fact one would discover that.  The other consideration, which is very, very strong in our case, which the deployment committee oversees is the gender balance inall these institutions.  We’ve long gone past where we just have men appointed to various positions so the development, I mean the deployment committee focuses on that and says, do we have a clear gender balance, do we have sufficiently selected women who can get into key positions and it is due to the deployment committee that is today in Government, more – over and over now we have balanced Boards of Directors, we have balanced even in the state we’re seeking to balance – it’s a matter of concern, for instance, to the deployment committee thatthe Director General cohort that we have is largely male.  So, the deployment committee will intervene and say to those deployed in Government, you’ve got an over abundance of men in key positions we need to see a balance and – so the deployment committee drives that.So, that is why I would say, yes, we shouldn’t just tilt the pendulum one way, it should be balanced, and it should never be because someone is close to the ANC.  We should appoint people who are close to South Africa who are South Africans who’ve got the loyalty and patriotism, but we are also professional who we assure have a developmental type of approach to doing things and who would be willing to promote the ideals that the ANC or the agenda and the mandate that the ANC was elected. So, whilst I hear what Barbara Hogan is saying that, there’s nofurther need I would say, right now there’s even more need, however, deployment committee as decided by, even our recent conference must focus on ensuring that there are people who are fit for purpose, who are professional who know their craft who will go and execute their craft without fear or favour and who, themselves, will not be captured by any interest will just be there to serve the people of South Africa.     Chairperson, it is the latter.    Yes.     It is the latter because in the end it has to depend on the sort of final selection processes of that given institution or given position, say in Government.     And the processes.     Chairperson, as it often happens, it is in the end left to a selection panel that the Executive Authority that has been deployed in that terrain will put together for instance I’ve often seen how, forinstance, if a Director General has to be appointed the Minister will make sure that the selection panel is diverse but behind that there is another layer that really goes into thorough details and they often rely on external entities where external entities go through, in a very expert way,the identification of those people who could be appointed and then the selection panel also has a number of, say Ministers and Deputy Ministers who are well versed in that sort of area but let me also say that, you know, the deployment committee is also composed of people who are quite knowledgeable.  So, you know the deployment committee of the current period is composed of people from labour, people from labour are usually very sharp on human resource issues, you know, people from political type of organisation, people from community basedorganisation, women, and the youth so it’s a collection of people who are so diverse in their own experiences that in my view, gives rise to a wealth of wisdom in the recommendation of people which should be taken forward. So, whoever is then taken through a number of filters and processes before they are finally appointed.     It is something that we need, obviously, in accordance with what I’ve put forward that we need possibly to regulate that we should consider becausewhen you look at what other countries also do they – some of them go through similar processes and when we talk about the professionalization of the state with a view to increasing or enhancing the capability of the state, this is precisely what we now need to do because we do really, seriously need to ensure that capture of the state does not happen again.  So, we need to do things in a transparent, in a convincing way, whilst yes, because we’re a political organisation we still keep our eye on the mandate we have and ensuring that it is actually executed. So, it’s awonderful balance in as far as I’m concerned, we should really give rise to something that’s quite new, innovative, and really beautiful for South Africa, as we go forward.     Really?     I thought it was five o’clock already.    Yes.    Thank you Chairperson.  We had envisaged that we would stop at four.   But I guess maybe to – to be accommodative because there are other issues we have to attend to five o’clock should be fine.    Ja I would wait for another message that will be sent from my office.    About that and then we will indicate that.   Okay.    Okay.    Thank you.      Thank you Chairperson.  I did become aware of what Mr Enoch Godongwana did say and he starts off his assertion on the basis that transformation was central to the necessity to have a Deployment Committee and this started off 1994 because you will recallwhen we came into government we found an all-white headed civil service and it really cut across from the top to near the bottom and the bottom was largely black people and the top – the middle and the below middle were all white.And in the main male as well so it was pale males who dominated the civil service so it was therefore necessary to have a Deployment Committee that would address that anomaly.But today we continue to need that type of intervention because what we are seeking to do is to build adiverse nation. A nation that is united across the various if you like cultures that we have in our country but also gender.And transformation is not a one day affair; it does not happen all at one go it is a process that happens over time.  And it does need to be guided; it does need a strategicintent and for instance one of the key issues I should have alluded to was not only the gender issue but also a demographic mix.Each time when the demo – the Deployment Committee meets it looks at that.  Are we able to have a diverse sort of Deployment of people?  So that we do not have an all let us say African components of the civil service leaving aside white, coloured and Indian who make up what South Africa is all about.And you therefore need that Deployment Committeebecause that is part of our transformation process. Now the Deployment Committee asks itself those questions and seeks to create that balance because I have also seen that even in the government circles sometimes it is lost – that focus is lost and we have always believed that it can be better inspired and it can better led from political party point of view.And this Chairperson is not unique only to the ANC.  If you were to look at what has also happened to other political parties and I can think of a party that is also ingovernment alongside say the ANC like the Democratic Alliance.  They do have that as well. They do in the end get approval process for the appointment of people from the party and sometimes and this occurred when a case had to be handled by the Public Protector and Mr Bredell had to saythis cannot happen until an arm or a structure of the Democratic Alliance had to give its nay or yeah.So without getting into those processes I am just alluding to the fact that the Deployment Committee in other organisations is there even if they may not call it that and I guess the ANC in its exuberance has gone ahead to say we will call it a Deployment Committee and there had been other cases it happened as it happens.I know for instance and I have referred to it in my affidavit that even in other countries I know for instance with– with the UK particularly under Margaret Thatcher the question needs to be asked is that person one of us?  And there is even a book written to that effect One of Us.And what that meant was even in her governance of the UK they always sought to find people who were one of them and so this is not unique to the ANC and you could never say that in Margaret Thatcher’s era they were going through a hard core transformation process and maybe it was soft, harsh but they still needed to have one of them and in our case we are not necessarily saying they must be oneof us we are saying we would like to see that all these requirements are met because they are important for the development of our country and nation building and making sure that those who are given key positions in our state are representative of who we are as South Africans.  Thank you.   No we are not a member we are associated – they have always sought to have us as a member so – but we are not a member of the OECD.    Yes.    Well there needs to be balance between what I would say the political involvement of the governing party that I spoke about with ensuring that there is proficiency – technical proficiency, fairness in terms of service delivery and that those who execute such are able to be neutral enough and not to be biased in a partisan way.Now that is quite important and it is what we want toengender going forward to ensure that when it comes not only to service delivery but also to for instance appointments of people be it for public employment projects that public servants should be colour blind when it comes to that.  They should not be partisan, they should seek to serve the people of South African with neutrality, with fairness and they should demonstrate their own technical capacity and capability.That is so necessary for them to do so because the people that we serve are not blind when something is doneon a partisan basis they see it and once it is done that way it basically means we are failing the people and we are therefore even violating their own basic rights as citizens of our country.So we need to guard against that and we need toinculcate that culture and we will – we will seek even to – to have that approach also encoded in regulations also in legislation to the extent that we can.It is so important and that is why I in my statement in chief if you like referred to the OECD and Matheson at    It is not my fault.    So it is therefore important and I would agree with Mr Pretorius that we do need to have thatbalance but I would say that balance needs to be – to have a foundation and that foundation is what I spoke.  Thank you.    It would seek to address the problems that we have had where and I think Minister – Mr Godongwana refers to that in his – in his interview where we do have and admittedly so we do have some people in our civil service who are ill-qualified, who are not that fit for the purpose, who do not have those qualifications that are necessary.  Now we want to professionalise the civil service and that will happen in a variety of ways and we are not talking about chucking people out we are talking aboutcapacitating those people, having them properly trained and that is why the school of government – the National School of Government has moved into top gear now – moved into top gear in the sense that it is a really literally come alive in terms of its curricular, offerings, in terms of ensuring that many cohorts in the civil service do attend certain courses and we do want to move to a point where you know nearly everyone in the public service from President right down does attend lessons and courses at the School of Government on an annual basis where I even as Presidentwould know that I do need to go and spend a week at a School of Government and to address that incapacity that we have say for instance the grouping of people who are ill-qualified to be capacitated, courses should be crafted for them and they should acquire the necessary skills soprofessionalising the civil service that would be part of that process.   But also going forward it would mean that we then appoint people who are fit for purpose.  People who are well experienced but of course when we get say young people into the civil service the issue of experience is not something that it is actually something that the young people have said please discard that because we want to come in and once we are in then you should equip us with all the necessary skills and I have agreed with young people that exactly what weshould do and we should now find a way of encoding that. But in the end professionalising the civil service means that we want to increase the capacity of the state.  That is something that I am really if you like obsessed about because many of the challenges that we face in terms of implementation of our decisions and our policies revolves around the incapacity that we have in the state. And it is a fairly straightforward matter that we can address through this professionalization, through getting people who are fit for purpose, who have the experience andthe expertise and if need be we go out and seek them out and head hunt them so that we bolster the capability of the state. And that way I think we will – we will have achieved a great deal in this era of deforming processes that weredamaged in them.    That problem is recognised and that is precisely the problem that we will now addressthrough the professionalization for the public service. Now it is a lot of people 3301 and I would say we are not about to chuck those people out.  If anything we as the state are to blame for having brought in people who are ill-qualified.  We therefore need to address the problem but we need to address it humanely.  We need to address it taking into account the mistakes that we have made and the human rights or the rights of those people as per worker/employer and what then calls on us to do is to be innovative.  To be very creative of how we are going to capacitate all thesepeople.And it is not like you know they are done the heads or they do nothing they are doing something and we just need to – we channel their capability, their knowledge and the ability to do the work.  So it is recognised and that is precisely what we are now going to be addressing.The good thing Chairperson is that we have recognised the problem and often when you address problems and try to find solutions you should first know what you are dealing with.  You must know your business.  Youmust be able to count what you are dealing with and once you have done that then the solutions will come quite more easily and then able to execute them.    Ja.     [laughs]     Yes.  That is quite a broad sweep, I must say.  It is a broad sweep because each one would need to be looked at it on its own merits and you will find that a number of those never even featured in theDeployment Committee and I will need to do some recalling to see if any of those that you have counted - been featured in my recollection or not really.And let us accept Chairperson that some of those deployments were done in a particular era and in a particular way and right know as we look at that past slate whether able to look at it and say we actually need to do things differently.Move away from those types of deployment that happened and that ended up being or some of them being deployments that were not fit forpurpose, as I said in my opening statement.So I would not know be able to particularise each one of them because they happened when they did and right now I would say the Deployment Committee would not have dealt with a whole lot of those.  And I would say that the Deployment Committee today would deal with matters in a way that we have outlines with professionalism and all that, would be the real focus.     No, I was not – you know, as I said in my statement and in my – the bulk of my statement or affidavit and as I said, you know, some of these state capture issues became only evident in time as we moved on.  And that is why I even referred to the statement by Minister – or let me call him comrade, Comrade Fikile Mbalula for purposes of the type of evidence I am giving now here.  It was when he mentioned in an NEC meeting how he had come to know about hisappointment.Even at that time we were not alive to the fact there was state capture and there was something horrible wrong going on.  So some of these appointments would have happened in that course of time and one with hindsight then became aware that there was a common thread and if you joined the dots you would find that there was something that was amiss that was really happening.So at the time, and some of them would have happened even before I was even Deputy President, theprocess had been ongoing and only became evident what actually was happening then.     Yes, yes.     Chairperson, no.  It never goes public.     It has never been heard ...[intervenes]      ...to go public.    Yes, Chairperson as far as I know they do not and I guess in Siyabonga Gama’s issue, he was then seen as a fairly successful CEO and that would have been something that was generally accepted and he would have been seen as a type of person whose capabilities could have been Head of Transnet.  So there would have been side noises, noises from the side but certainly not from the Deployment Committee because it has always operated as, if you like,a rear dart type of committee.      Ja.     Ja.    H’m.     Chairperson, I certainly wasnot a member of the Deployment Committee nor was I an official at that stage.     But what I can address to you is.  There was and there is still a concerted move to ensurethat we do have as many black CEO leaders as possible, taking into account the diversity that we need to observe in our state-owned enterprises.  So that to me does not come as a surprise.  It is very consistent with the approach that we also currently have that we need to have good diversity.  That need to have diversity is so important and of course there are many who feel quite strongly about it to a point where they would     Patronage would mean that you appoint someone who is not fit for purpose.  Who is put in a position to advance certain sectional interests.  Someone who you know will never really be able to execute the task properly or someone who is being appointed in return for some other favour or some other process that needs to be met.  And that is patronage.  And it goes against the grain of what we want to achieve because we want people who are fit for purpose, who will be able to execute the task, and who are appointed without having some interest in mind which are sectional or even factional.  So that is what I would characterise as patronage.  I have not looked at the dictionary meaning recently but that is how – that is the political understanding that I would give to it.     Yes, Chairperson.     Not only be manoeuvrable but be compliant.     Be compliant ...[intervenes]     I think that is what you said complaint.     And ...[intervenes]      Yes, manoeuvrable and be loyal to use  ...[intervenes]      ...who have appointed themor who would enable their appointment.     And manoeuvrable in a sense where they will do their bidding and they were always be there to guard their interest.    And that is patronage and that is the crude diversion of what we want to see in the state.     Ja.     Yes.     Well, as we have said and which we have dealt with in the African National Congress.  We recognise that this is behaviour that has ensued and in recognising it we have come to the conclusion that we need to rid our organisation of patronage.  And in somecases we even say certain members join other members rather than the ANC.  Those are practices that we want to get rid off so that we free everyone in the ANC to know that they can stand in their own name and right and be appointed topositions in their own name and right.  And how we do it is to inculpate this morality.  And the renewal that we have been talking about is part of that process that there needs to be renewed morality in the ANC to enhance the integrity of the organisation.  And without doing so, the renewal process falls flat on its face.       [No audible reply]     Yes, that is where the interpretation of this recommendation process would come in.  And that is why I referred to the role of the minister because the minister as the executive or it plays a critical role because it is the minister who, in the first instance, knows and realises that the board’s tenure has come to an end.  I need to replenish the members of the board and these are the skills that are needed.  I need or we needaccounting skills, corporate governance skills, financial skills, you name it, environmental and so forth and we need to have a gender balance.So it beholds on the minister and I deal with this, you know, on an ongoing basis even now as President.  It beholds on the minister to then come forward     Yes, indeed.    Indeed, Chairperson.     Quite correct, Chairperson, and I think the work of your Commission is to investigate precisely that.  What I can say is that there was massive system failure and some of it could have happened advertently where certain people were put in certainpositions to advance certain agendas, as you are investigating now about the capture of some of those entities and – so what you are saying is germane to precisely what your Commission is dealing with and some of it was so hidden, so masked that you just could not seethat a certain individual was there to advance a particular agenda and that is why we rely on your Commission to ferret the truth out so that we are able to see – but as regards going forward and which is where your Commission will make recommendations and we will be able to overlay some of the form processes that we are involved in, we will want to have a completely new chapter, we must open a new page and be able to say when it comes to state owned enterprises, we have come from a horrible past that converted some of really top performing state ownedenterprises into a shadow of themselves today, so we now need to move forward with greater firmness in as far as populating not only the boards but the management with people who are capable, who are focused and, Chairperson, we are already beginning to see that.  That future that your Commission will point us forward to is already beginning to happen.   We are starting from a low base but already a number of those state owned enterprises are being reformed, rebuilt, re-birthed, if one can use – reborn, thatis, and a structure which possibly we will talk about when I come back as President of the state, the structure we will put in place by the state owned enterprise council is looking precisely at that so that the rules and regulations that we have put in place should not only be theoretical orin name only, they should now be, for lack of a better word, practilasised[sic] and implemented. So those are issues that are top of mind to me, personally, and they are also top of mind to the ANC because it is only when these state owned enterprises function properly with proper boards and having identified South Africans who are loyal to the constitution and to the country that we will be able to reform them. So basically I would say we no longer want people who will be appointed to advance certain agendas and wewill be scrutinising everyone more thoroughly and completely to make sure that we do have people who are fit for purpose and the term fit for purpose is what should be operative here.  It is an English term but it is a term that is very applicable to correct the wrongs of the past so that is how we are going to proceed.     Ja.     I am happy to give you a liner on that.     Because I think we will deal with it at the next session.     What we have had in the past – and I will just mention that in short, because we will deal with it , is that we had a very silo style of work where, youknow, almost everybody kept to their name and where there was no – a cross-dimensional type of collegiate involvement and I will be able to tell you, when I come back, that we are ridding ourselves of that so that there is more of a sharing of knowledge and experience in the workthat we all do so that if an experience is being – something is being experienced in one SOE that in a particular portfolio it should be talked about to see whether it mirrors another experience elsewhere so there could be this cross-pollination but maybe we will leave that until I come back.     No, it is fair proposition andhence we said, even in our conference, the 54 t h conference, we say we acknowledge some of these things had happened and we even had the courage to say it is when we acknowledge them publicly that we would be able to take remedial steps to correct them, which is precisely what we are involved in now because we have acknowledged and if you [indistinct] with that our ...[indistinct] people of this country.  So yes, we will acknowledge and say things went horribly wrong but we are here to work with everyone to correct those things and wedo so with humility, we do so, you know, in a way also by bowing our heads and say because we are, if you like, a feature of a superstructure of this country, we cannot run away from all these matters, we are here to build a democratic society in South Africa and that requires thatwe must confront corruption, state capture and deal with it and which is why I am sitting here and which is why some leaders of the organisation have also been here, because we want to go to the root of it, so – and as I said in my last paragraph, my opening statement, that this never happens again.     With your kind permission…     You know, leading up to the point or addressing the point you are making, I would, with respect, however, say that maybe I should be able to do that when I conclude my appearance before you foreverbecause there comes a day when I will appear before you and never have to do so again.     And you will not want to ever appear again.     No, I never would want to.  So I would say maybe when I end my evidence before you as President of the Republic.     Because quite a bit of it will touch also on what we should have done in the state andso forth.     Yes.     Precisely the issue of us talking about that – where we do acknowledge that there were and may well have been people who were put incertain positions when they were ill-qualified and they were certainly not really fit for purpose but they were appointed and whether it was clear at the time or not, that they were advancing certain agendas, you know, would not even be an issue then but the ill-qualification seemed to testify to a patronage behind that and that is precisely what one was addressing and something that we identified as a party that we are concerned about and what we want to vent from the party because, you see, in the party circle, ANC circles, it just fuels and promotes factionalism because people thenget to know that so and so is ill-qualified for this position but they have been appointed.  Why were they appointed?  And then people started looking behind the reasons why they were appointed and it then becomes evidence that they were actually appointed to advance certainagendas and that then mutates into the formation of factions and groupings that in the end become pitted against each other.   And that is how patronage manifests itself in a very ugly way.  That is why it is important to get rid of it so that when you look at someone who is appointed you just look at a plain vanilla ice cream and say this person was appointed because of their capability, for no other reason, no flavourant added and all that.  So that is precisely the approach that we need to have.    They happened – they have happened and the more we talk about them, the more raise everybody’s consciousness and awareness of it.  I was in the Free State yesterday and after addressing FreedomDay occasion, a number of ANC members wanted me to greet them and meet them and one of the issues, I had to receive a memorandum from a group of four people who were representing what they call as a business forum. This very issue is precisely one of the issues they raised, they said we have a problem that are jobs for pals, people are overlooked, there is no fair way in which people are appointed, and this like at the municipal level, and they were raising it in a very fervent manner and you could see in the way they were raising it that they were deeplyconcerned about this, as they should be because it evokes anger and the feeling of being overlooked by the state and it also demonstrates unfairness which people recognise.And I went to a bigger meeting and precisely the same thing was also articulated.  So this thing of patronage, of jobs for pals, is something that is abhorrent, that people see and notice and what should we do about it is a very relevant question and we need to be transparent in what we do.   In our selection processes there needs to be transparency so that people can see that everybody has a shot in getting either a position, a job or whatever and it should never be something that is done in darkness where people do not see because when it is transparent, when there is a proper process of either election or applicationthen nobody needs to worry because if you are selected and you are fit for that position and another person is not, then you have no real reason for complaint.  So, Chairperson, I may not have the various elements of all this now but it basically comes down to a simple process.  There must be fairness, there must be equity, there must be transparency and openness and there must be a very good process that listen, once we have all this then we are well-positioned because then we are accountable and people can see – and it must also start offwith being consultative where you are – where everybody buys into the system or the process and sees that it is going to be fair and without fairness and equity then we will never be able to address this malady that exists.     I would like to comment onthe Amathole one.     Because I thought that that case is so descriptive of how we should bring about change, that is the appointment of the Municipal Manager.     Yes.     No, I thought it was Municipal Manager.
RAMAPHOSA:No I do not have any objections. Who comes and say I am recommending the following and the deployment committee then examines that and it is often convinced ...[intervenes]  Ja, this presupposes a public representative.  An elected public representative.  Public representatives are substantively supposed to have acontract with the NEC.  When I was secretary general and I think even during the tenure of the subsequent secretary general, we presumed the situation where a public representative would literally accept their deployment as a public representative and sign a contract with the NEC. In the end, you know with the secretary general where they say I accept my deployment, so that where it comes to a point where they have to be either removed, it is a termination of contract, because in the past we face a situation where some would say I have been elected and I am not stepping down or whatever. I am not agreeing to being removed.  So it deals more with publically elected representatives and not so much with the appointees who would be governed by other provisions, which has to do with the appointment either inthe civil service or in terms of company laws in the public enterprise.   No, not under my Chairpersonship, no it did not.  So, we didn’t do so, I need, maybe on further reflection, need to maybe correct the impression I may have made when you asked me about those who would apply to the Judicial Services Commission.  There were some appointments where the Deployment Committee was not aware.  I will give you a very good example where I was involved recently as President of the Republic where in finalising certain appointments, I bypassed the Deployment Committee myself and on realising that, I immediately went  But the Deployment Committee does express its disquiet and dissatisfaction, may I say.  In the case that I was involved in, now as President, it was members of the Deployment Committeewho raised the concern which prompted me, finally, to go and address them and that was accepted but they never, not a single one ever goes public. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Ja.     Ja.     No, I would not except that what often happens, it is actually the minister who ...[intervenes]     Oh yes.    And I have been in situations where the minister would come back maybe two to three times.    And say ...[intervenes]     This is the best one.     And I want to convince you and even bring further documentation to prove the case.     And then I am not suggesting that the minister brow breeds the deployment committee intosubmission, but ...[intervenes]     That is how it often happens.     But having said that, your point is a good one and I would say yes, because I do not really see the two being so mutually exclusive, particularly because of the role that the minister does play.    As the minister should because theyare the executive authority who has been deployed to do precisely that.     Yes.    Yes.  It is what I would call a living document.  Living because as the ANC develops its own policies and polishes those policies up, so are these types of policies also being panel-beated into better shape.  If I can put it in that way.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, substantively it is supposed to have that, and I was also involved in the preparation and the drafting thereof in the past and I have not really kept abreast with the continuity of such, and I would say that if it has not continued, it is a very good instrument to have,because it helps to regulate the relationship in the end between the organisation and the person who is deployed. This would also apply to a president, where the president has a contract with the organisation, because even as president or minister or whoever you are, in theend deployed by the organisation because we have that type of political system.     Absolutely, I would say yes.  Just as right now we have even published as you might well know at government level and we can deal with that when I come as president of the republic.  Published the contracts Ihave entered into with the minister.    Chairperson, I undertake when I come before you again, I undertake to bring a box full of documents.     We are in the course of doing performance assessments now.     Yes.  So you may find a very incomplete process.     Including presidents, yes.     Maybe I will ask the Chairperson to assist me.      Yes.     This put simply is a political speak about the ANC exercising its leadership role in society.  That the more we perform well, in the state that will have acascading impact on a whole number of other institutions, be it whatever is your supporting bodies and all that, and we will all start working in a harmonious way. With the ANC imposing this very positive developmental approach to how we should develop the country going forward.  So that is what is envisaged here.  It is more political.    Precisely.    Ja, positive impact which is the leadership of society.     For the most part, yes it does.  But I say for the most part advisably, because in some instances the deployment committee never really get involved or concerns itself with this.  If you like the deployment committee has set itself its own limit that we will only limit ourselves in terms of how we function or recommendpeople to these key positions. For instance, the deployment committee does not get involved in the appointment of ministers to cabinet.  That is left to the president, but the president does consult his immediate colleagues which are the officials of theANC, but in the end in terms of the government system we have, it is the decision of the president and the president alone. So the deployment committee does not get involved in that.  When it comes to the entire civil service, that has to be read to mean the top leadership of the civil service, because it could never, it is not possible for the deployment committee to involve itself in the appointment of you know secretaries or you know, directors and so forth.But it does however get involved in the appointment of directors general, and to some limited extent to also deputy directors general, but for the most part, the civil service appointments are done within the civil service itself and in the end, even the minister does not also get involved in the appointment of directors. It is the director general who gets involved in that.  Of course with premiers, yes.  It is the deployment committee.  Provincial administrations hardly ever.  The positions of DG of the provincial administration is done atthe provincial level. The legislatures, there is a process of if you like deploying people there are legislatures as well.  The national parliament and provincial and local, which really does not even, the deployment committee does not reallyget involved with that, because that is more of a very vigorous and robust democratic process that is involved there. Local government and I explained somewhere in my affidavit, something quite innovative is now being done, as this has evolved in the ANC, where it is no longer only the branch committees, it is also the community that gets involved in the final selection of people who should go into local government. Parastatals, yes.They key top positions. Education institutions, hardly ever.The deployment committee like with cabinet, hardly ever get involved.  Independent institutions, only to the extent of your top key one, and for instance you will be interested to know that when it comes to the judiciary it is left to that process that we have in the law. Ambassadorial appointment.Those will be recommended and they are always often recommended by the minister.  The minister, and in the end because ambassadorial appointment are at the instance of thepresident. It is the president who appoints ambassadors, because in terms of our system, they represent the president in where ever they are deployed.  So that too is a process that he is engaged in, and the president in thosecases takes the final decision, but he will also have discussed it with some of the colleagues. So international organisations is even a much more complicated one, because we do not appoint people to international commission organisations.  All we can do is to recommend, and after that, it is left to the board as it were.  ADV PRETORIUS    It is.     It is not done.  It is just the very top key positions as I have said, yes.     Absolutely.   In the judiciary, no hardly ever.  Hardly ever and I think much as it might have been thought of, it has never really resulted in that, because the appointment of people in judiciary in our country, is so well managed through the dispensation we have through the judicialservices commission which manages all these matter so well and in the end my full understanding is that whenever there is a vacancy there is a lot of activity amongst the legal organisations and fraternity who encourage one another, that why do you not apply, why do you not apply, why do you not seek to be chief justice or whatever. So that is what I believe happens.  So that one has if any, has actually been very much likes touch and not at all in as far as I am ...[intervenes]     Not as far as I am aware.     We have always relied on what I havesaid now, yes.     Yes.     No.    That one is Mr Chairperson, is so relevant in addressing the issues we are dealing with about getting a person fit for purpose.  Where a person who was fit for purpose, who even in the interview process, clearly demonstrated that they know the job and when the other one was interviewed, they recognise this lack of capacity but still went ahead and appointed, and then they said we recognise it but we believe that this person will reallyimprove going forward, without adding other elements. I would put that in a distinct way to say when we bring in young people, young people we are saying we need to bring young people in, even without experience because we need to prepare them to play a role goingforward and then we capacitate them. So that is separate, but in this case the person who was finally selected, this did not have the way with all and they disregarded a person who was more qualified.  They then were unhappy and took the matter to court and the court said that person who had been rejected, should then be appointed. Now this is where we bring in courts, to do what we should do ourselves as a political organisation.  We should be the ones to say this is the right way of doing things. This is, these are the people that we should appoint and I highlight it because in many ways it points us to a future that we must have. If we recognise that the other person who was appointed wrongly had shortcomings, we need to prepare them, help them but still appoint the person who is going to advance the interest of the people as a whole, and we do not do that and finally we are guided by the [indistinct].So I am saying you know, that is the outsourcing process.A variation of the outsourcing.We areoutsourcing what we should do and when we should ...[intervenes]     The eye of the needle is quite an iconic document in the life of the ANC.  Much as it was crafted, if I can put it that way, in 2001.  It was crafted to deal with problems that we already saw emerging as we were in government and we were already seeing those varioustendencies which even Madiba spoke about in successive conferences in the 49 t h conference and in the 50 t h conference. Going forward, our conferences have dealt with these, and what is different now, is that if you like the eye of the needle, much as it identified those problems was articulating the theory if you like and the ideology that needs to be fostered and ensued in the ANC. What is different now arising from the 54 t h conference, is that we are moving from theory, what wehave been talking about now has to be attend to the tyre hitting the tar.  Where we now say this must now happen.  It must be practice. That is why even when the MEC met, was it in August?  They said we are drawing a line in the sand, and that is not being said lightly.  It was the NEC that after much debate and discussion felt that we needed now to draw a line in the sand and say this is what the ANC is about.  We are an organisation that should return back to its founding values. Its principles adopted in 1912.  We should be the type of organisation that is fit to be the leader of society in our country.  So that is what I would like to suggest and say is different.  The eye of the needle I would say, I am glad you have read it, is the most beautiful document thatsets out what are the problems. It provides an in depth analysis, but then it also talks about the ideal situation, and the time has now arrived for us to grasp the metal and then restore the image of the African National Congress.  I would say kenako, this is it.    Okay.    I am at their disposal.     Yes, I am at their mercy because theyknow my program more than I do.    That is fine, yes I will be up here.     Yes.    Ja.     Yes, the principle is quite clear.  The ANC would not knowingly receive funding from tainted hands, either tainted in the form of the donor being involved in acts of criminality and all that.  So that is very clear. The breaches themselves would happen in a way where maybe it is after effect, for instance businesses do donate money to all manner of organisations, including political organisations, and sometimes when they do do so, you do not know that those donations have come from entities that have been involved in unlawful contracts. That presents us with a problem, because the money has already been donated and to a political party it is often very difficult to say, because the political parties are always strapped for cash, especially the ANC, becauseas money comes in it is used for a variety of activities that you would say no, refund is possible. So the issue of the breach happens after the fact.  However, what we are saying now, is that through the political funding act there would be transparency and thatis why we say the coming into effect of the political funding act, is actually in many ways revolutionary. It has brought about a change and should be applauded by all in sundry.  Much as in the end it is going to depend on the fiscus on whether the fiscus will be able to support democracy and make sufficient funds available to political parties, so that they are not tempted to go and receive the funds where these types of breaches could happen. So I would say looking forward Chairperson, wehave got a saving sort of dispensation that is going to enable us to open a new chapter in regard to advancing our democracy and the political funding, funding for political parties. It is something that is new and which we should welcome and applaud because it rids us of all these processes where political parties receive funds from tainted entities.     Chairperson, it did happen.  It is one of the anomalous events that did happen.  What is prominent in my mind is to say what do we do to prevent it from happening, but having said that, let me say let me put on the one hand that the political funding act is going to be our saviour. On the other hand we should also say that if for instance a company donates money to a political party, and it so happens as well that in some way or fashion it does business with government, but that that funding is notbeing given to the political party in return for vetting contracts and all that. I would say when it happens openly and transparently then there should not be any problem, because if you are going to give money and you know thatit is going to be transparent, even if you have won a contract, the transparency itself will be such that it prevents you and it will alert the public that you should not be seeking favours. So I put that in a different category.  So the transparency, the openness for me is the biggest saving and also the limitation to the amount that should be given, because the limitation of the amount that should be given is going to stop any entity being able to have an overarching control over a political party. But in this case, it did happen and there is no way of running away from it or even hiding it, because it did happen that company BOSASA had contracts with government and which funded an ANC election room and all that. I would say having happened, unless there is something criminal about it, which should be pursued following the investigation by the commission, we should now say how do we make sure that we move to a new situation where they do not have a capture of that sort. That is what I will say.     Yes.     Certainly Chairperson, it does arise and in part it is one of those issues that you want me to address.     Which I have said that I would address at the end.     Because you are absolutely right.  The ANC should have been aware that there are all these problems in relation to this company, obtaining contractsunlawfully, unfairly and all that.  They should have been aware. So it is one of those issues that I will ...[intervenes]     That is right.    Ja.    Yes, I will.    Yes.     Okay, I can go to the beach and everything?    Okay.    Thank you.    Thank you, thank you.
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Perhaps it bears mention Mr President, that there are three issues that wewill canvass in the time allowed.  The first issue is, as you have elaborated in some detail, how is the system designed to work?  How should it work. The second issue is how, whether in part to the greater or lesser degree that may be debatable, how it did work in the past.  What problems arose.  You have mentioned some problems and we will come to it in a moment.
