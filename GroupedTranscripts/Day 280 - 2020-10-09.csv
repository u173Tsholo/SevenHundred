CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.      Are you ready?    Yes let us start.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    What is the page?    I see there is a handwritten pagination as well as a red pagination with the right numbers.    Oh 715 I have got.  Yes.    Well I must just say also that that    Has a context.    And the context is that I think on the same day if I am not mistaken but at some stage early this year when there was appearance for Mr Zuma his counsel argued that previously it had been said that dates – he would appear – that is Mr Zuma on dates to be arranged and they had construed that to mean it would be days that would be agreed with them.    I made it clear on that occasion when they were they appearing that that is not what was meant.    What was meant was the dates would be arranged within the commission and that I – I decide dates.    I have occasion to look at the transcript of that – of that date and counsel for Mr Zuma accepted and understood that explanation and had no problem with it.    He just said that previously they had understood it differently. So the question of this commission not agreeing dates with the lawyers and witnesses was dealt with at that time.  And it was accepted that the commission will fix dates and obviously if Mr Zuma has a problem with the particular dates that have been fixed he could bring an application and show that he has got good reasons not to be available and then if I am satisfied obviously I would change the dates.  So that is the context.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Yes I think – I think it is important for you to read that section that gives me that power.    For the benefit of everybody.    Yes.    On – on the wording of that section it seems quite clear that as long as a summons – as long as there is a summons is issued for the purposes – for the purpose of ascertaining a matter relating to the subject of the commission’s investigations.  That is enough.    That is the only requirement.    For example it does not have to be shown that the person who is being summoned does not cooperate or cooperates.  It is enough if…    There is a matter that the commission seeks to ascertain that relates to a subject of its investigation.  Obviously if a person is not cooperating there is even stronger ground.    For that.  But it seems that even without knowing whether somebody will cooperate or will not cooperate if the commission is satisfied that that person has information that relates to a matter that is the subject of its investigations the commission may summon that person.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Of course if one says, is there a matter that this commission seeks to ascertain from Mr Zuma that relates to the subject of its investigation we have got to deal with that as well.   Because – to show whether this requirement of the statute is complied with – is present.  And one way of doing so I guess would be to go to the Terms of Reference.    Ja okay.    Ja.    I think – I think we should – we should do that – you should do that at least those that may appear relevant.    Well of course the passage that you read relates to the observance of the Audi Alteram Partum Rule.    Now one should not take that part too far because the Audi Alteram Partum Rule is there for the benefit to – for the benefit of the person who may be adversely affected by my decision.  He has a right to wave that right to say well I do not want to be heard.  That he has a right to do and I cannot force him for purposes of observing that right but where I can force him as I understand the law is where I believe that he has information that may assist the commission in its investigation but then in that case I am forcing him not for purposes of hearing his side of the story I am forcing him in order to do my work to investigate the issues that I am supposed to investigate.  So as I understand the position  1. I need to observe the Audi Alteram Partum Rule until such time that I am satisfied that he is not interested in being afforded that opportunity.  But the fact that he is not interested in being afforded that opportunity does not preclude me from saying come I want to know certain issues that you are appear to have knowledge about.    And it is in regard to that certain part it seems to me where he cannot say leave me alone I am not interested in being heard by you.    I mean there can be no doubt that if on information available to me or evidence submitted to the commission by other witnesses there can be no doubt that if I form a view that a particular person may have knowledge or does have knowledge of matters that are relevant to what I am investigating I must take steps to get that person to come and testify.    If I do not do that I would be failing in my duty.    It seems to me that the position is if Mr Zuma or anybody who is said to be implicated by a witness, a certain witness is served by the commission with a Rule 3.3. Notice to say here is a statement from a witness who seems to implicate you in wrongdoing that the commission is investigating.  I mean that notice in terms of the Rules of the Commission advises the recipient of a Rule 3.3 Notice that you have a right to apply to the commission for Leave to Cross-examine this witness.  You have a right to apply to the commission for Leave to give evidence yourself and contradict whatever the witness is saying.  You have a right to apply to the commission for Leave to call witnesses who can corroborate what you say – your story.   It explains all of those things.  But you are not forced to make those applications.    You are free to say I am not going to make that application – those applications.  Those people can implicate me as much as they want, that is fine.  But once the commission says we are aware that you do not think you are implicated; we are aware that you have chosen not to apply for Leave to Cross-examine these witnesses but nevertheless we want you to come and answer questions provided the commission has grounds to believe that you may have knowledge of matters that are – that it is investigating you cannot refuse lawfully.    Obviously if there is a specific reason why you cannot appear on a specific date that is different then you put your case before the commission to say, on that date – on that date I have to see a doctor. I am not well bla, bla, bla.  If the commission is satisfied that it is a genuine reason it will give another date.   But of course with reference to the recent correspondence from Mr Zuma’s attorneys one of the reasons that have been given recently why Mr Zuma was not prepared to come to the commission on the 21 to    25 September is this one.  It appears in he – the letter of his attorneys dated Tuesday September 1  paragraph 5. “Further we wish to point out that President Zuma is preparing for his much anticipated criminal trial the importance of which cannot be over emphasised.  It is rather unfair to expect President Zuma to simultaneously consider evidence and affidavits of more than 30 witnesses in order to make himself ready to appear before the commission on 21 to 25 September 2020.” And then later on in – in the same letter at    Well on the information…    Provided – on the information provided this is not a case where he was saying the dates that you have given me on which to appear before the commission fall – are the same dates when I must – I am supposed to appear in the High Court for my criminal trial.  That would be different.  That would be different.   But that is not what the letter was saying.  It was simply saying he is busy preparing for his criminal trial.  It does not say when the criminal trial is going to happen.  But in the end even if the criminal trial was going to happen soon he would have to appear before the Commission and then     I am now asking for you to give me more time in order to prepare for the trial     Not to say    Ja.  And you see, as I see it, that particular statement in the letter means that that is a belief that he holds that because he is preparing for this criminal trial, he does not have to come to the Commission.   And if that is so, if he has that believe, how can he come before the Commission at any stage before his trial happens?   Because the closer the... as he approaches the trial dates of the criminal matter, the more time he would want to spend preparing for that criminal trial.     So the question is.  Can that person ever come before the Commission voluntarily before his criminal trial happens?     Yes.     H’m, h’m.  Yes.     Well, I am going to... I was going to go straight to the Terms of the Reference.     Yes.  Well, you could read the relevant parts that refer to him.       Okay.     I think if you go back to... or maybe I can just have a look.  One point one, among others, that is of the     Brics Bank, I think.  But the job never happened.  And I have heard evidence from somebody from the bank who said that is not how the bank... that bank operates.  It has got policies and procedures and Mr Zuma had no say, had no power to force the bank to take Mr Jonas.   Mr Jonas himself said the... his position as Minister of Finance was higher than the position that Mr Zuma was talking about in the bank. And Mr Nene said, actually, the... Mr Zuma’s reason for dropping him, that he was to go to that job, was a fabrication.  That is what Mr Nene said before me under oath here. So the question is.  How come somebody from the Gupta family knew in advanced that Mr Nene was going to be fired?      And Mr Jonas says, at that meeting, the Gupta brother also told him that there are people that they work with and he says one of them is Mr Brian Molefe, another one is Ms Lynne Brown, Minister of Public Enterprise at that time. And when Mr Gordhan gave evidence before the Commission he said he heard that when he was fired in 2017 by Mr Zuma, Mr Zuma told the Top Six of the ANC that he wanted to replace him with Mr Brian Molefe.  And the Commission subsequently asked some members of the Top Six, Mr Gwede Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize and Ms    And Mr Zuma must enlighten the Commission on all of these matters.     H’m.  I mean, I am hearing evidence these days relating to Eskom.  And hearing evidence from Mr Tsotsi and from Mr Nick Linnell.  It is to the effect that, Ms Dudu Myeni called Mr Linnell to Pretoria and said you... I need you to come and meet with the president.  He came.   The president did not meet them then but then he was     And the acting DG at the time says, when the President called her because he said he could not find the minister or deputy minister.       I cannot ignore these things when I asked     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     Ja, is replete.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I mean, there was evidence by some of the people who were senior officials within the Intelligence community that their departments had... or units had conducted certain investigations of criminal nature.   And the minister serving under Mr Zuma or State Security, Dr Cwele called one of them to a meeting at the airport where he told them, according to the evidence placed before me that President Zuma had said that the investigation should be stopped.  I need to look to all of those things.     How can I ignore those things?     How can I ignore all of those things?  And all I am doing, I am doing my job to establish exactly what happened.     So that I can prepare reports that is based on evidence that has been presented by cross-section of people.  And if he is implicated, I am giving him an opportunity to come here and clear his name.   But I want to know what he has to say about those things.  He might he does not want to clear his name.  That is fine.   But I want to know what he knows about the things that have been said.       Well, in terms of the agreement that was reached on the 19t h of July, when he was before the Commission, you were... the legal team of the Commission were required to furnish his lawyers within, I think, two weeks with a document that would indicate the areas of interest in the various affidavits that he had to focus on and responding.  And the agreement was that, as far as I can recall, once you had furnished his lawyers with such a document, which you did around, I think, on the 30t h of July.     Oh.     Or first week, ja.     Yes.  Once you had done that...     Yes, I think it was.     Ja, I think a lot of ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Once you had done that, you and Mr Zuma’s counsel were supposed to agree a date by when they would file his affidavit or affidavits.   And if the two of you did not agree, the arrangement was that you would then bring that issue to me and I will decide the timeframe.   Now from what I read, one, they did not file affidavits.  Two, they did not... they do not seem to have reached any agreement with you.   And they promised at some stage, I think from what I read in the correspondence exchanged between yourself and them, that Mr Zuma’s affidavit or affidavits would be filed on the 13t h of September, last year.  That did not happen.   Subsequently, they kept on promising that they would be filed.  They have never been filed.   And no condonation application has been filed and no explanation, as far as I recall, has been proffered to say what is the difficulty to the extent that he may be saying in his affidavit, at a certain stage he fell ill and that impacted the preparation.   It seems that that was long after the deadline had happened.  And there was simply nothing coming from them.     H’m.     Yes.     Of course, Mr Zuma’s might not be here today but they had filed his affidavit opposing this application.  One of the issues that arises is this, when I invited Mr Zuma last year to appear before the Commission from the 15 to the 19 July, they criticised me for inviting him saying that that is not provided any rule saying in terms of what rule are you inviting our client, you know?  And when it was – you know, it was just a courtesy, you know, to say let us not issue a summons because he has promised to cooperate with the Commission, they seemed to have an objection to say why are you not acting in terms of the rules …[intervenes]     Now the legal time has now applied that I should authorise a summons, then they oppose that and say you make it as if he is not cooperating.  So when you act and show courtesy and say come and appear before the Commission without issuing a summons, you are criticised.  When you say okay, let us issue a summons, then you are criticised.     I mean, there are many people who have been requested by the Commission to appear before the Commission and they have never had any hesitation.  We have told, you know, Mr Zuma’s attorneys before – I was looking at the correspondence here, that I told the President, current President that before the Commission finishes its work it would be important that he comes and gives evidence before the Commission because the matters that the Commissioner is looking at, state capture, happened at a time when he was Mr Zuma’s deputy.  The current President had no hesitation, he said you are right, I am going to come.  You tell me when I must come and I will come and I said the ANC must also come and I was told the ANC has no hesitation to come.  The Commission has approached other leaders of the ANC, Mr Mantashe, and asked them to file affidavits without compelling them and they responded by filing affidavits.  Mr Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize, Ms Jessie Duarte, the President himself was asked, without being compelled, to file an affidavit about whether had had any interactions with the Guptas.  He filed his affidavit, he did not have to be compelled.     He did not complain that there was no rule for making such a request.     Ja, I mean, all it seems is I am not supposed to ask him to come, I am not supposed to authorise a summons to be issues to compel him to come, so …[intervenes]     So I guess I am supposed to just fold my hands and not do anything.     I think the one question that I think you will need to deal with is to the – it is two questions, one is whether when the point Section 3.1 says that the Commission has got power to summon witnesses, we know that this Act is a 1947 Act, it is very old, at that time there was only one way of summoning that could happen.  One question is whether that summoning in this day and age would include summoning a witness to appear and give evidence by video link or in any other way that may be done with technology.  I raise that because you will remember that in his attorney’s letters one of the things they say is that because of his age and Covid-19 his doctors have advised him to limit his movement. So the normal way of – when a summons is issued in any court to be served on somebody to appear before that court, it means that that person must physically come to the court. Now the question of Covid-19 may well be something that needs to be looked at.  I do not have a problem if – I will not have a problem if he were to say for Covid-19 reasons I would prefer to give evidence via video link.  As long as he does so within the borders of the Republic and not from outside, I would not have a problem, I have indeed authorised the giving of evidence by some witnesses via video link.  I think one of them was Mr Mkhwanazi who asked when – I do not know which level, at level we were in, said for Covid-19 reasons he was reluctant to travel and he asked if he could give evidence via video link, I authorised that, it happened.  So I could do the same with Mr Zuma if he has a legitimate reason that because of his age.     So – but the question is whether summon witnesses as used in Section 3.1 is wide enough to encompass that meaning.       Of course maybe if it does not, if it not wide enough to encompass that meaning, it may be that the summons might include something to which we will say if he wishes to give evidence via video link and he advises the Commission timeously on those dates then his appearance, via video link, will be deemed to be compliance with the summons.  I am not sure.  What do you say about that issue?     Oh.     No, it is important.     Well, maybe I should adjourn while they are attending to it.     Yes.  We will adjourn for a few minutes.  Hopefully they can sort out the sound quickly.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I understand the sound is back.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius, I just wanted to say – I just wanted to say that the regulations of this Commission, which were promulgated by Mr Zuma when he was President include Regulation 10[6] and Regulation     Yes, yes.       Yes, the one approach may be to take the summoning to be wide enough to include a video link, another approach might be what I said earlier on to have the summoning as it would be in a summons but to have something that says either maybe in the summons that says if the witness, if Mr Zuma through arrangements with the Commission appears via video link on the days that are specified that will be deemed to be compliance with the summons.     Yes, because then it gives him an opportunity that if he has no problem giving evidence but he has a problem because of his age and Covid 19 then that is taken care of, it can’t be advance as a reason for not appearing whereas if that is not done he might say the Covid situation is a good enough reason for me not to appear so but if one – if that is dealt with that way then he can’t advance that, that reason.     Well one of those, I forget which one, was I signed the regulation 10.6 directive, I think on the 28 t h of August.  That may have been the one relating to the affidavit of Mr Tsotsi and so on, or it may have been the one relating to Mr Popo Molefe’s affidavit in evidence about PRASA issues and subsequently I signed another directive requiring Mr Zuma to file affidavits.   So this is different, in the past there was a request in 2018, that request has never been complied with, there was an undertaking that the he would file an affidavit dealing with responding to General Maseku’s evidence and Ms Mentoor ’s evidence.  That has never been filed. Then last year when he appeared before the Commission there was an agreement, you referred to it ...[intervenes]  ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, and agreement that was concluded with him through his lawyers, and which I announced publically and I remember after announcing the terms of that agreement I called upon you and his counsel to confirm that I had correctly recorded the terms and both of you confirmed and he had agreed through his lawyers to file an affidavit, or affidavits responding to various affidavits of witnesses who ...[intervenes]      Yes, that affidavit, those affidavits have never been furnished, so whether you request him to file an affidavit you request him nicely, you don’t get an affidavit.  Whether there is an agreement with his lawyers or an affidavit he will file affidavits, you don’t get those affidavits and now when you issue a directive, because ...[intervenes]      Sorry?     Yes, now the last time I heard was that the directive that I issued on the 28 t h of August compelling him to file an affidavit I cannot remember whether it was in regard to the Eskom matter and the Durban meeting or whether it was in regard to PRASA, but the deadline which had been given the last time I had it had come and gone and he had not filed any affidavit and in regard to another one I suspect that the deadline has come and gone, but I don’t – I haven’t been told whether he has filed an affidavit. So whether you make a request nicely he won’t file an affidavit.  Whether you reach an agreement with him and he undertakes to file an affidavit he won’t file it.  When I issue a directive in terms of the regulations, at least in regard to one he did not file an affidavit within the time that was given and to my knowledge he did not file an application to request an extension of time and in terms of the regulations as amended failure to comply with a directive issued by the Chairperson in terms of Regulation [6] failing to comply with it without sufficient cause is a criminal offence.     It was never done.     Yes, yes.  That is the order I am making.     Yes, you are excused.  We will take a short adjournment and once the witness here for today is ready then I will be called. We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.    Yes we are Chair.    Set down for this morning Chair is an application to authorise the issue of summons in respect of the former President Mr Zuma.    Long heads have been prepared and they have been delivered to you.     We have prepared a note for oral argument which summarises the major points to be made and if I could take a few minutes to put those before you?    Notice of this application was given by email to Mr Zuma’s attorneys on Friday 18 September .  That appears at page 781 of the bundle that you have.  The application its time and date was also announced publicly on the 21 September 2020 that appears at page 790 of the bundle. In response to those notices Mr Zuma’s attorneys addressed a letter to the Chair giving notice of application for the Chair ’s recusal.  That is at page 791 of the bundle. Paragraph 12 of that letter at page 794 says the    715.    Yes we looking at the red numbers today Chair.    Where you stated as follows from line 10. “The commission’s legal team will deliver a replying affidavit on or before close of business Friday 24 January.  That is 1. With regard to what is going to happen in regard to this application that is the application for a summons in January 2020 Chair and the further appearance before the commission of the former President what has been agreed in the discussion involving myself and counsel on both sides is that this application is to be adjourned to a date to be arranged and I hasten to say arranged does not mean agreed.”   So by your directive Chair you recorded an agreement between the legal representatives of both parties that the application for a summons would be adjourned to a date to be arranged and this is the date so arranged.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair and that – that position is confirmed in the Rules of the Commission.    Where the rules and the consistent practice I might add is that you as Chair determine the dates, the order of appearance and in fact who will or will not give evidence.    So Chair the rules, the record as well as the consistent practice are all confirmed by the arrangement now that you determine the dates.    Chair the power of the commission lest there be any doubt certainly in the public mind to issue summons is set out in Section 31 of the Commission’s Act which states very clearly that you as the commission have the power of a court of law to compel attendance by way of summons.  So that is a statutory power that you have and it is a power equivalent to that of the High Court.  That section is quoted in the long heads before you Chair at Footnote 2. Chair insofar as there may be any dispute as to whether this application for the authorisation for the issue of summons can and should be granted it can be resolved by reference to legal principle and by reference to what are incontrovertible facts. There are in our submission grounds to issue the summons.    Yes Chair.    Section 3 of the Commission’s Act deals with the commission’s powers as to witnesses.      “A commission shall in the union now the republic have the powers which a Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa has within its Province to summons – to summon witnesses. To cause an oath or affirmation to be administered to them.  To examine them and to call for the production of books, documents and objects.”    That is the qualifying…    Requirement yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    If there is any issue to be raised.    Or if on a particular date which the summons authorises for the appearance a person who is subject to such a summons has every right.    To deal with those matters.    Either before you or in a court of law.    So there is no question of any legal infringement of anybody’s rights here.    Quite simply Chair you exercise your discretion on the qualifying requirements.    And that then authorises the lawful issue of a summons.    And in fact it is a necessary mechanism for this commission to do its work.    Yes.    Yes we will do that Chair.    The – we can read the Terms of Reference if you wish.    We have them here.    Yes.  There are two points there Chair.  The first is that insofar as Mr Zuma’s evidence is subject to the investigation of the commission one could have reference to the Terms of Reference themselves but also to the witnesses who have come before the commission.  34 witnesses have implicated Mr Zuma. Now over and above the requirement of the Section 3.1 and the requirements of the Terms of Reference which delineates the mandate on your Chair for your investigation there is a duty at common law and it is being emphasised in a number of recent judgments that obliges the commission to call Mr Zuma to answer those allegations. If I may just read one passage of a judgment in the matter of Msiza versus Advocate Motau and the Prudential Authority of the South African Reserve Bank.  Paragraph 55    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair the – that in our view is accurate subject to one qualification which I will come to in a moment.   Of course there is distinction between the duty on the commission to give every opportunity to an implicated person who states his or her side of the case.  And the implicated person then has an election whether to exercise that right to speak or not to speak. The duty of the Chair to investigate arising out of the Terms of Reference and that is a duty in respect of which the Chair has no discretion.  You must investigate and we will come to the grounds upon which we submit Chair and you have said that there is a duty on this commission to explore those to investigate those issues where the former President has evidence or can give evidence to inform your findings.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  Chair in correspondence and this is the qualification I have to the propositions that have been put now.   The former President has asserted that he is exercising a right not to participate in the matters of the commission and by exercising that right he is in fact participating. There is no right not to respond to a 3.3 Notice implicating a witness.  That witness has an election. He may say or she may say, I am not going to respond or I am going to respond.  But there is no right not to deal at all with the matters which are the subject of the commission’s Terms of Reference if the commission determines that a person must come. So insofar as there is alleged by Mr Zuma’s legal representatives to be a right not to respond that is incorrect.  It is not a right not to come to the commission. There is no such right. There is an election not to answer a Rule 3.3 Notice to put a version or to cross-examine a witness.  But there is no right to say I am not coming to the commission at all.    Correct.    Correct.  Correct.    25.    Well in our submission no because the – the point about that – that paragraph in that letter is that is a situation that will prevail for the life of the commission.   And the commission must conclude its evidence by September and one of the reasons procedural reasons for the issue of summons is to enable the commission to consider the former President’s evidence before the commission ends which is in December.  Certainly the evidence must end by December to enable you Chair to write your report by March next year.   So in the circumstances – particular circumstances of this case our submission is that it is not a good enough reason to – to refuse to appear.  But if the former President does believe it is you Chair will exercise your discretion in terms of your mandate and you will exercise your discretion in terms of the directives that govern your chairing of the commission.  If he believes there are grounds not to appear on a particular date he is free to – to raise those with you.    But not in those general terms.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  Quite frankly, Chair.  The Commission has a job to do.  It is obliged to do it.  The fact that there are other mattes that the former president must attend to may or may not be relevant, but it is certainly no basis for a blanket refusal to come on those grounds at all and frankly on any date.     Correct, Chair.     Not on what is contained in that letter.     So whilst the requirement to appear in another forum may be a reason to ask for particular dates to be changed, certainly not as it appears there, grounds for a blanket refusal to come before the Commission.     Chair, the issues that we have covered in our written submissions, therefore covered two principle contentions.   The first is to say that Mr Zuma’s evidence is both necessary and desirable for the work of the Commission.  That we will establish and have dealt with in detail in the written submissions. The second is why it is necessary that summons be issued to secure Mr Zuma’s appearance at the Commission to give evidence. Now Chair, that is an added reason but it is not a necessary reason.  In regard to the first issue, if I may refer to paragraph 12.1 of the written submissions. In summary Chair, Mr Zuma’s evidence is a necessary part of the Commission’s work for at least the following reasons.   Firstly, much if not most of the corruptions, an act which might constitute State Capture occurred during his term of office as President of the Republic. Secondly, the Commission’s Terms of Reference refers to Mr Zuma directly in a number of paragraphs.  If I may just ask you, Chair, to look at page 808 of the bundle.     Yes, they are there.     I will do that.  The Terms of Reference are... they are included in the bundle.     Paragraph 1.2 reads    Brics Bank.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes, Chair.  Chair, there are, apart from those Terms of Reference, there are other Terms of Reference where Mr Zuma’s evidence would be necessary for the Commission to complete its investigations adequately.   The 1.6 which talks about government advertising in the New Age Newspaper and other undue benefits to the Gupta family.   There has been evidence directly implicating the former President.  Mr Sundaram’s evidence, for example, where you have asked for information from the former President which has not been forthcoming.   So there are a number of... there is the evidence, for example, of the exchange and the study of the former President at his residence in Pretoria, Chair.  Where the Gupta’s demanded “favours” from the then Minister Shabangu in relation to mining licenses.   All those issues are issues that need to be addressed.  And the evidence to date is replete with such examples where it is necessary for you Chair to investigate these matters as a matter of your Terms of Reference.     Yes.     Correct.     H’m, h’m.  And you have been cautious to say that no findings have been made.     But you have evidence before you ...[intervenes]      ...which requires investigation.     And as night follows day, evidence implicating the former President must be examined, including through the evidence of the former President himself.       There are other examples.  Chair, the record is ...[intervenes]      ...replete of such evidence.     Direct interference in the activities of law enforcement agencies.     Appointments and dismissals.     The meeting with Gavin Watson ...[intervenes]      ...in relation to the BOSASA prosecution.     Those sorts of issues ...[intervenes]      ...need to be dealt with.     Correct.     Yes, Chair.     Correct.     Yes.  Chair, in summary then.  In evidence before you and to date, and I stress to date, because there is more to come.   Mr Zuma has been or may be implicated by the evidence of at least 34 witnesses.  That perhaps is enough to qualify, certainly under Section 3(1) of the act.   Chair, in relation to the second issue that is why there is an added reason that it is necessary and desirable for a summons to be issued.  The Commission, quite apart from its mandate, the law, but as a practical consideration, requires certainty in regard to the fact of Mr Zuma’s appearance and the dates of his appearance. We are simply so close to the end of the Commission’s hearings that the proper and efficient functioning of the Commission would be rendered impossible unless we have that certainty and you are entitled to take that into account in the exercise of your discretion. The history of Mr Zuma’s cooperation or lack thereof with the Commission, is set out in the written submissions.  Paragraphs 18 and 19, Chair, you during 2018, requested Mr Zuma through his legal representatives to provide a response to the evidence of Ms Mentor and Mr Maseko.  That has not been forthcoming. You will recall the well-known areas of interest undertaken.  There have been and this... the paragraphs of the heads and perhaps, I should just mention one or two. The most recent undertaken.  Just to put that in its context.  At the last appearance of the former President where he seized to answer questions, to put it at its lightest. An arrangement was made and an agreement was reached that the legal team would provide a document containing areas of interest. There was an agreement and repeated promises that that areas of interest document would be responded to.  It has not been responded to.   In his opposing affidavit dated the 13t h of January 2020, that is the opposing affidavit to this application, Mr Zuma     It was slightly later.     It was in the first week.     Of the following month.     I am told it was the 30 t h, Chair.     But there were some administrative hiccup.     In any event, it was delivered.     Well, Chair there were repeated undertakings.       On 12t h September 2019, Mr Zuma’s attorneys confirmed that he would provide his answers to the areas of interest document previously provided to him.  And then Chair, on the 30t h of September, Mr Zuma’s attorneys requested a “indulgence” to provide the Commission with the answers to the areas of interest by 20 October 2019 and simply after that nothing has been forthcoming.   Even in January this year, in opposition to the application it said the document is ready, I just cannot finalise it.  Ten months later we still do not have the document here.       So the import, let alone the implications of that are clear.     Of which led to summons.     Then you not being polite.     Yes.     Yes.  Chair, I must stress that the application by the legal team has not been prompted by the notion, which is a preposterous notion, frankly, that you are not allowed to issue polite invitations because the law does not expressly say, you know, you may do so.  There are good legal and factual grounds quite apart from that.  But the proposition that you are not entitled by law to issue a polite invitation to witnesses to come before the Commission to give evidence voluntarily cannot stand.     But when you do…     Yes, Chair.  The test, of course, is you have a duty, you have a discretion, you have a mandate and you have the power and that must be exercised reasonably in terms of discretion and all the facts that are incontrovertible, Chair, and I will deal with some more now and make it certainly beyond, in our submission, any doubt that that discretion would be reasonably exercised.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  The section has a timeless element to it because it says you, as a Commissioner, have the powers that the High Court has and that power has been interpreted and applied over time.  In fact the legal team has done an opinion on this which we can let you have, obviously, but I do think it is somewhere in your own archives as well, the many files that you have.   I am told that there is no sound, Chair.     Perhaps it is important that there should be sound.     Purely coincidental, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes thank you Chair.  Chair we were dealing with the import and meaning in today’s technological age of the provisions of Section 31 of 1947 Commission’s Act.  The powers of the Court ...[intervenes]      Yes Chair and those regulations have been promulgated under the amended 1947 Act, which says that the President may issue regulations to expand the powers of the Commission.     Chair the 1947 Act, which gives powers to the Commission which are equivalent to the powers of the High Court is instructed, because the powers of the High Court have been developed over time through the application of the summons provisions and the giving of evidence provisions to take account of technology.  There is the judgment of Satchwell, J, the technology of the video link is now accepted both in other jurisdictions and South Africa as an efficient and effective way of providing oral evidence both in chief and in cross-examination and that this is simply another tool for securing effective access to justice.    We have the example of children giving evidence via video link, we have the example of in camera witnesses, or witnesses who don’t give evidence directly but over video and sound links, so there is no reason why a person whose immunity is threatened by Covid conditions shouldn’t also be catered for under the expanded technological rubric of the giving of evidence. Of course you make the qualification which is important that the witness must be within the jurisdiction of the Court, so that the evidence that is given can be accounted for in terms of the law within the borders of the country.       Yes Chair.  In fact I think that has been provided for in other cases specifically in camera witnesses.     Okay, yes.   And the powers that you have are based in statute as well as in regulations which have been empowered by statute expressly, as well as the general power that during the charge of the procedures, and this is essentially given the authority is a procedural matter. Chair if I may just finish the list of issues where the former President has been requested to assist you in your investigations.   You requested the President to respond to the application made by Ms Reddy Tlabe, that was an application made by her to give evidence and to cross-examine the former President, arising out of his own evidence and in that respect a request was made and there has been no response to that.  You have issued at least two 10.6 directives, the provision to which you have just referred Chair, requiring him to respond, and this is more than an invitation Chair, this is an exercise of the compulsory power, to respond to the evidence of Messrs Tsotsi, Linnell and Matona and to respond to the evidence of Mr Popo Molefe in the Eskom and in the PRASA matters respectively.  Those have not been complied with.     The areas of interest documents?     Which came as a criminal sanction.     The directive now carries a criminal sanction.     Correct.  Chair there were two further invites of a less formal nature to respond to Mr Human’s affidavit dealing with the evidence of Mr Sunderam and an invitation to respond to the affidavits of Mr Megwe and Ms Pillay also dealing with the evidence of Mr Sunderam, those have not been complied with either. Importantly for the question of an appearance Chair you have set aside at least five separate weeks in the calendar of the Commission for the appearance of Mr Zuma, which have not been adhered to and what you directed Chair was that if he wasn’t to appear or had good reason not to appear he should make formal application, that hasn’t been received either.     There has never been a formal application, we have always had to deal with allegations and correspondence, and of course that is more than just a formal requirement because if Mr Zuma’s legal representatives were to come before you to make an application not to appear in any one of those five weeks you would have the opportunity of interrogating that.   If it is just simply sent to you in a letter you don’t have that opportunity at all, so it is more than just a procedural requirement it is a substantive requirement.  So Chair in summary then, unless there is any further issue you want to raise the two questions really before you are would it be a reasonable exercise of the power that you have to issue summons in these circumstances, given the terms of reference, given your duties, given the provisions of Section 31, given the provisions of Section 10[6] that must be answered in the affirmative.  There are the added considerations that we have just outlined that make it practically necessary for summons to be issued and we therefore ask for an order in terms of the amended Notice of Application. ORDER Having read the affidavits placed before me and having listened to submissions made by counsel representing the  Commission’s legal team I am satisfied that this is a matter in which I should grant the application.    I am satisfied that a proper case has been made out for an order authorising that the Secretary of the Commission should sign and issue a summons against Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, former President of the Republic of South Africa to appear before the Commission at ten o’clock on the 16 t h to the 20 t h of November 2020 in this venue on each one of those days, therefore I am going to     No Chair that is – we will assist the Secretary in the drafting of the summons in accordance with your order.     Thank you Chair.   May we be excused.
