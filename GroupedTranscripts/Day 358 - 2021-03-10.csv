CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Okay.  I am sorry we have had some few minutes delay but let us – let us continue.  Mr Molefe good morning.    The oath you took two days ago will continue to apply – affirmation I think it was.    Yes okay thank you.    106?    0 – okay.  Is that on Bundle 5?    Bundle 6 okay.    The net value of the acquisition would be?    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    In the memorandum.    You want to …    Alright.    Is your evidence that these were brought to your attention before you made the decision to change and go with CSR as opposed to Mitsui?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay. And when we say they were brought it might be that it is the problems that were brought or it is the letters giving you – telling you about the problems.    Not the letters.    Ja.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh.    Keep your microphone on Mr Molefe at all times.    Ja.    I am sorry I thought that was 405 – 2405 is that correct?    Oh yes – no I can see where you are indeed.  Ja.    Look this side Mr Molefe.    Ja, no, no I know ja.    Is his affidavit on Bundle 5?    Okay.    That was the offer of who?    Ja.    Were they all more or less around that figure would you say?    Ja okay.    Actually the – the final price that they would want Transnet to pay…    Ja not the other way around.    To accept.    Ja.  Well it is English Mr Molefe.    To accept.    49?    Are you moving away from 43 – 44?    Ja.    Ja.    Well no let me just – let me make sure.  First you say Transnet made an estimate.    And the estimate was 38.6billion.    The tenders came in.    And the prices were …    43 – 44 thereabouts.    And you are now saying the final price…    After negotiations     I assume that that is because – because when you negotiate one would have thought that you would be wanting to bring them down from 43 – 44.    I assume that maybe it is because it took time and they – there was escalation or how did – how did you do so badly instead of bringing them down you    Allowed them to go up.    That or they would do – that would explain the increase from 43 – 44     To 49.    Because now you were speaking of a fixed amount over 7 years.    Okay alright.    Did that not undermine the whole idea of a fixed price?    They bought the idea of a fixed price to have certainty.     Mr Myburgh.     Including?     Point 6.     Yes.     Yes, but his question is and my understanding is that you have answered but he just wants to make sure is that.  His question is whether that estimate ...[intervenes]      Included.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     But what was your understanding?     I am not sure how...  It is rather surprising to me if you say it did not matter whether it excluded or included because I would have thought that it could significantly – it could make a big difference in terms of your budgeting and how much you could be talking about and it might be... My assumption is that it would be important to know whether - when you as the management say to us as the board, if I was in the board, when you say your estimate of what Transnet is going to pay is R 38.6 billion.     Have you taken that count all risks?  We know that it is an estimate but you have taken account everything that you should take into account?  And if you     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     Well, Mr Myburgh will continue with his questions but let me put this to you at a, maybe a principle level or a general level.  If I am going to drive from Durban to Johannesburg ...[intervenes]      And I am a former Chief Group Executive of Transnet ...[intervenes]      [laughs]  I am going to drive. Yes.     From Durban to Johannesburg.     [laughs]  It might not matter how much petrol I will have to put in and the tolls, how much I will have to pay in terms of toll charges but for somebody else, if you tell him only about – or her about only the petrol, the cost of petrol for that trip and you do not tell him what – that there are toll charges that will have to be paid and so on and so forth.  It might make a big difference to that other person but maybe not somebody else.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, I do not know if there is any but those are definitely.     Ja ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m?     Yes but ...[intervenes]      But the cost of the wear and tear of the tyres might be a long-term thing but in the example I am giving you, the issue of the toll charges will have to be paid.     Petrol, you must have money for petrol.     You might arrive in Gauteng without ...[intervenes]      ...your ...[intervenes]      So if you do not tell the person about the charges for the toll, you know, it seems to me that that would be critical but you might say ...[intervenes]      You might say the example of the toll might not fit into the locomotives.  I am not sure ...[intervenes]      ...in terms of these costs.   Ja, that is why I am saying ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Mr Myburgh.     Moola and Laher.     H’m.       Just repeat the page.     [No audible reply]      [laughs]  I just saw that too.     Before that.  I think Mr Myburgh – to Mr Choubey, you need to say exactly what you meant.     Ja, well maybe that might be too far.     What all three of us know nothing about.     Ja, about the ETC increase and ETC, I think that is what you were talking about.     Well, maybe we were at cross-purposes and both of you may indicated if I misunderstand something.  Mr Molefe had criticised Mr Choubey for talking about an increase of ETC from 38.6 billion to 54 point whatever on the basis that 54 point whatever billion was not …[intervenes]     The ETC.  So but this memo here that has got his signature also talks along the same lines.  That is that we were all talking about.     No, no, no, you were making the point.  My understanding was simply that you were saying he was – well, firstly, using wrong language because 54 is not ETC.  But two, you were saying that it reflected a fundamental I misunderstanding on his part.     So at this stage I am simply saying …[intervenes]     But at least the language seems to be same as in your memo.  Ja.     Error.     Okay, okay, I think that is fair enough.     I think that is fair, that is fair enough.     Mr Myburgh?     We are – we still have five minutes.     Ja, if you want to use that.     Ja.     Mr Myburgh?     Oh, yes, ja.     Let us take the tea adjournment.  We – I am just going to add another five minutes in order to attend to somebody.  We will adjourn, we will resume at twenty five to.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     Just repeat that so I can check whether I have got it here.     Oh, ja.  I have got it.     Is it bundle 6, Mr Myburgh?     And page 184 did you say?     But of course what you sought to do through these two memoranda, one to the – is it the BADC?     And the other to the board, was you sought to explain to them how come there was such a big gap between the ETC of R38.6 billion that you had told them about …[intervenes]     And the actual price.     That you sought to explain that.     And in doing so you brought in the issue of these costs.     And said they had been excluded when in fact they had been included.  It think that is where we are.     Ja, okay.  Alright.  Mr Myburgh?     I think Mr Myburgh seems to establish whether in the memorandum you told the board that the negotiations had been concluded, this was going to be the price.  You must tell me, Mr Myburgh, if I understood your question.     Ja.     But maybe – I am sorry – are you going to, among other things, look at the memo to see whether that point was made or you are saying no, I did not make that point in the memo but the board had been told at some stage before the memo that the negotiations had been concluded?     Okay, okay.     Okay, no, that is fine, I just wanted to be sure.       I wanted to be sure whether as far as the memo is concerned there is an acceptance that is not there but you will check somewhere but you are saying you will check in the memo and you will check elsewhere.  Okay.       Cavil.     Okay, I think you must just repeat that, you were too far away from mic that last sentence.     Yes, yes.     Okay.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay, okay.     Okay.     That is to whose affidavit?     I am sorry; at what page did you say?     332.     File number 6, just look at the bundles in front of you, bundle 6 on the spine and then the one below that, bundle 6 on the spine.      Okay, looks like they found it, or is that a loan, is that loaned to him or is it his?  Okay, page 332 you said Mr Myburgh?     Black numbers?     Mr Molefe, the Evidence Leader ask questions and you respond, then where it is necessary to get clarification on his questions, you can ask for clarification.     Ja.     I take it that when you – when Transnet teams, different teams, certainly the Group Chief Executive Officer handles a matter as big as this somebody would be tasked with the function to say please highlight to all concerned…[intervene]     …what requirements or hurdles needed to be taken care of, before this whole thing can be successful.     And I would have thought that in such a – there would be such a document and somebody would have said, hang on at this stage, we will need to get Ministerial approval.      Do you accept that that is what one would expect?      Yes, but would you say it was not done in this case?      Okay, Mr Myburgh.     There was?    Ja, would assurance always be the same departments or units, or it could change depending on the subject matter?     Were excluded.     But such a request I would imagine it would have to go under your hand or the Chairperson but not somebody junior to you.     Ja, no that is fine.    Are you looking for her affidavit?  Are you looking for her affidavit?    To where you gave reasons?    Remember not to speak to far from the microphone.    Ja.  Ja you say the condition precedent that was understood to be there.    Get out of the…    I am sorry, I am sorry.  Same file what page?    Okay.  Okay I have got it.    Yes.  Okay. Let us take the lunch break then and we will resume at two.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.     You are looking for the company who was ...[intervenes]      Neotel?     H’m?     H’m?     I just want to make a note just below 10 at page 9 where 2010 is given instead of 2014 to refer to that bundle and that page Mr Myburgh.  So that would be bundle?     Yes, and the page?     349.  No, okay that is fine.  If previously know ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Yes.     Ja, I got it.  I just want to refer to make a reference to the bundle where there is the resignation document.     Oh, that is what you have given me?  Ja.     The page was 349, hey?     Okay alright.  Your junior could check if no supplementary statement or affidavit was previously made by Mr Van der Westhuizen to correct this, it will be good if we could get a supplementary statement that can be slotted in behind his affidavit.     H’m, h’m.     Yes, Mr Myburgh.   One second Mr Myburgh. Yes, Mr Myburgh.     Just...  I wanted to check the date of the agreement Mr Myburgh.  It is 1 December 2014.  Is that right?     Ja, okay.     I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  Page 405.8?     Oh, that must be... one.     Okay I have got it.     I am sorry.  Who was Mr Essa’s wife?     Oh ...[intervenes]      At the bottom?     Okay I have seen it, ja.  Okay?     Oh, okay.  Of T-Systems?     Oh, okay, okay.     Yes, okay.     Okay.     The background ...[intervenes]      ...and the reasons.     And the motivation.     H’m?     Okay.     H’m, h’m.     Okay.     That is the Transnet – that is the one that we are talking about now.     Okay.     Well, Mr Molefe...     We have and maybe one should take what you have said before and say you would say the same thing but one wants to be sure.  I would expect that if – assuming that the evidence that Mr Myburgh is talking about were to be true, it is what was happening, it would mean that in the organisation where you were Group Chief Executive Officer there was a lot of corruption and money laundering that may have been perpetrated by certain people and assume for present purposes that you were innocent and you did not know but just hearing about it to say is this what was happening while I was there?  I would expect that it would be of concern to you, not to say necessarily that you had anything to do with it.  Just the fact that it may have been happening or if the evidence is true it was happening, taxpayers’ money, people were using all kinds of vehicles to get money illegally.     Yes, okay, alright.     So this file can go [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Should I have any bundle in front of me?     Oh, you will mention when I need to have one?     Okay, alright.     That is fine, when – it may well be, you will assess it, I need to have a file in front of me.     Well, maybe we will talk more later on on the matter, you may or may not know that when some of the Transnet witnesses, who talked on this issue, came to give evidence, I had lots of issues, questions to them.  I would have thought that if the best way to promote your brand is to be in the news is to do things that are newsworthy and you are therefore in the news for good things.     Yes as opposed to what you have just mentioned, which was mentioned by those witnesses too, that in these breakfast shows very often the speakers would not be speaking about Transnet.     They would be talking about whatever had been planned to talked about.     And then it did not seem to me that the idea that it was promoting Transnet’s brand was as clear as it might be to you.     Well, as you speak, the point that comes to my mind is that if you have done something that is newsworthy, the media houses will not even pay because that is newsworthy.     They will want it and you will be talked about in favourable terms without you paying, you know?     So it seems to me that if you or Transnet engaged in activities that were seen as good by the community and as newsworthy, that is when you would get – you promote your brand and you would do so without paying.     Well, I will let Mr Myburgh take it from there but if you have done something that is seen as good by the community or by the society, the news people will be there, you will not need somebody else, you …[intervenes]     Yes.     Well, maybe Transnet was not doing those things that it should have done.     Ja, no, no, that is fine.  I will mention one example of my own experience.  I think about two years ago I went to the area, the village where I grew up.     And went to the primary school that I attended because the Zondo and Bux Educational Trust that was established a few years ago had spoken to another trust about the situation in the school which I attended of toilets and so on and that trust organised funding and they sorted that out and we went there to have a function and to say this is what has been done and I think somebody must have told the media and some journalists went to that rural area and they were there and the story was in a number of newspapers about the toilets that had been built for the school and a school hall in the high school in the area.  We did not pay anything to the media for them to put us in the newspapers.     But I am just mentioning, I think it might be a matter of degree.  I am just mentioning one example.  Mr Myburgh?     Okay, okay.     Page?     Okay.     So the question really, Mr Molefe, is you may or may not have approved but you noted and you read.     Did you pick up this very absurd idea?     Let me explain it Mr Molefe.  Mr Gama, I think when he was suspended, brought an urgent application in the High Court against Transnet and various…[intervenes].     When he  was suspended against Transnet as an entity as well as a number of members of the Board, maybe all of them, I’m not sure but a number of them to, effectively, get the suspension set aside.  Transnet and various Board members opposed that application and the High Court dismissed that application and said he must pay Transnet’s costs as well as the costs of those members of the Board who had opposed the application, that’s what the Court ordered. Now, Transnet and the Board members had gone to lawyers and briefed lawyers to oppose this application, so Transnet had incurred costs.  So, the order of the Court as far as the costs were concerned, was to the effect that Mr Gama must pay Transnet and the Board members, their legal costs.  Now the – what, ultimately happened, which is what Mr Myburgh is talking about is that Transnet – the settlement agreement said that Mr – Transnet must pay, I think 75% of Mr Gama’s legal costs.   Yes, that’s what the settlement agreement says, even though he had lost in the High Court.     Yes, yes but leave aside whatever you may think of that part of the settlement agreement.     What the memorandum – what was, ultimately done, was not to look at 75% of Mr Gama’s legal costs but to take at the legal costs of Transnet and say what is 75% of the costs that Transnet and its Board members have incurred in this litigation and then say, we will pay Mr Gama 75% of our legal costs.  So, that’s what he’s talking about to say, that’s something very, very strange.     [Laughter], no, not the tax cost’s part I can understand, from a lay person’s point of view when you say tax costs, where is SARS here but of course, obviously, I think if you are required to approve anything and there’s something you don’t understand you need to ask because you don’t want to approve something that’s wrong.     Mr Myburgh?     You say, 499?     Okay, I hope I didn’t misrepresent anything, Mr Myburgh about what happened with regard to those costs, to Mr Molefe?     Ja I think I saw that in his affidavit he said that High Court costs and costs in regard to the labour matter, that’s how he puts it, but I just saw in the settlement agreement or the quoted paragraph in the memo that you referred us to, it doesn’t say labour matter.     It says, it’s specific, the matter unfair dismissal matter.     Yes, ja.     Okay, alright.     Well, he has given evidence and – ja but certainly there is evidence and if you’d like to have a look at it, it will be available, the transcript.     Ja.     Did you actually establish that there was proof that Abalozi had done work?     Now – so did he bring you statements by people who claimed to have witnessed Abalozi perform the work, what actually did he bring to you? MR     Yes.     But timesheets can be made without somebody working…[intervenes].     But did you ask that statements be obtained from people who were prepared to append signatures to say, we did see Abalozi perform work there, there, and there that day and that day, did you get that – then it would mean certain people who were prepared to stand up and give evidence to say, yes, did you get that?     Yes.     Yes, because you don’t need Crime Intelligence for this. If Abalozi’s work for example was that they must send security officers or certain people to be in certain guarding’s during certain times or to guard Transnet’s buildings in certain places or whatever the work was then there ought to be people who were employed by Transnet who were supposed to sign whenever there was somebody – the guard was there and so on.     Yes, but the question is, do you know whether, what you were provided with…[intervenes].     Well, let’s leave out the fraud it may be fraudulent.  Did it contain documents where people who had witnessed Abalozi doing what they were contractually obliged to do, in other words there were signatures where people say, yes…[intervenes].     Ja.     Yes, but did you only rely on the General in terms of those people who had signed or was there some investigation…[intervenes]?   Did you authorise somebody to investigate who was hiding the information from Transnet?   Were those people confronted…[intervenes].     Mr Myburgh?    Transnet’s General.    [Laughter].     Do you want to find out whether you’d do better than him against the General?     Mr Myburgh, I know that we are trying to save time, but I think this document is quite important.  I would suggest because it’s not long…[intervenes].    Did you, in the negotiations did you offer to General Nyanda that Transnet would pay the cost or did he demand that Transnet will pay the cost?    Yes.     Yes.     Mr Myburgh, let me leave it to you to continue.     Yes.      But Mr Molefe, the business dealings were between Abalozi and Transnet.    They were not between Abalozi and the directors, cofounders of GNS and all of that.     Yes.     So why would you owe the directors anything on top of owing, let us assume that Transnet owed something arising out of this.     Why would you owe the directors and cofounders of GNS on top of owing Abalozi as an entity? MR    What damage?  What damage?    But the directors and the cofounders, own founders had not sued Transnet.    On our bundles ...[intervenes]     Yes, because ...[intervenes]     What kind of damage did you cause?    Did you publish the blacklisting?    Yes.     Okay.    Did they sue you for it?    Yes.     Okay, that is the counterclaim.    Was that the counterclaim?    Okay, but certainly as you sit here, I mean you, you ...[intervenes]     I hope you do not say I am patronizing you.      Because I did not say anything but there was a time when you accused Mr Myburgh of patronizing you and I thought it was not.  When you occupy a certain position.    You know, group CEO of Transnet.    You must be taken to have certain knowledge and so on and so on.      So there are certain things that we can take it that you cannot be, you cannot not know certain things.     So I am, my reaction when I saw this for the first time, and I can indicate it was, I became aware of it after we had been looking at the settlement of Mr Gama.  Between Mr Gama ...[intervenes]     And Transnet.  This looked very strange.     And to me, when I think of you having been CEO of PIC, CEO of ... group CEO of Transnet, I would expect that in litigation such as this, even though you might not be a lawyer, but your general knowledge and experience would have you ...[intervenes]     But if we settle and pay cost, if we are supposed to pay any cost to the entity.    That should be enough.    You know, we should not be paying the directors and cofounders and all of that.     Am I unfair to expect that kind of knowledge?    Ja.     Did you bother to say let us get a legal opinion as to whether this claim of theirs has got any merits and if so ...[intervenes]     How close, what risk do we have of paying even half of 95 million.      Well, you are not answering my question Mr Molefe.  You may have thought it had merit but you are not a lawyer.      I am asking you whether you bothered to ask for a legal opinion, people who could say to you in law yes, there is a claim and two, it has got reasonable prospects and if they succeed, will they come close to 95 million.    Yes.     Yes, so are you saying that your recollection is that there was a legal opinion from within the ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]     Mr Myburgh?    What page?    Okay.    Yes.     Well, it was happening to me yesterday.      I can tell you Mr Molefe, I would not be ... I would not be candid with you if I did not tell you that when I read just a settlement agreement, I was shocked.     It is just shocking.     Those terms of the settlement agreement are shocking.  In all the years that I was in practice before I came onto the bench, I had never seen a settlement agreement like this.  I have never seen a settlement agreement like the one that Mr Gama and Transnet concluded.  When you settle, because the basis of a settlement is look, we do not know who was going to win or lose in the end, if we proceeded with litigation.    That is the basis.     So let us settle.  That is normally the basis.  Of course, sometimes there might be other considerations.  But normally you would have each party paying its own cost.     But sometimes you do have the one party making some contribution to the cost of the other, usually not all the cost, just some contribution.    But maybe you might have a situation where they pay party and party cost.  Okay.    Or one of the parties in a settlement agreement, should pay attorney and client cost.     Is something I have never come across.  I do not know about Mr Myburgh.    That is apart from what Mr Myburgh has just drawn attention to, to say the amount was not just for cost, you were paying for much more than that, even though the settlement agreement said Abalozi had withdrawn its action against Transnet.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay.    That is fair enough.    Ja, no arrangements can be made, even if you come back.  I think, because it would not take long.  I do not know what Mr Myburgh has to say, but let me ...[intervenes]     Mr Myburgh?    Yes, okay.    And just to add onto that, you know if you look at the, the legal costs relating to Mr Gama, I think in their legal cost they had the legal cost of the disciplinary hearing which had involved senior counsel and so on, and had gone on for about 14 days, two weeks.  The cost for that I think were less than four million, less than I cannot remember, but we are not talking about even ten million I think, but certainly not 20 million.  Here the matter had not gone to trial.  Some pleadings had been exchanged.  Had not advanced much.    No, no that is fair enough.  That is fair enough, ja.  That is fair enough.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh?    Maybe to, maybe to round off the topic of that settlement Mr Molefe.     And Mr Myburgh, maybe Mr ... there are two ways of dealing with it.  One is that after Mr Molefe has studied it and tried to recall what happened, one option is that he can come back and then put his understanding, give me his understanding and explanations, without an affidavit.  Another one is that he could put in an affidavit first to say this is my recollection of how this came about blah blah blah blah blah and then if need be he could be called after that.  I do not know Mr Myburgh if you have any evidence, what do you suggest?    Yes.     Yes, yes.  Yes, ja. ADV MYBURGH    Ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     No, that is fine.  If that could be, if what the arrangement is going to be, can be finalized, if possible within the next two days because we do not have a lot of time.  So that we at least to say this is the agreed way forward.  Then we can take it from there.     Okay, alright.     Okay Mr Myburgh.    Well, maybe I should say this.  No, maybe I should not say, you will put in whatever you will put in about that settlement and then we carry from there.  Ja, okay.      You are not being told about Salim Essa in regard to Abalozi.  What bundle did you say we should have?    Okay.    Yes.  Thank you.    What page?    Yes, I have got it.     I am sorry.  Mr Myburgh, I think it might be good for those who are following, to just give a general just of what witness 1 said about Mr Molefe, so that when he gives his own the just of his response, then they can follow or is that going to be difficult? If it is going to be difficult, it is fine.      Ja.     Okay, no that is fine.  I just wanted that when Mr Molefe gives his response to this evidence, people who are listening can understand what it is about.     20 maybe would be short.    And 20 you would say not short?    No, no, no I do not have a problem myself about 45 minutes being you know, not an unusual time for a meeting.     I am talking about 20 because I think somewhere he says in his, the log book or whatever he has put in there, reflects like you would come in there, you would go there and spend about 20 minutes and go.  I think quite a few times if I am not mistaken.    And it gives me the impression and this is maybe I must just say, gives me the impression that that might not have you know, serious meetings if it is so short, but ja I may be mistaken.     If it is so short.    Ja, okay.  But generally you do not have any quarrel with the kinds of times he gives in terms of the duration whenever you went there, more or less you have no problem with ...[intervenes]    With those times.    Okay.    When there were?    Events, ja okay.    Yes, ja.  When you would be there longer.     Ja.     Yes, no maybe you are going to say what I was about to say.     Okay, no I was saying maybe during the time that he took you there, there were no events.  That is why I have made, that is why ...[intervenes]    Ja, okay.  Alright, okay.    Well, I think what you do say based on what you have said before, is you might not be saying they are accurate, but your sense is that they cannot be too way out.  They, it is more or less.    It is more or less what you think.    Ja, ja.    Well, there are times where ...[intervenes]    There are times where according to his log book you were there for a few hours.  I see at page 20, second item ...[intervenes]     9 July 2011, according to the log book, his log book you were there from five to ten past nine.    I think there are times where it reflects you were there for quite some time.     And then there are times when it shows that you were there for a shorter period.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Well, I guess the log book has got to say when you arrived where you arrived and when you left.  I assume that that is part of what they are supposed to do.     Okay, Mr Myburgh?      I think so.     You see, the problem might be that where ever you went, you went with it.     Ja, but earlier on you ... I thought you said something like looking at, I do not know which page you were looking at, looking at I think one of the bags, pictures of the bags.  That is what you said.  It is not similar, but the impression was, the impression that I got was that you were saying there is some resemblance, it might be ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja.    Well, should we not have a picture of this one, so we can compare with the pictures here.     Oh, okay.    Okay, I am sorry Mr Myburgh.    I may have missed something.  26 this witness refers to a light brown leather back pack.     That description is the same as the bag you say you, is probably the one that you were carrying?    When he said ...[intervenes]     Light brown leather back pack.    It fits that description.    Okay.    Okay.  I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, I interrupted you.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh.    Will you arrange for somebody in your team to write for example in regard to the bag, picture of the bag at page 69 Annexure W117, so that if I read this paragraph, it is easy for me to know this is the one because it is not written ...[intervenes]     Oh, okay sorry.    Oh, okay.    Oh, okay.  Oh, you see it is confusing because you expect the picture to be ...[intervenes]     To be on page 68 when you look at this.     So maybe what should be done is to move, to move this to 69 or to find a way to make sure that if I look at, if I am looking for this picture and I come to 68 and I see there is no picture, I do not think that there is nothing, and then I go back. Or maybe there should be a reference to say I must look ...[intervenes]     Over the page, ja.    You know, two months after now if I am working on this I might be confused.     Quarter.    Quarter full?    Okay.    Well I am sorry Mr Myburgh I am sure you do not intend it there are a number of areas where he said he has no recollection.    But what you – what you are saying is true to the extent that you mean he does not dispute.    Most of these ja.    But that also includes when he says he has no recollection.  So – so I thought I would just mention that.    Ja. But basically because you do not have a recollection you cannot dispute but you – there is nothing that you really seriously dispute for most of the part of what he says.    This particular part.    Of the cash ja.  No I ..    Ja.    Ja, no, no that is fine but other than that…    Ja.    Yes but other than that in terms of what Mr Myburgh has taken you through you do not have any serious issues.    Ja okay.    Ja.  Then Mr Myburgh I interrupted you while you wanted…    To put a proposition to Mr Molefe.    Was that burial society of which you were treasurer or something?    At that time?    Hm.  What was it called?    Ma?    M-a-p-h-a-l-a.    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.    Burial society at the end.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  And you had the treasurer.    Okay. Okay.  It is still there, it still exists the burial society.    Ja.    Okay.    I think Mr Myburgh wanted to put a different proposition to you in regard to probabilities or…    Yes.    Hm.  Well I guess – I guess that if this statement was full of lots of things that you say are false maybe really serious bad things it might – one might look at it in a certain way but having gone through the statement with Mr Myburgh having taken you through the statement up to just before he talks about the threats most of the things that he says about you there you do not identify them as things that somebody would be saying about you that are deliberately false.  There are just two or three areas…    Where you say well here this is not true.    Mr Myburgh.    Well I am sorry we normally take a short adjournment after two hours we have been here for three – just over three hours now maybe we should have a ten minutes adjournment.   Okay let us take just ten minutes adjournment.  We will resume at twenty five past five.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.  Your mic.     The one ...[intervenes]      The one we were using before the break.     Yes.     H’m.  Yes.  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn but you – arrangements will be made and I am inclined to think that to deal with that settlement agreement, you may have to come back but I will allow the Legal Team to compose – teams from both sides to discuss it but it seems to me that might be desirable in which case, to the extent that your counsel might wish to re-examine, that could be done at that stage.  Is that fine?     Or did you wish to re-examine today if you plan to?     You could make the request then.     Okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr Molefe for availing yourself to give evidence.  As I say, you probably might come back but your legal team and the Commission’s Legal Team will talk about the part that remains that you wanted to get a chance to look at and then we will take it from there but thank you very much for availing yourself.     Yes.     We are going to adjourn for the day and tomorrow morning we will start at half-past nine and I will hear Mr Gama’s evidence tomorrow.     We adjourn.  I am sorry.  I think, Mr Myburgh, is there not something you are forgetting that the secretary wanted to say.     You to deal with.  I am sorry.  It should not take long.       Ja.     I cannot remember...  Well, counsel will normally come and see me in chambers but I cannot remember whether it was about that or not.     It may have been.  I do not know.     It may have been.  I do not know.  H’m?     No, no.  Mr Myburgh is not springing.  He wants to find out exactly what the ...[intervenes]      No, no, no ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Hang on.  Let us not speak at the same time.  He is seeking clarification as to what it is that made you think like this.  Yes?     No reply?     Well, the one thing Mr Molefe is that we need to understand what it is that you are accusing the Secretary of having done.  Firstly, because the statement yesterday was made in public.  He also needs to know.  But we also need to know so that we can understand.  So that... but as I understand it.  You are saying, the conduct on his part, the Secretary of the Commission ...[intervenes]      Which has – which prompted you to think that he had a negative attitude towards you ...[intervenes]      ...because you did not intervene some years back ...[intervenes]      ...when he had ask you to intervene in regard to the Western House matter.     You say the conduct on his part is the fact that he did not over the whole of December respond to correspondence that sought clarification on certain – on the matter of this summons or subpoena.     That is what prompted you to think like that.     Okay.     No, no, no.     Yes, yes.  No, no, that is fine.  Mr Myburgh?     Ja.  Ja-no, I think, at least it is clarified what it is or what it is and then we will take it from there.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Thank you.  Good morning Mr Molefe.    Yesterday we were on the point of ending off the topic of the 100 locomotives.  I just want to take you if I may back to the Fundudzi Report.  This is at Bundle 6 could I ask you to turn please to page 160.    160 Chairperson – 160.    Bundle 6.    Are you there Mr Molefe?    I just want to direct your attention please in closing to – to two paragraphs under the heading Conclusion that being Sub 4 and Sub 5.  Paragraph    Right.    And then they go onto to conclude in    But Mr Molefe can I ask you is that – is the conclusion here does it not go beyond that?  In other words you – you – it seems frail to conduct a comparison between the one and the other.  I understand your point about the NPV we are going to deal with that perhaps in a different context with other people.    Well if you say that was in the memorandum then I will take your words for it but what I am looking for here is was there a time where you actually did a cost benefit analysis as between the two possible deals?    Now we undertook yesterday to add I think it was 10 pages of documents that you provided to us to the bundle.  We have done that but if you could please go to Bundle 5 that is your exhibit; Exhibit 22.    Now if all the administration has worked out correctly if I could ask you to turn to page 114.  Are you in the right file Mr Molefe?  Bundle 5 Exhibit 22.    So what you will find directly after 114 is a series of documents marked 114.1 – I think you may have them there in front of you.  114.1 running through to 114.10 do you have those documents?    So these are the documents you gave us yesterday.    You recognise them?    So what we have done is we have added them so they follow directly after your affidavit, you see that?    Would you like an opportunity to address the Chairperson on the significance of these documents?  Are there any particular portions that you wish to draw to our attention?    Sorry I cannot hear you Mr Molefe. MR    Alright.    Thank you.  Sorry I just for some reason am not picking you up clearly.  Did you say the locomotives had failed?    Failing the Mitsui locomotives.     And if I understand your evidence.    No I understand.    As I understand your answer to the Chairperson you say that – these documents bear out the fact that there was that problem and it was something that you knew of at the time.    Alright.  And they all relate then to that topic and issue?    Alright.  I would like then if I may to turn to a different topic now and that is the procurement of the 1064 locomotives.      Now Mr Molefe I would – I just want to sketch some of the evidence that has been given so that we can get to the point where I can ask you a few questions around this.  What we have heard and a lot of evidence has been given about this was the building of the initial business case for the 1064 locomotives and ultimately it would appear from the evidence that a final business case was adopted by the board on the 25 t h of April.   Does that accord with your recollection?    And it may be a little bit onerous but I want to take you to the business case and then to the board resolution just so we can place those two documents on record and then I will ask you some questions from there. I have asked my colleagues to fish out for you two files.  I hope that they have managed to find Exhibit BB4(b).  And could I ask you please to turn to page FQC402. You will see that this is an attachment incidentally to Mr Callard’s affidavit and it reflects there procurement of 1064 locomotives for General Freight Business dated submission 25 April addressed to Transnet Board of Directors.  And it also titled Procurement of 1064.    It kept…    Procurement of 1064 locomotives for General Freight Business final version.    Now if I could ask you just to keep your finger there and then turn all the way to page 516 that seems to be the end of the business case.  FQC516.      What I note there is that this business case was not signed – this version by you, Mr Singh and Mr Gama.  Do you recall signing the final version of the business case?    Alright.  Could I ask you then please to go to the beginning and then go to page FQC405.  I will take you to the last paragraph of that page.      It says   You would confirm that that was then contained in the final business case.    Now if I could then ask you – you can perhaps keep that open so that we know what the wording is.  Could I ask you …    FQC405.    And then if I could ask you please Mr Molefe to go to Bundle or Exhibit BB4(f).  I think that is also been taken out for you.      And BB4(f) is divided into two parts; point 1 and point 2 I would like you to go to the first part and turn to page YIL23.  It is part of the annexures to Mr Laher ’s affidavit or statement.    And if we all on the same page what you find there is a certified exert from the draft minutes of the special meeting of the Transnet board held on the 25 t h of April and you will see there 6.1 Procurement of 1063 locomotives for the TFR General Freight Business resolved    Yes.    You mean the signed business case?    Alright we will have a – we will have a look for that but I assume you must be right that if it was presented as you say.    And adopted at the board it would have been signed.    We will – alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes but the point is it includes the same bracketed phrase.    Okay. So you know what the controversy is in relation to that bracketed phrase?    Yes.  I mean the controversy is that it is alleged by some and we will come to the evidence that actually the business case in support – in support of the R38…..    So the controversy is and we will come to the evidence in a moment that there are some witnesses who maintain that the business case ETC estimate of R38.6 in fact included hedging and escalation costs – did not exclude it.  You know that controversy?    Alright.  Now what I just want to put to you is that in 2018 after these events Mr Laher and Mr Moola do you know those gentlemen?    They were requested by the GCFO.    to undertake an investigation to determine whether the business case ETC estimate of R38.6 included hedging and escalation.    And they were assisted by Mr Callard.    Ant the conclusion that they came to was that the business case and ETC estimate in fact included those two things – did not exclude it.  We heard – we heard.    Well you have heard that evidence and you know of it.    That was their conclusion yes.    I get a sense you know the answer to that question.    I get a sense you know the answer to that question?    Okay what is it?    Sorry?    Yes absolutely.    Ja.    I think you might be looking for page 38 Mr Molefe.    Ja.    Bundle 5.     Thank you.  I think you have explained how the price increased but that was not what I was dealing with at all.     I understand that Mr Molefe but there are two different things.  The first issue that should be determined is whether in truth the Business Case included hedging and escalation or whether it excluded it as was represented to the board.  That is what I am dealing with now.       We are then going to deal after that with the increase in the ETC.  Do not worry.  We will come to that but perhaps to just locate my question better.  Could I ask you to go to Exhibit BB-4(f)?       Mr Laher ’s exhibit.  I think I have take you there a little bit earlier.       Yes.  And the first part point 1 to page YIL-17.       Yes.     If you could stick with this for a moment?  I am taking you to the actual foundation of documents.     And Mr Molefe, if I could just ask you?  We are dealing now with whether there was a misrepresentation of the ETC in relation to excluding hedging and escalation.     In the Business case.     In then initial Business Case.     We are going to come in time to how the ETC increased, as you have explained.     Now at paragraph 66, and I take you here because I do not want us to misunderstand one another and I want to ...[intervenes]      Page 17, paragraph 66.     Yes. “In January 2018, Mohamed Moola, Executing Manager of Finance Capital Programme and I... [that is Mr Laher] ...received a request from the then GCFO, Gary Pita, by the TFR CFO, Ms Kolane, to confirm that they have a Business Case pricing included or excluded forex hedging and escalation costs...” But that is the first controversy here.     Yes. “Upon consulting with Francis Callard, ex-Transnet employee, who was key in the original Business Case calculations. In January 2018 and reviewing the Business Case calculations, Moola and I concluded that the Business Case calculations actually did include forex and hedging costs...”     Yes. “...and that the recommendation within the R 38.6 billion Business Case to the board in April 2013 (that the ETC excluded these costs) was incorrect...” Do you see that?     So that is what I am asking you about.  They came to the conclusion that was submitted to the board was incorrect.  Now what is your answer to that?     Yes.  The exclusion, the bracketed portion, they concluded was incorrect.     Well ...[intervenes]      Ja ...[intervenes]      Yes.     But let us just ...[intervenes]      Okay but you accept that is what is recorded as the conclusion here?  I understand what you are saying ...[intervenes]      But ...[intervenes]      Yes?     Yes.     Yes, but from where you were sitting ...[intervenes]      ...did the initial Business Case include or exclude hedging and escalation?     Did it include or exclude it?     So it included it?     But it was represented to the board that they were excluded.  That is the whole point.  That is the whole controversy.       And not go by train.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe, before you engaged in answering questions as by the Chairperson.  I think that the record will reflect that what you said was this.  From where I was sitting, I assumed that the Business Case included hedging and escalation.  Do you recall saying that?     Yes.     Just ...[intervenes]      I am not worried about ...[intervenes]      Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]      Just so that you understand, please.  Is, that is not what we are trying to determine, to use your language.  At the moment, I am exploring with you an allegation, as you know, that you misrepresented the Business case to the board.   And the allegation, as you know, is that you misrepresented the ETC to the board when saying it excluded hedging and escalation when it in fact included it and it seems to be me that you made that concession earlier in your evidence.     You do not want to change your evidence?     You do not want to change your evidence?     Alright.     Well, let us come to the importance of that.     Alright.  I will come to the importance of it because it becomes more apparent.  So when Mr Callard and Mr Moola say that they reran the numbers and they came to a conclusion that the original Business Case included forex and hedging, you would agree with that.     Right?     No, they did not Mr Molefe.  You really are...  If you bear with me what happened.  You see, these people were asked to two things.     ...i.e. contract delivering... exchange rate, et cetera.     And then they came to that figure.  And that related to whether the increase from R 38 billion to R 55 billion was justifiable but what they were first ask to do is to determine whether the initial Business case of 36.8 billion included hedging and escalation.  And you have accepted that it did.  So I presume, you do not take issue with that part of the evidence?     Alright.  And what is also important is.  Dr Fine of McKinsey gave evidence before this Commission.  Did you have occasion to hear or learn of his evidence?     Okay.  So on Day 322, the  t h of December 2020, Mr Fine was examined by my colleague, Mr Chaskalson ...[intervenes]  MR     No, no.     I am going to read to you what Mr Fine said.     At line 20.   “There are a couple of point I just want to stress up front.  McKinsey predominantly was involved in the Business Case and that Business Case did confirm Transnet’s numbers of 38.6 billion including, and to be precise, including foreign exchange and including escalations...” You would agree with that evidence?     And then, of course, importantly is the evidence of Mr Choubey.  Perhaps we can go that and no doubt you will agree with it as well.     That you will find, and we have been to one of these reports yesterday.  Could I ask you, please, to go to Exhibit BB-8(b).     Now if I could ask you, please, and this is again something divided into two parts. We are dealing with part 1.  And if I could ask you...  Well, let us... in fact, let us go to page 1.       There you will find the affidavit of Mr Choubey.  And if I could take you, please, then to page 7 at paragraph 4?     Summary of findings, 4.1    And then he goes on to deal with another question and that was that the 41% increase in the ETC from R 38.6 billion to R 54.5 billion was not in its totality justifiable.  Now that is a different question which we are going to come to.     Yes.     Choubey.     Yes.     No, fair enough.  We are going to ...[intervenes]      Yes.  We are going to come to that ...[intervenes]      Alright.     Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]      Alright.     But the only point is.  I am still dealing at the moment with the first question that he was asked to examine and there it seems to be common cause between us.  So let us then go forward in the chronology.  We know that on the 23 r d of May 2014, you and Mr Singh and Mr Gama recommended to the BABC that there should be an increase in price.  Is that correct?     Now we are getting to the 23 r d  of May 2014.       If I could ask you, please, to go to page...  Ah, sorry.  To Exhibit BB-4(b).       I think we have looked at it already.       Alright.  Are you there?     Exhibit BB-4(b).  And I would like to take you, please, Chairperson to page FQC-714.       So this was the memorandum that I was referring you to.  714.  It is to the Board Acquisition and Disposal Committee and it is from yourself.  Correct?     Oh, sorry.  Are you not there?     Are you there Mr Molefe?     Could I ask you, please – you can keep your finger there, but can you turn forward to page FQC-731?  It is signature page.     731.     Yes, 731.     It is recommended by Mr Singh, Mr Gama and you in turn and you signed on the 23 r d  of May 2014.  Is that right?     Could I ask you then to turn back to page 714?     714.     Could you read what the purpose of your memorandum was, into the record, please?  Paragraph 1.     Yes.  That is A.  And B?     So what the purpose was, to request a recommendation of an increase in the ETC.  Correct?     So perhaps Mr Choubey is not as incompetent as you thought.     Can I first go to what was recommended and then I will give you the opportunity.  I just want to finish off this document.     If you go to page FQC-731.     There, it is recommended that, at 8, paragraph B, the BABC ...[intervenes]      ...recommends an increase.     The estimated total cost ETC for the acquisition of the 1064 Locomotives, Transnet Freight Rail... R 38.6 billion to R 54.5 billion.     Is that correct?     Okay.  What is it that you wanted to explain?     Ja, BB4b, and if I could ask you to turn to the table which we have gone to already, at F2C718.     718.     718, seven hundred and eighteen.     Now you will see we have already dealt with this on the left hand side of the capital letter D in the middle, that pricing adjustment for reduction of batch size to 40%/60%.  You see that?      There was a reduction of the size.     Of the size of the batches.     Right, now if you could then go as I had asked you to do, to the MNS Report at bundle 6.     Bundle 6 next there.  Now, what MNS do at the foot of page 332 is they quote…[intervene]     Page 332.     Do not worry about that it is very confusing, just stick to the black ones, alright 332 on the left hand side.     Yes, I just want to place on record one thing at the foot of the page Mr Molefe, are you there     332.     Yes.     I just want to read into the record where they say paragraph 4.1.11 under the heading batch pricing, Section 3.1 of the RFP relating to the acquisition of the 465 diesel and 599 electric locomotives, read as     Could I then ask you please to go to the Fundudzi Report in the same bundle at page 186.  Can I draw your attention then to another issue?      It relates to 186 paragraph, third paragraph from the bottom 5.9.12.12.  There they talk of the Transnet delegation of authority framework approved by the Board on 29 August and effective from 1 September     Would you accept that?     Now, was this increase – well I presume you will accept that there was an increase of more than 15%?     Sorry?     However, you see it, it was a lot more than 15%.     Right, was that reported to the Shareholder Minister?     Why did you not ensure that that happened?     Just so that we understand it, whose responsibility ultimately would it had been to report this increase to the Shareholder Minister?     Not you?     But this is not a secretarial issue is it, I mean, it is a very important issue.     Sorry?     Yes, now could I take you please to page 326.      Could you please go to page 326 of the same bundle?     At paragraph 3.3.6 there is reference to Section 54.2 of the PFMA, there is reference to the MOI     When were the - on a different topic, when were the locomotive supply agreement signed?     Well, I mean, I suppose what is important is you have accepted now that batch pricing and the splitting of batches was wrong, and you say it should have been picked up by…[intervene]     Yes, well they have been here, you see, that is the thing I want to get to if you do not mind.  So what Mr Laher says and in fact there is a transcript of this exchange…[intervene]     Mr Laher was in these negotiations.     He was; he was part of the locomotives…[intervene]     Mr Molefe, I do not know the answer to that, can I just tell you…[intervene]     If it is important, Mr Laher was from the finance department, he said he was a chartered accountant or he is a chartered accountant here, and he was part of the negotiating team.  Now, I understand there was a locomotive, negotiating team and then there was a Steering Committee, is that right?     And who comprised that Steering Committee?     We are going to come to it.     Let me just cut to the chase now.     Were you not part of the locomotive Steering Committee, you Singh and Mr Gama?     Right, so what…[intervene]     Yes, but who was in the negotiations was Mr Singh.      Right, and Mr Laher worked together with Mr Singh.     Right, so let me tell you what Mr Laher ’s evidence is Mr Laher says to Mr Singh - there is a     Sorry, if you do not mind just bear with me.  Did Mr Singh bring that to your attention?      Alright, so that is the issue of batch pricing.  Now, when we get to the Ministerial authority or approval, do I understand that you can get that ex post facto, do you need to get approval before the increase and the contract or can you just increase it and get approval afterwards?     Is it possible?     But should it be got before or after?     But what about if the Minister says no, I do not give approval?     Yes, well that is why presumably, it is wise to do so beforehand.     Yes, but that did not happen here, so there remains a very serious…[intervene]     But Mr Molefe you were the Group Chief Executive Officer, you proposed a massive increase in the ETC.  Did you not know that you had to get Ministerial approval?      Yes.     So Mr Molefe…[intervene]     If I could take you back to my question.  In relation to Ministerial approval, I take it you would accept that if legal and compliance failed to obtain Ministerial approval, you as the group chief executive must carry that can, it is not something that you can just palm off to legal and compliance you bear the ultimate responsibility obviously.     But how does one forget, sorry I suppose we lucky to have someone like you here to help us with this.  Once you - you talking about billions of rand’s.      How does one forget to get Ministerial approval for an increase of billions of rand’s?  I mean, yesterday, you pointed out to me just how much a billion or two or three is with reference to Transnet’s profits and turnover.  How does one forget or not insure, perhaps that is a better way of putting it, that this regulatory compliance is achieved?     Alright, let me go to something - would you also then accept that if the Chairperson finds that batch pricing was contrary to the RFP and ought not to have been allowed, that you must carry the can ultimately for that as well.     Thank you.  Can I take you still in bundle 6 please, to page 289, you see there that at the top of 289, this is from the MNS Report?      They deal with members of the Transnet Locomotive Steering Committee in 2014.  I will just ask you to confirm it was you, Mr Molefe, Mr Singh and with three others?     And you say you were not present in the negotiations; Mr Singh we know was would you confirm that?      And would he report back to you on the progress of the negotiations?     And did you expect him to do that honestly and faithfully?      And Mr. Gama, was he part of the negotiation?     And did he also report back to you?     Now I doubt that you would have expected him to do so honestly and faithfully as well, obviously?     Now, we know from Mr Laher that it took quite a long time to compile these memos that were presented to the BADC and the…[intervene]     Thank you.  I am sorry, I need just to retrace my steps and please forgive me if it is something that you have already answered.  Did you know that you, did you yourself know that you had to get Ministerial approval?     Yes, but that is not what I am asking you.  Did you know that you had to get Ministerial approval for the increase?  I mean, the falling through the cracks is not what I am looking at, did you personally know that you had to get approval?     You did know?      When you got approval for the transaction originally, were you involved in that process?     Did you sign off the documents as their group chief executive?     Alright, now let us just deal with one or two other things.  We know that CSR, they were awarded 359 of the 1064 locomotives, correct?     Can I ask you please to go to page ... 14 of Bundle 6.  And could I just direct your attention to a finding made by MNS at paragraph 2.5.2 are your there?    It says and I think we have touched on this already.  “Mr Sharma the Chairperson of the BADC and Essa were business associates through inter alia the business interest they had in various companies.  Mr Essa on behalf of one of his companies Tequesta concluded a business development service agreement with CSR Hong Kong on 18 May 2015.  Salient terms of the business development agreement state that  1. Tequesta was appointed to provide advisory services and particular assist CSR Hong Kong to secure the current electric locomotive tender and revenue will 2. In return Mr Essa would get paid 21% of the contract value concluded with Transnet.” That was what the research showed.  Would you know anything about that?    Did you know anything about links between Mr Sharma and Mr Essa?    And if you had known of them what would you have done?    My question is if you had known what would you have done?    Alright.  I want to turn now to another topic because finally we leave the locomotives and the transaction advisors around the locomotives.  Can I just ask you when – when those memoranda to the BADC and the board were prepared – just bear with me for a second.  And those – those memoranda we have seen – we have looked at them they were – they were approved or recommended in May of 2014, correct?    Can you recall whether or which consultants gave input into – into the increase in the ETC?    But can you remember who the …    Yes.    Alright.    And you do not know whether this was a point at which Regiments were on the scene to the exclusion of McKinsey or – you do not have a clear recollection of that?    Alright.  Can we please then turn to another topic and that relates to the Neotel contracts.    Now let me just before I take you to the relevant documents and I suppose it is refreshing that here we talking about something else now.  I know that you have dealt with this in your affidavit but I just ask you to confirm this before we go to the controversy.  Mr Molefe on the 31s t of October 2013.    Ms Chetty was then she was the acting Group Chief Executive.    And she awarded a contract to Neotel, is that right?    And then you reversed this decision and we will come to the reasons why and  you appointed T-Systems in a memorandum dated the next month 20 November, correct – 2013?  Is that right?    You did that without consulting with Ms Chetty, correct?    And you would have seen that she says well all your reasons for reversing her decision was bad.    She said all of your reasons for the reversing her decision were bad, you have seen that right?  You have seen her affidavit.    Ja let me just – I just trying to paraphrase things.    Because we are not – we obviously we do not have a lot of time left.    Over.  So she says that all of your reasons for reversing her decision are bad.  I am going to come to your – your position now.  Mr Volmink you would have seen also says your reasons for reversing the decision were bad.  Mr Van der Westhuizen also gives some evidence about this.    What we know then is about six months later on the 6t h of June 2014 after opinions had been obtained from the senior counsel and well I understand your external auditors you then revoke your decision.    Alright.  So tell us then why you changed and revoked Ms Chetty’s award to – to Neotel in favour of T-Systems.  Why did you take the contract from Neotel and give it to T-Systems?  And you dealt with it in your affidavit.  You – I am happy if you go there.    But Mr Molefe you did not need senior counsel to tell you that you cannot just simply take away a contract that had been awarded to Neotel and just give it to T-Systems. MR    There was no condition she had issued a letter.    You did not what?    You did not need to be told – I mean she had issued a letter of approval.    In favour of Neotel.    I mean just to make this very simple here is a woman who was acting in your position.    She awards a contract to Neotel does all the paperwork, signs all the letters, properly appointed.  You come along a month later without even talking to her…    Well – she – she awards the contract on 31 October.    We have gone through the chronology.  On 20 November – okay not a month, three weeks later.    You simply take away that contract from Neotel and you give it to T-Systems.    Alright well let us go to – let me go to Ms Chetty, her affidavit.  I think this is a new file BB6.    You have it?    Alright so if we have a look at page 88    SC88 that is your – I think it is the memo that you speak about.    This is on 20 November this is the reversal, correct.    This is quite a long memo and contains a lot of quoting you see at pages 89, 90, 91.    Let us get to the meat of it that is at 92.  You say at paragraph 7 and it is eloquently written. “I have the following specific concerns with your recommendation and responses to me including responses” Etcetera and you set them out a, b, c, d, e. “Counterparty risk and alienation of state assets. Concentration risk as Transnet is Neotel’s largest client. BBBEE partners. Information Security incident and CCTV camera exposures.” And then you go and articulate each of those points.  Correct?    And the balance of this.    And you then conclude that due to the above you were – you effectively revoke then the award and you appoint T-Systems we see that at the foot of page 92.    Yes.  And then what you also did at 22    If you go to – back to page 93 and paragraph 21 at the foot of the page.     “Post the close of the final offers being submitted T-Systems indicated that they unfortunately due to the strict timeline set by Transnet only managed to get confirmation from their shareholder on certain pricing elements and that they would be in a position to reduce the price submitted a week before by a further R248 million.”    As part of T-Systems best and final offer.  Is that right?    Even though they did not make that offer?    We are going to come to that.  Now…    Can you just point out to us where in this memorandum do you refer to the fact that Ms Chetty’s approval of the contract contained a condition precedent?    No in this memorandum?  These are your reasons for setting aside Neotel and awarding it to T-Systems where do you see reference here to her approval having contained a condition precedent that you have spoken about?    I see.  But in your evidence unless I misunderstood you it seems to me that that was the core issue.    Not alright.    Alright so…     Well I mean did you have an option Mr Molefe?    You did not have one.    Right. So could we go then please to Ms Chetty’s affidavit at page 6.    At page 6 of her affidavit SC006    Page 6 Chairperson SC6.    She in paragraph 17 addresses each of your reasons.  Counter risk and alienation, concentration risk, BBBEE partners, information security, CCTV issues and then at paragraph 18 she refers to a particular document and she says that clearly indicates that the possible price reductions could not be taken into account as the final pricing had already been submitted.  Mr Molefe could not approve that the price reduction be considered as part of T-Systems best and final offer as this prejudices the other bidders and is not considered fair and transparent.  And what she refers to there as annexure SC3 that you find at page 37.    Just bear with me for a moment because I want to just get a – she refers to a Tear Report T-e-a-r and what that stands for is a Tender Evaluation and Recommendation Report that you find at page 23 could you turn there please?  So this is a formal report that is being produced and if I could take you to page 37 you will see that the last third of the page between the second and third schedules. “After conclusion of the normalisation process a final clarification session was held with the three bidders to double check if they had not admitted anything in their price.  Bidder 5 who was T-Systems indicated during discussions that their joint venture partner may be able to negotiate optimisation with its shareholders which will result in an overall reduction of R248 million on the tendering – sorry the tender pricing. Bidder 2 and 3 also indicated minor possible price changes which would have resulted in slight adjustments in the final commercial proposals”     “I know as an indication of the pricing changes if the R248 million possible price reductions were to be taken into account in this project even though it is not possible since the final pricing had been submitted.” You see that that is the Tear Report.    Yes.    We can have a look into that but Mr Molefe once parties have submitted their final pricing.    During a tender …    Cannot – you know that you cannot do this.    But that does not answer the issue that I am putting to you.  I mean you know surely that when parties tender…    Okay well let me ask you this.    Well let me put my question this way.  Did you think well presumably you thought it appropriate to allow someone a price reduction outside of the tendering process?  Did you think that was (talking over one another).    But how?    Alright.    Yes.    But that does not detract from the concession that I think you fairly made.    Does not detract from the concession that I think you fairly made.    Now I could I suppose take you to Mr Volmink’s affidavit but I do not suppose it is necessary because I think you accept that ultimately the award in favour of T-Systems was irregular and needed to be reversed.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Chairman I see it is one o’clock.     Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, before lunch, we were dealing with Neotel/T-Systems.  I have referred you to the evidence of Ms Chetty here who has spoken about Mr Volmink.  I would like, for the first time, to take you to the evidence of Mr Van der Westhuizen.  That evidence you will find at Exhibit BB-7.  There are a number of files.  It is BB-7(a).       And if I could ask you, please, to turn to page 7?     Mr Van der Westhuizen, incidentally, is a Chartered Accountant and at material, it appears to have been an Executive Manager, Office of the Chief, Information Officer.  Now at paragraph 23, he refers to a     Did it happen or not?     You did ask him to hand over his cell phone?     Why?     For information leak purposes?     Alright.  At paragraph 26    Then he says over the page at     Alright.  And then below that,     Now if you go to paragraph 33, he says – and this is at page ...[intervenes]      So could I, please, take you back to page 5 at paragraph 15?     Page 5, paragraph 15.     At paragraph 15, Mr Van der Westhuizen sets out that there were five bidders who submitted proposals.  We know one was Neotel and then we also know one was T-Systems.  That was number 5 – at 15.5.  And you see there, T-Systems South Africa (Pty) Ltd.  It was a bid made in collaboration with Broadband Infraco.     Do you see that?     We can now go to paragraph 33 at     Yes.     Well, I take it that you will not...  I can take you to Exhibit BB-7(b) at page 348.  If you want, it is the Supra record.  Could you go there?     BB-7(b).     If you could turn, please, to page 348?     It is a CIPC company search.  If you turn to page 349, you go to the foot of the page and then you count up ten lines from the bottom.  So from the bottom up, you will see reference twice to Mr Salim Essa and you see that he resigned on 14 October 2014.  So at this time ...[intervenes]      From the bottom, count up 10.       Sorry, I beg your pardon.  It is Bundle BB-7(b).     Page 349.     I am sorry, DCJ.     Are you referring to the error in the date?     Yes, I beg your pardon.  So that is Mr Van der Westhuizen’s affidavit.  Have you ...[intervenes]      Yes, so that is what I have given you.  That is correct.     Yes.     Correct Chairperson.     We will do that DCJ.     So Mr Molefe then, at the time that you were dealing with the Neotel/T-Systems issue, you accept that Mr Essa was a Director of Broadband Infraco?      No, no.  I am asking you, do you accept that he was a Director of Broadband Infraco?     Alright.  Whilst dealing with Mr Essa. Perhaps I can turn to a different topic and that is – and I suppose importantly, it also still deals with T-Systems but this is the cession from T-Systems to Zest Galore(?)     Could I ask you, please, to go to Exhibit BB-3(a), Mr Mohamedy’s exhibit.       BB-3(a).     30.  Three, zero.     Page 30, and at the foot of the page, please, Mr Molefe at paragraph 12.5.2 under the heading T-Systems.  Are you there?     T-Systems said    Yes. “Transnet Group Capital was paying for approximately 2200 computers when only approximately 1100 were employed by the divisions...” Et cetera.  Of a particular reference then is     Let me take you to the agreement because you in fact signed it, the cession from T-Systems to Zest Galore.     That will you find in Mr Mohamedy’s next volume that being Exhibit BB-3(b).     Alright.  Can you ask you, please, to go to page 581?     Ja.     Thank you.  At MSN-581, you will find a cession and delegation agreement between Transnet, Zest Galore and T-Systems.  Do you see that?     And if I can take you to page 585 at     “And hereby accepts the cession...”     And if you then go forward all the way to page MSN 592, you will see that you signed that agreement. MR     Yes.     I do not have a memo.     The fact is that you signed it.     Now, can I take you, please, to Exhibit 5?     That appears correct.     So this is also something you dealt with in 2014.  Can I take you to Bundle 5, please?     And could you turn, please, to page 405.86?     Are you there?     Now that is a CIPC search on Zest Galore.     And if you could turn forward, please, to page 504.89 and right at the bottom of the page, there is a person by the name of Zenad(?) Osmani(?)  Do you see that?     Osmani.     At the foot of page 405.89.       Do you know that person?     Well, I just want to put it to you that she is or was at the time ...[intervenes]      .89 Chairperson.     Yes.       So I just want to put to you that Zenad Osmani was Mr Essa’s wife.       Do you know that?     Okay and we are...  So that is what I want to put to you.  Let us carry on with something else where Mr Essa features.  I want to turn now.     Zenad Osmani.     The person who ...[intervenes]      Yes.     You would have seen, DCJ, that she was a director in the year 2014.     Of Zest Galore.     So there was a cession from T-Systems to Zest Galore.     Mr Molefe signed that contract and this lady was a Director of Zest Galore and she is Mr Essa’s wife.     Now let us move to another topic.     But let us carry on then with another topic, also relating to Mr Essa and that is the Manganese Expansion Project.  Now you will remember, we have touched on this at the beginning.  Mr Henk Bester, who was then employed by Hatch Consulting, gave evidence about this.  Do you remember that?     Yes.     I just want to take you to five paragraphs of his affidavit.  That you will find at Transnet Bundle 4 and Mr Bester is Exhibit BB-19.       So if I could ask you, please, to turn to BB-19 and turn up page 29?     So at paragraph 19 and you would have seen this before so I am going to paraphrase it.  You will remember that Mr Bester ’s evidence was that Hatch was tendering and that there were people that made advances in relation to being appointed as its – the supplier development partner. And at paragraph 19, he talks about a meeting where Padayachee and Reddy, amongst the people that are referred to, indicated their respective companies to form a joint venture if they work with Hatch on phase 1. Padayachee further explained that they, him, Reddy and their respective companies, knew everything about the project and people high up in Transnet.       Then at paragraph 23.  He talks about a meeting and he says about five lines from the     Well, I think we have seen this contract yesterday, actually.  But this is the MNPQ(?).     The Manganese Contract.     Sure.     And then at paragraph 29, you will see there is a call from Padayachee, who indicated he would like to see him again.  They had a meeting.  Padayachee and Reddy advised that the confinement approval was imminent but that Hatch needed to sign the addendum to the MOU before confinement could be finalised.     Well, let us then deal with paragraph 65.  Now this is the meeting that was held at Melrose Arch, JB’s Corner, attended by Mr Essa...   “Essa clearly indicated that he can provide me with the submitted tender documentation from all the other bidders. He told me that they have already decided ...[audio cut] Eskom will be Molefe and that an announcement will be made in the newspaper soon.” I have already taken you to that.  I assume you have nothing further to say.     So, if you were asked to approve this would have looked at it more carefully, is that what you’re saying or not?     Well, let’s look at page 104.     Yes, because earlier in the year you had, in fact, approved this.     104, so this memo is dated, that I took you to at 142, it’s dated 17 August 2011. Let me take you to the memo at 104, this is no 23 March 2011.     You see, it refers there, at the bottom of the page, the same 3.5 of the settlement agreement.     And then it says, “Financial Implications”, over the page, “75% of the attached invoices have been paid to Mr Gama”, And then those attached invoices are invoices you see over the page Eversheds Attorneys and Bowman Gilfillan Attorneys.     And that you approved.     But I’m still – I’m not sure that I – in other words, if something is put before you for approval you can just sign it?     But  the thing is the Board hadn’t entered into that agreement.     Correct ...[intervenes]      Correct, Mr Molefe, but the point is, if you go to 3.5 the clause, Transnet will make a contribution equivalent to 75% to Mr Gama’s tax costs incurred in the High Court and in the labour matter.  What this memorandum lands up doing, is authorising Mr Gama to receive your costs.     No, it wasn’t the terms of the agreement was that he would get his costs, that’s what I’m taxing you about, …[intervenes].     When he was suspended?     Yes, thank you.  Let’s turn to another topic please and that is Abalozi, could I ask you to go to Transnet Bundle 3 and to Exhibit BB17.  Right, now could you please turn to page 499.     Yes, Chairperson, 499.     That is, as I understand it – look I understand that Mr Gama, I checked with my junior, in his affidavit’s he’s dealt with costs, but he doesn’t seem to have said much I understand that he may have a version that he will give and that might change things but as the evidence stands now, it’s correctly so.     No.     Yes, the referral to the Bargaining Council.     Yes.     So, Mr Molefe, can we turn to page 499, are you there?     So, we’re dealing now with Abalozi and you would have seen these paragraphs.  Mr Tadu was instructed by Bowman Gilfillan he was one of the attorneys dealing with the matter and you know up to this point litigation had been entered into, Transnet had sued Abalozi.  He says that, “I was subsequently invited together with one of my partners and counsel to attend a meeting with the Group CEO, Mr Molefe.  I prepared a note in anticipation of the meeting which briefly summarised the key message that I intended to communicate to Mr Molefe.  Then he goes on to say at 43, the meeting with Mr Molefe duly took place, Mr Molefe informed us that the litigation was sensitive and that he had been receiving calls from a person he did not identify by name, but I assume from the context was General Nyanda, asking why Transnet was assisting with the litigation against Abalozi”, Do you want to comment on that?     Right, then at 45, shortly before this meeting it appears that Mr Selinga had addressed a memorandum to Mr Molefe in which he motivated for and recommended the rescission of the decision that had previously been made to exclude GNS/Abalozi from doing further business with Transnet effectively a blacklisting, is that correct?     Because they hadn’t been afforded a fair procedure?     So, why didn’t you just give them one?     That I understand but did you ever enquire into why they were blacklisted?     And what did you discover?    Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe you know that, subsequently Transnet appointed a firm of attorneys, HNR to investigate this matter?      Yes, in other words to investigate whether – it’s their report that gave rise to the withdrawal of the litigation.     People refer to it often just simply as the Nupen Report, are you familiar with that?     Are you familiar with the report?     Yes, and do you know whether, in that report, there’s any reference to timesheets and this information and evidence that you’ve been telling…[intervenes].     Can you explain why that would be?     Nupen was appointed, and he gave a report to the Risk Committee, the Risk Committee accepted the report, and the litigation was withdrawn.     Do you know whether there’s any reference in the Nupen Report to this stock of information…[intervenes].     And if there’s no reference in it, then it seems it’s quite questionable…[intervenes].     And, if he didn’t, can you explain why, I mean he interviewed people at Transnet.     Do you know what he’s key conclusion was?    You don’t?    Well, his key conclusion was really that bodies hadn’t been provided, people hadn’t worked but value had been added or things saved.    Bodies had not been provided, warm bodies.    But that savings had been affected through certain initiatives.    Yes.    Do you see the tension, you say you’re sitting on a stock of information that proved in your mind that people had worked, and bodies had been provided.    By way of timesheets, you saw there were people working? MR    Alright, Mr Molefe one would, I suppose, have to study the report, and then reflect back on your evidence but let me get to another point.  Had you been seeking…[intervenes].    So, you confirm you were in touch with the General during this time?    But not General Nyanda it’s another General?    Okay, I beg your pardon.    Okay had you been speaking at all to General Nyanda?    He’s a friend of yours?    Because we know Mr Gama also, I think, played golf with him, he was obviously an avid golfer, the General.    Is this the General…[intervenes].    So, I’d like then to just move forward and wrap up on this.  So, the Risk Committee, ultimately on the Nupen Report took a decision that the litigation should be withdrawn.    And what we then know is that you signed the settlement agreement.    Yes.    So, can I just take you please to the deed of settlement that’s at page 789 of the same bundle, Bundle 3 BB16.    789, are you there?    You’ll see that at – between the tramlines is “Deed of Settlement”, are you there?    So, it talks about,  “Whereas Transnet issued summons etcetera, under that, whereas Abalozi issued a counter claim now…[intervenes].    I’ll read it into the record, thank you, I’m indebted to you. “...Transnet SOC (Ltd) Transnet.”    “Issued a summons against Abalozi Risk Advisory Services Pty Ltd Abalozi.”    “Previously known as General Nyanda Security Risk Advisory Services Pty Ltd GNS.”    “In connection with security services rendered to Transnet by GNS in the period 07 to 2009 the service, and whereas Abalozi issued a counter claim against Transnet in connection with the services.”    “Now wherefore Transnet and Abalozi have agreed to settle all disputes between them in this litigation on the following term.  One, Transnet hereby withdraws its action against Abalozi. Two, Abalozi hereby withdraws its counterclaim against Transnet.  Three, Transnet will upon signature hereof issue a media statement in the form as agreed and attached hereto marked A.  Four, Transnet will pay all the legal costs incurred by Abalozi, its directors and the cofounders and directors of GNS on an attorney and own client scale, and five the terms of the settlement are settlement agreement are confidential and shall not be disclosed by any one of the parties to any third party.” Are you there?    So this was a settlement of all disputes between the parties in this litigation.    Claim and counterclaim.    Yes, well the only amounts that are referred to is the costs.     So that had to be computed, the costs.     Have you any idea, and you negotiated this agreement.     Why did you agree that Transnet, first of all why did you agree that Transnet should pay any costs?  Transnet had sued Abalozi, Abalozi had sued Transnet.  Both parties were calling it a truce, but why should Transnet pick up the tab?    You said you negotiated this agreement, to settle.     You negotiated.    Yes.     Then I am asking you why did you decide that Transnet should pick up the tab?    But Mr Molefe, that was not the finding of the Newton report?    Yes, thank you, and then why costs incurred by Abalozi, its directors and cofounders and directors of GNS, why?  Were the cofounders, were they even party to this agreement, and the directors of GNS?    Why would you ...[intervenes]  MR    You must be careful, Chair.     Yes, okay.  So from 95 million, thank you Chairperson, to paying cost looks like a good deal.  When you negotiated this settlement, did you negotiate it with General Nyanda?    I see.    So let us have a look at what happened after that.  If you go to page 807 you were written a letter.  Your reference ...[intervenes]     807 Chairperson.    You had written a letter by Abalozi.    You see that, dear Brian and if you    808, paragraph 8.     Paragraph 8.  Are you sure you are in the right file Mr Molefe?    You need to be in Bundle 3, BB16.     Is this the same bundle that you had open when you were looking ...[intervenes]     808.    Okay, ja.  It is that time of the day when starts confusing the red numbers with the black numbers.    Okay.  So what they say, this is dated 16 October.    No, this is after the settlement.     This, okay.  So they say   “We think that settlement of 60 million would be justifiable.”     So you see, now they do not just want cost, they also want compensation for lost revenue.    Now let us look what you do, is you respond at 803 and at 803, perhaps I could read this into    “In full and final settlement of all legal claims and costs.”    “We will be pleased to receive your response to the aforesaid offer within seven days of receipt.”    Now as you have correctly said, as you say, you went from 95 million to cost.     But this amount that you settled on, was not settlement for costs.  It was something else.  It was cost and lost revenue and we do not know what and that is really the problem Mr Molefe, because when you look at the settlement agreement that you concluded ...[intervenes]     Transnet’s only obligation was to pay costs.     They write to you and they say well, we want 60 million.    Which includes cost and lost revenue etcetera, and you go back and say well I will give you 20 million.    So what were you paying this money for?      Yes, which one?      Yes.     Ja.     Yes, no we have seen this because that came after you had actually made this offer.  So they accepted your offer.  That is not unsurprisingly and then Mr Salinga and Singh action payment, but what we need ... what I want to ask you, is what were you paying this 20 million for? You made the counter offer.  It can only be cost on the evidence that you have given.      Yes, you must have.     You gave away 20 million rand actually.    Alright, I am happy to leave it there, thank you Chair.     There is just one other fact that I want to just put to you, and that is Mr Todd if my memory serves me correctly said that the costs could not conceivably been more than a million rand, because very little had happened in this litigation. There had been an exchange of pleadings and if my memory serves me correctly, I think they might have got to a discovery affidavit stage, but this litigation was not far advanced at all.      Mr Molefe, perhaps that is something that you could think about.     Yes, thank you.  I would like then, it is late in the afternoon Mr Molefe, to deal with the final topic, and that relates to witnesses 1 and 3.  Do you have Bundle 14d available?      I think the latter route might be preferable.     Because potentially he may not need to be recalled then.     Thank you.    Do you have Bundle 14d?  Can I ask you please to go to ...[intervenes]     Well, but General Nyanda, your golf partner, was the director of Abalozi.  That is a bit closer to home.  Alright.    Thanks.     14.    d, Mr Chair.    So ...[intervenes]     Page, I think it is 15.  One five.     Now Mr Molefe, I mean given the importance of this, I think it may warrant us going through it on a paragraph by paragraph basis almost.  Are you in the right file?      Page 15, witness 1.  But perhaps before I pick my way through this affidavit, could I just ask you to give us a summary of what your response is to witness 1’s affidavit, and I suppose in particular from page 1 through to, it should be 15 through to 24, up to the heading threats received.     Well, I think generally by way of very broad summary.  Witness 1 says, is that he was effectively Mr Molefe’s driver when he was at Transnet and that he took him on a number of occasions to the Gupta compound in Saxon World and to other meetings with the Guptas, and he gave certain evidence relating to money.  That is ...[intervenes]     As broadly stated as it can be.      Sorry, what did you say?    Yes.     Okay, we’ll let us just accept for a moment that he does not give evidence on your contractual of having seen someone give you money, but apart from that, would you then agree with this statement or what ultimately are you saying?      No, your analysis of his evidence, is he says very little.  He does not give direct evidence you say of people giving me money.    But what do you say to the content of his evidence, that he took you to all of these places.  What do you say about his observations?  Are you saying they are all wrong or are you saying …[audio cut] that he does not give evidence of someone giving me money.    So let us just go through, if you go to paragraph 10 of the affidavit at page 17.  When you say you do not know who witness 1 is, well he says that he acted as your driver for three years.    Three or four years.     Did you not also say earlier that you know who he is?    Did you not also say that you know who he is?    Yes.     But what are you saying, a bad motive, that you had a driver who had, who may have had a bad motive for this evidence?    No, absolutely.    But then Mr Molefe, can I ask you why did you not exercise your right to cross-examine this person?    Okay, so that is really your defence.  That there is no implication of wrong doing?    So are you prepared generally to accept the statement that your main opposition or defence is it does not implicate me in wrong doing?    Alright.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.  Alright.  I might ask you to show me your bag later, but yes.  MR    Yes.     Alright.  So let us go through this.  He says that or she, I am going to perhaps just refer to he, and I do not mean to disclose the gender of the person, but    Okay, and then it says   Then he says, the driver says   And at 14   15   Alright.  Then 16   17, the driver says   18, sorry anything else to say?    Okay, 18   Alright.     Then we have the heading meetings    Sure   “I was either informed by Molefe that he was going to meet with AJ or I actually saw AJ at these venues or both.”    Paragraph 20   So what the table reflects, is that in the 14 month period between July 2011 and September 12, the driver took you to Saxon World on 11 occasions, twice to the Michael Angelo, once to the Fire and Ice and once to Sahara.      But it seems, would you dispute what is said here?    Alright.  Now you will see that at page 21 after the schedule references in the log book to Saxon World, Saxon, Saxon World etcetera are all ...[intervenes]    Just above 21.  There is a key there where he explains that any reference ready to Saxon or Saxon World is a reference to the Gupta residence.  Reference to the Michael Angelo is the Sandton Michael Angelo.  Reference to Melrose Arch, presumably it should be hotel, refers to the Protea Fire and Ice, and Midrand Sahara refers to the offices of Sahara Computer.     “After September 2012 I no longer transported Molefe to Gupta Saxon World residence.” Any comment on that?    He says   Not as I understand the evidence.  He says it was towards the end of July 2014 that he was re-deployed to Durban.    So you agree with that?      Then at paragraph 23   “On arrival at the Gupta residence I would wait for Molefe in our vehicle to return, as can be seen from the table above the visits to the residence usually lasted between 20 and 45 minutes.”    What do you say to that?    Those are relatively short meetings.     Perhaps if I, sorry Mr Chair are you finished?    No, no please you are ...[intervenes]     Just in that regard, could I take you back to page 20 please?  Have a look at this ...[intervenes]     No, page 20.  The table.  You see the first entry at the top, 29 July at 20H11 Saxon World.     He arrives or you arrive at ten, and leave ... sorry six o’clock in the morning and leave at seventeen minutes past six ...[intervenes]     In the morning.     And then the fifth entry in the middle of the page, 19 t h of October you arrived at ten to six in the evening and you left at six o’clock.  So that is a ten minute meeting, the first one is 17 minutes.     And then if you go over the page, to page 21, the second entry on the 28 t h of May 2012 you arrive at twenty to seven in the evening and you leave at ten to seven.  Ten minutes.     What would you have been doing?    Well, that is what the log books say.    But they, what ... can you think of what you might be doing for only ten ...[intervenes]     Mr ...[intervenes]     Then at paragraph 24, at page 22   25   Sure.     26   Sorry?    Yes.     Okay, that you find sorry at page 66.  Did you have a similar brown leather back pack to that one?    Did you have the one that you have got on the chair next to you?    It was that one?    There we go.    Alright, so that is a brown leather back pack.     And was that, is that in fact it looks quite worn.  Was it the same back pack that you had at the time?    It is like my briefcase.  It is also falling apart.     Okay, so ...[intervenes]     Well, that is a brown leather back pack I suppose.    Alright.    So Mr Molefe, I suppose if it was not so serious it might be funny, but do I understand you to be saying that that back pack that you have just shown the Chairperson, your trustee brown leather back pact was in fact the same one that you had ...[intervenes]     The same one?    Alright.    Yes.     Alright.     So then at 27   Yes.     Yes.     Thank you.  So he says at 27   It had contents.     So this paragraph you do not recall?    Then he says at 28   What do you say to that?    If we go back to 28, the driver says   Yes.     Yes, perhaps I referred you to the wrong page.  That has been done.    The W1-17.  That is a cover page to each of these things.  That you will find at page 68.    I do apologise.     Yes.     Yes.     Over the page.     Alright, we will work on that Mr Chair.    Sorry?    I beg your pardon?  Well, I wanted to    “Undertaken to the offices of Sahara Computers is attached as W1-18.”    No recollection.  Then at 29   Yes.  He met AJ, also met AJ in the presence of Molefe.     If I might just have a second?  You have no recollection of that?    Then at 30   Alright and then people recognized at    One thing I perhaps neglected to ask you, earlier on in your testimony when discussing your relationship with the Guptas and your visits to the Gupta residence, who would you see there?    Yes, but who else?    Sorry?    Yes.     On those occasions when you did see someone else, who were they?    So do I take it to be then your evidence that you never saw any politician during your visits there, that you never saw any ...[intervenes]  MR    Alright and then there is a heading saying Molefe in possession of cash.    Paragraph 32.     “One day whilst attending a meeting in the main board room at the Carlton Centre Molefe asked me to fetch his cellular phone from his bag in his office.”     “As instructed I went to his office and when I opened his light brown leather backpack to take out the phone I was surprised to see that the bag was more than half full with bundles of R200 notes.  I called Mbele to Molefe’s office and I showed her the cash in his bag.” Now what do you say to that?    Well let us go through this presumably you did have meetings on occasion in the main board room at the Carlton Centre?    If you had left your cell phone in your bag would it – might you try and retrieve it by asking somebody in the position of your driver to do so?    Is it possible that that happened?    From your light brown leather backpack?    So the only issue is you say well if I had asked him to do that he would not have come across these bundles of R200 notes.    But he says   But would you…    Now he says   So just that I have your evidence correctly.  Your evidence is you never kept money or any real quantity of money.    You never kept money or any real quantity of money in your light – in the bag you have shown us?    And then in paragraph 33. “Upon his return from the meeting I approached Molefe about the fact that he was carrying that much cash in his bag which I considered a safety risk.  Molefe was visibly upset with my comment and told me that it was none of my business.” You say to that?    But Mr Molefe how does one deal with this?  I mean here is a driver and you say really that 90% of the statement you do not dispute it is only when the word cash really enters the equation that you say you do not have a recollection.  You say you could have been in a meeting in the main board room.    Yes.    Yes I am ..    Yes.    Yes thank you.    Yes perhaps I can re-style it.  In relation to this particular incident that he recounts here would you accept that if he had come across a lot of money in your bag it would not have been – it would have been a natural thing perhaps for him to have raised it with your PA.    Yes but you see what he says is that you were upset and you told him that it was none of your business.  He raised it with you directly.    Just that I understand it so this your backpack that you have shown us with your – if you had left your cell phone in your backpack would that backpack then be in your office?  Is that – he say I went to his office because as you said if you had left your phone and you were in a meeting you might ask your driver to go and fetch it from your office.    Is that right?      And what your – I take it your secretary or your PA worked close to your office?    Then at paragraph 34  “I furthermore frequently deposited cash amounts on behalf of Molefe at ABSA, Standard Bank and Nedbank in and around the Carlton Centre in various bank accounts.”     “Usually between the 28t h of the month and the 5t h of the following month and sometimes also around the middle of the month.”    What do you say about that?    You drew cash to deposit cash.    But would it not…    But why not just make an electronic transfer?    So what sort of things would this relate to then?    Right.  What type of society?    Right what other – what other things?    But there could have been…    Then the driver goes to say  “The cash amounts would be handed to me by Molefe’s PA in envelopes which Molefe had handed to her with the instruction that I should do the deposit.” Would you agree with that?     “I handed the deposit slip to either Molefe’s PA or Molefe himself after doing the deposits at the bank.” Would you agree with that?    And he says – or the driver says at 35 “I would count the money or deposit it varied in amounts but usually several thousand rand at a time.”    Alright.  So it seems that the main area of disputes then or dispute is 27 the sports bag that you – you deny that you would leave the Gupta residence – you would reappear carrying a sports bag which appeared to contain something.  You deny that you ever instructed the driver to deliver an empty leather bag to Ajay and then you deny this issue in relation to the cell phone and money being found in the bag.  Those are the main areas of dispute.    But otherwise by and large I think as the Chairperson has asked you – you do not seem to take particular issue with the statement, is that – would that be a fair summary?    It was – yes I am talking about the parts that I have taken you to.    Alright.  Is this is – As I understand it it was reported in the press that there was an attempt on – on Witness 1’s life a few days ago.    So have you got any idea I mean the person who made this statement is obviously in a difficult position in his life the driver.  There is threats being made on his life.  It is a sets out the threats that gave rise to his driver’s evidence being given in camera.  It – can I ask you to address the question of why – why would somebody put themselves into this position if their version was simply a pack of lies?    The position of fearing for your life.    Well the point is that this person and I am not suggesting Mr Molefe it is you but what the – what this driver has done…    Well you have seen what he says about the threats that were made that caused the DCJ to allow his evidence to be given in camera.  You have also heard about reports that there was an attempt on his life a few days ago.      Yes I just – I mean why would somebody falsely implicate someone like you in circumstances where they fear for their life?    Right.    Yes thank you.  I want to take you then to Witness 3.    That affidavit you find at page 122.    Now Witness 3 says when dealing with these CPO Services to Minister Gigaba.     You would have seen that he says at paragraph 22 at page 126. “That whilst waiting in my vehicle for Gigaba to return from meetings inside the Gupta residence I noticed on different occasions people arriving or leaving the premises that I recognised. Individuals in this regard included and there you see firstly Mr your name Brian Molefe.” What do you say to that?    But it seems to me that I mean you would accept that given the frequency with which you went to the Gupta residence that it was possible that you would have been seen there.    By other people.    Mr Gigaba.    So let us then turn to paragraph 46 at page 130.  Witness 3 says that this is under the heading Bags received from men of Asian descent at Three Rivers Lodge. Witness 3 says and this is at a time when he is providing services – CPO services to Mr Anoj Singh your CFO.  He says at 46. “During July 14 Transnet executive management attended a week long strategy session at the Three Rivers Lodge in Vereeniging.”    Would you accept that?     “I dropped Singh off at the venue early in the week and picked him up on the Friday afternoon again.”     “While I waited for Singh on the Friday afternoon to finish at the session I noticed four men who appeared to be from Asian descent (they looked like Chinese men to me) standing around a Hyundai H1 vehicle in the parking area.  Two of the men appeared to be busy with a conversation on a cell – cellular phone.” Any comment on that?    49. “The next thing I noticed how the two men (who spoke on the cell phone) took two luggage bags from the vehicle, one black and the other maroon and went inside the Lodge area where the executive management meeting was held.”    “At around 15h00 I received a sms from Singh requesting me to come to the conference room where the meeting was held.  As I entered the room the two men who took the luggage bags into the Lodge were in the room together with Molefe and Singh.”    And when you had these weeklong sessions I presume do they finish on a Friday?    At what time would you finish up typically with the conference?    You presumably give people time to be able to travel back.    In daylight hours.    And this is in the winter time you know?    Yes well it was July.    2014.    Alright.   “Singh pointed to the maroon bag.” At paragraph 50. “And requested me to take the bag to our vehicle that being his – Singh’s vehicle.”     “I took the bag and I put it in the boot of the vehicle.” Then at paragraph 50.1 over the page; page 131. “I need to mention that the bag was really heavy I however did not know what it contained at the time.” Sub 2. “I recognised that the bag – sorry I recognised the bag as one of the luggage bags that the Chinese men had earlier taken into the meeting room.” Have you any comment on that?    And then 51. “While I was seated in our vehicle waiting for Singh after putting the maroon luggage bag in the boot of the vehicle I saw Molefe’s driver I cannot clearly recall if it was Witness 1 or a colleague pulling a black luggage bag from the same Lodge venue to the vehicle that was used to transport Molefe.” What do you have to say?    Yes because Witness 3 goes on to say   So just so that we – we understand the facts there are two bags on this version that are taken into the conference centre.  One maroon bag, one black bag.  On this version a maroon bag goes back into Mr Singh’s car and the black bag goes into your car.  You see – you follow that?    Let us see.    Alright.    I am just putting the facts to you on this statement Mr Molefe.    Alright.  What I was trying to get at if you just be a little bit patient please is I want to track what on this statement happened to the maroon bag.  If you have a look at paragraph 52. “The next Monday Singh drove to the Carlton Centre with his BMW M3.” You know Mr Singh to drive a BMW M3?     “He left the vehicle in the basement for the week and that Friday afternoon I was about to take Singh’s vehicle to the car wash.  As usual I checked that there was no valuables in the boot that could go missing.  As I opened the boot I saw the maroon bag that I had collected at the Three Rivers Lodge the previous Friday.  When I picked the bag up I realised that it weighed less than before.  I opened the bag to see what was inside and I noticed a couple of rolls of R200 notes.  I sms’d Singh and informed him that the bag was still in the car.  He immediately came down to the basement and collected the bag from me.” So this is his version as to what happened to the maroon bag.  I suppose the question is what happened to the black bag?    Alright.  So I want to just ask you some – some more general questions on this.  So the – the evidence and I do not want to overstate it but the evidence of the money flows, him, research that they have done and I have put these things in fairness to you for the last three days points to a large scale money laundering by  At Transnet.   Of course you right that ultimately that finding would have to be made by the Chairperson but that is what the evidence points to.   And what the evidence points to is that it is the procurement system that was abused by Regiments and Mr Essa to facilitate that money laundering.  What the evidence also appears to point to is we know that contracts that you were involved in, confinements that you were involved in, that Mr Singh was involved in and Mr Gama to a lesser extent were contracts that were used as a vehicle for money laundering.  I have put all of this to you.      No I did not – I said some not all contracts obviously – contracts. And we have been through the evidence. Now assuming that the Gupta’s were involved in money laundering to an abuse of the procurement system presumably those people that allowed that I ask you presumably there would be some kind of quid pro quo if those people were complicit.  Would you agree with me?    So I am not suggesting when I put this proposition to you that you were complicit in the money laundering but if there were Transnet managers that were – that enabled it presumably they needed to be some kind of quid pro quo?    Because you see …    Well I would ask you to – one assumes that if you complicit in money laundering and you facilitating it as a manager you need to get something in return.    As a general proposition.  Correct?    So just leaving Mr Gigaba aside for a moment and just focussing on you and Mr Singh.  He was your CFO, correct?    And when the two of you to Eskom you were replaced – swopped with Mr Gama and Mr Peter? Correct?    Ja and what these three drivers do to a greater or lesser extent is they implicate all of you in …    These three drivers.  They implicate all of you to a greater or lesser extent in visiting the Gupta’s and that did not apply necessarily to Mr Gama but visiting the Gupta’s in some instances and…    Well there is the statement.    Well what you – and just bear with me for a moment.  They all in relation to you put you at the Gupta residence.  A man gives some evidence about the fact you say I deny that I came with a pull sports bag back to the car.  I deny that I gave Ajay Gupta a leather bag.  I deny that there was money in …    What they point to is you carrying large amounts of money certainly in relation to the cell phone issue.  What I am trying to get at Mr…    Yes.    Just bear with me for a moment.  What we – what we do know is they certainly say directly that Mr Singh received bags of money and they say Mr Singh took the money to Knox Vaults.    Knox Vault.  You did not have a safety deposit there?    Mr Singh’s replacement Mr Peter driver’s also give limited evidence about him going to the Gupta residence but they also speak about bags going to the Knox Vault.  That was his replacement. You have read no doubt or listened to the driver’s evidence in relation to Mr Gama where that driver gives evidence of lots of cash being found in relation to Mr Gama. You have seen that evidence. What ties the four of you together is that you had at least some connection with the Gupta’s.  You had by far the strongest one.  And that there is either direct evidence on large money transactions and collections or indirect evidence like in your case where the driver says he had a half full bag of R200 notes.    Were you ever given money by Mr Singh?    When you say you cannot recall might you have?    No that is not what I am asking Mr Molefe.    Well you tell me.    Well let me perhaps take you there.  We were dealing with – with Witness 3 let me take you to that – to that paragraph.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you.  Do you still have the bundle BB-14(d) open, do you?       I said I just refer you to the one paragraph that you questioned.  Can I ask you to go to page 133?     14(d), the one we have been in.     Page 133.  You will see at paragraph 64 that... that he transported Mr Pita on approximately 15 occasions to this restaurant in Turffontein for meeting with Mr Essa.     Yes.  They would have extended lunches and they would drink a lot of alcohol.  There again, you see Mr Essa featuring prominently, not so?     DCJ, we have no further questions for Mr Molefe.     Yes.     Thank you Chair.     Oh, ja...     No, I do apologise for having forgotten about this.     Mr Molefe, there is one thing that I want to raise with you.     And that is.  Yesterday you said that – we were speaking, as I recall, about Mr Jiyane.     Or someone who you said could give evidence.     And it was in that context that you     Now you are speaking of the current Secretary of the Commission?     Yes.     You understand the seriousness of what you said about him?     “He is not very helpful because he  has issues.  I think it has to do with the fact that he once lost a tender and lost the court case...”   What ...[intervenes]      But Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]      Yes? MR     So Mr Molefe, just so that I understand this. You say – your – you had bad experiences with Professor Malesela at the Commission.  In what respect?     Yes?     Could I ask you Mr Molefe?  You...  There was a delay in advising you as to whether the summons applied to Transnet or Eskom?     Sorry?     I am not springing to his defence.     Well, just...  I am trying to understand...  So I do understand that you say that there was a delay in telling you as to whether the summons applied to Transnet or Eskom.  Ja, I follow and you say that happened in December/January.  Then ...[intervenes]      Yes?     Alright.     Alright.     Mr Molefe, if you just bear with me, though.  I understand that.  Then you talk about other treatment.  Is it confined to the failure to respond to that correspondence?  That is really all I want to know.     What do you mean the general demeanour?     But you need to articulate that.  I do not understand.  I mean, you do not deal directly yourself.     The need for...?     But you make a very serious allegation in public ...[intervenes]      You want to leave it?     No other questions Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:  Good morning Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    Good morning Sir.    Yes.    Yes this is – this does not compare with base price.  It compares the total price which includes the other things that I talked about yesterday that are based on assumptions    So in fact what that could be is just a difference in the different assumptions on hedging, forex and so on.    Ja I do remember Chairperson that in the memo it refers to the – the project continuing to be NPV positive which means that the net present value of the acquisition would be positive.  I remember.    Net – NPV Net Present Value.    The acquisition would be positive which means that it has a positive value to Transnet.  NPV is – ja it is a calculation that people make in the financial markets    So generally as a rule a negative NPV means you should not do the investment. A positive NPV means that you can do the investment.    In fact I think in the…    In the memorandum or …    I cannot remember exactly what it is.    But it acknowledged that the NPV was positive.    Chairperson when you do cost benefit analysis there are things like accounting costs and so on that are comparable.  But the total – the true cost benefit analysis includes things that cannot be quantified in rands and cents and these are the considerations that we made for example that the locomotives were failing – then the three locomotives were failing.  And there is no value that is put to that although in the end they will have a cost.   So that was not the value of the failing locomotives is not built into a cost benefit analysis like that  So in the end a cost benefit analysis – an accounting cost benefit analysis is just a guide.   In the end you have to go with what you think would be in the interest of the company.    Okay.  Yes.    Yes.  My – yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson these documents indicate the – the correspondence between Transnet Engineering – sorry TFR Engineers detailing the failures of the Mitsui locomotives.    So these different matters and the tables that show the instances where the Mitsui locomotives had failed in – in the period preceding our decision to do the award.    Yes they were brought to my attention at the time but I have recently been able to get these documents.    That actually show.    Yes.    No, not the letters.    In fact that the locomotives had been failing.    They were failing yes.    Ja.    Failing means break downs.    Yes.    It was something that was brought to my attention at the time.    Generally relate to that topic yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So it is the file that keeps it.    Yes.     Yes.    Ja I think that if the business case was presented to the board it must be the final – the signed version must have been presented to the board.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and just to add that I presume that they were approving the signed document.    Ja.  Which – which I do not know if Transnet still has the signed document but that is the document that was approved.    The signed business case.    Exactly.    Would it have been – it would have been the signed version ja.    So all I am saying is I do not know if what you have just seen now.    Is an earlier draft.    That was not signed.    Yes that – it includes the R38.6 billion yes.    The R38.6 billion.    Yes  I just wanted to hear properly from his eye Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was that – was that their conclusion?    Come again.    And what was the amount that they    Huh?    Yes I do.    Chairperson let me – let us just cut to the chase.      Let us cut to the chase.    And just explain what happened.    Chairperson when a procurement of this nature is done because we saved an estimate how much we think it will cost to buy locomotives and these are big numbers.  So the number that you come out as an – with as an estimate you can assume that from a negotiation point of view that is going to be the base.  That is going to be the minimum from which you move from.  And that number even if you confidentially take it to the board it is going to take – to come out – it is going to – to go out into the market.  So this number – the R38.6billion was an – a desktop estimate.  It was not even arrived at by doing a – by phoning suppliers around and saying how much do you think you will sell us a locomotive for?  It was the desktop estimate but it had to be a conservative desktop estimate.  You can imagine Chairperson if we had gone out with an ETC of R50 billion we would have ended up at 75 in the purchase.  So the ETC was R38 billion it is not a price, it was an estimate; a desktop estimate that was done at Transnet.  Now people say that the price increased from R38 billion to R54 billion.  That cannot be true because the R38 billion was not a price.  It is like if you want to buy a car and you budget R100 000.00 and you want to buy a specific car.   And then when you go out to go and buy the car you find that it is R160.000.00.  Do you say therefore that you have just incurred an additional R50 000.00 in buying the car?  Just because you estimate your budget was R38 billion or the budget that – that you knew would become public was R38 billion.  So – so let us start there.  We went out on tender with an ETC of R38 billion.  The tenders came back. When they came back they were nowhere near R38 billion.  When – when actually we put together – in my affidavit I actually detail this.  If I can go to my affidavit?  So we went out with R38 billion and the market came back with another number.      38?    Thanks.    Yes 39 page 39 paragraph 55.  The – the price that we went out with was in fact R38 billion.  The suppliers came back with a number.  In fact that was between 38 and 49.  I am just surprised that I did not catch it here.  But it was about 43 of 44 the number.  I am surprised that I did not write it down here.  And that was their offer when they submitted the tenders.      The bidders.    Ja.  And so for the…    Around 43 – 43 – 44.    Ja that was the number that they gave 43 – 44 that was the number that for the first time we saw what the market was prepared to pay and it was not 38 billion.  And that number does not represent an increase from 38 billion it was what the bidders said they could pay.  So now they submitted their tenders and they were evaluated and after they were evaluated the – there was further negotiation and the biggest thing in the negotiation was to fix the price so that there are no escalations.  After those negotiations of hedging and so on and so forth the final price that the bidders were prepared to pay was 49 billion.  To that …    That said – sorry that the bidders were prepared …    They were prepared…    To pay with their locomotives for the money.    Yes it is English Chairperson.  But the final price that the bidders were prepared …    To receive for their locomotives was R49 billion.    49 billion – 49.547.    Ja it increased from 43.    43 – 44 it increased from the original tender price.    The price of their tenders.  If you look at paragraph 57 I show you…    Yes.    38 billion that was desktop estimate.    Ja.    Higher than…    Yes.    After negotiations.    Ja.    Ja.    So I was…    I was not part of the negotiating team but the biggest issue in the negotiations was you must give us a price that will not change over 7 years.  So you cannot come back and say there was forex, there was this there was this it must be fixed price. And for giving us a fixed price they wanted to be paid more and that was in my understanding that was the main component of the increase and they took it to 49.    To 49    Yes.    Over 7 years yes.    And then on top of that – that was what was going to be paid to the bidders.  On top of that Transnet decided to add onto that price.  It is money that is not automatically payable.  It is called a contingence.  So we went to the board and said the price is 49 but we would be allowed an additional 10% for unforeseen things that during the procurement we may require in the locomotives.  It is like a contingency.  I think it is standard practice.    No.    No the – contingency is – no that there was a certainty on what we had agreed on there was a certainty.  But then unforeseen is I do not know like what but unforeseen things, acts of God things like that were to happen or whatever could happen that we would have a % contingency.  Now this is – this is standard practice in projects like this that when you have a project amount you add onto it a usually 10% contingency.  So if for example the procurement even if everything was fixed and so on came to not 49. – 49. 547 but came to 50 or 51 that would be covered by the contingency.  So it was approved up to 54.  So it is 49 up to 54 the 10% is a contingency.  Now Chairperson in paragraph 57 I show you the summary of the per unit price from the bidders.  So the pity that this does not translate to the multiplied by the number of locomotives but the price per locomotive – the price per locomotive at – at submit – at the time of submitting the bid from CSR was for example 32.46.  The final price after negotiations was 50.48 it increased by 18.02million per locomotive.  The increase from Bombardier was twenty ...[audio cut] million per locomotive, increase.  GE was 9 million per locomotive and CMR was R 12.42 million per locomotive.  So if you take the BAFO multiply by the number of locomotives, you will come to the number that I am talking about, about 43.  And then if you take the final price multiply by the number of locomotives, you will come to 49.547 billion. So there is no one, Chairperson, who sat in a room and just increased the price from R 38 billion to R 54 billion, costing the taxpayers 15 billion.  Nothing like that happened.  It is a fundamental misunderstanding of the process and what happened, which is why I could not understand that MNS does not understand it.     No, I did not explain the...  Well, the ETC is not the price.       Yes.     [No audible reply]     BB-4(f).  Yes.     Oh, Chairperson, if you may indulge?  You have asked me a question that I did not answer actually.  Mr Callard made a calculation.     So did Mr Laher and it is in my, I think it is in my affidavit.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Page 17?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     The R 38.6 billion?     Yes.  So my question is.  If they say the R 38.6 billion included the forex and hedging costs.  What portion of the R 38.6 billion was the forex and hedging costs?  And on top of that.  What were the assumptions behind the correlation ...[intervenes]      ...of those costs?     ...because forex and hedging costs, as I pointed out yesterday, depend on – because their future based on ...[intervenes]      ...your view of what is going to happen on the future are very difficult to estimate going forward.  So, ja, if they excluded or included, if they did make a detailed calculation.  What portion of it was this forex and hedging costs ...[intervenes]      ...on the R 38.6 billion?     That may be ...[intervenes]      That may be their conclusion but from where I was sitting ...[intervenes]      ...the figure was R 38.6 billion.     They would go out on tender.  They would come up with numbers.  We would negotiate and that will be the final price.     Yes.     There was no calculation made of exactly how much the forex and hedging ...[intervenes]      There was an assumption that they would be there.     Yes.     Chairperson, from where I was sitting, the figure was R 38.6 billion.    The 38 ...[intervenes]     The ETC was R 38 billion that we went to the board with.      Ja.    The passage from the Business Case that we read ...[intervenes]     ...said it excluded ...[intervenes]     ...forex.      Yes.    Ja, my understanding, to put it goodly is, it did not really matter.  So the Business Case says it excluded.  That was the R 38 billion excluded.  That is fine.      Yes.    Ja.  You see, Chairperson, what we are trying to determine here is whether the R 38 billion was a perfect number, whether it was a number that reflected, really, that what you are trying to determine.  Ja.  I am saying it did not and it did not have to.  Ja.  It was a number that we would go out to market with.      The number that reflects reality is the number that bidders come back with.    Yes.  That is what happens.  The rest of the things, Chairperson.    Once person can say this locomotive is R 20 million and another says this locomotive is R 25 million.  The difference in the five million can be justified using a myriad of reasons.  At the end of the day, the question is, the price of the locomotive is what they put to you as and if they are willing to pay for it.  That is the final...      If they come up with a number for the price of a locomotive that we are not willing to pay, there is no price.  If the bidders looked at our R 38 billion with or without forex hedges and so on and other things...  We could have put in the cost per screw that is in every locomotive, the cost per wheel of a locomotive, the cost per steering wheel, the cost of a breaking system, the cost of...   So we could have detailed it.  At the end of the day, what matters is, is the number at the bottom and it was R 38 billion.  So it had forex.  The Business Case says it did not.   So what I am saying is.  This exercise of determining whether the R 38 billion included or did not exclude forex hedging.  It does not matter.  What matters is, what were the bidders willing to pay?    Yes.    You are you going to drive?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, Chairperson, so when you are going to drive from Durban to Johannesburg.  What are the costs?  So it is petrol.    And tolls.    And what else?    Those are the costs, né?    So there is wear and tear of your tyres.    There is the cost per kilometre of running your engine.    There is the oil.    Even if it is just a small amount.    Right?  And then in – on the way, your car maybe chipped, the windscreen maybe chipped.  There is the damage to the paint.  Even if it is small, that is a cost, right?     So what I am saying is that, at the end of the day, the question is.  Are you willing to pay R 500,00 to travel from here to Durban or are you willing to pay R 1 000,00.  That is what matters.  But going – being    And what I am saying is that, the bottom line is.  What are you prepared to pay to travel from here to Durban?  Prepared to pay to travel from here to Durban, even when you do not know what the costs of the wear and tear of the tyres are.  And I am saying ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    So those are ...[intervenes]     Well ...[intervenes]      Ja.     See, you are elevating the hedging costs to the price of the toll.     There are things like the hedge of costs ...[intervenes]      ...are like the wear and tear ...[intervenes]      ...of the tyres.     And the oil and other things.     So at the end of the day, Chair, you can go and see the car hire companies.  They charge different amounts per kilometre for hiring their cars.  So if you were     Yes, I did so but the Business Case, as you pointed out, had then corrected me, said it excludes.     But what that reflects ...[intervenes]      What that reflects is that that was not uppermost in my mind.     What was uppermost in my mind was, what will the bidders be willing to pay?     And to receive.     Okay Chair, I may well have, yes.     Come again?     I tried to explain Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]      ...that this thing that you are going on about was from where I was sitting not an important issue.  I think we are nit-picking about the wear and tear of the tyres, really ...[intervenes]      ...in the trip from Durban to here.     No.  You see, this is exactly my point.     So there was a Business Case of R 38 billion.  Mister...  Is it Laher?     Laher?     Recalculated it and came to a calculation of R 43 billion, is it?     Yes? ADV     Yes.     Yes.     No.     No.     ...I was not implicated?  Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     No, not only that.       It displays mister...  What is his name?  Choubey?     Yes.  Mr Choubey’s lack of experience.     ...and unprofessionalism.     Because he says the increase in ETC from R 38.6 billion to R 54.5 billion was not justifiable.  R 54.5 billion is not ETC.       So those two numbers, R 38.6 billion is ETC.  R 54.5 billion is something else.     R 54.5 billion is based on what the bidders gave us as prices.     ...he is comparing things that a person with a minimum of understanding of finance ...[intervenes]      ...should not be comparing.     We recommended that there should be an increase?     Can I see that recommendation?     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes?     731?     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Seven...?     Yes.     To note the reasons for the increase in ETC?     “To request that the... is recommending an increase in the ETC from 1064 to... from R 38.6 billion to R 54.5 billion.”     Yes.     Oh, ja.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     But can we clarify one thing?       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Except that in substance the 54.5 billion is not an estimate, it is the outcome of negotiations.     Yes, yes.     Perhaps, Chairperson …[intervenes]     Yes, perhaps, Chairperson, our using of that same language in this memo reflects a similar …[intervenes]     Amateurism.     That we also heard.     But the substance, the substance is that the difference between the 38.6 billion is that the 38.6 billion was an estimate of what the trains would cost, 54 is the actual cost.  So actually on reflection this should not have been crafted as an increase in ETC, it was to say that we had budgeted to spend 38.6 billion, the reality is that the trains are going to cost 54.5 billion after the bidder submitted the price and after negotiation.  And I think what the memo tries to capture is the differences that led to the increase of 54.5 billion or rather 49 because 5 million of it is contingency.  Ja, so the main drivers are what is captured in the memo.     So – and these main drivers were the outcome of negotiations.     All of us.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Forex and …[intervenes]     Escalations are functions of assumptions that change with time even with the people that are calculating it.  So if I was to ask you if they were included in the 38 billion, how much was it and what were the assumptions?     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     No, I do not.     Chairperson, can I make a point?     With the different assumptions that are being made on the calculation of this ETC.  The fact of the matter is that there was a calculation of billion with or without correct hedging and assumptions and so on, there was a figure of 38 billion.  Then Mr – is it Laher, was asked to calculate ETC.  So he calculated ETC and came to about I think 43 billion, thereabouts.  He says in his evidence that I recalculated it and this is what I arrived at and then Mr Callard also made a calculation of the ETC.  I not sure what his assumptions were …[intervenes]     No, I am trying to – I am trying to…     So they were actually of the ETC, so these three calculations are based on the first figure.  So the first one is 38 billion unless this agreement or a controversy or representations or misrepresentations that it did or did not include hedging.  So that was 38 billion.  Mr I think Laher calculated to 43 billion.  Mr Callard made a calculation of the ETC.  So what he did is he went back to the desk and recalculated the ETC and his figure was 45 billion and the final figure was 49 billion.   All I am trying to say, Chairperson, is that in the calculation of these ETCs, the negotiations and so on, you are bound to come up with different numbers.  But that was not the point of executive decision, executive decisions are can you live with what the bidders are prepared to receive and if you look at the paragraph 7 of this memo, it     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     To reduce the batch price.     To reduce the batch, the batches.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Except, Chairperson, the use of ETC in all these documents is unfortunate.  The 54.5 billion was not an estimate, it is what the negotiated actual price was, 49 billion plus 10% contingency of 5 billion.  So it is really not an increase, the 64.5 billion is the negotiated price for the locomotives and the negotiations had different aspects to them, different things that were negotiated during the negotiations that came – that brought the amount to 64 billion.     Ja.     And the actual price.     Yes.     Yes, I think …[intervenes]     Yes.     Okay.     But it is the contract price.     Ja, it would be a misrepresentation if there was anybody in the board who thought that we were still trying to estimate.  We were not trying to estimate, this was the actual cost, the use of terminology is unfortunate.  But from the board’s understanding I am confident that the board understood this to mean this is the price that we are going to pay for the locomotives.     The negotiations, the negotiations were concluded at this point.     Yes.     Now, Chairperson, I would have to go and look at the point exactly when the board was told that the negotiations were concluded.     Ja,. Either at some stage or in the memo, I am not sure.     I will have to go look exactly when the board was told that this was [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] the price.     Yes.     And he is talking about his own calculations, yes.     On page?     Oh, so this was Mr Callard’s calculation.     This was Mr Callard’s calculation.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, exactly.     Chairperson, if you look at my affidavit, so the original ETC calculation was 38 billion with – or without some of the assumptions that it had made.  In January 2018, paragraph 59 of my affidavit, page 40, it     No, of Mr Callard.  Was further revised by a group of Transnet professionals to 45.8 billion.  Now according to Mr Laher, this amount was 3.747 billion lower than the original contracted price.  So this amount is 3 billion less than the 49 billion.  So the ETC was recalculated by Mr Callard to 40.457 billion, Mr Laher calculated it to 45.8 billion and then Mr Choubey gave another number.     45.4 billion.     Mr Choubey came to a number, 45.4 billion.  I think this demonstrates my point that this was not a science, this is a – the oddest number, none of them is wrong, they just used different assumptions.  They just used different,  assumptions.  The question is, Chairperson, and in fact there is a document that has also come to my attention in the last week that I did not include which is a presentation that Mr Callard made when he was calculating his amounts and I will make it available to – in a presentation called – entitled – the presentation has been compiled to present work done to date into the data analysis investigation of the 1064 locomotives deal at Transnet.  It is intended to solicit buy-in for the approach and methodologies proposed to facilitate discussion work-in-progress. Mr Callard observes in a slide in the     Yes.     Yes.     Come again?     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     No, he demonstrated very well but the different assumptions lead to different outcomes.     They are not there, they are not – okay, they are close, I agree, they are close but being close – you see, if it was a science it would be precise.     No but that is, as I was saying earlier, that is the number that you would go out with.  If I had to choose between …[intervenes]     On the low side, yes.     No, the acceptance of the negotiated price at 49 billion …[intervenes]     But I say it as unfortunate use of terminology to call it ETC.  That was a price that was negotiated.     I do not know if there is a dispute that the 49 billion or the 54 billion was the price that was a negotiated price of the locomotives.     Yes.     What is batch pricing?     Okay.       Yes.     BB4 little b?     What is the number?     This is 71?     Yes.     Yes.      There was a reduction of?     Yes.      Bundle 6?     So what is the red page number?     I do not have that or number 6, so are looking at file number 6?     Alright.     Oh 332.     Yes.      Yes, that was in the RFP.     Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Except I would not have called it ETC.      I would not have called it ETC, but yes, it was more than 15%.     Yes.      Not that I am aware of.     I cannot recall the reasons why it was not reported, or if it was in fact reported or if there was any communication by the companies to the Minister about it.     Well, this would have come out of a Board decision, right.  I suspect maybe company secretariat.     Maybe it was me, I am not sure Chairperson.      Yes. it would have been me Chairperson.     It would have been me.     But that issue, that we have just come back from what…[intervene]     Yes.      No.      Chairperson, I just want to - when we refer to the batch pricing, and the section that you referred to in the PPM, that says that the batch pricing should have been included, as I indicated throughout the negotiation process, there are teams that include Transnet legal and Transnet, audit, internal audit.  They were in fact part of the negotiations and they sat in the negotiations, something like that should because it is detailed, should and would have been picked up by them, and failure for them to have picked it up at that level before they moved on to the next stage during the negotiations, I think something to the effect that while you are negotiating, you must know that you cannot pay for batch prices.  But what came back from the negotiations was that part of what we need to pay for is batch pricing because we will reduce the batches and so I just wanted to point out that that was a failure at that level during the negotiations of the batch prices.  On the matter of the PFMA it is a compliance issue and Transnet had the compliance, legal and compliance I think to the extent that in this transaction, we were - it was not compliant because it had to be reported to the Shareholder Minister, this should have been pointed out and rectified at that point.  But the correct people to advise and tell us to be compliant would have been legal and compliance.  They would have – and in fact I think legal was part of the negotiations when they saw that this would trigger reports to the Minister, I think there should have been a recommendation to report the matter to the Minister because I think that although the chief executive takes final responsibility. is final responsibility there.  It is not possible in a complex organisation like Transnet who keep a tab on every little thing one relies on the advice and the recommendations from the different divisions to look at compliance contract.   Now I expressed surprise yesterday today about the master services agreement that it had been done that I was not aware of.      No, I say it may have been wrong, perhaps when the people that were at the negotiations come here and explain exactly what happened.     So Mr Laher was from which department?     Yes, which department?     Yes, but from where did he work at the time?     Yes, Chairperson.     Yes.      No, it was a team from different parts of the organisation, but it included an assurance team, and the assurance team included people from internal audit and legal, and the point that I was making was that this particular issue should have been picked up assurance.     And so Mr Laher, I am not aware that he was in the assurance team.      Yes.      I was that.      But I was not in the negotiating team.     Yes.      Yes.      Yes, but…[intervene]     No.      Oh it is possible to get it ex post facto.      Yes.      Well, if it is obtained ex post facto, it has the same effect as it has been obtained before.     Then there is a problem.     Yes, it is a problem if it cannot be obtained ex post facto, but once it is obtained ex post facto, it is quantified.     No, you were just asking, I suppose theoretically, in the effect of ex post facto approval.     Well, I cannot recall what my state of mind was at the time.      I knew maybe it slipped maybe, I cannot recall what my state of mind was at the moment, what I am pointing out is that perhaps the legal department or compliance should have then said, oops, we’re missing a spend[?], we need to get approval from the Minister.  You know Mr Myburgh the increase in ETC, well what is now called the increase in ETC, was from R38billion to R54billion, but we also know that the ETC was recalculated by even Mr Choubey. So, Mr Choubey’s calculation if it is to be accepted or Mr Laher or the adjusted calculation by Mr Laher and Mr Callard, so if we take those calculations and say, the R38billion calculation was wrong it should never have been used.  The real calculation would actually be R45billion thereabouts and that the increase in the real ETC, would have been about R3billion, and that is what they say even in the MNS Report, so they say that had the R38billion been calculated properly, it would in fact have been 45 and not 38.  But Chairperson, I submit that the R38billion was convenient and necessary, from a negotiation point of view because if we had gone out with a R45billion known figure that that is where we are starting, we would have paid more.     We would have paid more than R49billion.     Yes, I will carry the can, however, I submit that it was not done intentionally, or out of malice.     Yes.      Because I am human Chairperson.     Chairperson, ultimately, I am the chief executive and I should take responsibility.  However, I will hasten to mention that none of these things that happened here were happening, because it was a deliberate, intentional outcome that we did not have Ministerial approval that batch pricing is included.  I was actually, I would be at pains to explain that in terms of our there was a failure in our system.  In a sense that during the assurance process, these things should have been pointed out.     Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      No, that is why I was explaining yesterday that in a procurement process like this that I gave, so it is supposed to be a gain that was not supposed to be open if the batch pricing was not correct.  Where assurance was supposed to say, you cannot proceed because you have included batch pricing and you are not supposed to include batch prising, but the assurance report, and I would be interested to get the different assurance reports at the different gain, including right at the end, where the contract was signed.  Because even as we are going to sign the contract, the assurance people are supposed to say, go ahead and sign, and I believe that there are reports, the assurance report that said everything was fine.  But it would be interesting from an investigation point of view to find out at this different level, what did the assurance people say?  Did they not pick these things up, and was there at any point where for example, I was told everything is fine, go to the press announcement and sign the transaction.  So that is my point that between internal audit, compliance legal that there was assurance.  In fact, on a transaction like this we even require external assurance, and I cannot remember what all external assurance took, but as far as I remember, assurance given otherwise I would not have moved on it.     Yes.      And then there was a sub-committee of that steering committee, and that was you, Mr Gama and Mr Singh.     Yes.      Yes.      Yes, yes, he would inform me of what is going on in the negotiations.     Yes.      Yes.      Yes, they both came and reported to me what was happening.     Yes.      Before we move on, what is not clear in this list of people are the assurance - exactly who the assurance people were because it is finance and technical, but I submit that there was legal and internal audit.      Legal and internal audit.      They give different types of assurance, as assurance from a legal point of view that everything is fine, then there is assurance from an internal audit point of view, that everything is fine.  For example, when the tenders are submitted, and they must be submitted at 12 o'clock. Somebody from internal audit says the tenders were submitted at 12 o'clock, those that arrived at five past 12 were…[intervene]     …were excluded.  So and that is an assurance that opens the next day.     Actually, we had obtained Ministerial approval at the beginning of the process.  So Ministerial approval had been obtained before, perhaps maybe what went on in my head was we do have Ministerial approval to do this.  The thing that fell between the cracks was the fact that the increase in the price from what was the approved ETC to the final price required Ministerial approval, that is perhaps, what fell between the cracks of that we should have been advised on.     Yes.      Yes, I knew that we had to get approval for the transaction. We did obtain approval for the transaction, what we however failed to do at the end is to get approval for the increase.     Yes, I was involved.      Actually, I cannot remember how the approval was obtained as to who in what form the request went to the to the Minister.  I do not know if it went under my hand or under somebody else's hand.     No, it would be - actually, I think it may be the Chairperson’s hand.     Yes.     Yes.    No.    No    Well I did not know of them.    I do not know what I would have done at the time but I did not know.    Yes.    My understanding is that the increase was an outcome of the negotiations.    So you asking who was advising?    I actually cannot remember who was advising the negotiating team.    Yes.    No I cannot recall what was…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is right.    Yes.    Yes.    She says what?    Ja I cannot recall exactly what the reasons were according to her.    No I am just putting away that file.    Oh okay no I thought you – you wanted to check something before responding to the question.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes on advice.    Ja there was – there was in fact a letter that I wrote or a memo that I wrote to…    That gave reasons yes.  To – to I think it was to Mr Singh – it was one of those instances where I wrote a memo downwards to say I do not agree with your decision and these are my reasons. And the reasons were that Neotel was the incumbent.   Neotel while they were working on Transnet systems that is where they were working – what they were working on we had had a breach of the firewalls under their watch which had cost us some kind of embarrassment because we do not know what information was taken out of the Transnet systems.   There had been security cameras that had been installed at the ports that were not working – it was embarrassing because in terms of our membership of international ports organisation these security systems were supposed to have been working and Vodacom had been for the same tender and had lost but now Vodacom was in the process of buying Neotel.   So I then said this is like giving the tender to Vodacom because they have bid and they have lost and now they are buying Neotel.  We have to understand this transaction between Vodacom and Neotel.  You – how do you award a transaction to a company that is publicly on sale?  Because the sale could come with its own uncertainties and could result in things that were envisaged in the tender being very different to the outcome.   So those were my reasons.  Incidentally when Mr – Ms Chetty also awarded the tender she wrote by hand on her memo of award that Neotel must give us some assurance relating to the Vodacom transactions which in my opinion meant she had put a condition precedent to the award that ja we are awarding but they must first do this.   So she did that on the 31s t.  And I said for these reasons I feel that we need a new incumbent because of the failures that had happened under Neotel.  Of course internal audit and legal after I had written that memo came back and said your reasons do not hold water.  This tender has been awarded – oh and then I recommended that the second company on the – on the recommendations should be awarded the tender.  Internal audit came back and legal and they said no you cannot do what you are trying to do reverse the transactions it was a recommendation to give it to T-Systems.  You cannot do what you are proposing to do.   And they also have opinion of senior counsel who also said that it could not be done.  And I agreed and I even said well at least I have told you my concerns about why we doing this thing.  If things happen in the future with Neotel it shall be recorded that I did not come back from where I was and just promised them the decision that I thought was    Ja which is why I needed senior counsel’s opinion.  Maybe you did not need senior counsel’s opinion.    That is may – which is why maybe I needed to be told by senior counsel.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no not a month later.    Yes.    Yes.    My recollection is that it was conditional.  I thought it could be done because I had concerns and I – I tabled my concerns.    Yes.    BB6.   Yes.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes I also saw that this network is at the heart of the Transnet business and I am of the view that awarding the business to Neotel will expose Transnet for unnecessary risk.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes they had indicated that they would – had to reduce their price by R248 million    Oh ja.  Yes.    In my bundle.    Oh the fact that I may not have mentioned it in this – in this memorandum does not mean that it did not exist.    No.    The core issue where the risks to the – so I mean there is – there is a different pockets of looking at this. The first one is that I had real substantive concerns with or without the – the condition precedent.  So the first one was but how could we give this tender to these people after these risks that we know about? The second one was could it be done?  And I felt that because of Ms Chetty’s award was not full and final I do not know how to put it was not – was not unconditionally final that there was something else that needed to be done.  I do not know how to put it in words.    That was understood.  Yes.  Yes.  Means that there was a window to actually …    Ja.  And in fact that – that condition precedent that she put in expresses one of the fears that I had that this company was being sold.  And so – and so I thought that it was possible to reverse this from where I was sitting – from purely a business point of view.  However I was later to be proven otherwise by legal and internal auditors.    And Chairperson it is worth noting that when I was advised that what I sought to do here could not be done I did not resist I accepted it.    No I had no opinion.    Yes.    The option that I had was to behave like a bull in a china shop and this is what I did not do.    Yes.      Yes.    Yes.  But if you go to page 43 of that Report.    You will see that Ms Pillay did not approve or not disapprove.  She did not approve it and that was – it was sent to her – the last person to sign – signed on the 31s t of October so I do not know if there is another report where she actually approves this.    No I am not …    I am not disputing that I am just saying …    She had not – she had not approved this transactions.    Mr – Mr – Mr Myburgh you are going back to this patronising you know thing.  I would really – I really do not like it.    That you are being presumptuous think that I know things and patronising me in the process.    Well I thought it was possible.    But then I was wrong.    I was wrong however what I am pointing out now.    Is that this report that you are referring to was not approved by Ms Sharla Chetty on the 31s t of October.    It does not…    No it may indicate to the fact that perhaps this was not this transaction had not been finalised and awarded as it should have been.    Yes I accepted that a long time ago.      I accepted it at the time when internal audit and legal.    Came to me and said Mr Molefe we cannot do this and I accepted it and I then said we should proceed with the award to – to Neotel the incumbent.  Although I had – I had my own from a business point of view I had reservations.  I accepted the advice that I was given that what I sought to do was impossible.      [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      No, I have no comment Chair.     It did happen.     Yes.     Because I wanted to discuss this tender of Neotel and T-Systems.  They were IT people and it is known that it is possible to listen to meetings through the cell phones of people or the meeting could be taped(?) by one of the participants.  I did not want that... for security reasons.  Security of information reasons.     Yes.     Yes, Chairperson, that was not the main reason for the R 248 million.  The main reason was the issues that I advanced in my memorandum.      Yes, I have a very vague recollection but I think, I may have referred to the fact that there is a corporate action.  A corporate action was this sale of...  No, from corporate action was a sale of – not Neotel actually, the other one, T-Systems.   Actually, this paragraph does not make sense, but what I do recall is that there was a discussion of the corporate action involving...  No, the incumbents.  Who was the incumbent again?      They had awarded the tender.     Neotel, yes.  It is Neotel, yes.     [No audible reply]      No, I cannot comment on that.     However, Chair, I would say that there is – the feeling that he had that his career would have been in jeopardy was misplaced.     Because what subsequently happened is that, I was advised by people who were junior to me to proceed with what we are doing and I listened.  So it was in the spirit of collaborative management.       15?     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.       Yes, Chair.  I knew that Broadband Infraco was a state-owned entity.     But I did not know that Salim Essa was a Director of Broadband Infraco.     Which one?  BB-7?     Yes.     Yes?     The 10  on the top?     I did not know that.     Yes, from the information that is here.  Yes.     Chair, I have no recollection of...     BB-3?     What page number?     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.     No.  No, sir, I do not know anything about that.  When was this?     Oh, ja.     Exhibit BB-3?     581?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     ...requesting me to sign the agreement.  I do not know if you have it there?     Oh, okay.     Yes, I signed it.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes?     Zenad?     On which page?     Yes?     No, I do not know.     Yes.     No, I do not even know Mr Essa, as I have said.     No, of Zest Galore.     Before, just to put everything in context.  Well, I accept that I signed the cession.  The reason I wanted to see the memo is I wanted to see the ...[intervenes]      The background ...[intervenes]      And the reasons.     Yes, but what I do know and recall is that, typically, agreements like that of T-Systems would have a clause and I say this without having seen the actual agreement ...[intervenes]      Or it is maybe attached.  Would say that this agreement may be ceded and that when the party that is ceding the agreement wants to see Transnet or the other party may not refuse unreasonable for the cession to happen.   So I would imagine it was in that context but I think that if this was investigated further, maybe that can be confirmed.  But I think, sitting here, that was the context.     Which is why I wanted to see the memo that     Ja.     And I want to state that I was not...  Well, I do not think that I applied my mind to the directors of Zest Galore but I did not know that that the person in question was Mr Essa’s wife.       Yes and when we are talking about Mr Henk Bester ...[intervenes]      ...I think the other day.  I kept – I think I kept confusing him with the Bester from Eskom in my head.  Actually, I do not recall Mr Bester nor how he looks like or what he looks like.  So I do not ...[intervenes]      Yes... [Speakers intervening each other – unclear.]     Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      No, I have no comment.     No, I cannot comment on that.     Yes.     Yes, but I cannot comment on what Basson was saying ...[intervenes]      ...to Padayachee and Reddy.       Chair, I have no comment on it and actually I do not know Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  I do not – I cannot recall who they are.  I have no idea who they are.     Ja and we have spoken about this meeting at length.  By the way, who else was at this meeting?     There were others?  And the others corroborated this evidence?     Ja, I cannot comment on it.     But, you know, the Chairperson was at pains to explain that I should be concerned about it so it would be interesting if the Commission could say that from the people that were there, they can confirm that this is actually a discussion that took place.     But it is a discussion that took place in my absence, that does not worry me, that has got nothing to do with me.     I cannot comment about his suspicion.  I can only say that it was not due to Essa’s involvement.  I think that I, if I did award such tender …[intervenes]     Huh?     Yes, if I did, it was on the basis of a recommendation that had been made after due process.     Yes.     Of the NMPP?     Mr Bester?     Did you say Mr Bester was?     Yes, yes, oh …[intervenes]     Yes.     I cannot comment on the discussion that Rudi Basson had with Deidre Strydom.     I cannot comment on the discussion that Rudi Basson had with Deidre Strydom on the corridor.     No, no.     I did not fit any contract into any delegation.     I cannot recall this specific transaction like that.  But what, is the 50% that you find offensive?     I do not know in the context of this transaction.  I would have to look at the memo that was sent to me to approve what I approved but looking at it like this, it does not make – it does not ring any bells.     It also does not look like there is anything wrong that was happening here.     Huh?     Yes, what was it?     Was Essa forcing Hatch to appoint them?     Yes, yes.     Yes, I am not aware of that.     No.     No.     Because I am not aware of all of these that were happening.     Yes, yes, I have noticed that.     Yes.     Yes, that is what you are observing that the evidence is pointing.     Well, you know, it would be troubling if I knew that I had done something wrong.  So, I mean, this was happening in the background, I was not aware of it and if these people have anything to answer to, let them answer to it, all I am pointing out is that I was not aware of this.     I would trouble me if my conscience knew that I had done something wrong.     I think we have traversed this, Chairperson.     Chairperson, then if it was indeed happening I am concerned.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja but you said in 2016.     Yes but in 2016 I was not at Transnet.     I have in my affidavit, Chairperson, pointed to Mr Jackson’s evidence but when I arrived at Transnet we were actually advertising in the mainstream media, paying a lot of money on the rail crossing campaign and this was to alert people to the dangers of rail crossing.  It was a noble campaign.  But the way that it was done is that there were very gruesome pictures that were printed and even played on TV of trains hitting cars and I felt that this is not – and we were paying for that, this advertising, I do not know if maybe the investigating team has cared to quantify how much we paid for that, for those advertisements in the mainstream media.  And what I said to the branding team was that this is not good for the brand to be seen – for our trains to be seen to be smashing cars.  This is what remains in people’s minds.  I even said that, you know, when children associate our trains with the collisions with minibus taxis, that is what will stay in their mind and they may not want to work for Transnet when they grow up, so we have to find another positive way of doing it and I also said we must desist from advertising where we pay for a message because people read through it.  So if we say we are the most effective and efficient transportation company in Africa and we have paid to say that, it is not as effective as the same message being in the news, in the news, as part of the main news.  So we have to move from paying for adverts, paying for adverts and move our brand into the mainstream news, find a way of moving our brand into the mainstream news and The Big Interview was an opportunity to do that.  Even though the people, when we sponsored The Big Interview, the people that spoke at The Big Interview spoke about news, about topical issues and not Transnet is an effective and efficient organisation.  So now we were building partners here with people that were speaking at The Big Interview to support our messaging later but also, whenever possible, putting in our newsworthy issues onto the news through The Big Interview and this is the shift that I asked to be done from a branding point of view, we should be seen in the news and not in the advertising pages from a branding point of view.  So this is a discussion that I had, Mr Jackson I think was present and he agreed and we agreed that on this philosophical or doctrinal issue this is how we were going to move forward and that was the reason for supporting The Big Interview.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chairperson, and the idea was actually very subtle because these people were newsmakers and what we were implanting in them is a positive view of Transnet.  We were engaged in the MDS.  At the same time we were a lot in the news about the MDS but the idea was that whenever, for example, we have a project that comes onto the news, these newsmakers would then help to promote the positive news on the other things that we were doings.  I do not know if you understand what I mean.  So there would be a friendly force.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     So, Chairperson, let us for example, nè, take that we sponsor a news – this programme and the person that is being interviewed is the Premier of Mpumalanga and she is going to talk about her successes as the Premier of Mpumalanga.  So that is fine, she talks about her successes as the Premier of Mpumalanga but we operate in Mpumalanga.  The day that we have a newsworthy item and she gets an opportunity to be interviewed about a matter that involves Transnet we can be sure that she will go out of her way to make sure that she portrays us in a very good light.  That was the whole point.     Which news people, Chairperson?  The media?  These ones?     No, Chairperson, we live in two different countries.     We were.  We were executing the market demand strategy, we were announcing all sorts of good news every week.  Government was -  generally, the problem in government is that despite the overwhelming negative publicity there are a lot of things that are good that government has done that have not made it into the news.  The attitude of our media is that if somebody has not died, if there is no scandal involved, they are not interested and so this was – I mean, you can talk to all the communicators from government, this was a big problem for the nineties right through the 2000 and even up to now I can say that our media finds it difficult to portray our government in a positive light.  That is – there are very few people who would argue against that kind of statement, it is a – and I experienced it in my entire career that we have done spectacular good things but the media was no interested in it.     Yes.     Yes.     I was going to give another example that involves you but I will leave it.     Does he indicate that he raised this during our debates because my recollection is that when we had this debate about the repositioning of the brand advertising he agreed.  As I say in my memo, maybe it was just because to buy my face as he is trying to buy the face of his new bosses now.  It is just a reflection of the person that he is but I cannot recall that he raised that issue either in a memo or in a debate on this matter.     Yes.     BB15, 2?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I think it should say Eversheds?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Come again?     No, I was not there.     Yes, this memo was sent to me and all I did was to note it.     Yes.     I just noted it, I just – so there must have been a request from me to say please apprise me of the Gama matter.     Well, I read it, but I cannot comment on it even now.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     ...and – ja, so I requested, I must have requested – there was, I think there was a query from the Director General about this matter that I knew very little about and I asked to be appraised and this is the memo that was sent to me and then I read it but it is a matter that was handled by the Board, it was handled by the Board and I read this memorandum and these were facts that were being presented to me.   I don’t know if there was expectation that I should do anything about it or challenge it or say, I don’t approve but it was done at the Board and this was a memo from Mr Mapoma who’s a General Manager Group Legal Services and he was talking about tax costs and 75% and soon.   I can’t say that I really understood what he was saying, I just noted that there was an agreement that the costs would be settled in a particular way.     No, I can’t speculate on what I would have done if this had come to me for approval.  Perhaps I would have sought more clarity.     104>     Earlier?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, because, as you see in paragraph 2 of the memo, the – so this is an agreement that the Board had entered into and had agreed to pay and my approval, really, was as a functionary who effected payment of a Board agreement, basically.     Well, if the Board has entered into an agreement that a certain payment will be made, and I do not see why I would be standing in the way of the payment being made.     The Board hadn’t? ADV MYBURGH     ...[indistinct]  Mkhwanazi was mandated to conclude such a negotiation.     Yes, but this was in terms of the agreement…[intervenes].     That’s what the settlement agreement said?     So, that was the settlement agreement that was entered into with Mr Mkhwanazi?     Yes.     Ja, Chairperson,  to be honest with you, my understanding of this matter was that Mr Gama had been dismissed and that the matter went to Court and now we have entered – or the Board or Mr Mkhwanazi] has entered into an agreement to pay his costs – entered into an agreement to pay his costs and that this was the payment in line with that agreement.  I would expect that, if there was anything untoward the legal people would have picked it up because, in fact, this recommendation came from the legal department that we should make a payment, in this fashion.  Mr Mapoma was the General Manager Legal Services compiled the memorandum and it was recommended by the Head of legal at Transnet, Ms Zola Stephen.  I took it that it was a payment in line with what has been agreed, I must confess that I did not go into the intricacies of how this thing - in any case this thing of the legal cost is something that I’m yet to understand because you know people talk about tax costs, but it doesn’t involve SARS and – so I – tax costing is not something that I’m confident with.     Yes, but also when it comes from the Head of Legal and the General Manager Legal Services and it is referred to an agreement that was entered into, even before my time and – ja the case numbers are quoted there.  If you look at the recommendation Chair, it says, “Based on the motivation above, I recommend that the contribution to the legal fees must be paid as per the settlement agreement”, For me there was nothing to argue, if, indeed it was as per the settlement agreement.   But it will be interesting to see what Ms Stephen and Mr Mapoma also say.       Yes.     Yes.     I can’t recall but I said in the meeting that I had been receiving calls from anyone, I can’t recall that.     That is correct, Chair, and if I can explain this.  I was informed that Abalozi had been blacklisted and then I asked, what process was followed to blacklist them, and no process had been followed at all and I do know that before anyone is blacklisted there has to be a process and the person has to be heard and everything must be recorded.  Even in the Treasury instructions but also, I’ve been dealing with Mr Selinga and the legal department, I mean they should have known that it’s a requirement that people have to be heard before you blacklist them. So, I said, if that blacklisting is challenged, we will not be, so we must rescind it immediately because it is illegal and so that is how that memo came about.     Yes.     Well, the blacklisting had happened some time before I arrived.     Yes.     Because they said that they had done work – they claimed to have done work which they had not done.  They said – so it was a contract – I think it was a guarding contract and it was about providing personnel for the guarding of – I think it was trains and that Transnet was saying they did not do the work, however, our head of security at the time, Major General Baduza [?] had come to me and said to me that Abalozi had not done work is not true, Abalozi has copies of the work – proof of the work that they have done and somebody here at TFR is hiding that, so that they don’t get paid and so it appeared that Abalozi was not being treated fairly.  In my affidavit I do say, - I did talk about this story and say that subsequent to informing me about this, General Dukkha brought the information to me and I took the information to Transnet’s Risk Committee as well as – I can’t remember which other committee, two committees of Transnet and the decision there was, then we should settle this matter and I was given a mandate to go and settle this matter out of court because it would be embarrassing that we have actually been hiding proof that Abalozi had done work.     General Dukkha brought it to me, and he said to me, he interviewed people at Transnet that had knowledge that the work had been done and that there are certain people that are hiding that evidence from Transnet – ja from the Management at Transnet.  He investigated the matter and brought the proof to me.     Timesheets that were signed.     Well, he said that it was proof and that there are people at Transnet – he mentioned by name the people that were prepared to make a statement to say that the work has in fact been done but from what was presented at the time, I was convinced that that it was, indeed, true that Transnet had done the work.     No, I did not ask for the statements to be obtained from the people.     Part of the problem may have been that these were people that General Dukkha considered to be sources. General Dukkha’s background was Crime Intelligence, he had come from Crime Intelligence so, I mean, perhaps – ja maybe he should have advised…[intervenes].     That is the files that were brought to say that this is proof of work done.     Was not fraudulent?     Yes, that was the nature of the evidence.  What I was thinking you were asking is, did they make the statement, they did not make statements, but these were as I said timesheets.     Like these people were here and they signed, these people were here, and they signed.     Yes, there were two or three people inside TFR that had this information and then there two or three people that knew that this information had – and had copies and gave it to General.  What we didn’t understand was, why was this being suppressed, why didn’t this come out into the open.     General did, I can’t recall that he ever wrote a report on that but General did…[intervenes].     I do recall saying that this is a matter that may require disciplinary action if it was, indeed, a Transnet employee that that was hiding the information but people who were at TFR would be able to confirm that this was, indeed, happening.     This Abalozi matter?     Yes, yes     Yes, I’m familiar with…[intervenes].     Yes.     No, that report was compiled as if that information did not exist.     I don’t know, as I say, it would appear that somebody had been hiding that information even from this investigation…[intervenes]. ADV MYBURGH     No, they were appointed before my time.     Yes.     No, I can’t recall that there is.     No, I don’t recall that Nupen had reference to these timesheets, I can’t also recall that he had the information that we had.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     Ja.     No.     I don’t remember what  his key conclusion was.     Bodies had been?     Yes.     Yes, by Abalozi?     Yes.     Well, the information that we had was the work had been done and that the people that were supposed to be provided to do the work had been provided.     But the fact of the matter is that the information that was brought to us went through the Risk Committee, perhaps it may be worthwhile to look at the minutes of the Risk Committee where this information was presented, that I remember very clearly.  The General brought the information and what I did with it, was to go to the Board and say that look, here is this information that we now have…[intervenes].     General reported to me…[intervenes].     No, not General Nyanda…[intervenes].     Ja General Dukkha …[indistinct].     Yes, I know General Nyanda, and we may have been speaking on other matters even, sometimes,  playing golf, yes.     He’s a friend of mine yes.     You see he played golf with the General, you see how it went.    Well, to put it in context, General Nyanda has – or maybe used to have, before Covid, an annual golf day in Swaziland really to raise funds for people that had – in Swaziland that had supported the ANC and Umkhonto We Sizwe in the underground in Swaziland.  So, every year – I also used to play in that golf challenge and ja, at least when we went to Swaziland, I did see him, we did talk but even in between we did talk, so yes, I know him.      Yes.     Yes, and the agreement was that both parties are not proceeding with the litigation.     And that both parties would further negotiate a settlement amount.     Page 89?     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     In this litigation.    Yes, without going into the amounts.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     The advice that we got from, which is why I would have said even this agreement must have been exceeded by a memo.    Yes, but there was a memo.     I negotiated?    Ja.    Because we were at fault, because we had hidden information.  Our people had hidden the information that Abalozi had done the work.     Well, that may not have been the finding of the Newton report, but this is what I knew for a fact.    General Nyanda had that information.    And this is what was going to come out in the cause of the litigation.    And General Nyanda’s position was you guys blacklisted me illegally without going through a process, because of a something, because of information that you had hidden, we as Abalozi had not done anything wrong.   It is you who hid away our report and therefore I think that we were wrong, and unfortunately I had no leg to stand on.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Having said that, it would have been helpful if I would have seen the name that I preceded, I was signing this agreement.  Typically there would have been a memo that explains everything that is in the agreement and why we are doing what we are doing.    Ja.     I do not have a recollection of why the clause was included as it is, as it was.     I do not have a recollection as to the background of that clause now as I sit here.  Perhaps if I go and reflect on it I may remember the reason why but what I can think of as I am sitting here is because we were in the wrong.  We had hidden away information and caused a lot of damage to the company.     Reputational, they have been blacklisted and they have been known that they have been blacklisted.     No, the matter was in court.  It was at the courts.  It was public.    It was in court, yes.     Ja.    They did.      That is what, this is a settlement.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, ja.     Okay, but let me take you through my decision-making process as I recall it.    The counterclaim was about 95 million.  Sitting there, negotiating and finally coming to this agreement, even with this clause my quick calculation was we were not going to get anywhere near 95, and that if the matter proceeded to Court and they were suing us for 95 million which they said was the damage, I saw that we had no leg to stand on.  We had even the information.  So my calculation was it does not matter because it will not be anywhere near 95.      No.    Their claim had merits because we had hidden the information.  I was ashamed at what Transnet Employees had done.    Yes.     Yes, which is why I was asking for the name.    Because my recollection was that this was in fact drafted by us, by Transnet legal department.    No, not a legal opinion.    But from our side ...[intervenes]     I was not alone in a small claims bar, we were in Transnet and I sat with the legal department of Transnet, and as far as I recall there would have been a memo saying that here is a matter and we recommend that we settle in this manner.  This document itself was drafted at Transnet by our legal department.     Perhaps in the process of drafting, if they have seen that this was untoward or not possible or unreasonable, perhaps they should have advised and said this does not get done, but from a global view which is where I was, was that well from 95 million to paying cost, it looks like a good deal.    Yes, General Nyanda was there.     Yes.     807?      808?    I do not know if I am in the right file.     Ja, BB16, 808 is a letter to Ningisa Hofmeyer.  What is the page number?    Sorry, what is the page number?    Sorry, I was on the right 808.    Yes, 808.    Before we did the settlement ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     If you look at the document before ...[intervenes]    On 801.    It says   “To authorize the payment of 20 million.” Oh, sorry.    Ja, Chairperson I think I must have made a mistake here.     Because what we were supposed to have paid, was the cost.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, Chairperson may I make a request?    Yes.  May I make a request Chairperson?    Because my recollection of this matter may be very vague.     That I go and look at this matter again.    And then come back.    Maybe by way of a supplementary affidavit or something like that.      Ja, I would really like to go and interrogate this matter again.    Yes.     Ja, please allow me Chairperson to go and refresh my memory.    Yes.     But Mr Essa was not a director of Abalozi.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.    Chairperson, firstly I did not know who witness 1 is.    Yes Chairperson.  I do not know who witness 1 is.  But I suppose even if I assumed the identity of, who the identity of witness 1 is, it is difficult for me to include motive without identifying witness 1.      It is difficult for me to impute motive ...[intervenes]     For giving this kind of evidence without knowing who witness 1 is.  But secondly, witness 1 does not say that he saw anybody give me money.  He refers to meetings that I had with the Guptas, that I have not denied.   However, he talks about bags and a bag as if those bags had money, but he had no evidence that there was money in the bag.  So really there is very little response in the evidence of witness 1.     That somebody gave me money?    Yes sir.     His observations that he saw me with a bag, may be true but I would deny that it had money in it or that the bag I was carrying, when I went to the meeting and came back from the meeting came back with money.  I will deny that.     Did he?    Yes, so who is he?    Come again?    No, I said I could assume who he is.     And but assuming who he is, it is not fair, because I cannot impute motive on a person based on assumption of identity.     Ja, there is a driver that I know with a bad motive, but I do not think I can reveal what I think was the motive.    Because it would identify them number one, and number two, what if my assumption about the identity is wrong?      Because he did not implicate me in wrong doing.     There is no implication of wrong doing.    It does not implicate me in wrong doing.     It just implicates me in sometimes carrying a bag that I always carry that he took a picture of.  No, he did not even take a picture of the bag.    Downloaded from the internet.     And said that is the bag that I may have been carrying or a similar bag.     I may have been carrying a bag, if I was and if somebody sees me leave the Commission with that bag and says that joh, it looks like it has got money inside, I have to answer to that allegation.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     If it is the guy that was re-deployed to Durban there is a lot to say about that but it would reveal his identity.    Yes.     Ja, I never looked at them.  I knew that they were handed to the head of security, and ...[intervenes]     No.    Well, I am not sure whether this was in line with their standard operating processes.      But yes.     Yes.  Generally yes, it is true that there were occasions when we went.  I do not have a recollection of every single incident.    I cannot recall that they were or were not recorded in my diary.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I cannot comment on it because I do not have a clear recollection of every single incident, but as I said ...[intervenes]     No.    Paragraph 21?    Yes.     September 2012?    Sir, after September 2012 is when he went to Durban? ADV MYBURGH    Ja, but was it because he had gone to Durban?    I see, yes.  Ja, okay.     Ja, I cannot comment on that.  I cannot really recall when he ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is a reasonable assessment of what was happening.     No, I mean ja, 20 to 45 not short.  Ten minutes would be short.    Ten minutes would be short.     45 is about reasonable time to have a meeting.    Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, he just does not mention perhaps when there were events.    Events.     Ja, like a function.    Yes, he does not mention those.     I cannot recall Chair.     Paragraph 20?    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is what he says.    That is, ja but I cannot comment on the accuracy of the log book.     I do not remember what it was about.  I do not and I cannot comment that these entries are correct.    Yes ...[intervenes]     They may not even have happened in the way that he describes them in the log book, but I have no way of showing that.     Because well, that is what he wrote in his log book.    So when he made these entries in his log book.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, but what I, you see I do not dispute that he did take me there.     And that maybe he kept a log book.    And I was not aware of.  But I am not sure about the accuracy.    Of what is in his log book, and really what his motive was for keeping the log book.  I do not know if he ...[intervenes]     Yes, but and then the log book is handed over to his general manager for safekeeping.  But he says he kept the log book.  So I am not sure what the motive was there because as he says here, it was for audit purposes.   Well, if anybody wanted to audit his log book, it would be found with the general manager of security.  So I am not sure what his motive really was.     And in fact he may have been in breach of their own standard operating procedures because the log book was supposed to be handed over to head of security.     Yes, yes I would normally visit AJ.    On who he saw or who he identified as AJ.    Did he say similar?    Did he say similar?    He is not 100% similar.  That is just a back pack.    Not like this one.    Yes, it was this one.     My trusted bag, yes.     Ja.     Yes, this is a ja, it is a brown leather back pack.     Yes Chairperson I have been everywhere with this bag.  I am surprised that ...[intervenes]     I am surprised that it is accused 2 at the Commission.     Yes.     And I still do.      No, this is a back pack.    It is not quite similar to this one.      Well, that is why I was saying this is a back pack.     So this is just an [indistinct] back pack.     Ja, in all likelihood it was this one.     Yes.     No, I am saying it was likely to have been this one.     Yes, yes.     No, the description ...[intervenes]     Ja.    Ja, but his evidence is that the bag that he saw is the one that he took the picture of here.     So let us go with the description that is in this picture then because that is his evidence.     The shape of the bag suggested?    I have no recollection of that Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     I have no recollection of that.     Just out of curiosity, does his diary confirm these trips?    Does his diary confirms these trips?    Oh, I see.     Okay.  I have no recollection of that.     No, I have no recollection of what happened at the airport in Bloemfontein in January 2014.    Yes.     Yes.     I cannot remember being at the same time at the Gupta residence with Minister Gigaba or with Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu.  I, no that I cannot remember.    Mr AJ.    He is the person that I was discussing the bank with.    He is the person that I was discussing the bank with.    Yes, so I would hardly ever see anybody else.     Sometimes his brother would pop in, phone him or his wife or his children.  Ja, they would pop in but the person I really saw and discussed with, was Mr AJ.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I have no recollection of that incident and I just wonder if he did report – he did write it in his incident report and if he reported it General Thoga but I have no recollection of that incident.    Yes.    I might have yes.    It is possible that I might have asked him to retrieve a cell phone during the times that I was working with him from my bag.    Yes.    No not in the manner that he described them as being this much and stacked and so on and so forth.    No not half full.    I have no recollection of this incident where he says he found half full bag – half full – my bag half full with money I have no recollection of that specific incident.  And on top of that it is – I never carried cash like that.    That was my PA.    Come again.    Not half full just maybe if there was cash..    Sorry.    No maybe a R1000.00 maybe R2000,00 I do not know how – how that would fill the bag.    I have no recollection of that and wonder if because he says it is a safety or a security risk whether this threat – security because that is where he worked – it identified a threat according to him was properly recorded and discussed with his superiors.    Ja there is no recollection Chair.    No I dispute that…    Of the cash.    Where he says he saw cash.    Where he says if he wants or if you – if his desire was to imply that I left the Gupta residence with cash that I dispute.    But then I notice.    That he never went that far.    No I mean this narrative is built on real facts that were happening.    Yes.    No.   Let me put it like this because he calls it a security threat.  If he had come across a security threat he would not have raised it with my PA he would have raised – he would have and should have raised it with his superiors and in this instance it was General Thoga and there would have been a proper incident report.    But it did not matter that I was upset about it because his job was security and if he identified a security threat there would have been a particular protocol to deal with it.  And so – and so I cannot recall the incident I am just saying if indeed it did happen this is what would have happened.  He would not or should – or – ja he would not have raised it with the PA because he knew that that would start a rumour and exacerbate the threat which means that if he raises it with the PA the PA might then say to somebody else or the next one you will not believe what Mr so and so told me today and then it will be a rumour that goes around.  And so a person of his training and his responsibilities the responsible manner to have handled it would have been especially that he specifically says that it was a security threat or a security risk would have been to raise it with his superiors who would then have called me in and said we have a problem how do we deal with it.  That never happened.  That never – that never happened.  However having said that I – I  - ja I dispute that this cash incident happened.    Yes.  Yes.    If I had left it in my office and I said go and fetch my phone – I mean this is hypothetically.    Yes, yes right next door.     Yes.    Yes.    It may or may not have happened on some occasions that maybe I asked him to make a deposit for me.  I cannot recall what it was for – with different things.  Maybe society or I do not know, I cannot recall but ja that may or may not have happened.  I am not sure about the frequency that he is talking about but ja it is true that on one or two occasions I may have sent him to go to the bank.    No not necessarily. Sometimes when we go to a burial society and people donate cash and then I have to take it and bank it.  Things like that.    Or sometimes if I am doing it for somebody or – for whatever reasons I had personal reasons.    No but if it was cash that needed to go to the bank you cannot deposit electronically.    Like the society – you know society?    Various societies – various societies.    I cannot recall Chair what other reasons I may have had to have had cash with me but…    But – ja there could have been for a number of reasons.    Yes.    Yes at the time yes I was.    Mapala.    Mapala    L-m-a.    L-l-a.    p-h-a.    l-a.    Ja it is actually officially it is called Investment Society so it is – it is Llaphala - Llaphala     Was my grandmother’s mother so it is all the children that had descended from that root.    We have a burial society and I was the treasurer.    Yes.    It still exists but we have not met since Covid and…    There is a big debate now about what we are going to do.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes several thousand yes.    Yes.    Other than to say that the threats that he talks about I have no knowledge of and I notice that you say that we do not have a problem with the rest of the statement.    Yes.  Yes.    Well – a few days ago.  Yes.    Which – which position?    Who is threatening his life?     Because I really do not understand that you are saying that because he made the statement his life is now threatened?  By whom?    Yes Chair I would really prefer not to be drawn into these threats and the reasons for the threats and – because I really do not know anything about it and I also do not wish to speculate.    Ja I – I said Chair I could try and impute motive but that would identify the witness.    But there is motive that I could impute.    Ja.    Ja so Chair the way that the statement is crafted is that it is generally true except that there is this spice of cash that gets put in and – and that is cleverly calculated to imply – it is not even real evidence – to imply just to cast aspersions that is what I do not understand.  This statement is based on things that are true but it is designed to cast aspersions without even offering real evidence of things that – the – the person saw.  I remember when he was giving evidence Chair that you asked “So when you found the money in Mr Molefe’s bag did that money come from the Gupta’s?”    Yes.    Yes.     Yes.    I cannot comment on that Chair I have no recollection.  Actually Witness 3 I even find it difficult to speculate about who he is.  So I do not know what he is talking about.    Ja but…    Witness 3 was attached to Mr Gama was he not?    Mr Gigaba ja I have said I do not recall being at the same time with Mr Gigaba at the Gupta residence.  Unless if there was maybe a function but I cannot recall.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I deny that I ever met any Chinese people or Asian men at the Three Rivers Lodge during Transnet strategy planning sessions.    I cannot comment on – I cannot comment on that because that is what he saw I – I did not meet the Chinese people at the or Asian men in – at Three Rivers Lodge.    I deny that that happened. ADV     Yes there was – although I do not recall the exact dates but I do recall that we once or twice had a strategy planning sessions at the Three Rivers Lodge.    Ja.    Well it depends.  It depends on our agenda for the day.    Yes.    Yes.    This was in the winter time?    Yes, yes.    Oh ja because it was July Chairperson it is likely that it was winter time.    Aye I do not know anything about that.    I cannot comment on that – that is…    No then I deny that there was any bag from the Chinese people that was given to my protectors.    Mr Myburgh I have just said to you that that incident as far as I am concerned never happened.  I do not know where this guy got it from.    I am not even in a position to speculate about this bag and that bag and this guy carried that.    I mean the next thing you will be saying ah so you admit that it did happen.    I have denied that that incident happened.    Ja I just know he is a BMW guy I do not know what type.    I cannot comment on that.  There was no black bag that went to my car Mr Myburgh.    All of them?    What did you say?    I cannot comment – I do not know.    Is that an assumption that you making?  That there would have been a quid pro quo?    Yes.    I do not know how those things work Mr Myburgh.    Yes.    Yes, yes, yes.  I think that is what happened.    Who?    So what do they implicate me in?    Ja the – what do they implicate me in?    So what – what do they implicate me in I just want to understand that?    Ah no.    You trying to get to that the Gupta’s gave me money?    To?    No.    But he specifically says it did not come from the Gupta’s and I deny that there was ever a large sum of money in my bag.    No I cannot recall that.    No I cannot recall that.  I mean maybe for lunch or something I do not know.    No I was never given – like how much?    No I was never given money by Mr Singh unless if you are referring to maybe we were somewhere or I needed a R100.00 for lunch or I do not know.  But I was never given money by Mr Singh. ADV MYBURGH    I have not seen that no.    So you say Witness 3…     [No audible reply]      Of this one, BB-3?     Yes.  Page?     Page 133?     Yes.     Oh, he just wanted to show me that paragraph?     Okay, okay.  No, that is fine.  Then we can hear later on if you think there is a need.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you.     Yes, sir?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Reverend Malesela?     Yes, it is Professor Malesela.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes, I do think so Chair.     If I can explain?     Perhaps my attorney can explain.  I mean, when we received the subpoena ...[intervenes]      When we received the subpoena in December, for example, we – the subpoena did not say whether it was a Transnet or Eskom matter.  And we were not sure what it was about.   In fact, we were still waiting on submitting the documents that were required in terms of Section 10 for both Transnet and Eskom. And then we got the subpoena and then the Commission went dead.  They did not tell us whether it was     I am not the only one.     [laughs]     Yes, but then we – in the end, I remember us sitting around the table and Advocate Masuku saying to     I do not think it is necessary to spring to his defence Mr Myburgh.     I do not think it is necessary to spring to his defence.  All I am saying ...[intervenes]      No, even the fact that I ...[intervenes]      And Mr Myburgh wants to go through them again.     I have just said exactly what made me feel like that.     It was not just a delay.       It was ...[intervenes]      No response to our communication.     Right through the month of December.     Which caused a lot of anxiety and what are we doing, what...?  And at the same time we had to reply with a Section 10 Notices and yet the...  And then, eventually, they said it is about Eskom and then we were requested the documents and ...[intervenes]      No, it is just the general demeanour from the Secretary’s office.     Exactly that.  The attitude relating to our matters at the...     But the need for articulation is to what end?     To articulate it.  To what end?  Because I am not instituting any legal proceedings or anything.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     And I will repeat it.  And Chair, I will leave it at that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     And just to...  I was not laying a formal complaint.     I am just answering to the questions that you are asking.     Thank you Chair. 
MOLEFE: Detailing the failures of the Mitsui locomotives.   But I was issued with a 3.3 or ...[intervenes]    Chairperson, I doubt if anybody understood this, even the use of the ETC to mean that the 54 billion was an estimate, it was the negotiated price, it was the price that we were going to pay for the locomotives.   No my interpretation – my layman’s interpretation was that the condition.   Yes. And just for the sake of completeness. This agreement would have been accompanied by a memo ...[intervenes]    Have the others corroborated this evidence?   Yes, those are your findings or observations that you are making and I choose not to comment on them.   The settlement negotiations were sanctioned by the Transnet Board and the Chairman of the Board.   It was files of timesheets and ...[intervenes]    Ja the nature of the information, timesheets, and reports and so on.   Well Chairperson, that is what was represented to me as the damage that would have been done by the fact that we had been hiding information.   Chairperson, I mean this is what I understood to have been the damage that we had done by hiding the information.  However ...[intervenes]   Mr Myburgh, as I walked into the Commission.   Yes. Well, I cannot comment on ...[intervenes]    That he saw AJ at the airport in Bloemfontein?   Perhaps when there were functions.  Perhaps when there were functions, but ja I do not remember being there when there was no function and seeing …[audio cut] Shareholder Minister.   Professor Malesela was part of a consortium of Western House that was bidding for a nuclear project at Eskom.  Western House is an American nuclear company that was bidding for work at Koeberg and they lost that deal before I arrived at Eskom. When I arrived at Eskom, he approached me numerous times to intervene in their favour.  Eventually, Western House went to court.  The matter went as far as the Constitutional Court.  It was held by yourself, actually Chairperson, at the Constitutional Court. And I think since that time, Professor Malesela has got a something to grind with me because the way I interpreted the subpoenas and the notices as they came one after another, not responding to our correspondence when we asked about what matter we are coming to talk about.  We complaint about the fact that the Commission was not responsive.   My feeling was because of the Western House matter, Professor Malesela is not taking it out during – now during the Commission and that his behaviour, certainly, towards me, in the context of the Commission, is informed by his dissatisfaction that I was not able to intervene on his behalf on the Western House matter.  That is how I felt.   
MYBURGH SC:   Firstly, they were asked to determine, did the original Business Case include hedging and escalation.  And you have excepted it did.  Then what they were asked to do, is they were asked – and Mr Laher    But you were present at this conference with Mr Singh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am going to come back to Mr Choubey.     In fact what Mr …[intervenes]     Well, Mr Choubey was asked to determine whether the increase in the ETC was reasonable and justifiable and that was the correct question to be asked based on this memorandum submitted and approved by or recommended by Mr Molefe. Chairperson …[intervenes]     The ETC.     Is it a convenient time to take the tea adjournment, Chairperson?     Alright.     Yes.  Without wanting to be uncharitable to you, Mr Molefe, do I understand you now to say that insofar as there was amateurism it was now on your part, not on Mr Choubey’s part.     So let us then have a look at the reasons for this increase.  This is at page FQC 714.  Executive     And the one causing the greatest increase in the ETC was risk mitigation, forex and escalation.  Do you see that?     And do you understand the controversy, controversy is that was actually included in the initial business case.     And you accept then that that accounted for 59% of the increase?     Escalation.     Can we turn to the next page?     Page      FQC 715, background.     Paragraph 14.     Now perhaps one gets a better sense of the     Hedging and escalation.  In other words, what is presented to the board is that this massive change in the ETC is attributable by and large 59% to the fact that we initially excluded these costs and now they are being included, which you accept is wrong.  Your own case is they were included initially.  Do you see the problem, Mr Molefe?     Alright.  Okay, so then comes the issue of …[intervenes]     Yes but, Mr Molefe, what you, with respect …[intervenes]     I am sorry, carry on.     Yes, is this an appropriate time now to take the tea adjournment.     Thank you.     Thank you.  Mr Molefe, we were dealing with FQC page 714.  Are you still there, in EXHIBIT BB4(b).  I think you probably have it in front of you there.     EXHIBIT BB4(b).     And page, Chairperson, FQC 714.     It is your memorandum to the BADC, do you have it?     I just want to turn to one other thing.  If     I just want to drop down to (d), we have     And it cross-refers to item (d) of table 2.  Could I please take you to that, it is over the page at FQC 718.     And you will see that if you look on the right hand said then you will see a letter d and on the left of that it talks about batch pricing adjustment, then you get d and the amount attributable to that is 2.7 billion.  Do you confirm that?     Alright.  Now what we know – so this is a memorandum to the BADC which you sign on the 23 May.     Would you agree that on the same day you made the same recommendation to the board of directors in another memorandum.     Sorry?     No, you made exactly the same recommendation that you made here to the BADC at page 714.     Running through to page 731.  You made the same recommendation to the board.     Let us go to that document.  That document you find in another file, Mr Choudey’s file.  BD8(b).     Now that file is divided into two parts, we are dealing with part 1, so it’s EXHIBIT BD8(b.1).  Could I take you please to page – these are red numbers on the right hand side page 165.     Alright, could I just ask you to confirm that this is the same memorandum.     165, it runs through where it is signed at 182.     Alright and then I would just ask you to confirm that on the 28 May 2014, a few days later, the board of directors in fact approved your recommendation.     Perhaps I could take you to the Fundudzi report, that is in bundle 6.  If I could take you please to page 184.     Yes, bundle 6, Chairperson.     184, correct.  If I could ask you, Mr Molefe, please to have a look at the heading towards the middle of the page, Board Meeting on 28 May and there at paragraph     So, Mr Molefe, I just want to put it to you that on your evidence then it seems there is a further misrepresentation made to the board because you represented the [indistinct] increase in the ETC, you did not represent that it was the contract price.     Yes but you are not listening to my acuity, please.  On your own version there is then a misrepresentation to the board, another misrepresentation. MR     so your answer is that – well, do you accept that it is a misrepresentation or not? You made a recommendation.  On the basis of your recommendation it was then approved in the exact terms where the board …[intervenes]     Where did you tell the board that you had already concluded the contract.     Alright, now …[intervenes]     Yes, correctly reformulated, thank you, Chairperson.     Could I ask you then to turn back …[intervenes]     Thank you.  Mr Molefe, could I please ask you to go back to Mr Choubey’s file, EXHIBIT BB8(b.1)  Now if you please to page 36, Mr Choubey deals with the increase in the ETC from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion and ultimately you will see that if you go over the page to     Page 40 he deals with build-up to the ETC of 54.5 million (sic), he looks forward, he looks backwards.  If I could ask you to have a look at, for example, page 646, forward escalation, how did I arrive at the escalation costs, foreign codes and hedging costs again at 47.  How did I compute the FX hedging costs at 48.  Deals with contingencies and then this is his conclusions …[intervenes]     Can I ask you please to go – because that is what your – you convinced the board to approve, he is dealing with their approval.  Now let us go to the conclusion please.     Page 50.  He concludes that    I beg your pardon?     No, no, this is not Mr Callard’s calculation, this is Mr Choubey the expert’s calculation.     And we are going to come to Mr Callard.  Can you please just direct your attention to this?     Mr Molefe.     I will take you and I know you want to refer to Mr Callard or Mr Laher.  We will go there and I am asking you please to address this conclusion.  What do you say, is it like what you said yesterday that this is an art and not a science?     Okay.  Anything else to add to that?     45.4 billion.     So if I could just take you if I do not mind to…[intervenes]     Yes, we gave the same undertaking as we did yesterday.     Once we have a copy we will attend to that.       Perhaps I could just ask my learned friend if he has an electronic version of it if he could in the interim send it to my junior and we will process it perhaps at lunchtime even.     So can I – Mr Molefe, let me take you to Mr Laher’s affidavit.     That is where you get your figures from that you have been speaking about.  Go to EXHIBIT BB4(f) please?  BB4(f).  Pardon, page YIL18.  Now you will see at paragraph 69 at the top.     Mr Callard’s figure of 40.457 billion excluded the impact of using Transnet engineering.  Do you see that?     Mr Choubey’s figure, if you excluded Transnet engineering, as you know is 42.8.  Do you see that?  Do you know that?     Mr Choubey’s figure and perhaps I could ask you, you have still got his affidavit open in front of you.     Mr Choubey’s figure when excluding Transnet engineering is 42.8.     Do you see that?  Not vastly different, is it?     And then you see Mr Laher’s calculation, paragraph 70, of 45.8, that now includes Transnet engineering.  Do you see that?     And do you see that Mr Choubey, he comes to almost exactly the same figure, 45.4 billion.     So maybe it is more of science that it appears.     Yes.  Now – the outcomes are not that different, that is the point that I make, Mr Laher and Mr Choubey, they are very close to one another.     But you are so far out, Mr Molefe, that is the problem.     You were so far out.     Well, what did you recommend to the board and what did they accept, an increase in the ETC to what?     No, that is not what they did, Mr Molefe, that …[intervenes]     Do you understand that you are attributing and talking down to an unfortunate change in terminology what might amount to almost R10 billion?     I think I am going to leave this topic, I need not to examine you any further over it.  I want to talk about batch pricing.  Now we have seen that 2.7 billion of the 15.0 billion increase was attributable to batch pricing.     Could I just take you please to the MNS report?     We are going to go to the MNS report.     Would you please go – and this is in bundle 5.     Now perhaps to answer your question so that we know exactly what I am dealing with, could I ask you please before we get to that document to go back to bundle BB4(b).  That is your memorandum to the BADC.     It was Mr Essa and Mr Bester and I think there were others.     Sorry? MR     No one else has given evidence about this particular discussion.     Alright.     This is a thing that does not concern you.     Alright.  Then at paragraph 71    You awarded the tender, did you?     You awarded that tender.     Alright and then if I can take you to the evidence of Deidre Strydom, who also testified on this issue and you will find her affidavit at BB20, in the same file that you are in.  So it is bundle 4, BB20.     And if you could please turn to paragraph 35 at page 145 and from paragraphs 35 to 38 she effectively corroborates what she was told by Bester     Yes, she was at the time I think it was the programme director of the manganese expansion project.     Sorry?     No, Mr Bester worked for Hatch.     Strydom, Deidre Strydom.     Alright, so she says at paragraph 35    Sorry?     But did you fit this contract in your mandate?     So you can comment.     And then at paragraph 36 over the page,     Ja, I am saying is that high?  Does it sound high to you?     Alright.     Well, Mr Molefe, there was a lot wrong that was happening here.     There was a huge amount wrong that was happening here.     Well, there were attempts by skills development partners and Essa to force Hatch to appoint them.     Well, this is – let us just go back to – I have told you about the meeting at the Melrose Arch, I have read to you what happened.     And the fact that he referred to you.     So when you say – I mean, I am just trying to explain to you – do you see this is very serious thing that was happening here.     No?     Alright.     No, no, I am not suggesting you here were aware but do you see how prevalent it seems corruption was within the organisation because what we have done in the last half an hour, how many times have we seen reference to Mr Essa?     Ja, it is really a lot of times.     So when P Systems is contracting with a party that Mr Essa is a director to, you are ceding a contract where Mr Essa’s wife is a director, you are referred to her by Mr Essa as being the next CEO of Eskom in the context of skills supply development partners being foisted on Hatch and we know that is, certainly from the money flows evidence, it is through supply development partners that so much of this money laundering happened. MR     Sure.  Well, it seems –it is what the evidence points to, it is not my finding, I fortunately do not need to make any findings.     But it is troubling is it not?  It must be to you.     Yes but what I am trying to get at is even now when you see this, is it not troubling to you?     Alright and then to another topic, the New Age.  I think you have accepted that under your watch investments     Yes, it can go back, thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, I think that you have – that under your watch Transnet sponsored The Big Interview in the New Age.     And you did that for a number of years?     And I see that in 2016 the cost of that advertising was R450 000 per month.     Well, the difficulty, DCJ is that this …[intervenes]     Yes.     The difficulty with this and the exhibit is that this comes from another stream, it is MM.     We do have – your registrar has it but I want to try and short-circuit all of this.  Mr Jackson – you have been referred to this.     Well, attached – I have been looking through the invoices and I see that in 2016 it was 450 000 per month.     Yes, okay, fair enough, I accept that.  What Mr Jackson says and you have been asked about this and you have asked to comment is that he thought that this was not at all valuable or really in the interests of Transnet.  Do you want to comment on that?     Yes, thank you.     Mr Molefe, I am just going to read to you, I do not think you have this exhibit before you but this is just one paragraph, it is EXHIBIT MM5 at page 10 paragraph 47.  Mr Jackson says this …[intervenes]     Page 10, JFJ10.     Mr Jackson says this    Alright.  I would like to move to another topic please.  Chairperson, you can dispense with that file and if you could now be provided with Transnet bundle 1, EXHIBIT BB15 and I would like now to address briefly the topic of Mr Gama’s legal fees.     And I would like to start – I think I am going to refer you only to two documents.  Can you please go to BB15, you should have a tab 2.     And I see it is consecutively numbered so perhaps you can go directly to page 142.  You will see at 142 there is a memorandum to you.     From a Mr Mapoma, general manager Group Legal Services.     And it deals with legal fees, Mr Gama versus Transnet.     Let me direct your attention to paragraph 4.     You refer to a settlement and it says    Do you see that?     So 75% of the costs in his High Court application and 75% of his costs in the unfair dismissal dispute referred to the bargaining council.     Now if you can skip to paragraph 7 at     It should say Eversheds, yes. “The second matter in which he incurred costs is the labour matter.”     Alright. “These costs were supposed to have been paid by Mr Gama.” Do you see that?      “On reaching settlement with Mr Gama, Transnet sought and obtained the taxed bills from these two firms of attorneys and paid 75% of the total amounts.”     Does that make any sense to you?  So you win, he owes you costs, what you land up paying him are your costs.     You win with costs.     But this memo was sent to you, I am trying to ask…[intervenes]     Okay.     You just noted it?     But when you note – perhaps I misunderstand things, but you noted it - whether you approved it or not, did you read the nonsense in paragraph 7?     But, Mr Molefe, just let us have a look at what it says.  The costs in the High Court were granted in your favour.     These costs were supposed to be paid by Mr Gama, your costs.     On reaching settlement with Gama, Transnet sought and obtained tax bills from these two firms of attorneys.  Your attorneys.     And then paid to Mr Gama their fees. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Chair?  Chairperson?     Mr Molefe referred to a document that he has recently come across, I want to confirm that during break I brought this to the attention of Mr Myburgh.     And would appreciate it if it find its way into the bundles of the Commission.      This is a presentation that was prepared by Mr Callard.     Chair, I want to confirm that I have already sent to Ms Lee.     Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES 
UNKNOWN:  Chairperson, I thought it would also be prudent that we make a proposal on how ...[intervenes]     Or have an input on how we can handle this matter.    I still have to get instructions.  So we will get instructions Chair, and revert back to Mr Myburgh on what will be the best way forward.    Thanks Chair.  
 MR MOLEFE:  I deny that I met the Chinese people or Asian people at the Three Rivers Lodge.  However the – the taking a bag from the Lodge to my car they have maybe something that one of my protectors did and that would have been a bag that I had come with with my clothes.  So I mean I will deny that that bag – if there was such a bag that was carried from the Lodge to my car came from the Chinese people.  It may have been a bag that I had come with with my clothes inside. 
COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]      Chair, I have not consulted with Mr Molefe about the need for re-examination.     Certainly.     [No audible reply] [microphone not switched on]
