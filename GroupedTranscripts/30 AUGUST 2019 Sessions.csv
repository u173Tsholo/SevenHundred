CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Good.  Let us proceed.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    What was it – what did the conclusion say?    Okay.    Yes.     Yes.  Yes and why there had not been a speedy conclusion all along.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    I am disinclined to deal with it simply on the basis that whatever we may need to do may only be done at the time of preparing the report.    Certainly it would be important at that stage to know as much as possible about these types of delays, what causes them and so on.  But I think that we should seek to assist if we can in  1. Understanding why either nothing or very little has happened and  2. Seeking to have the action that is required to be taken to be taken.    What we may have to consider – I think the first thing is to try and get as much information as possible as to where – what has been done and then one option might be to then bring this to the attention of the – the leadership of whatever and law enforcement agencies are involved whether it is the Hawks or the SAPS and maybe ask them to see to it that something is being done and maybe to consider holding certain people accountable.    But it may well be that we should consider whether senior people should not come here and explain what has happened.    But we do not need to – if we can avoid let the time that we have which is limited for the hearing of witnesses who would be telling us about various matters let some of it be taken by …    Those matters but at the same time it may well be that it might send the right message if people were to be called and to come and explain publicly what is happening.  Because if it is a question of incapacity, not having resources one would expect them to come – to be open with us and say look the reason why there has been no action is because we just have too few police officers or something like that.    And then give a full breakdown of what is there – what is available and so on.  But also one would want in that situation to understand what efforts have been made to bring that situation to the attention of senior authorities you know.    To say look we cannot carry out our functions in this area, in this community because we do not have enough resources and this is the situation or whether people just have not done anything.    So maybe you could think along those lines and obviously whatever we do we have got to look at what power we have.    Because we do not want to be accused of doing anything that does not fall within our powers.    Ja.    Yes.    Well I would like to have sight of the actual document.    As well.    Yes but in the meantime I will just read this letter.    Okay no maybe even without looking at it I have just finished reading this letter.  Maybe what we can do is – maybe I can make the order with a rider.    That I – the order could be revisited should it become necessary.    Later on just in case     Later on it might appear that there is something.    Particularly when I have not looked at a lot of things.    Ja.  So in that way then one can always relook at it and either withdraw the order or keep it as it is.    Ja.  So is this identification of the relevant documents fine?    Hm.  Okay.  The information contained in the documents identified in paragraphs 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the letter dated 28 August 2019 from Cliff Decker Hofmeyr addressed to the secretariat of the commission will be included in the commission’s record only in a redacted – redacted form.  Is that adequate?    Is that adequate?    Okay.  Alright thank you.  I think I must then say we will make that 1 and 2 will be the order in 1 above may be reconsidered at a later stage should circumstances dictate its reconsideration.     Ja.    Yes.    Yes and I see that on the last page of his letter – his attorneys letter it does emphasise that he intends to give his full cooperation.    To the inquiry and just once again does make the point that the lack of notice, lack of time and minimal admissible information against him is unfair and prejudicial.      I think that the important thing is that he knows that the witness will be giving evidence today and he has been advised that he could be here if he wishes to object.  And he is not here or his lawyers are not here.  And whatever prejudice may – he may suffer would – at least he will be given a chance to present whatever challenge he wishes to present.  So I think it is okay we can proceed and he must simply be given whatever it is he is entitled to from the commission.    That he might not have been given yet.    Yes.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Ja.  Please come forward.      There.  Switch that off and go there.      Hm.    Thank you very much.  Okay.      Let it be – ja.  Please administer the oath or affirmation?    Yes you may proceed.    Yes it has been a long time.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Thank you very much for that background.    Yes.  Which one of the …    Files should – I should …    Oh yes.    Hm.    Only one of them has got his affidavit?    The rest are annexures?    Hm.   And other documents. The file that has Mr Mainganya’s affidavit or statement will be EXHIBIT DD13A and then there are two other files.  They are lever arch files.  One will be marked EXHIBIT DD13B and that is the one whose first annexure is Annexure VDR 1 and the other lever arch file will be marked EXHIBIT DD13C and that is the one whose file document bears the logo of IDC and is dated 30 January 2017 with the heading “New Application”.  That will be EXHIBIT DD13C.    Yes.    Just raise your voice a little higher if you can.    Okay.    Sorry.  It may be that your voice is soft by nature.    Make another attempt to speak up a bit.  Thank you.    Okay.    Ja.        What is the page?    Thank you.    Yes.    Just to get somethings correct.  You have got the IDC and then you have got divisions within it?    Is one of its divisions Industrial Investment Facilitation?    Is that something else?    Oh.    Just repeat that.  Repeat the last sentence.  It is not …    Oh, okay.  So that is a - that is outside of …?    Okay.  Okay.  No that is fine.    And …    And just repeat what Mr Cobbinah’s position was.  You - you did - I think you did say it earlier on.    Oh, okay.  You did not say what his position was?  Do you remember what his position was?    You do not know?    Okay.  No that is fine.  I am sure we will get - find it as some stage.    Ja.     Hang on one sec, I haven’t got to the right page, what’s the right page on his affidavit?     Page 2 okay.     Yes let’s take the break but we’ll take a rather longer tea break today let’s resume at quarter to twelve, I just need to attend to something.     Yes, we adjourn.    Okay let us proceed.    I am sorry.  Please just try what you tried earlier on when we could hear you quite well.    Just try that again.    Okay but it is fine you can continue you do not have to go back to the answer you have given.    I am sorry I thought – I thought I understood where you were.  I thought it was the last block at page 564.    Oh okay.    Is that something he could check over lunch?    Yes.    Could you take me to that?    Yes.  Yes, yes.    Ja.  Hm.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Let us make it 37.3 if you think that will – that should work?    Yes in the right place ja.    Yes.    Ja okay.  Thank you.    Yes page 3 you say?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Thank you.    Yes.    I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.    February 2022 …    Oh that 38 (intervenes).    38 000 ja.    Okay.    Ja.    Ja, ja, ja.    I - I think I am - I have given up your voice.  It seems to be just low by nature.    I do not know if the technicians have …    Whether there is anything the technicians can do.    Ja.    It seems something that could and should have been easily picked up.    Hm.    Did - did …    I think we probably want to ask the same question.    What are the chances that it - it was a genuine error?  What are the chances that it was not a genuine error in your own assessment?    Or is that something you are unable to …?    Okay.    It was not your question.        I am sorry.  Just so that I follow that part.  Is that regular for them to have that holiday?    Yes, but you recoup …    Later whatever they would have paid earlier?    Okay.    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    The - where you give a client a holiday as - as we call it now - the compensation that you structure into the whole arrangement whole deal you just mentioned that later on the repayments are higher. Would the aim be to achieve the same benefit for IDC as IDC would have achieved if there had been no holiday or is the position that because you have been given a holiday IDC will structure the repayments in such a way that it must end up getting more from you as a client then otherwise would have been the case if there had been holiday - holiday?    In other - is the aim to similarly achieve the same thing because you just want to assist the client or is there an element of saying well we must punish you a little bit in order to discourage people from wanting to get into holidays.    Or is that something that you are not sure about?    Ja.    You would not use punish.    Ja.    Yes.      Yes, no, no I understand that I think what I’m looking for is whether you say, if we hadn’t given this client a holiday over, for example,  a five year period we haven’t given this client a holiday of, what two years, for example the first two years and they start paying on the third year, whether you look at simply putting yourselves in the same position you would have been in financially in terms of what you get or whether you actually make more, you seek to make more money by reason of the fact that there’s been some holiday?      Oh you try to achieve both?      Okay thank you.     Are you back in his…[intervenes].     You did mention the page but…[intervenes]     Oh okay.     I wasn’t sure whether he wanted to add something?     To the previous question.      What – I mean I can understand the idea on the part of an institution such as IDC of saying we are – we are prepared to take some risk in order to assist maybe a certain sector of business or society and so on but I wonder what measures the IDC would take to try and make sure that it’s decision to take that risk is a reasonable one, particularly where you’re looking at people who might be depending on tenders you know, they tell you we have hope that we’ll get two or three other tenders and they might not even know who else will be tendering for those tenders, what are their prospects, what will their prospects of getting those when they don’t even know who else will be bidding for them.  It seems different to me from somebody who say, look this is the business I have now and here is another business that I’m going to start, here’s my business plan you can look at it and they motivate.  You can assess the risk in a certain way there are not too many variables but I’m just thinking if it’s an entity that is talking about getting other tenders in Johannesburg, in Pretoria, in Bloemfontein, I’m just making examples, you say, but we have no idea whatsoever what your chances will be, are  you able to shed any light as to how those risks are assessed?    Looking at the track record.        Thank you.     Okay I think let’s take the adjournment and we will resume at two, we adjourn.    I note that this Friday afternoon is a very empty – it is a very empty hall.      We can just assure Mr Mainganya that it is has got nothing to do with him,    That is right.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes I have got it.    Yes I am sorry I think I got lost.      You went to 189.    Oh okay.    I was seeing that 1.12.    And that 1.8 but I was not seeing some of the figures you were mentioning.    Hm.    I have got it.    So this invoice was it - well I see that it - it seems to be addressed to EML but I hear you talk as if it was directed at IDC or did I misunderstand something?    It was sent to - it was sent to EM - EML …    And EML sent it to IDC?    As part of expenses?    Oh, but how could - how could that happen?    Yes.    This is not equipment or anything like that.    But why did he even go there?  Why did you - do you even have to say you did not tell us?  I mean that - if there was such an arrangement it was between the two of them.  Is it not?    Yes.  Ja, no, no I understand that completely.  I do not know about Ms Hofmeyr but I mean - I mean on the - on - on the assumption that EML had asked Mamela Properties Trust - Properties Trust - they are raising funds - Properties Trust to facilitate or raise funds for them.  That must be their - their own business.    How - how could they even begin to think they can pass that on to you.  That - that is my - that is - that is my reaction you know and - and I am kind of thinking maybe you - ID - IDC should have been much harsher …    To EM - EML    Maybe - maybe I missed something.    Yes.    From - from the money obtained from …?    Hm.    I do not know Ms Hofmeyr.  Just - I think I would have been very harsh.    Ja.    Hm.    Or maybe before that.    I take it that it is obvious that there had been no facilitation that was lawful that would have happened?    Yes.    Okay.    You do a verification?    Okay.    Well this 1.5 did you ask EML exactly what it is that was done by Mamela Property Trust, the properties trust that Mamela Properties Trust understood to constitute facilitation raising of funding from the IDC.    But what was it really, was it preparation of the submission, what was it?    You may have but I remember I told you I have – I’ve given up trying to hear what you say because I’m – I hear some things, I don’t hear others but I’ve given up, I think it’s the nature of your voice.    Ja, so what is it was it preparation of the submission or what was it?    In essence?    But is that understood to be the raising of funds, generally speaking, when somebody raises, can anybody raise funds the way it’s understood in business or do any facilitation without talking to the person who is being asked to provide funds?    Oh I’m ahead of – okay alright.    Yes, well the reason why I was asking, I was going to ask it much earlier but the reason why I asked it now was because Ms Hofmeyr talked about whether it wasn’t a sufficient bad flag to IDC so it brought back that question in my mind to say but if you as IDC know that there is nobody who has been talking to you on behalf of this client to try and raise funds, if you are shown an invoice that says somebody is demanding money because they facilitated or raised funds with you, not with somebody else, and you know that there is no such you know, isn’t it – shouldn’t that have said to IDC hang on maybe that is fraud here.     Okay.    I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr, did you say that you – there was some security that you called, you called back or whatever?    And in what form was that, where was the security?    Equipment.    Ja.    But you are still going to do that, you haven’t realised the money?    Oh you had to wait for the litigation?    Ja but in the meantime when you talk about vehicles if you talk about a year later they’re depreciating and all of that, I’m not suggesting that there might be a better way in which you could have done, I’m just stating what would be effective there, just sitting, if they are parked somewhere for a year because I guess in the nature of your job you don’t use them you have to sell them, if they are parked somewhere for a year they are depreciating.    Well I don’t know if you are able to say this, if you can’t then you can’t, I get the impression that you are unlikely to get to recover much through them, if you bear in mind exactly what you had given this client.    There are challenges.    Is that the same that the two of you have just talked about?    Where he says he understands that they said it was going to happen.    Yes?    I’m sorry, just before your next question, is it accepted that whoever made that payment or made the decision that payment be made, the 1.5, that – no I think I may be confusing this, from IDC you just made a payment to the client and the understanding was that the client knew from what they had been told that IDC is not going to pay this 1.5, is that right?    Yes, yes so the actual payment to Mamela Trust would have been from the client to Mamela Trust?    And not from IDC as a payment to Mamela Trust.    Okay.    Thank you very much Mr Mainganya, if a need arises for the Commission to ask you to come back we will ask you, but for now you are excused, thank you very much.    Okay.  Next week it is SABC and ... I think, ja.    Yes, yes, we will adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.    We are indeed.    Chair there are a few housekeeping matters just to address and also an update to conclude in essence the evidence of yesterday before we move to the evidence of today.  If I may just be permitted to address you on that update?    Chair you will recall at the commencement which was many weeks ago of the aviation section of evidence.  When I introduced the topic of the North West ground handling transaction which Mr Natasen’s evidence yesterday completed at least in this evidence session.  I indicated that one of the concerns of the commission as it had been investigating the matter was its understanding that there had been a series of criminal complaints laid in relation to the matters that were investigated and presented beginning as early as 2016.  And the concern was why there had not been movement in relation to those cases.    We indicated then Chair that we had taken steps to engage with the relevant authorities about that.  We have – we received an initial report to which I made reference at the outset.    Of the evidence.  That is a report there is no need to go there now but just to refresh our memories it was a report from the let me just have it here – the Lieutenant General National Head for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation colloquially known as the Hawks because the commission had engaged with the Hawks to say we are aware of these complaints the first of which laid in 16, the second of which laid in 2017, the third of which laid in 2018 and we have seen no movement in relation to those cases.  They gave us a report of what steps had been taken in relation to the engagements and it concluded on the basis that the investigation needs speedy conclusion.  Those were the notes of the report from Lieutenant General Lebeya.      That there should – the investigation needs speedy conclusion.  Right.    So Chair we – we interrogated the report.    Because we wanted to understand precisely what has happened since 2016 to 2019.    Until that point indeed.    Chair that precipitated correspondence, further correspondence and seeking’s’ of clarity.  The report itself indicated certain bank statements had taken very long to be produced, had taken – had been requested again.  That there had been an attempt to consolidate the cases.  Chair the upshot that I report to you today is that none of the clarity that we have been – well attempted to be given has actually advanced the matter.  It raises more questions in fact than it answers.  And I raise that with you today Chair because it is our proposal that we continue to engage to try to understand why three and a half – well it is three years since the first complaint.    These matters have not progressed.    And Chair it is with a view in due course.    Once we get to the bottom of this.    To make recommendations in our submissions to you.    About what you may consider in a report in due course.    Chair our thinking there is if this can be explained by matters of incapacity.    Well that is one thing and it may well influence the type of submissions we would make to you in relation to recommendations following from the commission.    There is also concern though that there may have been delays in this prosecution of the matter for other reasons.    And we have – we are in the process of engaging those matters with the Hawks.    So I – my request to you today is that we continue to probe the matter.  That we update you as and when we believe we have a full picture.  I would not be in a position today to give you a full picture because there is much that still needs to be interrogated but we would do so in advance of making any submissions to you Chair about what our proposed recommendations may be in relation to these matters.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Hm.    Hm.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Thank you Chair that was just to conclude that aspect of the North West ground handling transaction for present purposes.  If I may then move to today and one or two procedural aspects.  Chair there has been a request – Mr Mainganya who is going to be sworn in shortly is the Chief Risk Officer of the Industrial Development Corporation.  Some of the documents that the IDC has provided to the commission in their endeavours to assist with the investigation are commercially sensitive.  There are two pages of a particular annexure that are commercially sensitive and which there has been a request that we ensure are redacted from the public record when the bundles of today go onto the website.  Chair the legal team has considered the two documents or the two pages of a document that appears in three places in the bundles after receiving the letter and we have no difficulty with the suggestion that they be redacted.  As a matter of fact I do not even intend to take Mr Mainganya to those documents today.  And so with your leave our proposal would be that that arrangement be made.  It is set out in a letter which those documents will be and Chair I can just hand that up to you if I may.    Chair you will see that it is a letter addressed by Cliff Decker Hofmeyr who are  the attorneys acting for Mr Mainganya today and the relevant documents in respect of which redaction is sought are set out from paragraph 4.1 on that page over to 4.3. Chair my suggestion is this morning I was able to identify those documents with the legal representatives as they appear on the paginated pages in the bundles.  And so my proposal is that if you are inclined to give the ruling you do so with reference to the documents referred to in the letter and then we will simply ensure that the correct paginated pages of the record are redacted.    Certainly.    Chair let me take you to that then.    Certainly.    Hm.    Hm.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    Yes it is.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Hm.    Thank you Chair we are indebted.  Chair the final procedural aspect is just to update you insofar as Rule 3.3 Notices in respect of Mr Mainanya’s evidence is concerned. Chair as you will see when we commence with Mr Mainganya’s evidence it comes in two parts.  There was an initial affidavit in respect of which a Rule 3.3 Notice was issued to an implicated person.  Pursuant to that notice being issued we received an application for cross-examination from the implicated person but that was subsequently withdrawn.  There was then a further affidavit that was received from Mr Mainganya on Wednesday of last week and it was a supplementary affidavit.  It has been placed in the folder that – in the bundle that we will come to.  In respect of that affidavit there were three further Rule 3.3 Notices that needed to be issued. They were issued on the Friday of last week first thing in the morning. That means implicated persons obtained a week’s notice of todays’ evidence.  There has been only one response to that and that was a response received yesterday from Mr Komane’s attorneys.  Chair that correspondence indicates and if I may just beg leave to hand it up to you Chair before I go to it.    Chair the way it has been put together is the covering email that you see there is actually the email that the commission sent in response to the letter that was received from Mr Komane’s attorneys.  Second in the documents that have been handed to you is Mr Komane’s lawyer’s letter.  The essence of it Chair as I understand it is that Mr Komane places on record at paragraph 1 of the letter which you will find on the second page of it that he denies any involvement in the alleged payments that are described and we will come to that in Mr Mainganya’s evidence.  He goes on to raise concern that the allegation is based purely on hearsay evidence with no corroborating statements, affidavits or documents supporting the allegation and furthermore lacks merit and is conceived to be unsubstantiated and the concern is that it makes it impossible for their client to respond to it.  At paragraph 3 concerns are raised about the public interest in the commission and the prejudice to Mr Komane both in private and his public capacity should the allegations be made public alternatively his client be associated with the allegations and then at 4 they are concerned – they raised the concern that he has not been granted adequate time to respond to the notice and has not received all the necessary information to properly respond.  And if you go to the last paragraph on that page it concludes on the basis of a request that Mr Komane be furnished with the founding affidavit of Mr Mainganya or any corroborating evidence that might exist in order for him to assess the merits and obtain the necessary further legal advice and assistance he is entitled to.  Chair the letter on its face did not make any claim in relation to the proceeding of Mr Mainganya’s evidence.  But out of caution yesterday evening a letter was sent that is the first letter in the pack to the representatives and it was made clear to Mr Komane’s representatives that it was the intention of the legal team to proceed with Mr Mainganya’s testimony.  You will see that at paragraph 3 of the email.  It further went on to indicate that if Mr Komane intended to object to the commission proceeding to hear the evidence of Mr Mainganya that he was invited to send a legal representative to the commission to make such representations. And it continued in conclusion to say if no legal representatives appear to make such representations the commission will proceed with the evidence of Mr Mainganya and your client will be able to bring whatever application he intends to bring and to provide his version to the commission in due course.  Chair the other thing I can update you on which is not reflected in this email is of earlier this morning the other affidavit of Mr Mainganya as well as an affidavit of Mr Rama which will be referred to in todays’ proceedings have been sent to Mr Komane in response to his request.  Chair I am not aware of any legal representative today for Mr Komane and so it is my proposal that we continue with the evidence and of course we are eager to receive any information from any persons related to the mandate of the commission and if in due course Mr Komane seeks to do so or makes an application to cross-examine any witness we will place that before you Chair for determination.    Indeed.    Hm.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed and if what we have given him in his view is inadequate and there are further documents that are relevant.    He will certainly engage with us on that.    Chair if I may then ask Mr Mainganya’s legal representative just to place herself on record.    Before we proceed with the evidence.    Thank you Chair.  If I may request the witness be sworn in?    Thank you Chair.  Chair and Mr Mainganya before I proceed with the questioning of Mr Mainganya with your leave Chair I would just like to place todays’ evidence in context because it has been some time since we heard the aviation evidence.    indeed.    And in order for today’s evidence to make sense in the scheme of the evidence that was presented previously if I may just take a moment to locate it?  Chair one of the investigations that was presented in the aviation session related to jet fuel supply agreements that had been concluded between South African Express and South African Airways with a company called EML Energy.  You will recall we had the evidence of Ms Loock and Mr Vaughan.  Both of them dealt with this particular jet fuel supply engagements with their respective state owned entities and EML.  Their evidence was that a jet fuel supply agreement had been entered into between South African Express and EML Energy in circumstances that did not follow procurement processes at a time when the fuel was already being supplied to SA Express by SAA.    And so it – it on its face appeared to be a duplication of supply.    It was at a price 30% higher than the price that SA Express was receiving fuel from SAA and the further evidence of Ms Loock was that EML after it was awarded the contract for jet fuel supply ended up never being paid for jet fuel supply because all – the only performance that it rendered was in relation to refuelling and defueling of aircraft which was in a small proportion.  I think her evidence was about R80 000 whereas the contract was for many many more thousands beyond that.  Chair that was the background of Mr Loock’s evidence from the South African Express airways side.  What Mr Vaughan gave us insight into was that actually prior to that South African Express airways contract there had been a decision of the board of SAA to set aside certain jet fuel transactions for certain identified parties?  There was a process that was run to try and bring what were referred to as black industrialists into the jet fuel supply sector and the consequence of that was that EML was one of three parties that were identified for that 20% set-aside of jet fuel.  As it so happened on Mr Vaughan’s evidence despite them being short listed and recommended for appointment they were not actually appointed in the initial 2016 tender.  There was a later appointment of EML in 2018.  So that is the context against which Mr Mainganya’s evidence is heard today and it might not be readily apparent why we would be hearing from a witness from the IDC in circumstances of jet fuel supply to SA Express but the reason for that and it will be traversed with Mr Mainganya in his evidence is that off the back of these contracts with SAA and SA Express a funding application was made by EML Energy to the IDC and it received funding and that funding transaction has been investigated and will be explored with Mr Mainganya today.  And so Chair with that background in place.    If I may then commence with Mr Mainganya’s evidence?    Right.    Chair first of all if we could just enter into the record.   There are three files comprising Mr Mainganya’s evidence today.    They are all in the DD13 range and they are files DD13A, B and C.  If we can enter those into the record.    Correct.    Correct …    And other documents.    Thank you Chair …    And we will spend most of today in DD13A which contains the affidavit - the first and second affidavit of Mr Mainganya but we will on occasion move to the other documents.  Mr Mainganya so my suggestion to you if I may is to keep A readily available in front of you and then when it is necessary to go to Bundles B and C I will identify that. The second thing is just to ask that you put your microphone on and we find that if you bring it closer to you it sometimes amplifies a bit better.  Thank you.  Mr Mainganya could you just for the record clarify for us what your position is at the IDC?    Thank you and when did you join the IDC?    Thank you and what are your qualifications?    Thank you and before joining the IDC in 2014 what did your career involve?    Thank you.  If we can then just pick up the first page of your affidavit and you will find that at page 1 of the Bundle DD13A.  Mr Mainganya this is an affidavit as I have it that you deposed to previously as compared with a statement …    But just for completion sake can you confirm that this is your affidavit and that it is contents are true and correct?    Thank you and then if I can take you to your second affidavit that you provided to the Commission.  You will find that in the same bundle at page 32.1 - 3-2.1.    And can you just confirm for the record that that is the second affidavit that you provided to the Commission and that you confirm its contents as true and correct?    Thank you.  If we can then just return to the first page of your affidavit and that is at paginated page 1.    I would like to pick it up at paragraph 3 there.  You have already told us about when you joined the IDC but in that paragraph you go on to explain some of the committees that you serve on.  What are those?    And you indicate also in that paragraph about a reporting line to you from the Risk Management Department.  Can you explain to us how that works?    Thank you.    Mr Mainganya what I would like to deal with next just for us to be able to navigate your evidence today and understand the IDCs processes is to have your assistance in describing to us how the processes of the IDC work when it receives an application for funding and Mr Mainganya I have been guided in that by an affidavit that was prepared by one of your former colleagues - Mr Rama - which had also been supplied to the Commission and for ease of reference that appears at page 38 of the same Bundle A. That is DD13A.  Can you confirm who Mr Rama is and whether he is known to you?    Thank you and if you …    Thank you Mr Mainganya.  That is much better I think.    So if we could continue in that frame for the rest of your evidence.    Just from an audibility point of view.  If you go to the last page of that affidavit.  You will see it is the final page in the file in front of you - DD13A - and it is page 61.  Could you just indicate for the record the date on which this affidavit was deposed to?    Thank you.  Now what Mr Rama does in this affidavit is to describe the end to end application process in the IDC and so what I would like to propose to do with you is to go to that and then ask you to explain it to us but we will just use the pointers in his affidavit for that purpose and you will find that at page 3-9 - 39.    It is the second page of his affidavit and you will see a heading there “End to End Application Process”.  Do you see that?    Right.  So he begins with what happens by the Pre Investment Business Centre at paragraph 5.  Can you tell us about what that centre does when it receives an application?    Hm.    And - and what happens if it - if an application proceeds past that Pre Investment Business Centre’s evaluation?  Where does it go next?    And there is reference to a person called a deal maker.  Who is that in the structures?    And could you tell us a bit about that due diligence process?  What does it involve?    And when the due diligence is complete what is the next phase of the process?    And are the Credit Committees the ultimate decision making bodies in relation to the application?    Thank you and can I just get one point of clarity.  You spoke about the team leader producing the submission report and then you spoke about that being evaluated by the risk management committee.    Is there also a peer review that happens before it goes to Risk Management?    Right.  So - so just - so that I can get it right the submission report …    Is prepared?    Then it is peer review - reviewed.    Is that correct?    Right.    Thank you and can I say just from the basis of what you have described now it sounds like a multistage process …    With various endeavours to ensure accuracy in the process.  Is that a fair description?    Thank you and then after a decision to fund has been made there has been reference to a Post Investment Committee.  How does that committee become involved?    And do they generally do so quite swiftly after the submission?  Is there a sort of timeframe on resolving the request?    Hm.    Hm.    Do you have a sort of sense of the average time?  Are we talking about days after receipt?    Thank you.  When it becomes relevant I - I will seek clarity on the timing in relation to the specific decision that the Post Investment Committee made in this case.    If we may then go to this particular application for funding and you will pick up how it originated in the IDC again in Mr Rama’s affidavit …    And that would be at page 41 - 4-1 of Bundle DD13A and you will see at the first paragraph on that page paragraph 11 Mr Rama describes how he received the EML that is a reference to EML Energy Business Plan.  Could you read there what he records?    Thank you and if we could go and take a look at that email.  You will now need to move to DD13B and it is right towards the beginning of that file.    So if you go to the - DD13B.  It will be one of the other files next to you on your left.    The page - 63 Chair.    6-3.  Could you please describe for us the email that appears in the second half of that page?  Who it is from and who it is to?    Could you give the full name - Billy?    Chair just for the record Cobbinah is spelt C-O-B-B-I-N-A-H and …    Mr Komane that is Edward Komane, K-O-M-A-N-E.  Mr Mainganya on what date was that email sent?    Thank you and if you could just read for us what it says?    And signed off by?    Who is Mr Billy Cobbinah?    Thank you and then if you go to the top of that page there is an email between what I understand to be Mr Cobbinah and Mr Rama.  Can you tell us when that was sent?    It appears to be shortly after the email that was sent from Mr Komane to Mr Cobbinah.  Is that correct?    And what does Mr Cobbinah say to Mr Rama?    Thank you.    So just for - for my own clarification purposes can we understand these emails to be a third party Mr Komane is sitting outside the IDC …    Forwarding something that he had discussed with Mr Cobbinah to him.  Is that as you understand the bottom email?    And then the - the higher email is between two IDC employees as I understand it.  It is Mr Cobbinah the forwarding it to Mr Rama both of whom are IDC employees.  Correct?    Thank you.    Indeed.    Thank you Chair.  If we can then just move ahead to the actual decision that was made in relation to this funding but before we leave the page that we are on.  I do just want to indicate Chair that Mr Komane’s email at the bottom refers to see attached document. If you go over to page 65 - 6-5 - you will that that is the attachment to the email and what I would like to just draw to the attention for the purposes of the record because it will become relevant later in the evidence of Mr Mainganya.  Is at page 71 - well - sorry.  Let us start at 65.  What is that document Mr Mainganya?    And whose business plan is it?    Have - had you seen this document before?    If we move in the business plan to paginated page 71 - 7-1 - you will see a heading there “Product and Services”.  Do you see that?    Can you read for us what EML Energy indicates there in the business plan are its products and services?    Thank you.  Can you just explain to us what - what would a business plan of this nature from a potential applicant for funding then - how would it be treated then by the IDC?    And who would be the person who did that evaluation in this case?    Yes.    Yes.    Right.  If we can then just jump ahead so that we orientate ourselves in time.  As I have it this email with the application and the plan comes through in May 2017.  There is a final decision to approve this funding on 6 February 2017.  So I would like to jump ahead to that and then in the evidence we will go through the stages towards the decision but it is quite useful for us now to understand what the decision was if we may …    And you will find that decision in the same Bundle D that is DD13B at page 2-6-4.  Mr Mainganya as I understand it this is the minutes of the meeting at which the decision in relation to EML’s funding application was taken.  Is - is that correct?    Just explain to us when that was.    Were you involved in this decision on that day?    I - I can see down the page under the heading “Apologies”.  It appears you gave your apologies for not having been present.  Is that correct?    So would you ordinarily be on the committee that was deciding this application?    But as it so happened you were not there on that day.  Is that right?    Thank you and then if you go over the page to 2-6-5 what is that?    Is this what was decided by the committee in relation to the funding?  If you see under the heading 3.1 “EML    Is that what they did approve?    Thank you.    Thank you.  If we could just take a bit of time with sub paragraph 1 of 3.1 on page 2-6-5.  I would like to understand the two facilities in respect of which funding was sought.  Can you explain to us what the first facility was which you see under sub paragraph 1 on that page?    Chair we will come back to explore what MSEP means.   But for present purposes thank you Mr Mainganya and tell us what the terms of the loan was going to be.    Thank you.  so can I just clarify there I understand a term of 42 months - I had to do a quick calculation in advance of today’s evidence - is three and a half years.  Is that right?    And those payments that you see one to 12, 13 to 24 and 25 to 36 are those monthly payments?    So when it says one to 12 that is month one to month 12.  Is that correct?    Over the period and so the full period if you add the six month capital moratorium would be three years plus six months which is four years.  Is my understanding correct?    Well 42 months is three and a half years.  Is the capital moratorium within the 40 …?    Excellent.  So the full term of this loan is three and a half years.  The 42 months.    Thank you and then tell us about the second piece of funding that was approved.    Mr Mainganya can you just confirm for me what was the term of this plant and equipment loan?    Thank you.  Then can you help me with something because I am - this was approved in 2017.  Is that correct?    We are in February 2017 as I recall it.    So a five term would take you to 2022.  Is that correct?      So help me with the last sentence there then, it says, “Repayment will be in the form of cash sweeps from financial year 2021 to 2024 maintaining a minimum cash balance of R1million”, Isn’t 2024 beyond the term of the loan facility?      We’ll look at that, is that your clear understanding of how it works?      But there are repayments preceding that, is that right?      Okay we’ll need to explore that a bit further when we go to the cash flow statements that were prepared by the finance department, because the understanding you’ve given now does not accord with my understanding of that schedule but you may be able to clarify for us but as you understand it here, it’s a five year loan for planting equipment and that is a loan that they receive the cash for in February – well at a point in 2017, correct?      And as you understand it did they only have a repayment obligation that began in 2021?      Okay thank you and then over the page at 266 can you assist me there, is it your understanding that those two loans were then approved?      And just deal with paragraph 3 at the top of that page, if you will, there was another facility sought and approved, what was that?      Thank you, Mr Mainganya I’d then like to go back to the topic of MCEP and for that purpose I’d like to move to page 2 of your affidavit.  Now you’ll recall your affidavit is in DD13A.  Mr Mainganya at page 2 of your affidavit you’ll see half way down there’s a heading 4.1 in bold, “Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement Programme Qualifying Criteria”. Is Manufacturing Competitive Enhancement Programme abbreviated as MCEP?      And please tell us what that is…[intervenes].      His affidavit page 2.      Apologies Chair.  So we’re midway down the page and we’re dealing with the heading in bold there, “Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement Programme”.  What is that programme Mr Mainganya?      M Mainganya do you mind if we just stop there for a moment, I’d just like to get a little bit more clarity in relation to the working capital loan that was approved for EML Energy that we just looked at.  Did I understand you correctly to say it was approved under this MCEP programme, is that right?      And if we can just pause at that 4% fixed interest rate, is that a preferential rate?      What would the ordinary rate be if you didn’t qualify for MCEP funding?      Right and that was the interest rate on the planting equipment loan was it not?      No I was talking about the planting equipment loan, the second loan was priced – the subordinated loan at prime plus 3% wasn’t it?      Right what was that prime plus what at the time?      Oh I see so where is the prime plus 3%, where does that come from?      Thank you, so at the time, 2017, do you recall what prime was?      If I said to you it was around 10% would that sound right?      Thank you so that means you’re comparing a difference of about – of 4% with 13% correct?      Thank you, then if we can go on because you were going to deal with the criteria, so as I understand your evidence MCEP is something that you must qualify for to get this preferential rate is that correct?      And then there are qualifying criteria, is that right?      And the first of those you indicated at the bottom of page two what is that?      Thank you can I ask you what your understanding of standard industrial classification code 3 is?      So just – what is a standard industrial classification code, where does that come from?      If I could take you to – in that same bundle page 37.1 you’ll find it just before Mr Rama’s affidavit commences, this is a SARS document reflecting standard industrial classification codes, is that what MCEP is referring to when it talks about standard industrial classification codes?      Do you know that as a fact?      Oh we haven’t seen those so maybe what you would need to do is assist us over the tea break to make those available to us.      What then, until today we had understood these to be the standard industrial classification codes the ones that you see at 37.1, what is code 3 under the standard industrial classification code that you understand to be the MCEP code?      Mr Mainganya I have not seen that before so I would like to take a look at it over the break and then we can come back to this point if we may in your evidence.      If we go over to page three where you were at the top bullet of your affidavit, you give the other qualifying requirements which are not pertinent for our purposes but at b) you tell us that the EML application was pre-assessed to have met the MCEP requirements, is that correct?      Who did that assessment?     And what was he – what was the basis he gave for identifying it as having qualified for MCEP funding?      Thank you, I don’t want to jump to 2018 yet if we may that’s why I’ve stopped you there because I just want to stay faithful to the chronology at this point.  This fact that it had been qualified for MCEP funding was referred to in the submission that was made to the Committee that took its decision on the 6 t h of February 17 and so I’d like to take you to that document so that we could explore it a bit if we may.  You’ll find it in DD13C, so it’s one of the files on your left-hand side and we’re looking there at page 554 which is right at the beginning, what is that document Mr Mainganya?      Is that the Committee that made the decision on the 6 t h of February?      And in the scheme of the processes of the IDC what is this document?      Thank you, I’d like to pick up a few aspects of this submission because they will be relevant to the further evidence that that you give and it could then ask you to go to page 557 in that document.  The third paragraph on that page deals with the fuel farm that EML Energy had, can you tell us about that?      Thank you and in this paragraph the compiles of this submission are dealing with the valuation that was given to that fuel farm, can you tell us about what is recorded there?      Thank you we’ll pick that up later but just so that I can understand does that mean EML in its books had given it a particular value but when the IDC did its due diligence it gave it a different value – a lower value?      Thank you. If we then go to 559 the second paragraph there talks about the tender that EML had been involved in to supply jet fuel to SAA, is that correct?      And what is recorded in that second paragraph about that tender?    Thank you, Chair I note that we have just gone past quarter past, it may be an appropriate time to take the break.        Thank you Chair well it will also facilitate us looking at the document, thank you so much.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mainganya we were on page 559 of bundle DD13c when we broke for the break.  And I was asking there about the second paragraph on that page where it is recorded that in the submission to the credit – the committee that was deciding this application that it had been established that there are three finalists for the tender. That is a reference to the SAA tender, is that correct?    And then what is your understanding of what else is recorded there about the stage in that tender that EML was at at the time that this funding decision was taken?    The submission indicates that the tender process had not yet been finalised, is that your understanding of it?    What does it indicate was the stage of the tender process that had been achieved by the time this submission was made?    Indeed but it does go on to say the budgets have been set up in a manner where it has been assumed that EML will be awarded a third of the full tender as per discussions with SAA.  Let us just stop there.  If a tender process had not been completed how could it be that any reliance was going to be placed on what volumes EML would be awarded?    Is that a customary approach for the IDC that it would assess an application prior to the tender in fact being awarded?    And just in terms of how you assess the viability of the application is it customary to rely on representations from a state owned entity about how much is going to be allocated to a particular bidder?    But …    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mainganya do you know who your – well the due diligence team of the IDC dealt with at SAA on this question?    I think it was Mr Soqwezele.    Is – does that ring a bell?    And do you know what position he held in SAA?    Does – is it any cause for concern for you that reliance was being placed on a particular allocation of the 20% to EML in circumstances where the approval processes within SAA had not yet been completed?    Well I am interested in a slightly different thing.  I know that you identified a risk and you also identified a risk in relation to how long the tender was going to be awarded for but this is a slightly different thing.  This is the IDC going to a person within SAA and saying how much is this tenderer going to be awarded so that we can do our cash flow forecasts on the business.  Is that customary?    Sorry who is he?    Mr Rama?    And that was a non-disclosure agreement between SAA and IDC?    Is that right?    Because certainly the client could not know anything about that process, could it?    And then you go – well there you – submission    That means it would be better for EML rather than worse, correct?    Could it not also be that a smaller amount of the tender could be awarded/    But that is not reflected here is it?    If we can then go to page 564.  When the decision to approve the funding was made on the 6 February 2017 there were certain conditions precedent that applied to that funding, is that correct?    And the one I am interested in we can pick up at the bottom of page 564. Can you tell us what those conditions precedent relate to in the last block of that page?    Well before we get there what are they conditions precedent for?     That is the underlined second line.    Thank you.  And if we could just focus on the second one.      Why do you understand that was put in?    Correct Chair we were at point 2 in that last block.    Thank you.  And that related to the requirement that there be a signed offtake agreement between EML and SAA with terms to the IDC’s satisfaction?  And MR Mainganye I was just asking you what is your understanding for why that was included?    What – what risk is sought to be protected there for the IDC?    So is it fair to say whatever terms were arrived at were important for the IDC to interrogate?    Then if we can go over to page 570 and this is the point – this is the document that reflects the point that you made earlier about the risk committee having identified a concern in relation to the tender.  Just to help us remind us in the processes when does this risk committee get involved?    Indeed.    Thank you Mr Mainganya that is exactly as I understood it and I am indebted to your explanation for it.  So the committee that is deciding whether to approve this funding is not only getting the submission prepared by the leader of the particular unit where the analysis has been done but they also are getting the risk department’s appraisal of that submission, correct?    And if we could then look at the first heading on that page which is entitled Material Risk Considerations and it is the second bullet there that I am interested in which is highlighted as the material risk. What was that risk?    So can I just pause there?  Are we to understand from that that the assessment of the contract that was used – should it have eventuated that was used to assess the financial viability of EML as a recipient of this funding was based on a five year contract from SAA?    And that is despite the fact that it was known to the IDC that the tender had only been advertised for three years, is that correct?    Again my concern is a similar one to the previous one.  Why would the IDC be comfortable in assessing the financial viability on the basis of a term for the contract that had not been the advertised term?    But why model on five years when to the knowledge of the IDC the tender was only for three years?    And the working capital loan?    Where is that?    Possibly.  Let us do that Chair.    I raised it Mr Mainganya because I have not found that in these documents.    So it would be useful if you could check that for us.    Assuming that it is not there thought would it not be more prudent to model for the purposes of financial viability assessment on the basis of the known tender period.    Hm.    And then if we can go over to 571.  You will see at the bottom there there is a heading Pricing, do you see that?  Apologies 571.    So there is a heading at the bottom pricing, do you see that?    And just read for us the first bullet there?    Thank you and that is a recordal of your earlier testimony as I had it.  You said if they had not qualified under EMSEP then the alternative pricing would have been prime plus 3 correct?    This indication that the client qualifies under EMSEP, do you see that?    Do you know if anywhere else in this submission it was indicated to the decision making committee the basis on which it had been determined that EML Energy would qualify under EMSEP?    Right.  And is your recollection that that may be somewhere in this submission?    I understand mr Mainganya from your affidavit that and we looked at it just before we went to this document that when you went to Mr Kobena after your engagements with the commission and you asked him why he had qualified EML for EMSEP funding he told you and I am quoting here from page 3 you do not have to go there for present purposes but as I read it here he said to you. “He approved and recommended the transaction for EMSEP on the understanding that EML will as part of its operations be involved in blending and value adding on some of its product.” Is that what he told you?    If I tell you that I have read this submission very closely it does not mean that I do so always without error but I read it very closely and I have not found any reference to blending or value adding in it, would that surprise you?    There is?    Indeed certainly.  If we can do it quickly then maybe we do so now otherwise Chair with your leave we can maybe pick these two aspects up after the break?    Just so that we do not delay ourselves too much.    Mr Mainganya should we leave it for the break?    Would that be preferable.    But just so I can understand where we are.  You agree with me that there is no reference to blending anywhere?    But you do recall a reference to value add.    And you will find that for me?    Thank you so much.  We now should go to the document that you made available to the commission over the break.  Chair we have managed to make a copy for yourself.  If I may beg leave to hand that up?    Chair it is a copy that Mr Mainganya had with him and so it does have some handwritten annotations of his.  He is happy for us to work off this document now notwithstanding those annotations but he is going to provide us with a clean copy.    For when it goes into the record.    Chair my suggestion is that we slot it in after the codes that we had thought were applicable and that would mean paginating it at page 37.3.  If that is suitable?  Otherwise we could give it a different exhibit number I am in your hands on that?    I think it will because then it comes in the right place in the document.    But we can just work with it separately now.    We will replace the clean copy in your bundle as well Chair.    So Mr Mainganya I understand your evidence earlier to be this is the applicable set of standard industrial codes that applies to EMSEP, is that correct?    We are indebted to you for pointing that out to us this morning.  Tell me which of those codes it was determined applied to EML?    So if we go down there is a column the third column is SIC code and then we read the first one of those is 0301.  If we move down to 0332 is that the one you referring to?    The one you have ringed actually in pen?    Is that what you understand Mr Kobena determined or is that you looking at the code and working out what it might have been?    But EML was neither a refinery nor a synthesiser was it?    Yes.  So why would you identify that as the applicable one?    I beg your pardon?    Crude petroleum?    Okay could you get us those sub-codes over the break?    Thank you.  Right subsequent to you interrogating this pre-assessment.    Of the EML funding qualifying for EMSEP with Mr Kobena you then I understand and that is if we go back to page 3 of your affidavit at paragraph C on that page. Chair that is DD13a.  We are back in the smaller file.      Indeed.    And I would actually like to pick it up at D on that page.  You say at D there  “Mr Kobena subsequently informed me on the 23 r d May this year that the DTI in an email correspondence dated 3 May 2018 had confirmed that fuel storage and blending is not covered by the EMSEP program.” Do you see that?    Was EML ever doing anything other than fuel storage to your knowledge?    So in May 2018 if I read this and correct me if my understanding is incorrect.  In May 2018 the DTI confirmed that EML would not have qualified for EMSEP funding, is that right?    Let us go there.    You will find that at page 32.1 in the same bundle.  32.1.  That is the commencement of your supplementary affidavit.    Is that right?    Mr Mainganya and then if you go over the page to 32.2 that is where in paragraph 5 you deal with EMSEP is that correct?    And what did you want to tell us about that?    Yes I understand that but if the DTI admittedly in relation to a different funding application in May of 2018 said fuel storage does not qualify for EMSEP that would I assume apply to any application for funding based on fuel storage, correct?    And EML was never doing anything other than fuel storage, correct?    So it would not have qualified when it was pre-assessed by Mr Kobena?    Sorry just say that correctly.    Thank you.  Thank you.  I would then like to move if we may back to your affidavit and just to conclude the question of EMSEP is it fair then to say that the committee relied entirely on Mr Kobena’s pre-assessment that this funding application qualified at least on the working capital loan for the preferential EMSEP rate?    Did they do that to your knowledge?    Indeed you were not present were you?    Have you done anything to investigate whether there were justifications given or whether the committee just relied on that sentence that we read at page 571 – you do not need to go back there.  But the sentence just stipulated client qualifies under EMSEP.      Thank you.  I would then like to move to page 4 I think that is where we were and look at the engagements with South African Express.  We have traversed this a bit already in your evidence because we were dealing when we looked at the submission that went to the committee.  With some of what I am going to suggest are curious features …    Of the way in which the SAA tender was approached by the IDC and you will recall the issues we traversed there was taking a funding decision despite the fact that the tender had not been approved.    And you have given your comment on that.    And then deciding to run a financial viability model on a five year contract in circumstances where the tender was only for three years.  Is there any other aspect of the engagements between the IDC and SAA that you would like to comment on?    Thank you.  Well then we can go over to page 5 because there we deal with the financial viability assessment …    That was made of the EML application and you will pick that up under the heading of 4.3 in bold on that page.  For this purpose Mr Mainganya we are going to need to look at the cash flow model that was produced by the relevant team insofar as it was submitted to the committee. Now it is in the Bundle C Chair but what I have done for today’s purposes is just provided us with bigger copies because there are lots of numbers on the page and it is just easier to see.  So if I may beg leave to hand it up.  Chair this is a duplicate of the page in the bundle and …    My suggestion is just for today’s convenience we work on the A3.    I am handing up two pages.    The idea is that we work with them together if we can.  They come from different parts of the bundle.  So just for record purposes the one page is paginated MPM 5-7-6.  That is actually the one we need to start with and it appears in DD13C and then the second one I want to work with Mr Mainganya appears in your affidavit.  Well it is an annexure to your affidavit …    And that is paginated MPM 21 and that is in DD13A but for ease we will work on - I understand you have also been given a larger copy Mr Mainganya and your legal representatives as well.  I will work on my smaller copies because we seem only to have received three.  Mr Mainganya the document at 5-7-6 what is that?    Oh, before we get to the error.  Can we start with 5-7-6?    Sorry and I should have said to you 5-7-6- is the cash flow statement that appeared in the submission     That was approved in February 2017.    Right.  So I just want to know what this document is.  Right.    What is it?    Thank you.    So just in layman’s speak I assume the people in your Finance Department will look at the application for funding.    How much is sought?    Will look at the position of the business.    Its cash flow and will determine whether on the terms for the loan that are being proposed.    The loan will be serviced.  It will be - the company will be in a position to pay it back.  Is that a fair summary?    Thank you.  So if we can just look at this page because for those of us that do not work with these spreadsheets often.  It sometimes requires a little bit of deciphering.  First of all just read for us the heading of the document.    Thank you and then below that there is an underlined Rand denomination with an apostrophe and three zeros.  Can you explain to us what that means?    And let me just ask you here I understand that to signify that when we look at the table …    Right.  We have got a whole lot of numbers there.  Those are - those are other than where it is a date indicated.  Those are Rands.  Is that correct?    So it is - it is money being signified - funds?    Right, but often those numbers do not exceed five digits.  Correct?    So does the R’000 mean we must add three zeros to any numbers that we see in this table?    Okay.  So just to help us if take that first column audit and it is headed “February 2015”.  Do you see that?    There is a number in brackets there - (47).  Do you see that?    That is not R47,00.  Is it?    What is it?    Okay.  So every number in this table we must add three digits to.    In a sense multiplied by 1 000.  Is that right?    Okay.  Right.  Then I would like to know under the heading “Senior Debt” do you see that halfway down on the left hand side?    What is that describing?    Okay.  So just to remind ourselves three was an approval on 6 February 2017 for a working capital loan of R6 million at four percent interest.  Correct?    Okay and then just help me if we move across from that “Senior Debt” and follow it through the columns.  If you go to July 2017’s column.  Chair that is about four - five along from the left …    And you follow it down to where it is in line with “Senior Debt”.  There is a R6 000 there.  Do you see that?  Well there is a 6 000.  We have to multiply it by 1 000.    So it - it signifies six million.  Correct?    Is that showing us the six million that would have been made available through the loan facility to EML?    And why is it shown as coming into the cash flow position of the business in July 2017?    Right.    In July 2017?    Right, because the approval was in February.  So as I understand this it is anticipating that by what you call the peak the full facilities …    Will have been made available and that is why we have six million there.  Correct?    Then help me.  The next line under that - still under “Senior Debt” says proposed IDC loan repayments.  Correct?    And then if we follow that across that line starts in February 2019 with an amount of 2.640 million.  Is that right?    What is that?    Of the loan of six million …    That was extended in …    By July 2017.    Correct; and if we track that along - please correct me if I am understanding it incorrectly but there is a repayment of about 2.6 million in February 2019.  Correct?    There is a next repayment in February 2020 of 1.4 million or thereabout …    And then there is a repayment in February 2021 of about 1.9 million.  Correct?    So that insofar as capital of the loan is concerned is repaid by February 2021.  Correct?    If we could then go to the next line.  What is that?    Right.  So those start to be repaid from what I can understand here in July 2017.  Is that right?    And then you track those numbers through and if I am understanding this correctly by February 2022 that is when the last interest payment of 38 000 is made.  Is that right?    Okay.  So just so that we are on the same page.  The working capital facility of six million according to this cash flow statement was going to have been fully repaid capital and interest by February 2022.  Is that right?    Sorry Chair.    Yes.    That 38.    That is the final payment …    As I understand Mr Mainganya’s evidence on this facility and it would be towards the interest.    So am I right Mr Mainganya that the repayment takes place and is concluded by February 2022?    Thank you.  Let us move to the second facility that was available.  That is under the heading “Mezzanine Debt”.  Is that right?    So what does that signify - the “Mezzanine Debt”?  Which loan was that?    And the interest rate on that was?    Thank you and again I understand this cash flow statement to work in the same way in this line as we did with “Senior Debt” but please just check me if I am incorrect.    If we take July 2017 again because that is always the peak when the full funds will have been extended you see an amount of 6.5 million there.  Do you see that?    What does that signify?    So by July 2017 EML has received 6.5 million for the plant and equipment loan.  Correct?    And then if we go down the line again what this is reflecting on my understanding is the repayments of that loan.  Correct?    Okay.  So they start in February 2019.  Is that right - with an amount of 2.1 million?    There is a second payment in February 2020 of 2.1 million?    And there is a third payment in February 2021 of 2.1 million/    So insofar as the repayments on that loan are concerned they are completed by February 2021.  Is that right?    Yes.    Again capital.  Right; and then there is something called - on the left hand side - “Bullet Payment”.  What does that mean?    Right.    Oh, okay.  So the liability to pay the interest only kicks in later.  Correct?    Yes.    And as I understand this document the first interest payment is in February 2021.  Is that correct?    And it is in the amount of 2.7 million?    And then the second interest payment is in February 2022.  The same amount 2.7 million.  Correct?    And so again similar to the working capital loan the plant and equipment loan is similarly repaid by the end of February 2022.  Correct?    And that - February 2022 - is five years from the decision in February 2017.  Correct?    Thank you.  Right.  You in your evidence wanted to talk about an error …    And I stopped you and I apologise.  Let us understand the error that was brought to the attention of the IDC by the Commission’s investigators.  What is the error on this cash flow statement that we are looking at?    Hm.    Hm.    And what amount was the error?    Yes.  About 6.9 million.  Right?    Now Mr Mainganya how could an error like this occur in your rigorous processes that you have described?    Could you - Mr Mainganya if you would mind just as bit closer.    Thank you.    We will try and remind you to bring it closer.    Hm.    Because Mr Mainganya if I may just come in there.  It is - it is - I mean your description of it with respect is a very simple description.  It is not a complex matter.    That it should not have reflected a R6.9 million cash position insofar as the Denel asset donation was concerned.  Is it?  It is not complex - the error?    Hm.    Thank you.    No it - mine was close to it Chair.  So mine has not become not necessary any further.  Mr Mainganya when was the error first made known to you?    With the Commission.    Thank you and what steps did you take?  You have indicated to the Chair you did go back …    To engage with the financial team.  I also understand from your affidavit you asked them to look at the numbers again in a sense …    And that is the second spreadsheet that you have in front of you Chair and it is at paginated page 21.  That is in DD13A.  Mr Mainganya why did you ask for this recalculation of the cash flow statement to be done?    And Mr Mainganya I understand your affidavit to say it would still have been viable.  Is that correct?    It is that last part that I want to explore a bit further with you Mr Mainganya when you say the “Mezzanine Debt” which for our purposes I want to suggest we call the plant and equipment loan because that is how it was referred to in the decision making.  I understand you to say the plant and equipment loan would have been paid later.    Repaid later but only one year later than on the original calculation.  Is that right?    Yes.  However Mr Mainganya if you go back to page 5-7-6.    Remember we had determined on that page that the plant and equipment loan would have been paid back by February 20 - 2022.  Do you see that?    If we look at that same line on page 21 which is the reconstructed cash flow statement.    You will see that the plant and equipment loan is only repaid in February 2025.  Correct?    So that is more than a year later.  Correct?    It is in fact three years later.    Thank you Mr Mainganya.  You will recall when we were looking at the decision taken on 6 February 2017 …    I said we may need to come back to it when we looked at the cash flow statement and your clarification now has been helpful in that regard but I would like us just to go back there if we may so that I can be sure I am entirely understanding your position.  You will find that in DD13B and it is at page 2-6-5.    You will see under two there that deals with plant and equipment loan.  The one we are interested in at the moment.  Correct?    Now it is just the wording here does trouble me because it seems on its face to be contradictory …    But you may assist me there.  It reads   I do not understand that.  Can - can you assist me there?    If you could just come a bit closer.    Hm.    So was this an error that was then picked up before the agreements were concluded in your …    View.    So the approval that was given did not make sense at point two.  Did it?    And then help me with one last part.    Why would you refer to it as a loan facility of five years when it ends up being a loan facility of eight years?    So there is basically a holiday of three years.  Is that right?    So they get to fund their plant and equipment from July 2017 …    But they only have to re - start repaying that in 21.    Is that correct?    Thank you but you agree with me that it cannot possibly have been that they started cash …    Sweeping in …    February 2018.    Let us go back if we may just to that page 21.    And then if we go back to 21 but maybe before we do that just to pick up on the Chair’s question.  Of course all the time - correct me if I am wrong - the IDC is deciding which applications to fund.  Correct?    Is that right?    Thank you.  Just for the record you need to …    Give the positive answer.    Not the head nod.    So it is assessing at any point in time which to fund and whether it has three years receiving no repayment in relation to a particular applicant as compared with others.  I assume would be something it takes into account.  Is that right?    But delayed.    Indeed.    So it is - it is - I would suggest to you a balance that has to be struck when financial viability is assessed.    You get a bigger return at the end …    But you do not get repayment in the interim and I assume you would have to take into account that impact on the rest of the IDC’s decision making albeit that we dealing with fairly small figures here.  I accept that.    Thank you.      Thank you Chair.  Mr Mainganya just in relation to page 21 you were explaining…[intervenes].      We are back in his affidavit which is DD13A.  This was the recalculation done when you went back to the finance team, is that right?      And it…[intervenes].      21 Chair but it’s also on the big A3 that I handed up which might just be more convenient to look at.      This was the reconstructed cash flow statement done by the finance team when the error was drawn to their attention, is that right?     It does not, as I understand it, account for the increase in the interest rate that ought to have been paid by EML if it, as we’ve agreed did not qualify for MCEP funding is that right?      That would have increased its interest payments from 4% to 13% correct…[intervenes].      Apologies did you want to add something there Mr Mainganya?      Fully understood.      Thank you, do you agree with me though, that if this was properly to have been assessed at the time, this application for funding, two things would have had to have changed in the cash flow statement analysis that was produced by the finance department.  The first is that the facility would not have qualified for MCEP funding and so the interest rate on that loan would have had to have been at prime plus 3%, correct?      And then the second thing is that the error would have had to have been removed, correct?      So had no errors, and the Chair has already questioned you on the error of whether the R6.9million was a genuine error and you’ve given your evidence on that, we will return to the question of whether the MCEP error, I’m putting that in inverted commas at the moment, was also genuine in your view because  there have been further developments and investigations around that but for present purposes at least those two things would have to be corrected for the committee to be in a proper position to assess the financial viability of this application, is that right?      Mr Mainganya I don’t suggest it’s necessary that we do that exercise, I’m working at the level of principle.      So just to establish that you and I agree at least those two errors would have to have been corrected.      Thank you I then just want to understand the rationale because I read your affidavit to say you still think this would have been a financially viable loan to fund, is that right as you sit here today?      Why would the IDC want to extend loan facilities that end up extending for eight years in a situation where they only maybe have a tender which is, as I understand the submission, the sole source of revenue of EML at the time for three years, is that usual?      And what if they can’t get other contracts?      Chair I note that we are at the lunch break time if it’s convenient we can take the adjournment.    It is indeed Chair.    No indeed not, indeed not.  I think it is a combination of Friday afternoon and lots of figures that we have been dealing with.      Thank you Chair.  If we may proceed then. Chair there were two aspects well there were three aspects that Mr Mainganya was going to follow up for us on over the break.    The one related to the sub-codes.  I indicated to him that as his evidence progressed after that point they no longer became material certainly for my purposes.    So I am not concerned that we go to those sub-codes.    The other two I do want to just reference quickly in fairness to Mr Mainganya and then one or two follow up questions and then we will proceed.  Chair for this purpose we need to be working with DD13b.    And if you pick that up at page 189.  Chair the question arose in the context of the issue around the tender with SAA being for three years but then the loan assessment being done on a five year basis and the question to Mr Mainganya was well how could that really have occurred?  And he indicated that there had been an assessment as to what the extent of the exposure would be over at the end of the three year period and I asked him to draw our attention to where that was in the submission.  And that you will find at page 189 as I have it.  In the second paragraph there this is part of the submission that went to the committee on the February 2017 date, is that correct Mr Mainganya?    Thank you.  And what the paragraph you have    Mr Mainganya the R1.8 million that is reflected there is a product at the time of that error still being included in the cash flow statement, correct?    So the error would have to be taken into account to know what the actual cash in the bank position would be after the three years, is that right?    And as I have it from your reconstructed model that would reduce to about R1.1 million, is that right?    Mr Mainganya of course the R1. – you have traversed this with the Chair already but…    Apologies.    189 the second paragraph there Chair.    It is the last sentence of it.    Yes.    Apologies.    So that last – well second last sentence says there is going to be an exposure on the senior loan that is the working capital loan of R1.12 at the time.  That is million but the mitigant that is identified is that there is going to be about R1.8 million in cash in the bank, correct?     What I have also understood your evidence to be is you recognise that because of the error that had been included in the cash flow statement at the time that R1.8 million figure would have to be reduced, correct?    And it would go down to about R1.8 million, is that right?    Apology from R1.8 to R1.1, correct?    So there is less available cash than is recorded here at the end of the three year period?    If the error had not occurred, correct?    Would that have influenced you materially if you had been making this decision?    Right.  And just to conclude this Mr Mainganya of course that whole cash flow model depends on a range of assumptions made after the three years in which the contract which has been tendered for would apply, is that correct?    So you in a sense if I can understand and make sure we are on the same page when IDC looks at its modelling if the SAA contract had been awarded on the terms of the tender it then has a realistic sense assuming performance under the contract and on both sides what is coming into the company for three years, is that right?    But after those three years so this was in 2017 after 2020 everything else we see in those cash flow statements are projections, they are assumptions, is that correct?    It is.  And you traversed with the Chair earlier well that is part of the risk as I understand it that the IDC evaluates, Correct?    And what was the basis for those assumptions and the figures put into the cash position of the business thereafter?    So would that mean that they assume for the purposes of the model that what has been secured in the tender with SAA for the three years is likely to continue plus inflation?    And contracts of a similar value, correct?    But if you are and correct me if I am wrong but if you are increasing off a base for inflation you are assuming that base remains the same thereafter which would assume a similar value of contract being obtained elsewhere would it not?    Indeed but …    They put a figure in and a I understand the figure assumes a continuation of the same cash receipt over time as was secured for the three years plus inflation?    Thank you.  The second aspect that I asked for you to look at over the break related to whether there was any reference to the justification for EMSEP funding as being the value add that EML would bring and you drew my attention in the same volume Chair to page 222.    And Mr Mainganya I had introduced that question on the basis that I had not seen a reference to value add as the justification for the EMSEP approval or qualification in this submission.  What you have drawn my attention to is right at the bottom of that page 222 where there is a reference to the approach that ACSA Airports Company South Africa takes to people in the position like EML would have been in its contract with SAA, is that correct?    And what it records there is ACSA sees through putters.  Chair you will remember that phrase of through putter from the evidence of Mr Vaughan.  The real essence of it was that a company like EML was going to purchase the fuel from one of the big – the oil majors Total etcetera and then was going to utilise the pipeline at the relevant airport as a through putter to then provide that fuel plus a margin that SAA would pay into the aircraft.  Is that consistent with your understanding of through putter status?    Thank you.  So what is recorded here is ACSA sees through putters as a value add to the process as they will be sourcing the fuel, purchasing the fuel, transporting the fuel, storing the fuel and testing the fuel before it is put into the planes.  You and I might have been at cross purposes insofar as I was interested in it being presented as the justification for the EMSEP qualification in this submission.  Do you know whether this is what Mr Kobena took into account when he indicated to you when you followed up with him about this topic that there was a value add that EML was going to be contributing?    To this.    Thank you.  Do you hold the same view that it is a value add as understood under the EMSEP program when an entity purchases fuel from one of the oil majors and enters into an arrangement to then put it into the aircraft thereafter.  Is that the sort of value add that EMSEP is interested in?    If it was simply purchasing the fuel, transporting it, using the pipeline and putting it into the plane is that the sort of thing that you think would qualify as a value add?    Thank you.  Sorry, apologies I have taken two files.  If we can then go back in your affidavit Mr Mainganya and my hope is Chair that there are not too many topics to still deal with with Mr Mainganya so we look on good terms to complete this afternoon.  I would like to pick it up at page 6 if we may?  Mr Mainganya that is in DD13a.  And it is under the heading on that page in bold 4.4 Request to replace the SAA contract with SA Express SOC Limited.  Now Mr Mainganya for this point I do not want to have you move back and forward between files unless it is necessary because the document I am going to refer to now is one we have looked at before and I just need to quote from it.  But if at any point you want to go and look at the document feel free to tell me that.  It was in the conditions precedent of the decision in February 2017 that a requirement that there be a signed agreement with SAA was stipulated and I just want to read how it was    So when this was approved given everything we have traversed previously in your evidence as I understand it at that point the tender had not been awarded, correct?    So as I understood your evidence it was a protection for the IDC to say well it is a condition precedent of all of these agreements both loans and the guarantee facility that there must be a signed agreement between EML and SAA with terms to the IDC’s satisfaction, Correct?    Right then as I understand your affidavit that does not materialise that contract, is that right?    So then what happens?    If we could just stop there Mr Mainganya.  You indicated that earlier in your evidence today that you do not convene as a committee and that it is done on an almost round robin basis and I said to you in that evidence when it became relevant I had ask you in relation to this decision where the submission was made on the 26 July 17 whether you recall how soon after that submission was received the decision was taken?    Would it have been a matter of days in all likelihood?    Indeed but we are not talking about more than a week or so, is that fair?    Thank you.  In other words yes you agree?    It is just the record does not always reflect the manner in which you have indicated the answer.    Thank you.  So shortly after the 26 July 2017 a decision was made and what decision was that?    Okay.  Thank you.  So now we have a substation of funding that was premised on a SAA contract being replaced by a SAA Express contract, correct?    I would like to go to that actual submission because the aspects of it that we do just need to traverse.  You will find that in DD13c and it commences at page 631. Mr Mainganya you will be in file c.    At page 631.  Thank you.  Can you confirm what document that is at page 631?    Thank you.  And is this a submission that you have been discussing they went the post investment committee to change the funding from a SAA contract to a SA Express contract?    Thank you.  And then if you just go to page 634 it is a few pages on.  Under the – the last table on that page where there is capital letters APPROVED ahead of it.  I see there in the third line the chief risk officer identified, is that you?    And so that is your signature?    So you were part of the group that approved this change from the SAA contract to the SA Express contract, is that right?    And this occurred just a few months – a few days after the 26 July 2017, correct?    I would like to look at the actual wording that was used in this request to the committee of which you were a member and you will find that at page 633.  You will see there that the request under 1 if you could read that for us.  What is the first request that the business unit makes to your committee?    And then under 2.    So that was to push the drawdown date out slightly, is that right?    Okay I would like to focus a bit on point 1 though because you will correct me if I am wrong but this is a request as I read it that there be a consent to change the condition precedent that is the condition precedent that we saw previously related to the need for a signed agreement between SAA and EML on terms satisfactory to the IDC to a term which now stipulates that EML will be allowed to draw funding based on the SA Express award letter.  Do you regard an award letter as being different to a contract?    So why would the request be being made to allow funding purely on the basis of an award letter in circumstances where previously it had been of some importance as I understood your evidence to the IDC that they actually had a signed contract in place.    That is the page back yes.    Correct.    Is that how you understood this document at the time?    Because can I say to you that language is not readily apparent to me certainly as an outside reader of this.  And the reason is because when this document talks about the change it talks about a change and only ever makes reference to an award letter that has been received from South African Express.  Do you accept that just in terms of the words?    And do you understand the position to be that at 27 or call it 29 July when the approval was given the IDC had not yet seen the agreement?    There is only the award letter?    Is that right?    And let us just go to that award letter because it is a few pages on it is at 635.      Is that the award letter that you refer to?    And I understand your evidence to be this you understand is not a contract but – and you also – your evidence is that as at this date the IDC had not seen a contract, correct?    But thereafter it was obtained, is that correct?    And disbursements were made only after it was obtained, correct?    Were its terms interrogated at all by the team in the IDC?    Did they engage with South African Express at all about it like they had engaged with SAA previously?    Because as I understand it from Mr Rama’s affidavit and correct me if I am wrong there is no second due diligence that is done when a change of this nature occurs, is that right?    Right if we at 635 the one thing I just want to probe with you there is if a due diligence is not done when a change of this nature takes place I assume interrogating the prescribed litres of fuel that were going to be procured from EML would not have been interrogated at all would it?    And in fairness Mr Mainganya to the IDC I expect in this process you are not on the lookout for fraudulent contracts being concluded with state owned entities are you?    Indeed.    Indeed.    Oh the reason I raise it Mr Mainganya and this is not evidence I assume of which the IDC was aware at the time but the 8 million litres that were going to be provided according to this letter of award to Pilanesburg airport the commission has received evidence was wildly in excess of the number of litres that airport would ever need annually but I assume that was not known to the IDC at the time?    And the process of review that was undertaken did not reveal that?    Thank you.  And then if we could go Mr Mainganya back into your affidavit.    And we will pick it up at page 8 if we can.  At page 8 the heading begins 4.5 drawdowns paid directly to EML.  Do you see that?    Mr Mainganya I know at the time you may not have been aware of a particular invoice for a consultant that was included when the drawdowns were sought by EML from the IDC but you have seen Mr Rama’s affidavit before.  Have you not?    Can you assist us with what that particular invoice in the order of 1.5 million that was submitted to the IDC in respect of the drawdown related to?    And what were the services that were alleged to have been performed for that invoice?    Let us go to that invoice if we may.  You will find it in DD13B and it is at page 4-5-6.    Is this the invoice that we were speaking about?    And who is it from and to?    And the date of the invoice what is that?    And the contact person on the invoice?    That name came up earlier today.  Did it not?    That was back in the middle of 2016.  Is that right?    So his name appears here again on an invoice and what was the work for which this invoice of R1.5 million was raised?    So what is your understanding of this invoice being forwarded to the IDC as justification for a drawdown on its facilities?    Hm.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.  I - I - with respect I share that sentiment.    Do you think it was sufficient for Mr Rama simply to say we are not paying it because it was not in the original terms or might he appropriately have said we are not paying it because the IDC does not pay R1.5 million only to be used to facilitate the very funding that the IDC is making available?    Indeed.    Indeed Mr Mainganya because as we will discover …    If this had been flagged at an appropriate time as being a basis on which EML was seeking drawdowns …    On the facility …    Possibly more about the arrangement might have been uncovered.  Is that not so?    Thank you; but as I have the evidence all that happens is Mr Rama goes back and says we are not paying it.  Right?    You may not use the funding for this purpose.  Is that correct?    And then what happens?    Hm.    And is it IDC policy not to fund where there is a facilitation?    Thank you.  I was moving onto what happened because you began in one of your answers to the Chair recently to talk about when it was picked up that despite the indication that it should not be paid it was paid.    Can you explain to us how that came about?  The - the uncovering of the payment.    And what further inquiries were made in that regard?    You mentioned an agreement that was sought.    And when about was that reported back?    And that is a date on which an application was made for further funding.  Is that right?    So at this point 12.5 million has been extended to EML and that was drawn down in August 2017 as I recall it.  Is that correct?    And then in May 2018 - early May 2018 there is a further application by EML for about R8.5 million of funding.  Is that right Mr Mainganya?    And was this issue of the payment of 1.1 million made known to the committee that was asked to approve that further funding?    Mr Mainganya I understood that the Credit Committee did approve the request for the 8.5 million additional funding initially.  Was I wrong?    Hm.    Hm.    And on the 18 t h it was approved?    Hm.    Thank …    If I could just a few aspects of that.  What precisely did the client convey to the IDC as the reason for the fact that the SA Express contract had not been implemented?    Would it have been prudent to possibly engage SA Express at that stage to understand from them why the contract had not been implemented?    Hm.    You see Mr Mainganya if that had been done the Commission has received evidence already that the irregularity of that contract that had been awarded to South African Express …    By South African Express to EML …    Had already been picked up in South African Express in October 2017 and an investigation had in fact been initiated as early as that.  We are now in May of 2018 …    When further funding is being requested from the IDC …    And the only explanation that the IDC as I understand your evidence was given by the client …    For non-implementation of that contract …    Related to some delay in guarantees.  Is that right?    Yes indeed.  It was suspended a few days later when a media article …    Broke.    Hm.    Yes.    No indeed.  All that I am interrogating now is when EML comes to the IDC for more money …    In May 2018 …    A few things have happened …    Between the 12.5 million that it received …    In August 2017 …    And its application for more money in May 2018.  I would like to list those for you.  The one it is that it in breach of a specific indication from the IDC that it not use those monies to pay a facilitation fee.  It had done so.  Correct?    If you can just say yes for the record.    Thank you.  It had and that facilitation as a facilitation of the very funding that it had secured from the IDC.  Correct?    And I understood your evidence to be previously that is irregular in the view of the IDC’s processes.  Correct?    It had then never yet implemented the substitute contract for which the 12.5 million had been provided to it.  Correct?    And notwithstanding that as I understand your evidence the IDC did not take further steps to try and get to the bottom of why that implementation had not taken place.  Is that correct?    Thank you.    Mr Mainganya was the fact of the facilitation fee not on its own enough of a red flag to make the IDC cautious about further extending funds to EML?    Mr Mainganya if I could just come in there because I understood your evidence to be previously that it was brought to your attention specifically the agreement between Mamela Trust and EML was called for and you actually made it the condition of the further extension of the loan that there be some arrangement with EML about the fact that it was going to reimburse the 1.1 million.  Did I understand that incorrectly?    I see.  So you had not at the time seen either the invoice or the Commission Agreement?    Thank you.      For ...(intervention)       Mr Mainganya I appreciate everything you have said about the steps that were initially taken, the breach letter sent, the feedback that you obtained, but the fact of the matter is the IDC did decide to extend another R8.5million to EML, did it not?      It did, and back to the Chair’s question isn’t just the mere fact that there’s a facilitation fee of now R1.1million, which is not an insignificant amount is it Mr Mainganya?      It is significant isn’t it, I mean especially if it is for preparing the business plan that we looked at previously that is a business we should all be getting into because as I see that business plan it’s about 10 pages long it is not particularly difficult together.  Why was this not more of a concern to the IDC, when it agrees to provide R8.5millon more funding?      And as I understand your evidence you made a brief reference to a media article, what happened with the media article and how did that influence the IDC’s processes.  If you would like a reference for that, it’s at page 9 of your affidavit and it’s at paragraph B on that page, where you refer to media reports on the 27 t h of May 2019.      Mr Mainganya just a few follow up questions there, who did the IDC engage with at S A Express?      I have not seen that correspondence to the best of my recollection so maybe you can provide that to the Commission, but ...(intervention)       But what I’m interested in is whether in your testimony you said that they were going to, you were told they were going to launch an investigation, is that what they said?      Currently under?      Did that suggest it was already being investigated, or pursuant to the media reports it was going to be investigated?      Well it will be useful to have that correspondence because we know from the evidence of Ms Loock that she raised this for investigation as early as October 2017 within South African Express, and if you are engaging them in May of 2018 that investigation should have been well underway if not completed by then, so it would be of interest to the Commission to see that correspondence if we can.      Right, the next thing I just want to ask is a follow up, is it fair Mr Mainganya to say but for the media reporting on this issue those draw-downs would have occurred?      Which contracts were those?      So that would be another prerequisite?     But the fraud that had taken place and the irregular procurement in S A Express was the subject matter of this article, is that right?     So it could have been the case that EML had secured other contracts pursuant to which funding would have flown but this issue around S A Express would not have been unearthed, is that correct?     And just to be clear what was not made available was the second request for funding which was the 8.5million but by this stage in May 2018 there had already been 12.5million released, is that right?     Well and the working capital loan.     What has happened in relation to that, has there been repayment on that loan?     So just so I have it clear there was never any repayment of the loan by EML, is that correct?     Then if we can move to page 11 Mr Mainganya because this is where the further investigations of the Commission ...(intervention)      Mr Mainganya in your experience does foreclosure usually involve loss?     Mr Mainganya if we then move to page 11 this is where you pick up a topic there at 4.7 in bold entitled Billy Cobbinah, before we go through this, because this is really the concluding aspect of the evidence Chair, prior to your meetings with the Commission’s investigators on this topic were you aware at all that there may have been irregular conduct on the side of the IDC in relation to this funding transaction?     And can you then take us through what was disclosed to you in your engagements with the Commission, and then what further steps have been taken by the IDC in that regard?     Indeed.     What was the amount of the money that he indicated he had received?     R50 000?     And how did he receive it?     Mr Mainganya was the interaction between IDC and Mr Cobbinah when this confession was made recorded?     Thank you, certainly when we met previously we did request that we have that recording made available to us, could you assist us with that, we haven’t yet received it.     But as I understand it there’s a forensic investigation and in the course of that there is an engagement between the IDC and Mr Cobbinah, is that correct.     You indicate now it was recorded and you will make that recording available to us, correct?     And in that interaction Mr Cobbinah admits to having received R50 000 in cash from Mr Edward Komane, is that correct?    What then followed in relation to Mr Cobbinah?    I understand from your supplementary affidavit that Mr Cobbinah also indicated to you further information in relation to Mr Rama’s involvement in the funding transaction, can you explain to us what Mr Cobbinah relayed to you?    And did you take that further with Mr Rama?    Thank you.  Mr Mainganya insofar as the evidence that you have presented here today is concerned there’s certain just concluding aspects that I would like to get your comment on if I may, and it is really in an effort to try and draw together what evidence we have heard from you today.   The first is that do you agree that pursuant to being made aware of the information related to Mr Cobbinah in particular by the Commission the IDC has established that corruption did take place in this funding transaction.    And I also would like to suggest to you that in the course of the evidence it has become clear that certain aspects of the IDC’s process in deciding to fund EML Energy was inadequate, and I would like to give you the respects in which I suggest they were inadequate for your comment.  The first is that this application should never have been pre-approved for MCEP funding, do you agree with that?    Indeed.    Mr Mainganya if I can just follow that up, it was a false representation to that committee that EML was involved in blending at all, wasn’t it?    Well when – as I have your affidavit when Mr Cobbinah was pressed on this with you he didn’t use language about anticipation, he said he qualified them as pre-approved for MCEP because EML was involved in blending and value add, did I recall your affidavit incorrectly?    Oh, I didn’t read your affidavit in that way.  But you accept now that it should not have qualified is that correct?    And you accept that it was falsely represented at the time that they were involved in blending if that had been the representation?    Indeed.    Indeed.    Was that an aspect that was traversed with Mr Cobbinah in his disciplinary?    Thank you.  There was an error in the cash flow forecast that was done, that was not picked up by the IDC, is that correct?    And there was an unauthorised payment for a consultant for facilitation that took place notwithstanding which there was further approved funding to be given to EML?    Indeed, but just to follow that up Chair that was known to the IDC that that payment had been made when it decided to provide further funding?    Thank you.   Mr Mainganya there are certain reporting obligations under PFMA for the IDC in relation to irregular expenditure and losses resulting from criminal conduct, are you aware of those provisions?    Is it the IDC’s intention to report on this aspect insofar as there has been losses incurred by it resultant from this conduct?    Thank you.  And in going forward is the IDC intending to put any other measures in place to not permit a repeat of this type of corrupt activity?    Thank you Chair, those are our questions.    As I have it Chair.

MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Mark Phakamile Mainganya.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    My position is that of the Chief Risk Officer.    I joined the IDC in 2014, September.    I am a Chartered Accountant.    Banking, risk management in banking and before that I was in Public Service as - as an auditor.    Hm.    I confirm.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Huh-uh.    So some of them are the Special Credit Committee, the Credit Committee and the Post Investment Committee.   So the risk management department reports to me.  It is a second line function.  So it is not directly involved in the transactions but it assesses them before the transactions are submitted to the committees.    Okay.    Mr Rama was an employee of the IDC.  He - he was a - specifically involved in the Chemicals Business Unit assessing the deal maker.    Huh-uh.    Okay.    So Mr Rama was an employee of the IDC.  He was a deal maker in the Chemicals Business Unit.    Ja.    7 June 2019.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    So that centre would be the first recipient of applications from wherever they come from especially in - in Gauteng and then you have other applications that come from the regions but that centre in Gauteng essentially does a pre assessment of the transactions. That is to - to check if among other things they - they are within the mandate of the IDC to fund and to do a preliminary basic assessment before they were forwarded to the business unit …    For proper assessment.    So it - it will go to the - the relevant department in which that unit falls.  So if it is chemicals it is sent to the Chemicals Business Unit.  Also they assess the assessment that has been done to determine if they can proceed to do a due diligence on that application.    So a deal maker would be the persons that - that would be involved in the due diligence mainly in preparation of the transactions for submissions to the committee.    So the - I would say three distinct phases.  It involves getting different expertise from the various people in the unit.  So one person would for instance be marketing expertise.  One would be the technical expertise.  One would be the financial.  So - and then there are various other units that are involved in the due diligence. So for example the - the Environmental Unit which goes on to check the environmental compliance of the client.  Then the other would be the Legal Department which will review the legal aspects of the transaction.  Then you also have the - the fixed assets valuation unit which would value the assets. So - so all those people will be assembled for a specific transaction and - and should it be assessed as readily passing for due diligence.  That is the team that will go to the client and do a due diligence on that client.    So the next phase is that each - each member would - would compile his report and the deal maker would - and the team leader in that unit would be appointed and the team leader would - would compile the assessment which is the submission now that should be serving at the committee from all the various members and that assessment - that submission report would then be sent to - to the Risk Management Department which would do an independent assessment of that submission and then they - they will raise various issues that they might have with the transaction and then there would be a to and from with the units where they - they try to address some of the risks that are raised by the risk management department and - and then post that if it is still proceeding meaning if adequate measures are included in the submission  to deal with some of those risks. It may be ready for - for submission to the Credit Committees.    Yes depending on the amount that is requested it will go to various committees all the way up to board committees depending on the requested amount.  If it is approved by that committee that is a final decision.    Huh-uh, huh-uh.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh, huh-uh.    Yes and - and the head of the unit must also sign off on the report …   And the - the executive responsible must also sign off on that report depending on the level.    Huh-uh.    Yes, yes.  We try to do that.    Okay.  So - so after a decision is made it does happen sometimes that various amendment to the approved transactions are requested.  So that committee is mandated to - to deal with those amendments.  It is - it is composed of four executives which all the time one of them would be the executive in which the - the application comes from and so each member of that committee assesses the request.  It is not a committee that - that sits and discusses.  So the submission is sent electronically to each member and they assess the request and they either agree an approval or not of the requested change.    Yes.  So - so the committee was formed specifically for that purpose.    That we may deal speedily with a requests that come from the client.  So - so - and hence it is - it is electronic.    It - it goes at the same time to - to all the members, ja.    I - I do not have the average time but each member tries to process it as and when they receive it.    Okay.    Huh-uh.    So he says   Sorry.    So it is from Edward Komane.  It is to Billy.    Billy Cobbinah.    May, the 17 t h 2016.    It says   Edward Komane.    Mr Billy Cobbinah is - was an employee of the IDC employed in the Development Funds Unit within the IDC.    That was sent on 17 May 2016.    That is correct.    “Can you do this deal fast for a potential client?  I have asked for the audited financial statements.”    Yes.    No Chairperson.   That is where apparently Ms Edward Komane works.  It is - it is the Economic Development Department …    But it is not of the IDC.    It is not a unit of the IDC.    It is outside.    Huh-uh.    That is what the email says yes Chairperson.    That is correct.   Yes Chairman. He was employed by the IDC in one of our units called Development Funds Department.    I - I …   I think it was a Senior Accountant Manager.    It says business plan 2016.    A the top it has got EML Energy.    No.    Yes.    It says   So - so remember I referred to the Pre Investment Business Centre.  So a business plan like this would have gone to - to that centre for evaluation before it goes to the business unit.    You mean in any of the people you have mentioned so far?    At - at the pre business centre …    It would have been none of these people so far.    Okay.    That is correct.    6 February 2017.    I was not involved here.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No, I was not there.    This is a funding request by EML.    Yes.  I see that.  So - okay.    This is what was requested.  What was approved it is on the following page.    The decision.    So the facility was for working capital.  That was for six million that was requested to be funded under the MSEP program which the IDC manages.    Okay.    It says   Yes, yes.    Yes.  These will be monthly payments.    Yes, yes.    Which is 42 months.  Sorry.    Within the 42 months.    The 42 months, yes.    So that was   Five years.    Yes Chairperson.    That is correct.    Yes.     So the term of the loan facility would start from 2021 in terms of repayments.  It will start from 2021, 22, 2023, 2024 so it doesn’t start from February 2017, the repayments thereof, only start from 2021.     Yes so from the date of approval until 2021 there are no cash sweeps.     So repayments would only occur if there’s cash but contractually the client is obliged to start repaying fro 2021.     Yes.      Yes.     Yes that’s correct.     So it’s a guarantee facility of R62million to Total South Africa and R3million to Engen Africa for jet A-1 relating to the SAA contract, the facility will have a term of 12 months.     That’s correct.     So MCEP is the programme of the Department of Trade and Industry for which some of it’s funds are managed by the IDC, the IDC’s Development Funds Department is a custodian of the MCEP programme within the IDC and it assesses applications for funding from the MCEP programme prior to these applications being submitted to the various IDC Committees for approval.  I’m informed that MCEP is aimed at assisting, manufacturing of value adding companies that need funding for working capital or companies with at least 51% BEE shareholding that need capital equipment.  MCEP is priced at a rate of 4% fixed for four years for working capital and seven years for capital equipment among other criteria.  MCEP is not available for start up companies, MCEP is only applicable to manufacturers under standard industry classification code 3…[intervenes].     That’s right.     It is.     So this client was priced at prime plus three.     That’s correct – no, no it was 4% but if there was no MCEP it would have been prime plus three.     No it was not it was priced at 13.8%.     No this is a different – this is a real after tax return it’s not linked to prime.     So for every facility whether it qualifies for MCEP or not, we calculate what the IDC pricing would have been had it not qualified.  So for this client it would have been prime plus 3%.     No I don’t Chair.       So it’s in the schedule that we [indistinct] yes Chair, around 10%.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Yes.     It says, “Only applicable to manufacturers under standard industry code classification code 3”.     So the MCEP programme has various codes, so this should actually be level 3, so level 3 will have many sub-categories under it according – classifying it industry according to where it comes from, if it’s under 3 there will be various industries falling under 3.     I stand under correction but I think this is a universally used industry classification code.     I think so, but MCEP has its own codes, has its own classification which are not grouped according to this one.     Yes I’ve got them here.     Okay.     So the one I’ve got here, it says the DTI, SIC codes Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement programme MCEP, then it lists standard industry code level 3 and then under level 3 it lists various industries starting from 301 all the way to 395.     Okay.     That’s correct.     It was done by Mr Billy Cobina.     So in paragraph c) I say, “Subsequent to my meeting with the Commission’s legal team above and for purposes of preparing this affidavit, I received – I interviewed the IDC’s Mr Billy Cobina who pre-assessed the EML transaction to determine whether it qualifies for MCEP.  He indicated that he approved and recommended the transaction for MCEP on the understanding that EML will, as part of it’s operations, be involved in blending and value adding on some of it’s products”.     So this is a submission to the special Treasury Committee.     Thanks correct.     So this document is a basis on which funding decision is made it contains the requirement of the client, it tells what facilities are required, it describes the business, what it’s going to do, it describes the industry, it summarises the due diligence that was done and based on that it recommends to the Committee that the facilities be approved.     So it was indicated in the submission that Denel had donated a fuel farm to the client, that is the premises on which the client was conducting its business.     So it says, “EML had later revalued their assets using an independent valuer to [indistinct] R14.3million, however the assets were valued by the IDC’s evaluations department at R7.4million”.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     “It has been established that there are three finalists for the tender, the budgets have been set-up in a manner where it has been assumed that EML will be awarded a third of the full tender as per discussions with SAA to remain prudent within the budget as the allocation of the tender has not yet been provided should a larger amount of the tender be awarded this will increase sales and nett profit further”.    Yes that is correct.    Sorry the question is?    Yes.    So the tender had not been approved at that stage it was still adjudication.    So in the submission the team says they in doing their marketing due diligence they interviewed SAA and SAA at that stage informed them three bidders had been short listed and one of them was EML.  And they also informed them that maybe the allocation would be equally among the three.  So the team had to make assumptions in doing their financial model therefore they took the 20% of litres that was earmarked for BBBE suppliers and divided it equally among the three short listed bidders  S&S Dimension to do the financial model.      Yes sometimes it does happen that when a client comes it is still bidding but the tender requirements for example would be such that when it is awarded it need to buy certain equipment.  Therefore clients would come to us and say I have bid for this thing the requirements that I will need working capital.  The requirements that I will need to prove that I have financial means to buy in this case the jet fuel from the suppliers.  Therefore we would adjudicate that but as a condition of our approval would be that the disbursements or the facilities can only be done once confirmation of the tender has been awarded so it does happen.    So in conducting the marketing due diligence the team indicates that it wanted to verify the assertions that the client had made.  So the client had said I have put a bid for this tender at SAA therefore as part of DD the client wanted to verify that and ascertain the fuel requirements from SAA and ascertain what the client was saying with regards to the allocation for BEE suppliers.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    So in Vimal’s affidavit he does indicate I just cannot recall the name now.    Yes.    Yes it does ring a bell ja.    No I do not.    Yes in our risk report we did raise that risk that there is a risk that this tender might not be approved.  So it was a concern.    So what is customary is to verify the assertions made by the client.  I do not know to what extent in this case the client revealed the tender processes.  So in his affidavit he indicates that before the client could talk it was required that a non-disclosure agreement be signed.    Vimal.    Yes Mr Rama that a non-disclosure agreement be signed so that confidential information regarding this process may not be disclosed.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    That is correct.    It could.    No.    That is correct.    So condition number 1 …    Okay.    Okay so you would remember three facilities were approved which is the working capital facility, the subordinated loan facility for equipment and the guarantees.  So these conditions for the loan for the subordinated loan and for the guarantee.  So there are conditions precedent for all the facilities that were approved.    So the second one says there must be a signed offtake agreement between EML Engineers and Construction and South African Airways with the terms to IDC satisfaction.    It is because it is a key basis on which the funding application was made.    So it is the risk you have just raised that it may happen that the client is awarded fewer litres than the one that are modelled which would mean based on those litres the client cannot afford to repay the facilities.  So IDC needed to be happy with the allocation that the client had got before it could proceed with the transaction.    Yes.    No, no remember I indicated that when the submission has been compiled by the business unit it is then sent to the risk department to assess the application.  Then the risk department writes a report of that assessment and it attaches to the submission to the credit committee.    So this is the risk report produced by [indistinct].    Yes.    So the risk says the tender was issued for a period of three years however based on discussions with SAA the tender may be extended for five years.  The risk remains that the tender may not be awarded for five years resulting in a mismatch between the IDC loan tender and the awarded tender.  Furthermore should the tender be awarded for five years it may expose the IDC to financial loss as the tender may be challenged by any other bidder and could be rendered unenforceable in terms of the PFMA.  This will expose the IDC.    Yes,    That is correct.    Okay so – so at this stage when the decision is made it is not known how many litres a client has got and the allocation. So – so the modelling is based on a five year period since the facilities are five years but the tender is for three years so when the tender is eventually awarded it will then have the exact allocation of – of the litres that are given to the client and based on that allocation then the IDC would determine if it proceeds with the facility or not.    So – so remember the – the main facilities that are granted for – for purchase of fuel is the guarantee.  So – so that one is modelled for twelve months.  It is a short term facility.  Then there are two other facilities.  One is for working capital, one is for equipment.  Now what is normal is the equipment you would model it along the lifetime of the – of the equipment because those facilities are secured by the underlying assets.  So those are the [indistinct] that were taken into account in doing that.    The working capital loan was for four years.  So in the submission the team indicates that should their client allocation be for three years the remaining facility at that point in time would be minimal therefore the IDC took a view on risk on that – that remaining facilities could be serviced by other revenues other than the SAA contract.  Because the client was already trading.    Okay I will get it – I will give it to you.    Okay.    Yes ideally we should merge the funding.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.     So working capital loan client qualifies under EMSEP alternate pricing equal prime plus 3 using decisions [indistinct].    Okay.    Yes.    No I can only think of reference to value adding part.    Yes, yes.    Yes that is correct.    It would not but there was reference to value adding.    Yes.    Okay.  Can I refer to [indistinct – not speaking into microphone]    Okay.    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    It does not say but the only one I could see that refers to petroleum is code 332 petroleum and synthesises.    Yes.    Yes, yes, yes.    It is me looking at the codes.  Because – so if you look at that codes 332 it also has sub-codes between under it which I have indicated there but the submission and he did not indicate which of those particular codes applied to this.    No it does not say so on the application.    Because the sub-codes talk to the crude petroleum.    The sub-codes that I have referred to talk to crude petroleum.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    No.    So in my supplementary affidavit this is a point that I am referring to.    Okay.      Yes, yes, yes.    That is right.    That is correct.    So I wanted to clarify that – that confirmation from the DTI was referring to a different transaction.  Because the IDC was considering a different transaction and it requested confirmation from EMSEP – from DTI whether that would apply.  So the response in that email was confirming that it would not apply.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes I agree.    Yes he is the one who did the assessment.  Usually the team would also motivate during the meeting as to why it deems it qualifying.    I cannot confirm I was not there.  I do not know anything.    Yes.    I cannot confirm if there discussions on that or not.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Not at this stage.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    So during the discussions with the legal team it - it was identified that there was an error in the cash flow.    Ja.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.  So these are the cash flow projections derived from the financial model.  They are used to determine the repayment - the ability to repay the facility.    Ja.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    That is correct.    So 5-7-6 its “EML Energy Consolidated Cash Flow Statements for the Year Ending 28 February”.    Thousands.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    No.  That is 47 000.    47 000.    Hm.    That is right.    Yes.    That is a working capital facility that was approved.  The six million.    That is correct.    Okay, yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    So that - that is a peak period.  It is a period when the full facilities would have been disbursed.    So - so it is coming earlier but it reaches six million in 2017.    Yes, yes, yes.    Hm.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is right.    So those are the repayments.    Of the loan (intervenes).    Huh-uh.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    So that is the interest.  So the first line was just showing the capital.  Now there is a - the four percent interest.    That is correct.    That is right.    That is correct.    That is right.    That was a 6.5 million facility for equipment.    It is the 13.8 percent real after tax return.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Again it signifies that it is fully disbursed at that time.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    The capital portion?    Yes.    So that is the interest on that facility because it is not priced like the first one.    So the first one incurs interest as time goes.  That is why the repayments start when it is disbursed.  This other one is priced like an equity instrument.  So the return on it is achieved at the end.  That is why it is referred to as a bullet facility at the end.    Yes.  So we start collecting the capital first …    And then the return is collected later.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Hm.    So you will recall that the client said it had got equipment donated to it by Denel of 40 million and - and we valued it at seven million ourselves.  So - so that donation is reflected as income in the hands of the client but it is asset.  It is not cash. So when we do the cash flow statements we must take it out because the client did not receive cash.  It just received assets.    So - so in - in this cash flow statement the - the income should have been reduced by the value of that donation to take it out …    And that is the error that happened.  It was not adjusted out.    So the - the adjustment is about to - to add back that income.  I think it will be around 6.903.    Yes, yes.    Chair, I - I think an error like this should not happen.    So - so …    Sorry.  Sorry, sorry Chairperson.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes Chairperson.  I was saying it is regrettable that this error was not picked by all the processes …   Including the peer review processes.    Huh-uh.    Yes, yes Chairperson.  The - the amount should have been added back.  I do not know how it was missed.  It should have been added back …    Because it was not a cash receipt.  It was an asset receipt.    Hm.    Yes Chairperson.    No, no, no.  I - I have engaged with the team that prepared the financial model and I also showed them this error.  They indicated to me this was a genuine error in the assessment.  I - I did not get the impression that it was done intentionally when I - when I interviewed them. I interviewed both the financial specialist and the head of the department and - and hence I requested them to - to do another calculation.  To say had this error not been done what would have been the impact on the cash flows?    I think it was around May when I had interviews with you.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Chairperson when - when the Commission pointed this to me they wanted to know whether the business would have been viable should this error not have been done.  Hence I request this to be redone.    Yes.  I am saying the facilities the - the working capital - the first one - would - would still be repaid in 21 but the - the “Mezzanine” one facility would be repayable a year later than was anticipated.    Huh-uh.    Yes, yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes, yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.  Oh, so - so Chairperson remember the terms of the - of the equipment facility are that you only deduct payments such that there is cash available of a million.  So when you repay the client must remain with a million.  So if - if every year when we test the model we find that should we ask for repayment the client would have a million less. There is no repayment due in that date.  So - so because of this error which had shown that the client was having more cash than it had.  The - the team modelled repayments earlier than the terms of the facilities.  The terms of the facilities say that the repayments must start in 2021 but because it was showing an erroneous cash they were starting earlier than the terms of the facilities. So - so as per agreement - as per agreed on the credit approval the repayments must start from 2021 to 2024 but they started earlier because of this cash.  So when we correct this adjustment we - we start sweeping with the terms of the facilities from 2021.  So the terms of the facilities said the client must have repaid by 2024 as per agreement but on the restated model it repays by 2025.  That is what I mean when I am saying it repays a letter than the first model.    Hm.    I am there.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, yes.    I - I looked at that Chairperson.  So -     So - so it was contradictory to me.    Hence I looked at the actual agreement.  The actual agreement does actually correct that.  So it is not 2018.  It is 2021 in terms of repayment on the actual subordinated agreement with the client.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  The facility was only supposed to start from 2021.    Huh-uh.    I think it refers to the repayment period - the five years.    Yes because this is an equity instrument.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    That is correct.    Ja, ja.    That is correct.     That is correct.    Yes Chairperson.  We - we model what the client can afford.  Sometimes because the cash flows are smaller in the beginning.  We give clients a moratorium.  So …    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Hence - hence you can see the return on this facility is …    Much higher to compensate for that period.    That we give them a holiday for.    Yes.    That is right.  That is correct.    Yes that is correct.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes, yes.  That is correct because the - the subordinated facilities are treated as an equity instrument.  So the return on them is - is much higher.    Delayed.  Hence the period is longer.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Oh yes, yes.  So we - we assign capital in terms of how much we can provide under these facilities and whether the other facilities do compensate for them because we have many facilities.  Others are repaying during the period of moratorium that we grant to other facilities.    Yes.    Okay Chairperson.  Thanks.  So I would not say …    No, no, no I am sure.    I can explain it to you.  So it is not a punishment …    It is not a punishment to the client …    But it is an assistance to the client because the type of clients that we fund some of them are struggling.    So in the earlier periods they are not able to pay but over time they get more contracts the business survives, so we give this facility as if the IDC is investing in the business but because we are suspending our cash flows the clients must compensate us for that in the end.  So – and also these facilities are subordinated, meaning other creditors are paid first that the IDC, so there’s more risks to the IDC hence we say the client at the end, when the business is viable and making money they must compensate us for that risk that we’re taking so that we can plough it back and fund other clients with the return that we get but as is in this case we model it such that we are only able to get that money if the client’s business succeeds as well.  So should the client fail other creditors will be paid first then the IDC that is the assistance we are giving to the client, I don’t see it as a punishment.     We try to achieve both.     We try to be compensated for the longer period and we try to be compensated for the riskiness of the facility.     Yes     That’s right.     That’s right.     Yes Chairperson for this I just wanted to only adjust for the impact of the error, I didn’t want to adjust for anything else.     Yes, so I didn’t correct those other repayments that were repayable as per that facility and I didn’t change any figure other than to correct the error.     Yes that’s correct.     Yes that’s correct.      So you want us to show what the interest would have been had it not qualified for MCEP?     Okay yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So Chairperson the IDC being involved with this client was not seeing it as it will only fund it for that period of three years and exit.  We raise the risk of the client having one contract and in mitigation of that the client indicated that it was working on other contract and as we’ll see later the client was able to attain other contracts.  So although for this loan the primary source of repayment was a SAA contract the IDC was seeing it as helping it to be sustainable to be able to bid for other contracts hence we were investing in the client, getting sufficient equipment to not only get the SAA contract but to be able to bid for other contracts and for the point you are raising there is a risk in that, in that the client may not get those and again to the point you’re raising it is why those other facilities are marked at a higher rate because the IDC carries more risk but we do set up clients like that with an initial contract and we push them to find other revenues so that the business doesn’t end on completion of that contract.  So that’s why we were prepared to take the risk to put the client, since we’ve invested a lot in the equipment the client was having which had a lifespan extending more than five years.     So that is a risk we are in as a Development Finance Institution, sometimes clients are not able to get other contract, sometimes the businesses close, sometimes they get other contracts, sometimes it does happen that we suffer losses and they cannot repay our facilities.     Yes Chairperson and thanks for that question.  It is a difficult space that we find ourselves in because on the other hand we have to play that role of assisting new entrants in the industry and we try our best to estimate on a balance of probabilities that the client has a reasonable prospect of getting that tender but we must always remember that our funding only flows on him getting the tender.  So we won’t give him money until he gets it but then we also try to do a pre-assessment of the ability of the client, so if somebody who’s never been involved in this business come to IDC and say I’ve bid for this fund me and we will ask questions.  Do you understand the industry, are you in this industry?  So in this particular client what the submission says, it says that, this particular client had been in existence for ten years and as we know most of the clients we fund, the small businesses fail within their first year.  So this one at least as per application had been there for ten years, it is in this industry but the client  is coming to us and saying, I’ve been doing this on a piecemeal I don’t have the right equipment to be able to bid for bigger businesses and for me to bid for SAA it requires me to have this licensing regime, it requires me to have this equipment but then on that basis we assess, we say at least this client has survived for ten years in this business we can take some risk on him that he will be there even post the SAA tender because of his previous record, so…[intervenes].     Looking at the track record, so – and it’s not always the case Chairperson in other difficult sectors we have to still try to facilitate, especially the entrants of new black people, sometimes they just have the technical knowhow and then they don’t have the equipment so we also give them business support.  So as you’ll see later on in this client we said he must go for corporate governance training, we gave him support in terms of appointing a financial manager, we assisted him with a financial support.  So in addition to the funding we try to give them non-funding support so that they survive post that client but it is a risk that things don’t always happen as we planned.    Correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    R1.1 million.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    No because the amount of cash available is more or less equal to the outstanding balance then.  Because there is R1.1 outstanding and then there is a balance of cash of R1.1.    That is correct.    That is right.    Yes that is beyond the actual contract.    Yes that is correct.    So in the submission the team indicates that it has grown the projections by the inflation rate beyond the contract among other assumptions.    So they assumed in this one like they indicate that the submission would be for five years and they also assumed that the client will get other contracts on termination of the SAA contract.    No not really contracts from different other suppliers not necessarily of a similar value.    Or more or less.    Yes.    Yes so that they start at the base and put some growth assumptions on the company and they indicate in the submissions which other prospect that the client was pursuing and they model assumptions based on that.    Correct.    That is correct.    Yes.  So in one of the correspondence and also in the investigation that we will talk about it does draw reference to that.    That was indicated in the submission.    So I would understand that the client does not just simply take and put he does something so in the submission there is a quantification of what that value add amount to but I do not know if it is sufficient to qualify for EMSEP purposes.    No I would not think that is value add.    I do.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    So around the 26 July the basics and chemicals team requested an amendment to the approval of the conditions set by the special grade committee.  Amendments that are requested by transaction teams are presented in the form or a memorandum addressed to the post investment committee which is comprised of the divisional executive directly responsible for the transaction.  The divisional executive responsible for transaction support and post investment management.  The Chief Risk officer and the general council.  The post investment committee abbreviated PIC does not usually sit as a committee and does not have a chairperson as each member considers the requested amendment independently and indicates his or approval or objection.    I do not recall exactly.    So some members could have approved it on the same day, some a day or two later.    No.    Yes I agree.    Okay.    So the decision was to agree to the requested amendment that instead of the SAA contract the SAA Ex contract would be used at the offtake. That is [indistinct].    Correct.    Okay. File C.    So it is a memorandum addressed to the post investment committee.  It is from the basics and speciality chemicals business unit.  Its reference it is for EML Engineering and Construction.      Yes.  Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    It is requested that the IDC consent to change NCP to allow EML to draw funding based on the SA Ex award letter.    It is requested that the first drawdown be changed from 6 August 2017 to 30 September 2017.    That is correct.    Yes it is.    No.  So this memorandum is requesting the change from SAA to SA Express and in support for that it is indicating that here is an award letter from SA Express. So – so I think if we – if we go to page 632.    That is the page back.  So I think that paragraph after item 3.  So which says as part of the approval process condition precedent 6.1.7 of the guarantee facility was for EML to obtain a signed offtake agreement from SAA Limited.  So it is that condition that is requested being changed.    So it remains a CP but instead of the contract being SAA the contract become SA Express.  So – so if you read item number 4 it does not mean that on award payment will happen because the CP will now read we must get an offtake from SA Express.  It is not saying based on this letter we can pay.  It is saying based on this letter can we change the condition.    Yes. Yes that is how I understood it.    Yes, yes, yes.  No I can understand but in support of what I am saying it is factual that upon this change being made the client started requesting payment and our teams and legal team said no we cannot pay you we still  need the contract first.  So that is my understanding it is just changing the condition.  Disbursements could not happen on the basis of this letter.    Yes at that point and it is not there – the agreement.    There is only the award letter.    That is right.    Yes.    Yes this is the one that was attached to this memorandum.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes I spoke to the legal team they indicated that they did review the contract.    No they did not.    Yes, yes there is no second due diligence in the sense of restarting the process but they still requested to do diligence on the terms that have changed.    So with regard to that the team indicated in the submission that based on these litres then they redid the financial models that we have been discussing and then re-verified the supporting prices to those litres to test if the client would be able to make sustainable income from this new contract.  So that is the extent of the interrogation that they did in checking that what the client bid was supported by reasonable prices from the suppliers and then they use those litres to do a new model and based on that they indicated in the memorandum that based on the model the client would still be able to afford the facilities that were granted.    It is a risk that is always there in the current environment so hence the legal scrutiny must do reasonable processes.    To satisfy itself that the contract that is presented to them is valid and that is the line between doing forensic process on the contract versus doing reasonable measures to check what you getting could be from a reliable institution.    So we have to think about the risk of fraud when we do that.    No I did not know it.    No it did not.    Hm.    Yes I do.    I have.    That invoice related to a fee for consulting services that was invoiced by an entity called Mamela Property Trust to EML.    So it was alleged that Mamela Property Trust had assisted the client in compiling its business plan and getting funding from the IDC.    Yes.    Correct.   It is addressed to EML Engineers and Construction.  It says - it is from Mamela Property Trust.    3 July 2017.    It is Eddie Komane.    Yes.  That is correct.  He is the one who referred the business plan to - to Mr Billy Cobbinah.    That is correct.    It says scope of work facilitation or raising of funding from the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa.    So this - this invoice never featured in any of the funding requests that were made by the client.  So it became apparent to the IDC only at the time when the client was requesting disbursements from the IDC.  At that point in time when a client requests disbursements we request that they include supporting documentation as to what the money will be spent on. So as you will see in - in Mr Rama’s testimony he indicates that at that time among the invoices submitted by the client was this invoice at which point he says he indicated to the client that this will not be paid from the IDC because at no point in time was the IDC made aware that there is these services and the IDC did not budget for this service. Therefore he indicated to the client that this invoice must not be paid by the IDC.  So then the client submitted invoices excluding this one which is for equipment and working capital.    Okay.  So - so the client …    Yes, yes.    Yes.  That is correct because (intervenes).    Yes, yes.    So - so for - for approved expenses it is normal.  Remember Chairperson so we gave the client 6.5 million and on that he says I am going to buy this equipment.  I am going to buy this vehicle.  I am going to pay these salaries.  So - so before we pay the client must give us those invoices that he has received from the sellers of that equipment.    So we can justify giving him money.  So - so we are saying in that pack of invoices he included this one but then we said this thing is not part of what we know to be your funding requirement.    Exactly, exactly.  So it shall not be paid from the money from the IDC because at no point did you tell us that there is a - there is a consultant that is helping you to do the business plan.    Yes Chair but - but we - the - as per (indistinct) he had to make it clear to the client that none of our money should be utilised to pay for this client - for this invoice.    Correct Chair.    Oh, oh, oh.    I understand …    Your problem.  So we will see later …    Because later we discover that despite us saying do not pay this the client went on to proceed to pay this invoice.    Yes, yes.    So - so then - he then shows us a contract between him and Mamela Property Trust and then in that contract it says Mamela had - had indicated that part of the funding request would include the services that he rendered.  So - so it is the reason that EML was sending this invoice. He says Mamela had indicated that it will be part of the funding requirements.  Which is a point we were saying no it is not.  We are not going to pay it.    No I think he should have gone further Chair. He should have even elevated this matter …    To the IDC and …    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    That is correct.  That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.  Up to this point in time all the approval committees have never been made aware …    That there is a facilitation.    Exactly.  We will never pay that Chair.    Hm.    Okay.  So - so in terms of our processes after we have paid the client the money then after some period once he has bought the - the items he needed.  We go and do a verification that indeed …    Yes.    We go to the client now and say did - where is the equipment that you bought and everything.  So it is at that point that we discovered that he actually utilised some of the money that we had indicated to pay this invoice.    Hm.    Yes, yes.  So then at that point in time be - because the team had changed that did the initial application.  So Mr Rama was no longer part of the team.  A new team went in and as they do the audit they discovered that this payment has been made and - and then they take the client on as to why did you pay this because in our budgets we do not see an expense item like this. Then - then the client says I had to pay this because I had entered into an agreement with this Mamela Property Trust that would help me to compile my business plan and the client now indicates that because Mamela is aware that the funds have been paid therefor it demanded its payment and the client says in an email addressed to the team it says it felt it had to pay this invoice. It is then that the matter was reported back to the - to the IDC because until that audit we did not know that the - the client had utilised some of our money to pay for this.    So we became aware of this around 4 May 2018 as the Credit Committee.    Yes, yes.  That is a date when an application is made for further funding.    That is correct.    That is correct.  That is correct.    Yes, yes.  Now on - on 4 May it - it is at this point that the Credit Committee becomes aware because now the time must submit the new funding request from the client and they must also explain how the other money was utilised.  So on 4 May they report back to the team why the client needs more money now. Among other things the contract had not started yet and the client had bought the equipment in anticipation of this and the client had paid salaries and now it was running out of working capital and we said no but how did you use the money that we gave you and then it - it is at that point that the team reports back that among other things that were paid were - were for - for this business plan. So - so at - at this stage if - if I recall it was reported to the committee that an amount had been paid for helping the client to do the business plan.  So at the committee it was not reported in this manner as a facilitation.  It was reported as a legitimate expense incurred to assist the client but then we said we did not budget for this and - and - so - so Chairperson sometimes our clients do use people to help them compile the business plan but our condition is that it must be made known to the IDC the scope of services to be provided. So - so the Credit Committee took issue with this matter that okay provided the client helped you with the business plan but you should have alerted the IDC that there is this service provider as well and we would have needed to assess if it is legitimate because the team indicated that in all their processes up to this point in time they had not seen any consultant doing their - their work. So when this was tabled to the Credit Committee we did not approve it at that point because we were not happy with this.  We sent the team back to obtain further clarifications from the client as to - as to how it is going to remedy this and - and at that point in time there were other breaches that the client had - had done on the facilities. So the Credit Committee did not approve the application at that point in time pending resolution of those issues.    Initially declined it …    And then they sent them back …    And then they came back on 18 May.    Yes.  So on 18 May the - the issues that were raised by the committee were tabled and the client indicated how it addressed them.  Now the - the IDC is - is at a point now where it had disbursed these facilities the 12.5 million and - and the client indicates that the - the contract from SA Express has not yet materialised and then in the meantime it had bought the equipment and it had obtained the compliances that it required that were budgeted for but now it had run out of funds …    And then the client indicated at that point in time that it - it had received two new contracts.  One was from an entity called Fly Africa and one was from GAAL the airport in Polokwane and then it requested funds to - to serve those contracts.    Then the committee requested to know the client how is it going to pay back this money that it had paid for - for facilitation fees and at that point the client - sorry before that.  A letter of breach was sent to the client indicating our displeasure with what had happened with the facilities and requested how it is going to remedy that situation and the team indicated in their responses that the client indicated that the - the funds would be reimbursed from the proceeds of a - of a grant I think it was expecting from the other suppliers and then we put a condition as a committee because it is not the - the 1.5 that was paid. I think 1.1 million was paid.  So the committee indicated to the client at that point in time that it - it may not pay any further monies for any services related to - to this point in time and then it is then on - on the strength of those contracts that were provided to the IDC and - and in view of the equipment that had already been spent on the facilities that the - the committee approved that application.    I - I do not recall what it said.  I think among other things it indicated that IDC released the guarantees late as a reason to justify and then it could not provide the guarantees to the oil companies.  Therefore it could not order fuel.  That is what was indicated in the submission.    I think so among other things …    That should have been done.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes but - but - that is right and then you must recall this funding that was approved was suspended.    In May.    So - so when we became aware of that.    We suspended it …    Immediately.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    So the steps what are taken was the breach that was communicated to the client in terms of indicating that the IDC at that point in time may call the facilities if those breaches are not remedied and then - so at - at that point in time the committee - these - these issues that you are raising were raised in our risk report that we did as you would see in my affidavit.  The fact that the - sorry I am on page 10.   So on page in our assessment of the situation we did indicate that the client had failed to meet the condition regarding the off take contract.  There was no off take contract from Fly Africa.  The SA Express contract that you indicated had not - had not materialised and been implemented at that point in time. So - so these matters that you are raising were - were debated at the committee.  Now the question was what do we then do with the facilities that have already been approved by the client.  Now at that point in time two things could happen Chairperson.  So one we can call the facilities. Take the security and close the business or two we can review the client what it says it is going to do to remedy these breaches that have risen and three we consider the facilities that we have disbursed.  Are they - are they collateral?  Are they supported by hard core assets? So - so those - those are the two issues that often arise when clients do not - do not respect our - our agreements.  We reach a point where we have to close down the business.  So - so the - the committee was confronted with that.  Does it close down the business and sell the equipment or does it request a remedial plan and based on the remedial plan that the client had indicated. Being indication that it had obtained further contracts.  Being indication that it had obtained additional financial support I think from - from Total or Engen one of the other guys and then it - it indicated that it had obtained the - the JIG accreditation which we paid over - I think - over a million to get that accreditation by other international operators so it can be able to - to supply fuel and - and whether we - we close down and the fact that at that point in time the client was employing about five people and - and the division of closing down would be those jobs lost. So - so those are the issues that the committee had to contend with versus these breaches from the client and - and given those two indications the committee decided to - to support the client further to avoid closure of the business.    So - so Chairperson to my collection this fact that this was - this facilitation fee only came to the IDC when we did the investigation to - to the people but - but when …    No you not - you not incorrect.  I am saying when it was reported to the Credit Committee it was not reported in this fashion that it was a facilitation.  They said the client had paid a consultant who helped them to do the business plan at that point in time.  The committee had not seen this invoice.  The - the matter was reported to the Credit Committee.    Yes at the - it was not presented there.     Yes Chairperson when we investigated this the client sent a long email to the IDC, it is just that I don’t have it now which indicated to the IDC what services this Mamela Property Trust is alleged to have performed.     You would recall Chairperson in the beginning we – the advocate referred to a business plan ...(intervention)      (Indistinct)      Yes, I was ...(intervention)      I was saying that business plan that advocate referred to earlier in the beginning it was among other things that are alleged to have been done by this Mamela Property Trust in return for this.     So Chairperson I think perhaps as the Advocate proceeds it will become clearer what happened.     Because we were asking the same question in the committee, what has exactly this person done to deserve these things.     So indeed Chairperson the credit committee that initially rejected this application was very displeased with this and it is especially for that reason that it said a letter of breach must be issued to the client and it is for that reason that they sent the team back to the client to obtain explanations as to exactly what happened, so I fully agree with you, we were not happy with what has happened here Chairperson.     It did.     It is it is.     It was a concern Advocate, also what was a concern was the money that we had already incurred on the client, we had to recover that money.     Yes, okay, okay, so the relevant – it says however on 27 May, remember this facility was approved on 18 May so on 27 May various negative allegations were published in the media regarding EML.  Upon this media allegations being brought to IDC’s attention, and my attention I immediately communicated to the Head of the Basics and Chemical Special Unit that no draw-downs should be allowed on these facilities until all the allegations referred to in the media above have been resolved, and then I have attached proof of that correspondence, so in a sense what happened immediately after we approved we read about these fraud allegations concerning our client, then I told the business unit that they shouldn’t allow any disbursements until we understand the nature of these allegations.  We then engaged S A Express to say we have funded this client, we read about these things in the media, can you tell us what is happening because we will not disburse on these facilities, so at that point in time S A Express indicated to us that they are investigating, they have launched an investigation and then there were several to’s and fro’s between us and S A Express regarding these allegations but to ultimately we never got to disburse these facilities, because we were telling the client that until we get a clearance on the allegations we will not disburse and that is where we are.  We never got to disburse on these facilities, up to this point in time.     I do not remember but I was forwarded with the email correspondence, I think at some point in time it went all the way to the CEO of S A Express.     Yes, yes, we will provide it.     Yes, they said we cannot tell you anything because this matter is currently investigation.     Yes.     I think – it gave me the impression that there was an investigation under way, I don’t know if it was started because of the media or it was already proceeding.     Okay.     No those draw-downs were dependant on contracts being provided to IDC.     The Fly Africa contract.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson did help us because at that point in time we had not disbursed any facility so these allegations when they became apparent to us we realised that we cannot proceed, hence we stopped facilities, so they were crucial in us stopping this decision, because I was not aware at that point in time that there is an investigation currently happening in S A Express.    Yes, for the purchase of the equipment.    Yes, that’s correct, that’s correct.    So Chairperson because we refused to release funds on this facility the client couldn’t supply any other funders and then in fell in breach with our facilities.  What has happened is we have had to perfect security, we have had to go to the Court and we’ve perfected our collateral and so our security that we funded in the vehicles and everything we took it under an order of the Court.    Yes, that’s correct.     Yes Chairperson.    Chairperson when the client came to us he had requested money to purchase ...(intervention)     Equipment which included bowsers, tanks, so these are motor vehicles.    And that is the security which we took as part of our facilities, we registered a general, a special notarial bond over those assets, so meaning we would look to either realise them to recover the money that we spent.    Yes Chairperson we have not realised at this stage but we are holding the security because we have to find the best way to realise it such that the institution does not suffer a loss, so which may include offers from prospective companies who use that equipment or it may include other operators who are able to use that facilities, which we have improved, so we have not disposed of the equipment at this point in time because the perfection of the court I think was granted, I don’t recall the date, we had to go through the court process.    Yes we had to go through the court processes to register that bond.    Yes Chairperson what you are saying is correct and that is what happened in these instances, if we decide to foreclose, it comes at a huge risk to us, that’s why we really have to balance that decision when the client can’t afford to pay our facilities we have to think which is the best way to protect what we have spent, because if we take them back we risk selling them at a far discounted price, now we have to look is there another operator who is in this business, who can use these facilities, therefore sometimes we invite prospective bidders, so we sell the business as a going concern so that we don’t suffer as much loss as we would have suffered if we just disposed them individually in pieces, but the court processes do add another risk to that because we can’t do anything until we get legal right to those assets.    So it is possible Chairperson that ...(intervention)     I did enquire from the team that is handling this what is happening, and they indicated at that stage that there was a prospective offer on the business that is close to what our facilities are but I cannot say anything about that, I haven’t interrogated the offer but you are correct, the risk that we may suffer is there.    Yes.    I was not aware.    Okay, so in our engagements with the Commission it was put to me whether I am aware that Mr Billy Cobbinah is a trustee of this entity called Mamela Property Trust, I then indicated that I am not aware and then, but I will go back and investigate, so when we went back to the office we instructed a forensic investigation into this whole aspect of this transaction, upon becoming aware that Mr Billy Cobbinah is a trustee of this entity which had invoiced us.  Do you want me to proceed?    So then the investigation was concluded and indeed it was confirmed that Mr Billy Cobbinah is a trustee and it was also confirmed that he had not declared this to the IDC, we have a policy that all employees must declare their conflict of interest, we have a conflict of interest register, so he did not declare in any manner in that register that he was a trustee of this thing.  And then furthermore during the investigation Mr Cobbinah confirmed that he received money from Mr Edward Komane.        It was R50 000.    Yes.    I think it was paid in cash.    I understand it was Chairperson.    Okay we will Chair.    That’s correct.    Correct.    That’s correct.    In relation to Mr Cobbinah we instituted a disciplinary hearing, and then on conclusion he was found guilty of the charges that were put to him, being failure to declare, and a breach of our code of conduct in accepting this payment, he was found guilty and it was recommended that he be dismissed, and he has been dismissed and then we reported this matter to the Police as well, we opened a case against him.    So he also indicated that he made a similar offer, him Mr Cobbinah, to Mr Rama that he will also be given R50 000 if he assists in getting these transactions approved.    Yes, he was included as part of the investigation for – first to ascertain the fact whether it is correct, he did also admit that is correct that an offer of an amount was made to him, he does not indicate what the amount was, but he confirmed that this was made and then that was also not reported to the IDC, so we also instituted disciplinary hearings against Mr Rama, and we started the hearings, and then before we could conclude Mr Rama resigned from the IDC, so that disciplinary hearing couldn’t be concluded but also a case against him was reported with the SA Police.    Correct.    Can I comment on that one?    So Chairperson on that one the confirmation from DTI that this is not included came post-approval of the transaction, a year later.  What the team indicated is that in their motivation they anticipated that there would be blending and value add and as part of our processes to approve this transactions we do invite the MCEP people to sit in our credit committee, so at that point when we approve this transaction they were also part of the credit committee, so the committee didn’t take that decision lightly, it was together with the people who are responsible MCEP and at that point in time it was not clear that this particular industry doesn’t qualify for MCEP so it was made clearer by DTI a year later, so I agree, now that we know but at that time we didn’t know that it doesn’t qualify for MCEP.    Yes, EML was not in blending as far it was indicated, so what the team motivated as I understand it, because I was not in that meeting, that that was anticipated to happen later but at that time it was not in blending at all.    No I think he said there was going to be blending.    That’s correct.    Chairperson ...(intervention)     Yes Chairperson.    So I am trying to say I do not know if the team intentionally named a false representation or whether they understood that it would qualify then, so that is what I am trying to say, I do not know if they intentionally made a false representation or they understood it to be value adding at that point in time.    If I am correct in his disciplinary he was still asserting that it qualifies.    That’s correct.    Correct.    Yes Chair that was a written instruction to the client.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair, that’s correct, it was made by the client.    Yes Chairperson, this is 2018 now, when it has become known to the IDC.    Yes, yes.    Yes Chairperson we do report them in our annual report.    Yes Chairperson we have certainly learnt a lot from this experience, first in terms of enhancing our due diligence processes, I think with regard to verifying the contract we could have done more work in that regard.  Also with regards to the review processes on due diligence, I think we need to enhance that process to avoid the reoccurrence of these errors, and we have also looking at all other transactions that we approved involving some of these individuals to identify if there are any other events of a similar nature, and based on those findings we will enhance our processes.    Thank you Chairperson.
