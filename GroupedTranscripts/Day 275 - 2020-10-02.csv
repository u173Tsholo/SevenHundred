CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    You said too many things Mr Notshe.    There is – there is BOSASA Bundle 03.    That has got Mr Frolick’s affidavit according to what you – has been written on the spine it is proposed that what is inside the file would be exhibits – Exhibit what T17.    Which file do you want me to have here?  Is it this one I have or is it another one?    Ja let us…    Let us deal with that one for now.  It is BOSASA Bundle 3.    Ja.    Yes let us – let us – let Counsel for Mr Frolick place himself on record first.  You can do it from where you are.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    yes.    Yes no thank you.    Yes.    Okay make it now so we get it out of the way.    Page 34?    Okay you using the black numbers ha?    Okay.  Yes.    Oh okay, okay.  Okay I think what we will be necessary is later on for Mr Frolick to just do two lines – one line supplementary affidavit to correct that.    Ja okay.    Yes.    He will say so.    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Yes Mr Notshe.  So I then please administer the oath or affirmation?    Thank you very much you may be seated Mr Frolick.    If you agree nodding will not be enough because the recording will not capture that so you need to say yes so that it is recorded.    Yes okay.    Did you say page 8?    Oh.    Mr Notshe I am sorry I am interrupting you.  Do take note that that affidavit is just a condonation affidavit only.    Well why do we need a condonation affidavit?    We have passed that stage is it not?    I thought you would go to his substantive affidavit.  The one where he tells his story.    Where is 17.1?    Oh where will be 17.1?   Is 17.1 meant to the condonation affidavit?    Okay let us…    Well let us – let us do – let us do it even though we do not really need it.  If that is – that is already what is in the index.  But otherwise the condonation thing is something of the past.  We do not need it anymore.  Okay so we start at page 8?    Is there a T before 17?    T17.2    And where is Point 1 – 17.1?    Ja let us – let us do that because now when they prepare the records there will be a problem when they can see 17.2 but they do not know where 17.1 is.  So we may…    Ja but we do not need to do the index to.  I think we should start at 6 where the Notice of Motion starts, is it not?    Why do they do that?      I am not feeling you know happy about the fact that I am now going to admit as an exhibit a condonation affidavit when condonation is not an issue. You know when that has been dealt with sometime back. But I was thinking not to mess up the index maybe we may as well do that but actually the condonation affidavit is irrelevant.    No that is been sorted out.  Ja that has been sorted out.  We do not need it for this.  I condoned it ended there.  You see.    So at this stage we should be looking simply at the substantive issues.    Maybe let us just say – let us say it is okay Exhibit T17.1 is the Notice of Motion.  Is that right?    Ja let us just – so that the index – the pagination is not messed up.  Then the affidavit starting at page 8 will be Exhibit T17.2, is that right?   Okay. That is together with its annexures.    And then when is the – which one would be 17.3?    Mr Frolick’s affidavit that starts at page 31 will be admitted and marked as Exhibit T17.3.    Okay.  What else?    Yes.    65.    Has he confirmed?    It is not stopping or it is?    Oh.  So the transcribers the –    They cannot hear okay.    Mr Frolick what is – what is your attitude to removing it while you are giving evidence?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No I mean from my side and I am sure from the side of everybody one would not mind if you put it on as long as we can hear you and those who are recording are able to hear you.  But if we cannot hear you or those who are recording cannot hear you then we cannot proceed because there needs to be a record.   So – but I – I mean I remember I know what you are talking about.  I know what you are talking about.  I am wondering whether – whether if you raise your voice more whether that might assist.   Okay let us try with him raising his voice more and then we will see whether we can hear in the first place.    And then whether they can hear.    Well I – I do not want you to feel uncomfortable but I am – that is why I was just saying if – the bottom line is that we must hear you.  I know that sometimes I do not know whether certain masks enable people to be heard even if they have them on but others you cannot hear them.  Okay no that is alright then.  Okay.  Thank you.    Mr Frolick’s affidavit that starts at page 54 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit T17.4.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Yes.    Exhibit T17.?    6.    Okay.  Yes.    Yes.    Exhibit T17.5.  Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Where are those two – are they here?    Ja.    Oh.    Okay.  Okay.  Okay that is alright so…    ja.    Okay so you will raise the…    Later on ja okay alright.    Mr – I am sorry Mr Notshe it might be good for the purposes of those who are listening or watching to first give a brief background to Mr Frolick’s evidence because it starts with Mr Agrizzi giving certain evidence relating to him. So that people can follow as you put questions to him.  The gist of what Mr Agrizzi said in implicating him.    No I am sorry Mr Notshe.  I think the – I think the story starts with Mr Agrizzi saying BOSASA had certain challenges.   There was negative publicity about them and their contracts with the Department of Correctional Services and they had sought to – they had been trying to have meetings with Mr Smith who was Chairperson of the Correctional Services Portfolio Committee in Parliament at the time and Mr Smith was not positive towards them – had a negative attitude towards them.   They were not getting an appointment with him and then at a certain stage I think he says Mr Cheeky Watson or Mr Gavin Watson told you that – told him about Mr Frolick and then bla, bla, bla.    Ja so I think that is how it starts then you can continue.    Ja.    Yes I think – I think the gist of it is that Mr Agrizzi said Mr Frolick facilitated their access to Mr Vincent Smith after Mr Vincent Smith had not been agreeing to see them and he said Mr Frolick facilitated that after he had been given some money by BOSASA.    Ja okay alright.  So I just wanted to make sure that …    Because some of his evidence was led some time back.    To – why – who would be listening they can see where it fits in.    Ja.     Ja.  Okay.     Hang on one second.  Maybe let us start... Mr Frolick, you are a member of parliament, is that right?     When did you become a member of parliament for the first time?     1999.  And you are a resident in the Eastern Cape?     Yes.  So that means you have been a member of parliament close... over 20-years?     Over 20-years.  When did you meet Mr Agrizzi or Mr Gavin Watson for the first time?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay alright.  Take it from there Mr Notshe.     Mr Frolick, if you are happy to do so, you can just tell your story as you wish to tell it and at a certain stage, Mr Notshe can then ask you questions.  But if you want to just deal with one, two, three points and then let Mr Notshe lead you, that is fine.  But if you want to just tell the story, starting from your relationships with the Watsons and so on, it is fine.     No, that is fine.     Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Hang on.  I think what... unless I misunderstood.  I think what Mr Frolick wanted to do and I think his counsel wanted him to do, is to tell his story as he sees it to cover what he wants to cover.     And then... otherwise, you can go from the beginning.     Ja, ja.     Ja, let him cover what he wants to cover.     Then after that, you can start from the beginning.     Ja.     Yes, proceed.  Ja.     Ja.     I am sorry.  You did not expect?     Oh, you expected Mr Watson.     Okay.     Yes, okay.     Ja.     Thank you.  We are at tea-break time.  So I think we will take the tea-break and then when we come back Mr Notshe can start with questioning.  Is that alright?     Okay let us adjourn now.  We will resume at half-past eleven.  We adjourn.     Okay, Mr Notshe?   I think you should proceed with questioning and when you come to it – I mean, obviously he knows his affidavit.     You will just continue and question him.     Ja.     Please face this side, Mr Frolick.     Ja.     Okay.     I understand it is to simply say  - to say that as far as your memory is concerned you do not remember him being present in that discussion.  That suggests to me that you are saying maybe somebody can tell me things that might make me remember that he was present, maybe there is something that I cannot remember but as far as I can recall, I do not remember him being present in the discussion.  I understand you to be saying that.     Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     Ja, it is a long time.     Ja, okay.  So that is how I understand it, Mr Notshe.     If somebody else comes and say I definitely was there then it would be subject to questioning to see whether that was so.     I think a lot of witnesses like looking at the evidence leader not at me.     Yes.     Okay, okay.  Thank you.     Well, that affidavit of Mr Komphela was attested to on the 29 August 2019.     As at that time – okay, I see that in his     Oh, four.     Oh.     Yes, okay.  Mr Notshe?     I think what Mr Notshe is trying to do is to say here is a situation where you cannot recall but Mr Agrizzi says he recalls what happened and giving you a chance to say what you might wish to say given that Mr Agrizzi seems to be clear that that is what happened.     Yes, okay.     Just before you respond.  Mr Notshe, I am not sure that it is fair to ask him more details about what Mr Komphela’s version is in circumstances where I think you want him to say what may or may not be in – what may or may not be confirmed by Mr Komphela’s confirmatory affidavit because Mr Komphela’s confirmatory affidavit simply seeks to confirm only that which in his affidavit relates to him or Mr Komphela.  So as long as – I think what you can ask him and you can tell me if you want to submit differently, I think what you can ask him, you can ask him his version and when Mr Komphela comes you can confront him with what he was confirming.  What do you say?     Did he not say that in response to your question about what Mr Komphela – whether Mr Komphela confirms his version because if he was responding to that, that might be different.     No, you may be right.  I mean, if he is able to say well, I know what Mr Komphela’s version is on this point, this is what it is, that is fine, you know?     I was just concerned that Mr Komphela’s confirmatory affidavit does not seek to confirm everything that is in Mr Frolick’s affidavit, it purports to confirm only those parts that relate to Mr Komphela.  So that has got to be borne in mind.  But, of course, if Mr Frolick deals with other matters that do not relate to – that are not confirmed by the confirmatory affidavit on the basis that he has had a discussion with Mr Komphela about those matters, he knows what his version, that may be different.  So …[intervenes]     Ja, so maybe …[intervenes]     You can go ahead but bear in mind this discussion.     Yes.     Yes, ja, ja.  Okay.     Thank you.  Okay, just ask that question again, Mr…?     I am sorry Mr Notshe before you move away from the visit to BOSASA I remember that between your affidavit Mr Frolick and the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi there seems to be a tension between his affidavit and yours in terms of what the purpose of the visit was, you say one thing and I think he is say something else.  I was trying to look here Mr Notshe can you remember what that is about, there are two diffident objectives.       Yes, there was something about the youth centre or some centre because in one of his affidavits Mr Agrizzi challenges the purpose of the visit as stated by Mr Frolick on the basis I think Mr Frolick mentioned something like they wanted to see his sports facilities for young people and Mr Agrizzi say in effect that could never have been the purpose because the area where the centre is, is tarred.       There would not have been any facilities, I think that is what I would like you to get Mr Frolick to deal with.       What page?     2-3?      Yes.     55?      Okay, thank you.        Mr Notshe you said we must start where?     22?     Okay.  So it is necessary to look at what the purpose of the visit was.        As testified to by Mr Frolick and look at what the purpose, what Mr Agrizzi says the purpose was and to examine each one of them.       Yes.       It says    Paragraph 13?      Paragraph 7 at paragraph 13?     34?     Okay, yes.  Whose affidavit is this?        Yes.      Yes, and then…[intervene]         Then page 55…[intervene]     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Yes 8.1    4.1    Yes.     Yes, let me just see…[intervene]     In paragraph 8.1 he offers his affidavit     You know one of the aspects about the purpose of the visit that strikes me is that from your affidavit I get the impression that you and Mr Komphela travelled all the way from Cape Town to Gauteng to the BOSASA offices to see, to deal with sports issues or to see there - I do not know youth centre or whatever you were coming about sports.   And according to your affidavit I think you wanted to see what facilities the sport facilities they had for the youngsters but having arrived at BOSASA I think on your version there are no facilities to be shown and you just tell me if I am misunderstanding what you have said in your affidavit.  And I get the impression that Mr Komphela was not to impressed that now there were no facilities to be shown but Mr Agrizzi says no but in effect as I understand him could never have been, the arrangement could never have been about us showing him any sport facilities because in that place you know that centre you know the whole place or the place around where the centre is, is tarred there would be no facilities.  So that strikes me as strange as if how could you have come all the way and made such a trip if no proper homework had been made as to what you could see and what you could not see.   That seems strange to me and yet when you look at Mr Agrizzi’s version which starts from saying we have been wanting to influence the portfolio committee on correctional services, we have been wanting to meet with the Chairperson of the portfolio committee on correctional services Mr Smith he was ignoring us he did not want to meet us and they were getting negative publicity.  We wanted to have somebody, he wanted the Chairperson to protect BOSASA interest in when my task come up in the portfolio committee on correctional services.   So when we had this stalemate we had to find somebody else to help us access Mr Smith and then Mr Frolick was the person that we got.  He came to BOSASA this was the purpose and then it transpired that during that visit if I recall correctly there definitely was a discussion about the challenges that BOSASA said they were having in accessing the Chairperson of the portfolio committee.  So that issue was discussed and it transpires that subsequently you spoke to Mr Smith and indeed there was ultimately a meeting and according to Mr Agrizzi, Mr Agrizzi’s version indeed in due cause there was a change of attitude on the part of Mr Smith towards BOSASA.  So there is that part so I just want you to comment on the starting with the question of how could you and Mr Komphela come all the way to see a sports facilities if there were no sport facilities.  Had there not been a discussion before because if one looks at what you say was discussed during that visit and when one looks at what Mr Agrizzi says was discussed there is a lot of conversions it seems to be dominated by BOSASA’s concern about accessing the portfolio committee.  You want to say something? MR     But can you understand my…[intervene]     You come all the way and then the purpose of the visit is defeated in a way because what you are looking for is not there and I guess most people would be upset to say you why did you bring us here if you do not have A, B, C, D because that is what we are interested in.  Could it be that you and Mr Komphela might have had a different purpose of the visit?  Your purpose of the visit might have been different from the purpose of the visit of BOSASA than Mr Watson and Mr Agrizzi maybe and maybe they were focussed on seeing how you could help them resolve their challenges with Mr Smith while you might have gone there for something else.              Yes, okay Mr Notshe.      I think what Mr Notshe seeks to check with you is whether Mr Agrizzi’s information irrespective of whether he was present at that meeting or not whether his information that Mr Watson raised this issue with you is correct namely the issue of their challenges to try and get hold of Mr – to have a meeting with Mr Smith.            Yes, no but the question is, is it correct is it true that during that meeting Mr Watson raised the issue with you?        That is correct, ja.      Ja.      Hm.    Well I think he – it is true that he certainly was saying earlier a number of times it is – as far as he can recall Mr Agrizzi was not there.  And then at a certain time just two minutes ago he said Mr Agrizzi was not there.    And then you raised the – you asked a further question then he went back to saying as far as he recalls.  I take that to mean your – your actual position is that you cannot recall.  Am I right?    Ja he was not there.    Ja.    Yes I think…    Ja.    I think – I think your – I think your answer would be in line with what Mr Notshe is saying because you say as far as you recall he was not there.  But you are not saying you are hundred percent sure that he was not there because you say it has been a long time but as far as I recall he was not there.  So I think your answer would be if my – if your version is correct that – if your recollection is correct that he was not there then the only other way he could have got information is if somebody else told him.  But if your recollection is wrong then he could also have got the information because he was there.  But your recollection that he was not there.    That would be your answer.    Okay.    Is that at Mr Valance Watson’s house?    Oh well that is important because I think you said earlier on Mr Frolick you have been to Mr Valance Watson’s house a number of times.  You – you – and Mr Agrizzi said that on the day that he went to Mr Valance’s house on the occasion when he took with him some money that was meant for you which he says he gave to Mr Watson – Mr Valance Watson and Mr Valance Watson gave it to you in his presence.  He says that Mr Valance Watson showed him a gym in the – well I do not know whether in the house or in the premises that was not being used or had not been used for some time.  So I – are you saying despite the fact that you have been to that house many times you do not know whether there is such a gym or are you saying you know that there is no such gym?    Or at least there was no such gym at the time?    Yes.  So you do not know whether there is or there is not?    Ja.  Okay alright.    Ja.    Yes.    With a brown colour.    Okay.  Okay.    The suburb – the name of the suburb Mr Notshe do you want to cover that?    Because he should know the name of the suburb at least.    I think Mr Agrizzi gives the name of the suburb.    Is that where Mr Valance Watson’s house is?    Yes.    Not Waverley?    Is that so.  Okay.    And you are familiar with the – with the suburbs in that part of Port Elizabeth?    Ja.    Yes.    So you would say certainly the area where Mr Valance Watson’s house is not called – is it Waverley?    It is not called Waverley?    Yes okay.  Thank you.    Hm.    The – the – the one possibility at least that I can think of is that if Mr Gavin Watson had given him the money on the basis that he should give it to Mr Valance Watson for Mr Valance Watson to pass it on to you maybe he would not want to give it directly to you to say I am giving it to the person that I was told I must give it to.  But he must give it to Mr Frolick.  That is the only thing I can think of.    No, no I just…    I am just saying a possibility.    You know it may be that somebody else will say well there is no need for the money to go via Valance Watson we are all here – here is the money.  So that is possible as well.    I think what Mr Notshe is suggesting to you is look if Mr Agrizzi was fabricating all of this and wanted to falsely bring you in corruption would it not be an easier thing for him to say we met in Mr Valance Watson’s house.  Mr Frolick was there and I handed him the money and he took it from me.  So in other words I can testify positively I gave it to him as opposed to saying I gave it to somebody else for that person to give it to him.  So he is saying would that not be as an easier thing for somebody who wants to frame you rather than talk about this version of giving it to somebody else?    You follow what I am saying yes.    Yes.    You say it did not happen?    Ja.    Okay.  I cannot recall Mr Notshe?    No thank you.    Ja because the date – no date is given or timeframe.    Hm.    So – so I think that your evidence will not be to deny having facilitated a meeting between BOSASA and Mr Vincent Smith?    Which is what Mr Agrizzi also says.  I think the difference between your version in relation to facilitating the meeting and Mr Agrizzi’s version is that Mr Agrizzi says the facilitation came about because they had started giving you money.  Or – whereas you are saying yes I did facilitate but it was not because of any money that I had received.  Am I right in putting it that way?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.     H’m.  I see we are at two minutes past one.  I propose, if everyone agrees, that we continue because I suspect that we should be able to be done by two o’clock.     And then we adjourn for the day.     Would that suit everybody?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, Mr Van Zyl also indicates, he is happy with that.  Okay let us continue then.     Oh, to have a ...[intervenes]      Ja.  [laughing]  Okay let us take, what ten minutes’ break?     Ja.     Okay let us say ten minutes.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     But was in the discussion that you had with him, when he agreed, was a date also agreed or was it just agreed in principle to meet them but without agreeing to particular date as yet?     Oh.     Yes.     Unless maybe he was expecting Mr Gavin Watson whom he has said he knew quite well and then maybe he was surprised when he saw other people, that maybe that might also be …[intervenes]     …that caused him to be upset.     I do not know, I know that he said that he – he had known Mr Watson from I think either late ‘80’s or early ‘90’s he knew Mr Gavin Watson quite well, so – Mr Notshe, you might have a better recollection of exactly…      Would it be correct to say you did give them advice but ultimately you said it is their decision.     Yes, okay.  And the advice was against litigating but saying ultimately you must decide.     Okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Continue, Mr Notshe.     Yes.     On page 70?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     What is the page number?     74?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, ja.     Yes.  No, that is fine.     Is the impression I have, Mr Frolick, looking at these telephone records or cell phone records, is the impression I have that Mr Gavin Watson frequently wanted to talk to you, whether he succeeded sometimes or did not succeed most of the times, is that impression correct?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes, actually I see that there used to be quite frequent – reasonably frequent calls also between yourself and Mr Smith.     Yes, I am just having a look and want to …[intervenes]     And check whether my impression is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, okay, so it seems to me that the picture that emerges, and you can comment from your evidence and that of Mr Watson, no Mr Agrizzi, is you are not in a position to deny or dispute his evidence that at a certain time before – at a certain time before they got to know you, that is now Mr Agrizzi and – I don’t know whether Mr Gavin Watson also did not know you until this happened, whether you only knew his brothers.   But it seems that you do not deny or dispute his version that  one as BOSASA they had certain challenges with regard to negative publicity in the media connected with their relationship with the Department of Correctional Services mainly and the challenges being that they wanted the portfolio committee on correctional services to handle matters that could arise that relate to BOSASA and correctional services to handle them in a manner, in a certain manner because he says that they did not want to have a situation where the portfolio committee maybe could take a view which would result in them not being even in a contract anymore.   I think that is why what he is saying so it looks like they wanted to make sure that when BOSASA issues arose in the portfolio committee they wanted to know that the portfolio committee would handle those matters in a manner that would not result in them losing business with the correctional services or not been granted any further contracts and for that reason they wanted to talk to the Chairperson of that committee.  You do not know anything about that or at least you do not dispute it as I understand the position, is that correct?     They shared that with you.      Yes.       Yes.       But the portfolio committees might not have power to grant contracts, award contracts, award jobs that is the function of government departments but what they certainly can do would you not agree is to put pressure on a government department that seems to be doing something they regard as wrong to say stop it.  Now let me tell you what I am thinking a portfolio committee could do I mean one of the things I raised I think already last year in relation to the BOSASA issues was for many years I was reading in the media in the newspaper that all kinds of allegations of corruption against BOSASA and my question was how did it come about that BOSASA continued to be awarded contracts after contracts by government entities when there were these stories all over you see.   Now if a portfolio committee, if the correctional services portfolio committee was aware that there were all kinds of allegations of corruption against BOSASA and they got to know that the Department of Correctional Services kept on giving them contracts or extending them certainly the portfolio committee would be capable of taking a strong position on the issue and say to the DG or the Minister this must stop have you investigated this, where is the outcome of the investigation.  It looks like nothing is being done about this company when all these allegations are continuing.  So I think there is some pressure they could put which could result in the department saying look until maybe these issues are properly investigated let us stop giving this company contracts.  Would you not agree?     Yes.      I am very happy I was going to provoke you into that one but if you say you will be coming, I am happy.      Yes.      Yes, from parliament.      Yes.       I am very happy that you are working on that because it seems to me that parliamentary oversight is extremely important and a lot of things that may have gone wrong in our country may well have been stopped in their tracks if parliamentary oversight had been performed the way we would like.  I am saying the way we would like because at this stage of course I do not know whether whatever evidence will be brought forward will reveal that parliament did not perform its oversight properly for whatever reasons maybe part of the reasons being lack of capacity, lack of certain skills or whatever I do not know.  But some of the things one says you know one keeps up to date with what is happening in parliament one has never seen parliament do A, B, C, D you know.   But parliament might be able to say we tried all of these things but they just – they were not effective maybe the mechanisms we have of oversight are not effective, are not adequate.  Or maybe they are adequate but somewhere somehow there is no will to push, push things through so I am looking forward to the time when I will there will be that kind of interaction.   But to go back to this point that you have said yes they have told you that there is this problem then you – this is BOSASA with regard to having access to the Chairperson or to the committee and then they spoke to you when you had that visit with Mr Komphela you discussed and the result was that you talk to Mr Vincent Smith and ultimately they met.  And then the picture at least that emerges from Mr Agrizzi’s evidence now I cannot remember well when you compare it with Mr Smith’s evidence.  The picture seem to indicate that indeed there was a change of attitude on the part of Mr Smith towards BOSASA.  So it seems to me that a substantial part of what Agrizzi says is something that you may not be disputing but you are simply saying whatever facilitation you may have done to ensure that there was a meeting between BOSASA and Mr Smith was not because you had been given any money whereas Mr Agrizzi says we gave him money that is why we got this results. Is my understanding…[intervene]                    It is correct, yes.      Okay, alright.  Anything arising?      Okay alright.     Mr Van Zyl would you like to re-examine or are you fine?       Okay alright.      Yes.      Yes, do that.      What page?      Exhibit T?      T17 point?     6?     Mr Frolick’s affidavit that starts at page 81 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit T17.6.       Ja.       Yes, Mr Van Zyl?     If you will not be long you could re-examine him from there if you would be short if you will be a little longer…[intervene     Okay, alright.       But you do not know if there is or would it be situation where you are definite that there is no such suburb or you would limit yourself to saying I have never heard of it.       Okay, alright.       Actually you Mr Van Zyl your re-examination has reminded me of something that I wanted to ask.  There is a – you know some weeks ago Mr Frolick, Mr Vincent Smith was here giving evidence and one of the – part of the bundle of documents that were before me included of the bundle included messages, I think either SMS text messages or WhatsApp messages between – exchange between Mr Agrizzi and Mr Watson.   And they were talking between themselves about certain matters relating to BOSASA and they were mentioning Mr Vincent Smith’s name but in the process your name was also mentioned.  Now I just want to see where that is because I wanted to ask you about it.  Mr Notshe do you know where that is because I know it is here I saw it last night? I think I…[intervene]           No I think I am going to find it I have already seen one.  I think I am going to find it; you just have to be patient with me Mr Frolick.  You see in those messages Mr Watson and Mr Agrizzi are talking about things that relate to the Department of Correctional Services and mentioning people who were employed by correctional services and they mentioned if I recall correctly contracts as well and then your name gets mentioned in that context         What page?     Oh I have got it.  It is page 463 of BOSASA Bundle 02 and can you make it available to Mr Frolick if he has not got it.      It is written BOSASA Bundle 02.      And the page is 463.  The message is begin a little earlier they begin at 460.  So maybe we start at 460 and then we can, have you got 460, not yet?      Yes, you see 460 I think that is Mr Gavin Watson sending to Mr Agrizzi if I am not mistaken 27     You do not.       Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.         Yes, yes.      Yes.      Yes.       Yes, yes.      No thank you for that Mr Frolick.  The leaks of information whether happening within the Commission or information being leaked from other sources continues to be something that causes us great concern.  I had an occasion a few days ago to talk about it, it continues.  There was a time when we thought it had stopped you know.  I think a number of media houses are abiding by the law but there are some that seem to have taken the view that they will look for and publish whatever they like irrespective of what the regulations say.  But to the extent of course that whoever it is that sent you a message or called you may have implied that the Commission had made any findings about you or against you arising from whatever evidence it has had obviously that is just not true.   It is not true but also to the extent that they may have wanted to deter you or discourage you from coming to give your evidence and making yourself available that was totally unacceptable.  I think that you have done the right thing by coming to the Commission and saying I am here I will tell my side of the story and I am available to be questioned on my side of the story.  It is important for the Commission it raised two important matters, I am a public representative I will support the Commission and I think it is important that people should come and give evidence.   So I think that those of you who have come forward and there are many who have come forward without being forced to come forward I think they are doing the right thing and the Commission will be enriched by their participation by the evidence they give irrespective of what the outcome may be, the process is very important.  So thank you very much for coming and for sharing what you have shared with the Commission.  Thank you very much and thank you to your counsel for the cooperation that he has given to the Commission and your whole legal team, thank you Mr Van Zyl.   Alright we are going to adjourn – next week the Commission this is just for the public we will hear evidence relating to Eskom it will continue to hear evidence relating to the suspension of executives at Eskom.  We might have a hearing on Monday we might not have it, we might resume on Tuesday I am not sure but that is what the Commission will be hearing next week but for today we adjourn for the day. We adjourn.                       
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Chairperson we are ready to start.  This is a hearing end of the BOSASA stream and this hearing today is as a result of Mr Cedrick Frolick.  He applied after he heard the evidence of Mr Agrizzi and after he had been served with 3.3 notices.   He applied for permission to file an affidavit and testify.  He has now filed – he filed an affidavit and today he is testifying in respect of those.  He filed two affidavits and then in August he filed a third affidavit which deals with only specific witnesses.   Chair as the application and the affidavits are in a bundle – the BOSASA bundle and it is BOSASA Bundle 3.  And then the affidavit, the application and the accompanying affidavits the – we marked them as Exhibit T17 but then the separate affidavits they have sub-17 number to T17.1, .2, .3 as we go along.    Yes.  Okay let me start with the first one.  The first one is today the file before you…    Yes.    Yes.    It is that file only.    And then in…    Yes.    Can the witness then be sworn in?    Now Mr Frolick I am sure before we started I took you – I show you the record and then let me put it on record that we – we are using when we refer numbers – page numbers we are using the black numbers.  You see it is called BOSASA – 3 and then – then there will be a number.  That is the page number we are referring to.  You understand?     Now Mr Frolick…    Now Mr Frolick can I take you to page 8 that is the black page 8 and there you see an affidavit.  It    Page 8.    Page 8 yes.    Are you on the page?    You see the document named affidavit then Cedric Thomas Frolick, you see that?    Then go to page 12.    Yes no I am just putting this – I am just putting it on the record.    Well the document is…    Yes I am not going to lead on it but just putting it on record as …    No that is fine.  Then in passing Mr Frolick can you go to page 31.  There is an affidavit and then go to – can you go to page 42?      Yes there is – there is a signature above the name C T Frolick, is that your signature?    You confirm that this is your affidavit?    Chair can this affidavit of Mr Frolick then from page 31 – Mr Frolick just a minute.  Yes I am just looking at the exhibit number.  As Exhibit 17.4.  Yes.  T17.4.  No Chair I am sorry I beg your pardon.  It is…    No I beg your pardon it is 17.3.    17.1 is the index to the application.  17.4 is the affidavit which is the application affidavit.  Then 17.3.    Yes.    Condonation application.  17.2 is the supporting affidavit.    Let us go back – Mr Frolick can you go back to page 8 where –     And then if you turn to page – hold on page 8 and turn to page 12, is that your signature on page 12?    Do you confirm that this is your affidavit?    Yes.  Chair can this be admitted as 17.2?    T17.2.    Yes.    17.1 is the Notice of Motion.    17.1 starts Chair at 04.  Page 04.    Well the index forms part of the …    I do not know Chair.    But do you not need it for purposes of record to say he applied for condonation?    It is fine.    That is fine.    That is fine.    Yes.    Yes.    17.3 starts on page 33 – 31 I beg your pardon.    Yes.    And then Mr Frolick can we then take you to page 54.      There is an affidavit there Mr Frolick and the signature of that is on page     Signature is on page 65.      You confirm that Mr Frolick?    Chair the – apparently the mask is not – is stopping the sound.  He is messing – it is interfering with the sound.      It is interfering with the sound of the witness.    Yes the – received a note.    Yes they cannot hear.    Okay.    Then Mr Frolick we were on – I asked you to confirm on page 65 whether that signature is yours?    And then you confirmed that this affidavit if your affidavit?    And then Chair can this then be marked T17.4?    Yes.    Then Chair there was an affidavit which was filed by Mr Gibson Njenje Lizo - Gibson Njenje.  That affidavit has never been part of the record but I am of the view that this is the opportune time that we place it on record.    Because it deals with the – this witness.  The affidavit is on page 79.      Can that be marked as Exhibit T17.6?  T17.6.    Point 6.    Yes point 6 yes.    Chair then on page 68 – 68 there – telephone records that my learned friend referred to.    Can those be admitted as T17.5?    Yes.  Chair that is the housekeeping exercise.  Can we then proceed?    Mr Frolick.    Yes.    They – we tried to print them.    In the local printer but we find that we – it is too voluminous.    It is – but it is being brought up.    And I must also put on record that they were kind enough to give me a copy of the affidavit – not the – not the annexures but the affidavit of Mr Frolick.    Yes.    When we get there.    Now Mr Frolick is it correct that you through your legal representatives you applied or Leave to File affidavits to the commission?    And that was your application to file an affidavit you thought to respond to the evidence of Mr Agrizzi?    And his affidavits?    Now you have filed the affidavit that we have referred to…    Chair the evidence of Mr Agrizzi was to the effect that he was introduced to Mr Frolick by Mr Cheeky Watson the brother of Mr – the late Gavin Watson and subsequent to that they met and Mr Agrizzi – I am sorry Mr Agrizzi says then Mr Frolick visited the BOSASA complex and accompanied with a Parliamentarian.    Mr Cheeky Watson.    Yes.  And then they visited.    Ja a visit was arranged for Mr Frolick together with the Parliamentarian Mr Komphela – Butana Komphela to the BOSASA business park it was called Mogale Business Park. There was a meeting held where he was introduced and then he says there – and then – then they discussed the issue of Mr – they discussed the issue of meeting Mr Vincent Smith and then at some stage Mr Gavin Watson excused himself and he went to his vault and he came with a bag, security bag and later on he gave it to Mr Frolick.  And thereafter there was – the meeting was arranged – there are details that Mr Frolick came back to say Mr Vincent Smith did not receive the letter but the upshot of that was that a meeting was arranged for Mr Agrizzi together with Mr Njenje to see Mr Vincent Smith in Cape Town in Parliament.  They went and visited him.   He says it was a short visit and thereafter Mr Frolick took them and they had lunch with him and then they flew back.  And then he says at some stage he was asked by Mr Gavin Watson to take some money to Port Elizabeth to the house of Mr Valance Watson wherein they waited there and Mr Frolick arrived.   There was a discussion about local politics and then he also talked to Mr Frolick and thereafter as they were leaving Mr Valance Watson gave the parcel of money to Mr – to Mr Frolick.  And thereafter there was also the – because BOSASA was having a problem in Parliament and they also wanted to meet Mr Masutha and – who was then at that stage the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services.   Then an opportunity they saw was that there was going to be a political rally in Port Elizabeth where Mr Masutha was going to attend.  Then they arranged that Mr Masutha must be accommodated at one of the houses owned by Valance Watson and that happened but Mr Watson could not meet Mr Masutha.   And then another issue was the – BOSASA had a problem with the Department of Correctional Services because they had tendered and their view was that they were the lowest tendered but despite that they did not win the tender.  So they sought to – they sought to challenge that tender.   And you will – and Mr Agrizzi says he was at home sick and papers had been drafted and all of a sudden Mr Gavin Watson came to his house together with their lawyers and he told him that the matter no longer going ahead.  They have been advised by politicians not to proceed with the matter.  They were told that will be suicide.   Then Mr Agrizzi insisted that Mr Frolick should be called so that he Agrizzi can confirm what Mr Gavin Watson was saying to him about Mr Frolick.  So the call was placed on Mr Frolick – to Mr Frolick and the phone was put on a speaker phone and then Mr Frolick instructed them that they should not proceed with the matter and the matter was not proceeded with.   And he said – Agrizzi says he was very upset as a result he chased the team away from his home.  That is the sum total of the evidence of Mr Agrizzi and…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Where it is going.    And then the – how the – then the evidence you – Chair you must have heard – seen that there are a number of affidavits that had been put together.  What has happened is the – Mr Frolick filed his affidavit and – and applying to lead evidence.  And then he dealt with the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi and Mr Agrizzi answered to that and then Mr Frolick replied to that.  And then the latest is and it is now reply to the affidavit of Mr Njenje and Mr Johan Blake, the affidavit which is outstanding which we will come to.     Mr Frolick, you have heard when I was summarising the gist of the issues today.  And although you have filed the affidavit... you filed an affidavit.  It has been heard and it reads smoothly and it is understandable if, for instance, you give a summary of your version of the events.  Can you do that?  But you are free to always look in the affidavit to check, if you want to check some issues in your affidavit.       Can you start with the issue of, when did you meet Mr Agrizzi for the first time?     Yes.  And ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Mr Frolick.  Now I do not want us to leave the visit.  The visit at the BOSASA complex.     Ja, let us deal with that.     No, that is fine.  I do understand that.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Then that is fine.     No.  Then I am happy, Chair.     [No audible reply]      Thank you, Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Chair, I have now – we have now printed the latest affidavit of Mr Frolick.  I am not certain whether we should just deal with it and then see he wants to comment on it and then have it as evidence and then I can then clarify certain issues with him.     Sure, alright.     No, that is fine.     Now, Mr Frolick, I understand - you say you were elected as a Member of Parliament in 1999, am I right?      Ja.  And then if I understand you were orientated about the rules of parliament and the different functions, the committees and all that.     And then you were also orientated on the functions of the portfolio committees.     And, if I understand correctly, the portfolio committees are – they have an oversight on their portfolios, meaning there is even oversight on the functions of the executive, am I right?     And they interact with the executive, am I right?     And they are not there to advise members of the public about their issues with the executive.     What do you say?     Yes.  And but the main thing is to ensure that the executive acts in terms of the constitution and their interaction – its interaction with the public is in respect of that role, am I right?     Yes. MR     Now let us deal with the visit at the BOSASA Park.     Now in your affidavit you say – you used these words, you do not recall whether – you say as far - I am on page 35 of the record, BOSASA 3, on     Ja.  Now when you say as far as I recall, you mean he could have been there but you forgot or you say he was not there?     Please let us – the word recall, cannot recall is pregnant in the sense that when you say I cannot recall, you mean I cannot remember and you mean it is something that could have happened, am I right?     Is that what you mean here?     No, I understand.     So when Mr Agrizzi says he was there, you are saying well, that is his recollection, am I right?     So you cannot dispute that he was there, that is his recollection.     No, Chair, it is fine, I know I look pretty.     Yes.     Did he come from the car to the office?     How did he walk from the car to the office?     I see.  And now I see here that there is a confirmatory affidavit of Mr Komphela but the affidavit is attached to your second affidavit.  Are you saying he is confirming your first affidavit as well?     As well.  Because I will tell you why I am saying that because he confirms an affidavit not affidavits but you say he is confirming both.     Mr Komphela’s affidavit?     Look …[intervenes]     The affidavit of Mr Komphela is on page 67.  Now this affidavit is attached to your replying     Yes.     Now when you discussed this issue with Mr Komphela, Mr Komphela must have seen the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi, am I right?     Did he deny that Mr Agrizzi was at – that Mr Agrizzi was at the BOSASA Centre?     So also he does not deny it but he says he cannot recall.     Now, Mr Agrizzi says at some state Mr Komphela stood up and took a telephone call and Mr Agrizzi had to hold a door for him.  Does Mr Komphela deny that?     So you are saying a door was not held for Mr Komphela to take a telephone call?  Is that what you are saying?     Did he stand up?  Did he at any stage stand up?     And did he take a call?     Did you ask him about this?     And did you ask him whether a door was held for him by Mr Agrizzi?     Did he say also he could not recall you talking to Gavin Watson aside?     Does his recollection to the effect that he did not see you talking to Mr Gavin aside?     Now again, all of this, saying it is a recollection and it is not a denial of that this happened, is as far as you can recall.     It could have happened but you cannot remember now.     But the evidence he has given, Mr Frolick, is he says he can recall – he recalls this and you are saying you are not denying them but you say you cannot recall.     So are you moving now from not recalling to disputing?     Now moving from not recalling to disputing does also comply to Mr Komphela?  He is now saying he now disputes, do you know?     Chair, there is this, Mr Frolick did not confine himself in his answers today to his – to the confirmatory affidavit and his affidavit, he goes on and tells you what Mr Komphela told him, so I think he is – then he is able to tell you what Mr Komphela told him.  If …[intervenes]     Chair, if – what I asked him was this.  I said that when he spoke to Mr Komphela about this incident, does he confirm a, b, c, d?  One, he does not say I did not speak to him about it, he spoke to him about it and he does not say to you Mr Komphela did not give me an answer.  He gives you an answer.  I will be fair to the witness …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.  Chair, that is – I was careful.     I was careful …[intervenes]     Yes.  No, I was – I am careful about it.     The only thing, I cannot be able to – to be answered to ask him about what he has not been told by Mr Komphela.     So, if I understand, Mr Frolick, is you are saying when you discussed with Mr Komphela he said to you he cannot recall whether one, Agrizzi was there.  Is that correct?     And can we, just before I go further, is this – are you saying this meeting at the BOSASA offices was – you were merely accompanying Mr Komphela as your friend, am I right.       And you were not going to the – you were not going to the offices of [indistinct – microphone off]     Sir, the visit at the BOSASA business park, he was merely accompanying Mr Komphela, am I right?     And you – at that stage you were a member of the Portfolio Committee of Sports?     And you were not a member of the Portfolio Committee for Correctional Services.     Now when Mr Cheeky – when Mr Gavin Watson asked you about matters regarding the Portfolio Committee of Correctional Services, why did you entertain him on that?     I see.  Now did at any stage Mr Gavin Watson leave the place where you were seated or you cannot recall?     And he did not – did you see his vault?     And you will not dispute that there is a vault nearby where you were seated?     Now Mr Agrizzi recalls Mr Watson excusing himself and going to his vault.  What do you say about that?     Now the travel costs, you say you will not dispute that they were paid by BOSASA but you are saying you do know that they are paid by BOSASA.     And you in the latest affidavit you filed, you filed also confirmatory affidavit of Cheeky Watson.     The one you filed in August.     You remember the one which was not in the bundle, the one you have just added now?     Yes.     It is now in the bundle.     Is if you look at page 121.     Yes.  And did you ask him, when you asked for this affidavit, to deal with this issue that has come up that the payments were made by Blake Travel and not by EP Rugby? MR     Ja, I understand.  The affidavit of Mr Watson I see was commissioned in August 2020.  Why?  This was after it has come out that the travel costs were paid by Blake Travel and BOSASA, am I right?     So also you confirm that then that Mr Cheeky Watson does not deny that your costs were paid by BOSASA?     Did he explain to you why your expenses were to be paid by BOSASA?     Did you ask him why?      No, I understand at the time he did not tell you but now that you came to know that this payment was made by BOSASA.  Did he tell you why was the payment made by BOSASA?      He did not explain it to you?     Right, now before we leave the issue of the boardroom at the BOSASA business centre are you now saying that Mr Komphela was with you all the time and if you had been given money he would have seen it?      And unless he cannot recall it.      And unless he was busy with – on a phone call and he was at the door.      Sorry perhaps - I do not want us to be at cross purposes.  The evidence of Mr Agrizzi is as I understand it is that Mr Komphela did not leave the complex of the office but he stood at the door to take this call.       And I am sure if Mr Komphela or maybe if Mr Agrizzi held the door of Mr Komphela, Mr Komphela cannot miss seeing Mr Agrizzi right in front of him.      Now Mr Agrizzi before I get to that – you know Mr Valance Watson?     And have you been to his place?     And there was a visit that Mr Agrizzi mentioned that he visited Mr Valance’s place and then he met you there.  Do you remember that?     Now tell me…[intervene]     Mr Agrizzi’s evidence was that they wanted to show Mr Frolick and his company what the BOSASA was actually doing.     There cannot be, yes.      One listen - Mr Frolick just turn to page 23.     Page 2-3, Chairperson.     Yes.       But can we start at 23 before we get to 55 Chair.      At page 23.     23.     Yes.      Yes, at 23, page 23 it is what Mr Agrizzi says was the purpose, paragraph 51.     Then do you see that Mr Frolick?     And then on page 44 paragraph 7 sorry before we get their Chair to 44 please turn to page 34 which is the affidavit now of Mr Frolick, on paragraph 13.     Yes, on page 34.     No, on page 34.     Yes, 3-4 Chairperson.  Page 34 paragraph 13.     This is the affidavit of Mr Frolick.      Where he says    Then on page 55.     Yes.     Right Mr Frolick are you – you say the confirmatory affidavit of Mr Komphela, are you saying it confirms that the visit was arranged and initiated between him and Mr Cheeky Watson?       So is that what his confirming?     And – now as we have read to you Mr Agrizzi says that the meeting was for something different.  It was to present the scope of the work of the company, you read that?       Yes, and when you were there you also confirmed that there was an issue raised regarding the problem with the correctional services portfolio committee.       And did you not ask as to why when the purpose of the visit was for the sports and recreation now you are asked about correctional services issue?      Now when you were there what was the issues of sports and recreation that were discussed at the meeting?      Now as the person who had initiated this was Mr Komphela, am I right?      Now why did it then come to you that you took over and start facilitating the meetings between the BOSASA and Mr Smith for correctional services?     So you say that Mr Smith confirm that BOSASA there were problems with BOSASA and correctional services?     And when you became the – what they call it Chair of Chairs did you also see it in the minutes of the correctional services that there were problems that were being raised in that portfolio committee regarding BOSASA and correctional services?     What is also interesting is that Mr Agrizzi recalls the conversation you had with them regarding access to Mr Smith.  Do you agree with me?      No sorry…[intervene]     The question did not come out clearly.  He states – he tells the Commission about what was discussed between you and Mr Gavin Watson regarding the difficulty to get access to Mr Smith, he testifies about that.       No, sorry Mr, perhaps you do not understand Mr Agrizzi says Mr Watson told you that he had a problem to get to talk to Mr Smith.  Do you recall that in his affidavit?       So I am saying he is testifying about what Mr Gavin Watson said to you at the meeting.      And you saying that Mr Agrizzi could have known about that discussion because Mr Gavin Watson shared it with him, am I right?       Unless…[intervene]    Unless he was in the meeting?  It is either he heard it from someone or he was in the meeting?    Tell me are you moving from saying – remember when you started your evidence you say well you cannot recall whether he was there or not.  Now you are saying that definitely he was not there.    Now what …    What jolted your memory to say that definitely Mr Agrizzi was not there when you started by saying as far as your memory is concerned?    Yes.    And then you said he said unless there is some concrete evidence to support Mr Agrizzi’s evidence, am I right that he was there?    And what Mr Agrizzi has done is to tell the court – sorry – the commission about the conversation that occurred in that room and you confirm that conversation did occur.    And you would agree with me that there are two scenarios – situations he could have heard it from someone else or he was there?    You say you will agree with me there are two scenarios.  It is either he heard from someone else or he was there – he heard it himself.    Thank you.  Now we – excuse me – the – you said you have visited on a number of occasions the house of Valance Watson, am I right?    And you have walked around his house, am I right?    And did you notice that he has a gym which is not used there?    Valance’s – yes.  Now…    Now does he have – so you must have seen this – does he have a beautiful brown lounge suite in his house Mr Watson?  You must have sat on it.    Look in line with – in line with what you said earlier that the – when you wanted to take the glory from me about being pretty.  When you said the – that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.  Let us leave the beauty does he have a brown lounge suite?    Does it have…    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Maybe – the – the suburb is?    As Waverley.    Waverley yes.    Does he – does he have where this lounge – I do not want to say it is beautiful – you do not like the word.  Does he have Persian carpets?    Okay now let us deal with that – the visit of Mr Agrizzi and meeting you at Valance’s house.  On page 41 of the record paragraph 33.  Again you use your famous    So does this again mean it could have happened but you cannot remember now?    Now what is important here Mr Frolick is this.  You do not deny – you do not say I never met Mr Agrizzi.  Remember by the time you deposed to this affidavit you had now seen Mr Agrizzi am I right?    You saw him in Parliament, am I right?    You saw him on TV, am I right?    Now by the time you deposed to this affidavit you know the face that was talking – that was saying it met you at Valance Watson’s house.  You say you cannot recall whether you met that face there or not.  Is that your evidence?    Now I see – I see that you are enthusiastic in checking people who are mentioned to have been involved with you.  You checked with Mr Komphela.  You check with Mr Cheeky Watson.  Did you check with Valance Watson about this?    What did he say?    But he does not deny it?    So you are saying he did not deny it?  He just says he cannot recall.    Now the – Mr Agrizzi’s evidence is this that this was not just a social visit.  He came with money to be given to you.  Am I right?  As far as his evidence is.    Yes and Mr Watson says he cannot recall this – he does not deny it but he says he cannot recall this.    That is strange.    Ja.    He says no he cannot recall?    No.    Tell me did you refuse to give to you a confirmatory affidavit as others did?  Refuse – the others did give you did he refuse to give you?    Why did you not ask him?  You had asked others?    But you managed to get it from Cheeky Watson the brother and family as well?    I understand.  Because Mr Watson – Mr – Sorry Mr Agrizzi has seems to have a clear recollection of what happened.  Turn to page 50.  Paragraph – look at    Now I see in your – I read in your affidavit – in your affidavit you say that it is strange that Mr Agrizzi says he gave the money to Mr Watson and then Mr Watson gave to you.  And you ask him why did Mr Agrizzi not just say give the money to you.  Am I right?    And am I correct to say that if Mr Agrizzi was making up this story it would have been easy for him to say well I have got him the money and then I gave it to him.  He would not create all this giving the money to someone to give it to you.  Am I right?    I have a – my view is quite different Chairperson.    And – and just whether I was putting – whether I was putting to you that would not Mr Agrizzi’s story if you are creating be more simple.  He says when I got there I gave the money to Mr Frolick rather than creating this long route?    And you know his evidence perhaps then it can tie in with what you had been asking for.  His evidence says this within a week after you had been given money you managed to arrange a meeting with Mr Vincent Smith.    On page – on page 26.  Paragraph –    The question is – he says within a week after he met you you had then arranged a meeting to see that they see Mr Frolick – to Mr Vincent Smith.    Yes.    Is it not so…sorry.    No, no continue.  I beg your pardon.    But are you not able when you try to jolt your memory to look at – think about when Mr Smith agreed.  Because you said Mr Smith is a very busy person.  Now at some stage he agreed to meet them.  But then looking back a week before that and think where you were – the week before that.    Now – but your  then your – your version responding to the Chairperson is this that – oh before I do that.  We know at the time you were not in the Portfolio Committee for Justice and Correctional Services?    And you just came to be involved in this BOSASA Correctional Services because you accompanied Mr Butana Komphela to the BOSASA complex right.  And then insofar as you were concerned you were just helping Mr Gavin Watson whom you had seen – whom you knew to meet Mr Smith, am I right?    And thereafter you had no reason to be involved with BOSASA and their problems with the Portfolio Committee.  It was not your committee?    Now when did you again discuss the BOSASA issue with Mr Watson – Gavin Watson after the visit to the Parliament?    And that was it?    And you never spoke to him about BOSASA?     We should be Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair besides Mr Frolick.  He had made a special request that we will try and finish him early.     He needs to go back.     And... no, that suits me very well.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Frolick, so you confirm that the meeting at Cape Town with Mr Smith was done with his consent, he agreed to meet these people.     I will tell you why I am asking that is because in his – when he gave an affidavit to this Commission he says he was sort of – he met them, they were unannounced and he did not appreciate that.     He says they came to see him unannounced and he did not appropriate that visit.     Yes, no, he did say he had known Mr Watson for some time before the incident.  Now after the visit, after they told you that the meeting was not successful, did you ask Mr Smith what happened?     And I am sure as a parliamentarian, seasoned parliamentarian, you know that the Portfolio Committees have this oversight role over the executive, I am sure you realise that you do not want to be seen to be favouring any individual against the executive or to be seen as part of an individual or a company, am I right?     But members of the Portfolio Committee would not be seen to be – did not want to be seen batting for one company or one individual.     And now when you were phoned by Mr Watson about this litigation they intended against Department of Correctional Services, why did you not say to him you cannot entertain this because it is not one of your roles?     Why did you not just say to him look, it is not my business to advise you onto whether you should litigate or not?     Did you say to them it would be unwise to litigate against government, government department?     Now did you ask Mr Watson why did he call you instead of calling his lawyers regarding litigation?     Now tell me, did you and Gavin Watson call each other now and again?     No, I understand.     By the slates.     And the slates.     Ja, no, do not worry.     And is it correct that you would also call him?     But is it correct that you were not part of BOSASA, he never drew you into his business, you were not part of his business.     Look, if you – can you just turn to page 68?  Are you there?     Yes.      This is EXHIBIT T17.5.  The record of a number of calls recorded between you and Mr Watson.  I am sure you saw a number of them from him to you and some from you to him, am I right?     Now what I have also noticed was also during that time in 2017 on the 6 t h – on page 70.     You were called by Mrs Nomvula Mokonyane on the 6 t h.  Do you see that?     The 6 March 2017.     If you – to help you …[intervenes]     And then do you remember that call?     Of March, ja.     So you say you cannot recall these calls?     Because the following day, the 7 t h, you called her.     I see.  And then I see down the line on the 7 t h she called you and I am not certain – can you remember whether you spoke to her then?  Do you recall?     As you go down – the easiest way is to track it through the calling number.     Let me give you the – I you do not mind, I will help you with a piece of paper.     Do you see that number?     Yes, yes, sir.     Okay.     Oh, okay.     No, I understand.  No, I understand, ja.     No, I understand.  Now just go to page 72.  It seems as if you received a call from Jonas Joe Gumede on the 11 December 2017.     You know who Gumede is?     Okay, so he must have called you about that.     Now also if you go – can you go to page 74?     Page 74.     Yes.  In the middle of the page I see there is call – okay, from Papa Leshabane.  Do you see that?     Do you know who he is?     BOSASA, yes.     But he is also linked to BOSASA.     And so was Mphaphuti(?)Dlamini.     Look on the …[intervenes]     Mphaphuti Dlamini.     Because there is a record that you received a call from Papa Leshabane and then there is a slash and Mphaphuti Dlamini.  The call was about 356 seconds.  You do not recall that?      No, I understand that.     But what is clear – what, Mr Frolick, comes out clear is that these people that are reflected in this printout are people you know.     And you know Joe Gumede.     And you also know that these people used to work for BOSASA.     Yes.  And if you go down there is also Sisinisio Opela(?).  Do you know him?     How did he get your number?     How did he get your number, do you know?     Ja.  Okay, I see here that Sisinisio called you on one day on a number of occasions and he spent some time with you, like some seconds with you on the phone.  Do you know why he called you a number of times?     Chairman, can you just bear with me one second?  I think that is all I wanted to clarify from the witness, yes.     No not from me Chair.      The only thing but…[intervene]     Chair before he re-examines then I think you are going to ask him about much as arising from your questions. Can I just hand – let this be part of the record the affidavit the one which we were put in after tea.     Can I just lead that evidence.     Mr Frolick can you go to page 81.     Page 81 and then that is an affidavit which ends on page 90.  Do you confirm that that is your affidavit with annexures?     And Chair can that affidavit be admitted as Exhibit T176.     T176.      Point 6.      Yes.      Thank you Chair.     I have no further questions.     Chair no I have been unable to find that.      Chair you can look at page I think it is 359.     359.      Thank you Chair. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  May I remain seated?      Chairperson name is Francois Van Zyl SC for – member of the Cape Bar.  I represent Mr Frolick in these proceedings on instructions from Danie Gouws Incorporated.  My instructing attorney is not here for cost saving purposes.      We are prepared to give evidence.      He has previously applied.      To give evidence.  You gave him permission to give evidence.      And that is why we are here today.      May this – there is one correction I have to make.      I wonder if I should not make it now?      If you can go in Exhibit T17 to page 34 paragraph 12.      34.      I am using the black numbers left top.      Paragraph 12.  The last sentence      Yes.      And may I also draw your attention to the fact that we have yesterday been sent a whole bundle of cell phone records.  I only received it when I arrived in Johannesburg and we only had very little time last – yesterday evening – yesterday afternoon late to look at it.  It was virtually impossible because it is a spreadsheet and the computer only shows half the page.  It was very      If he has a problem he will tell you.     And then we will have to take it from there.      Thank you Sir.    Chair I am sorry to interrupt but    There is also a further affidavit.    By Mr Frolick.    That was filed dealing with the affidavit of Mr Brian Blake of Blake’s Travels.    And with this affidavit of Mr Njenje.    And attached to that affidavit is also an affidavit by Daniel John Watson or Cheeky Watson.    I think it is important.    That that also be placed before the commission.     Chairperson, if I may interrupt?     In his affidavit signed on 3 September, which is a few days after the affidavit of Mr Komphela, at     Chairperson, if I may come in here?  At that stage on the 29 August there were only the two affidavits, the condonation application affidavit, which does not refer really to Mr Komphela, and then the affidavit of the 29 April 2019 which refers to Mr Komphela.  That is the first affidavit that he refers to in his affidavit on the 3 September a few days later.        Chairperson if I may interrupt.        I think what you are referring to is at page 55.        Paragraph 4.2 and 4.3.        Mr Chairperson may I interrupt.        If you look at page 44 where we have just been refer to paragraph 7.1.        You should also read paragraph 8.1.      Mr Chairperson it goes on in the next paragraphs.     To deal with the contradiction in Mr Agrizzi’s evidence as to the purpose.      4.3.     Chairperson that is not as I recall the evidence.  What he said was about ten days after the meeting at BOSASA’s offices this incident happened in Port Elizabeth, that is what he said.  With respect.    I stand corrected Mr Chairman.     Mr Chairperson, may I interrupt the witness, I am sorry but the cell records, they have a problem with their own, you will see in the second column record type and we do not know what all these things mean but if you go to the very last column on these two calls where Ms Mokonyane is indicated, the duration is nought so it seems not to have been a call at all.     Sorry, I interrupted.     Mr Chairperson, if I may again interrupt here.     If you look at this specific call of 356 minutes …[intervenes]      You will see that it differs from the others.  As the record typed it is indicated as a CF and then it shows call forwarding.  You see call forward in the third last column, that is where Mr Frolick’s name appears for the first time and then party number three, there is a 267 number.  How all this hangs together we do not know, I need to point that out.        Yes, Chair.     Thank you Mr Chairperson.     If I may I am quite happy to do it from here.        A question about the youth centre.  When you and Mr Komphela arrived at the BOSASA campus can we call it I am not sure that I understood correctly are you saying that there was no youth centre or that they were not ready with it to receive you or what is the position?          Well the question arises why did you not say well forget about all the other places we are just going to see the youth centre or was that not on the agenda at all.         Then you grew up in Port Elizabeth?           Are you familiar with all the suburbs?        But can you tell us whether there is a suburb like Waverley?       No, can you tell us whether there is a suburb called Waverley?     And then on Mr Agrizzi’s evidence as to the meeting you were asked extensive questions on whether you left that office in which you were.  But to place it in context Agrizzi said you left the office you were called out by Watson basically so that he could give you money and he gave you the money.  What do you say about that?      Thank you Mr Chairperson, I have no further questions.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed affirmation?    Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give shall be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm.    All rise. 
MR FROLICK:  Cedrick Thomas Frolick.    No.    I fully affirm.    I understand Chair.    My apologies Deputy Chief Justice.    I agree.    You mean page 8 now?    Okay I have got the page.    Yes.    I see that.    I am on page 42.    That is correct.    Correct.    I am on page 8.    That is correct.    I do confirm.    I am still trying to get to page 64 or 65 my apologies.    Chairperson I do not have any problem with it however in one of the correspondence that we communicated to this commission I indicated that I tested positive for Covid-19.    And that I have recovered from that but I am still sitting with the after effects.    Of the impact that it had on my system.  So with your permission I am prepared to remove the mask.    Chairperson I am prepared to remove the mask if you want to.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Sir.    That is correct.    Correct.     Yes.     That is correct, Chairperson.     1999, Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Chairperson, I met Mr Gavin Watson through the acquaintance of Mr Cheeky Watson.     He is the brother of Mr Gavin Watson.     And we have been involved in the non-racial sport movement ...[intervenes]      ...in the Eastern Cape.  I initially met Cheeky and after that I met the brothers ...[intervenes]      ...including Mr Gavin Watson.     The first time I met Mr Agrizzi was when he visited the parliament with Mr Njenje.     Thank you, Chairperson.  I prefer to do that.     To tell the story, to give the background.     I think that is context is important.     Chairperson, my relationship with Mr Daniel Watson, also known as Cheeky Watson, started in the late 1980’s when I was still a student at university and became involved in non-racial sports and politics and we became personal friends. And subsequently to that, being elected to member of parliament, I served on the Sport and Recreation Committee in the National Assembly. And from 2004, I was part of the team that worked with other local rugby administrators in the Eastern Cape to support the rejuvenation of rugby in the Eastern Cape Region as a whole. This initiative was strongly supported by the late Minister of Sport and Recreation, the late Reverend Arnold Stofile, as well as the then Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee, Mr Butana Komphela .   In 2006/2007, Mr Cheeky Watson was elected as President of Eastern Province Rugby and immediately I was roped in as an advisor to Eastern Province Rugby and that is where I was introduced to the other brothers who were involved in sport and all of them were also involved in the African National Congress. A very strong emphasis was placed on building and rebuilding the rugby situation in the Eastern Cape, especially in light of the decision that was taken by the government to build a new multi-billion rand sports stadium in Nelson Mandela Metro. The late Reverend Arnold Stofile informed me that, together with others, that they had to fight to get the stadium there.   And one of the reasons that was raised, dealt with this phase, sustainability post the World Cup and thus, it was important for us and I...  My constituency is in Nelson Mandela Metro in Port Elizabeth, that we put a team together, working with the rugby administrators on the one hand but also working with the sport administrators at times to ensure that we get professional rugby and professional soccer to the stadium.  And that was my involvement with that. Added to this strategy was also to encourage the hosting of other major sport and other events at the stadium and subsequent to the work that was done by the group collectively, we succeeded in hosting major international football and rugby matches including the International Rugby Board Sevens for three years at the stadium. And we also secured two professional teams to use the stadium as their basis.  That is both the Southern Kings and Chippa United. During this period, I was a member of the ANC and the ANC whip on the Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation and worked very closely with all stakeholders.   Although I initially only acted as an advisor to EP Rugby Union, I formally joined them on the board in 2012 and also served as a director on the board of the company, the Professional Arm of the Union. And it is a well-known fact that Eastern Province struggled financially and thus there were no demands made or any expectation for payment of services.  We did voluntarily with the understanding that logistical and travel support would be provided when needed. These travel arrangements were managed by the Eastern Province Rugby office and I only learnt subsequently in the discussion with Mr Watson, after Mr Agrizzi’s evidence, that the travel agency that was used by Eastern Province Rugby Union at the time, is also or was also the service provider to BOSASA. That is the background to my involvement with the situation.  I want to get to the visit, if I may, Chairperson?     The visit to BOSASA Chairperson was initiated after there was discussions between Mr Cheeky Watson on the one hand and Mr Butana Komphela. Because Mr Watson mentioned that there was some youth facility where they are trying to get sport activities, soccer going at this youth facility on the BOSASA premises.  And that they would like the parliamentarian to see it because at that stage, nobody was really aware as to what the exact operations were.  Everybody thought BOSASA was just dealing with one thing but in fact it was a group of companies. The purpose of the visit was to the youth centre that catered for these juvenile offenders and also to establish to what extent sport played in the process of rehabilitation of these youngsters. The arrangements were made by Mr Watson.  I was requested by Mr Komphela to accompany to him, which I have one on numerous occasions before to other events and other meetings. Because as you may be aware that Mr Komphela has a physical disability and requires assistance and he was comfortable with me travelling with him.  And as such, over the years we have established a very close friendship both as comrades and also as friends.   The visit to Johannesburg to BOSASA, Mr Watson specifically requested me since I was going to be in Johannesburg to meet with a potential sponsor for Eastern Province Rugby Union in Johannesburg. We got to the BOSASA offices.  We went straight into the office.  I assume it was the office of Mr Watson.  And Mr Komphela was not happy with the programme that was arranged for the visit because it was said it will be quite a lengthy visit and it will require a bit of time for us to spend there. And since both of us had other commitments, we were not prepared for such a long visit and the specific reason why this visit was undertaken was in fact to go to the youth centre but those arrangements were not part of the plan. During that visit, we had a discussion with Mr Watson because I know Mr Gavin Watson.  I have known him through his family.  I have regularly gone to their houses.  Politically they have been supporting us all the years.  So we had discussion about other things. And Mr Watson started complaining terrible about the bad treatment that he was getting from parliament specifically.   He claimed that he was writing on behalf of his company numerous letters to the Portfolio Committee and Correctional Services and he does not even get a reply or a response to the letters. He then also indicated that there is a narrative out that is in the media where the Portfolio Committee is giving an opportunity for certain information to be put in front of them without hearing the other side of the story. We then discussed it and we said that the best way we should approach it was to approach Mr Smit directly and I undertook to do it after the discussion with Mr Komphela because also at the social level, I am friends with Mr Smit and we were also together as colleagues in parliament. What happened during the interaction was when we were sitting there, I said but it is important if you want to go and visit the chairperson of a committee or parliamentary committee to write a letter and ask for an opportunity to do so. And Mr Watson reiterated and said but there is no     Okay.     Then I am happy.     No, thank you Chairperson.  That was also my understanding.  So I will proceed ...[intervenes]      ...with the arrangements that was made then for the visit to parliament.     Mr Watson then called me to say that they have sent the documents some time ago already and there was no reply.       Mr Agrizzi.     Mr Watson.     He said he will come with the chairperson of the board, Mr Njenje to meet.     So we did not expect that.  So on a specific day, the meeting was arranged and I can clearly recall that I received a call from Mr Watson where he said he is not coming anymore but there are two people from his company and they are lost somewhere in parliament. I found them in the passage and took them to my office and then I went to inform Mr Smit that they were there.  Mr Smit then said he does not really have time because he had another meeting to attend but he will quickly give them an ear and that is what he did. He came in the office.  He extends and introduced one another.  At that specific point, my secretary came to call me out of my office because there was a sitting of parliament in the afternoon. At the time, I was also the programming work and it had something to do with the speakers’ list for that afternoon that we quickly needed to be resolved because it was about lunchtime.   I then stepped out into the office just across from me to sort out the problem and on my return, they were no longer there.  They had left.   So I walked down the passage and towards the exit and I found Mr Njenje and Mr Agrizzi there, standing there and I     ...that emanated in the evidence that was given to this Commission by Mr Agrizzi on his first appearance and it deals with the accommodation of Minister Masutha.   Shortly after the 2014 General Election, I was deployed by the African National Congress in the Eastern Cape as the convenor of the Basil February Detachment that conducts sectoral work amongst minority communities in the province.   A number of other members of parliament, members of the legislator and councillors were at the time members of the detachment. And as the convenor I regularly interacted with the Provincial Secretary’s office on the work that we are doing as well as the relevant executive council members that at municipal, provincial or national government level to intervene where we see blockages in service delivery and resolve these issues. My responsibilities also include, because I am still the convenor of that detachment Chairperson, the organising of sectoral activities, networking events and securing the relevant members of the executives to attend these events. In the run-up of the 2016 Local Government Elections, the detachment did extensive work in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan area because of our assessment that we are in trouble in that metro. Issues raised by the community and sectors related to issues such as the recognition of the Khoi San, allocation of fishing rights, gangsterism, challenges related to the Criminal Justice System, the non-payment of maintenance that is received by courts to the beneficiaries and so forth. The detachment then decided it would be important to get the relevant minister or deputy minister to come and to address these issues. Because we were in the final stages for the preparing for the Local Government Election Rally, the launch of the ANC election manifesto for the local government that was held in Port Elizabeth subsequently. I conveyed the views of the detachment to the regional office and requested that they secure the relevant deployments but found it was difficult to secure the necessary confirmations from the relevant ministers and deputy ministers. I informed the detachment that we have difficulties and     That is correct.     That is correct.     Correct.     Correct.     That is correct.     I do not agree with you.        The role of the Portfolio Committee as an extension of the National Assembly in terms of the powers also that these committees have, they have the authority to call anyone not only the executive.  They exercise oversight over the executive but they can call anyone and, if necessary, summon anyone to come and appear in front of it and, as such, their programmes are in their hands and they execute it in terms of those rules.     Well, their responsibility is to exercise oversight over the executive.     Right.          That is correct.     I can recall, sir, that in terms of the affidavit as I submit it, that I up to today cannot recall.  The first time that I met Mr Agrizzi, was when he arrived in parliament.  He was not part of the deliberations that day.        Well …[intervenes]     No, what I am specifically saying, sir …[intervenes]     Oh, my apologies, Chairperson.     My apologies.     Now, I can – the context in which I used recall is that Mr Agrizzi was not present during that meeting or discussion.  Three people were there, was Mr Gavin Watson, myself and Mr Komphela.     Chairperson, if I may?     That is exactly the context because we must keep in mind that the incidents referred to here happened in 2010.     And I no longer got a fresh mind and memory that I used to have.     So it is in that context.     That is his recollection, sir.      I wish restate as the Chief Justice – Deputy Chief Justice, my apologies, I must get used to swinging around.     Beauty is in the eye of beholder, Chief Justice, if prettiness.  I fully agree with him.  No, I wish to restate as you correctly summarised it, Chief Justice.  If Mr Agrizzi comes and he can provide proof that he was part of that discussion then I can possibly refresh my memory or – and given the specific circumstances and then I will be able to deal with it.     Now can you just tell the Commission this, do you confirm that Mr Komphela had to be driven around in a golf cart?     On the visit that I am referring to?     Mr Komphela was not driven in any golf cart.  He did not go anywhere out of that office that day.       Yes.     He used his crutches.     The confirmatory affidavit of Mr Komphela confirms my first affidavit that I submitted.        Well, what I know is, is that the affidavit that Mr Komphela is referring to is the first affidavit that I just went through with you now, Adv Notshe.  That is …[intervenes]     That he is referring to that affidavit, my first one as it appears on page 8, I think, or – let me just get the paging right.  Actually started on page 31.     No, in total I think it is – with the condoning of it, it is about four different …[intervenes]     Four different affidavits.       I do not know if Mr Komphela had a look at the affidavit of Mr – I do not think so.  What I know is, is that Mr Komphela was following the proceedings of the Commission and then I indicated to him that I am submitting an affidavit to respond to the allegations and he agreed with me that that is the correct sequence of events as it unfolded.     In terms of his affidavit he agrees to what I say that as far as his recollection is concerned, Mr Agrizzi was not part of the discussions that took place that I referred to in my affidavit that I just went through.     That is – what he is saying is, as far as his recollection is concerned, unless proven differently, of course, I cannot speak on his behalf, but he concurred with my response in the affidavit as it is there, Chairperson.      Sir, what I can say as far as that is concerned, Chairperson, is that as far as my recollection  goes is that Mr Komphela did not even leave the meeting room because it was such a short engagement that we have.     What I am saying is, is that as far as my recollection goes, Chairperson, is that Mr Komphela did not leave the room or office that we were sitting in.     As far as I can recall, Mr Komphela did not stand up.  Mr Komphela was seated.        As far as I can recall, best of my recollection, Chairperson, he did not take a call.     I asked him specifically that either he himself or me leave that venue that day and he said that he cannot recall that we ever left.  We came in together and we left together.     Since he said that he cannot recall leaving the office the issue of the door never arose, Chairperson, of doors being held for Mr Komphela.        Mr Komphela is clear that my version that I am giving is also the recollection that he have of the meeting that took place, Chairperson.     Mr Komphela, in terms of his recollection, confirms what I say in my affidavit, Chairperson, that I had no side discussions with Mr Gavin Watson.  There was no need to have side discussions with anyone.     As far as …[intervenes]     As far as I recall, Chairperson, if Mr Agrizzi comes and he gives concrete evidence of what has happened, so that we can look at it then we can interrogate that evidence that is there but my recollection is as it stated in my affidavit.          No, I cannot speak for Mr Agrizzi, Chairperson.  I do not know what he recalls and can recall and cannot recall so unfortunately I cannot comment on the recalling ability of Mr Agrizzi.     No, I dispute what Mr Agrizzi’s version of events is, Chairperson.     I can confirm, Chairperson, that as far leaving the office room and as far as Mr Komphela, a door being held for him, those things definitely did not take place.  My recollection is, is that both of us remained inside in that office until we left.      Mr Komphela’s affidavit …[intervenes]     Well, Chairperson, my version of events is that Mr Agrizzi was not part of that meeting.  That was confirmed by Mr Komphela as well.  My version is, is that I never left that boardroom or office with Mr Watson for a side meeting or anything.  As far as my recollection goes, Mr Komphela remained in that office and that is what Mr Komphela in his affidavit is exactly saying.     That is correct, Chairperson, I was requested by Mr Komphela to accompany him and that is the reason why I went there.     Mr Komphela requested me to accompany him, I was – Mr Cheeky Watson indicated that Mr Komphela wanted to visit the facility and asked me am I going to accompany Mr Komphela, which I did, and that is how we ended up at the offices.     That is correct.        That is correct.     Chairperson, it is not as if I did not know Mr Gavin Watson, I know him for a – I knew him for quite some time before that and the nature of politicians are that then they sit in a discussion and different matters come up and you interact with that because we are not only politicians or member of parliaments serving on specific committees but you do have interest broadly in what is taking place.  So if a member of the public or anyone comes to you to complain about the lack of social services then you cannot tell that person I am the member of a Sport and Recreation committee, that is – I cannot comment on that, it has got nothing to do with me, and that is - was the nature of the discussion.    Chairperson, as far as my recollection  goes, Mr Watson was there inside the discussion that we were having.  That is the best that I can recall and, as I said, it was a short engagement and as far as my recollection goes, he did not leave that room.          No, Chairperson, I did not see a vault.     I was not taken around the offices, Chairperson, to show me the layout of the office and where this and that are.  We arrived and we went specifically into the one office.     Chairperson, I cannot recall, beyond my recollection for Mr Watson.  I have just indicated as far as my recollection is, he was part of the discussion and he did not leave the meeting.        Chairperson, as far as those travel costs are concerned, the original arrangements was made by, as I indicated earlier, by Mr Cheeky Watson, and I had a second task and that was to go meet with a potential sponsor as well.  So I was under the impression that that was the arrangements that was made by Mr Watson and that is as far as I can recall those arrangements that were made. I also wish to indicate, Chairperson, that when Mr Agrizzi made these different comments and things, I once again approached Mr Watson and I said to him but this – what do you say this stands, he struggled because he was no longer involved with Eastern Province Rugby at the time, he struggled to recollect and what to say and this, that and the other and that is why I also stated in my last declaration that I made to the National Assembly that since Mr Watson could not remember that there could have been a possibility, could have been a possibility that BOSASA paid the costs.     Which is the latest affidavit you are referring to, Advocate?     August?        Oh, the one that was not part of your records?     Is it now in the bundle?     Yes.        Oh yes.  Okay, I am with you, Advocate.     Well, what was presented to me and what I was made aware of – and that did not appear in the original evidence that was given by Mr Agrizzi here in front of the Commission, is that there were supplementary affidavits forwarded amongst other from Blake Travel where they stipulate things.  So I said to Mr Watson, Cheeky, can you remember these things that were there?  And he said no, man, those were things that through my office we have arranged and then he also said but in certain cases you came and you paid, right.  At that stage I realised that the Blake’s Travel that they were referring to here in the Commission, and it was confirmed also by Mr Watson then, is the same Blake’s Travel that is being used by BOSASA.     Mr Cheeky Watson Chairperson when I took him through the list of things and he said no all of these things were things that were arranged for your travelling in terms of the arrangements for Eastern Province Rugby or in other instances I would ask them to make a booking, they would come back with the invoice and somebody in the office will call you and say that you must either pay Eastern Province Rugby now, pay them or you must make out a cheque to the travel agent.          No, Chairperson.      I asked him but how could it happen that the BOSASA issue and the work of Eastern Province Rugby got mixed with one another and he indicated to me to say that the Blake’s Travel Agency very often took a lot of time before they would send invoices through to Eastern Province Rugby and that is what they dealt with in the administration.  I was not told by Mr Watson that BOSASA is making this payment or making that payment.        No, Chairperson.      No.      That is correct sir.      Chairperson if I was handed anything since Mr Komphela was with me then Mr Komphela would have been aware of that, he would have seen it.       I already indicated to you sir as far as my recollection go that Mr Komphela did not leave the meeting venue and did not have a phone call as far as I can recollect.       No, I cannot recall that happening Chairperson, I cannot recall that.      Chairperson I have indicated earlier Mr Agrizzi was never there, he was not there in our discussions he was not part of the discussions taking place.  So from where would he appear all of a sudden to come and hold a door.  I do not know from where he was making his observations, I cannot speculate.      I do know Mr Valance Watson, yes.      I have been to his place a number of times, Chairperson.       I cannot recall that Chairperson, I really cannot remember and that is why I also stated it in my affidavit.     That is correct.      That is correct.      I have read that sir.      But that is what I state in my affidavit, yes.      Chairperson as I stated earlier that when we deal with matters we are not restricted so that question did not arise to ask but why are you now dealing with matters of this nature, it did not arise.       Mr Watson referred to the – they were apparently busy with the juvenile’s section and the youngsters who are there in the youth centre to get them involved with activities not in rugby as Mr Agrizzi states in his affidavit.  It has nothing to do with rugby and what he said was that the difficulty they have with these recreational things is that it is expensive, it is not very well supported from people outside and there is no government support so he does it on his own as part of his social responsibility to the youth centre that is there.   He also stated that they were in the process of establishing a football/soccer team so that they can participate and he would wish that he can get support for that as well and it is part of his attempt to then give the other side of what the company is really doing and it is not sees only with the matter only of correctional services.         That is correct.      Chairperson Mr – in the discussion Mr Komphela said that Mr Smith is a very stubborn person and since I know him better maybe I should discuss the issue with him as far as a possible a visit is concerned so that they can deal with their matters as far as the attempts that they have made in the past to make submissions to have a meeting that proved to be fruitless and it is from that point of view that I approached Mr Smith and asked him if he would participate or want to be part of such a meeting.   And as I have earlier indicated he said there is a lot of problems there and this and that and I said that it is important also just to give them a hearing you do not need to agree with them on anything that is being done but since the matters are then ventilated if it is possible give them – just listen to what they have to say you do not need to work with them, you do not need to agree with them for that matter.     He said they were dealing with problems as far as the BOSASA and correctional services issues were concerned.      Chairperson it was common knowledge at the time that when I became the Chairperson of committees that there were issues in correctional services because it was not only them who were dealing with the matter I know at a time the steering committee on public accounts also had certain issues that they raised as far as the BOSASA correctional services matter is concerned.      I follow what you are saying Chairperson, I follow.     Chairperson as I said that the reason why we visited was to focus on the youth centre that we were told about that is there operating so well they doing such excellent work.  And maybe they I do not want to speculate on behalf of Mr Agrizzi and the late Mr Watson maybe they had also an intention to share with us the other difficulties that they may be experiencing as far as their company is concerned but that was not our intention.        I cannot agree with that Chairperson because if Mr Agrizzi was not part of what we were discussing inside the office how can Mr Agrizzi then have a recollection of that and how can I agree with that.  I do not know what the discussions were between whoever were left there after we left, so I do not agree with that.        Maybe I misunderstood you sir.      No, Chairperson I was not part of those discussions that took place so I cannot attest to that.      Yes.      Chairperson as I said and I clearly indicated to this Commission what our intention purpose were for that and also then subsequently throughout to what we were discussing that he mentioned the difficulties that he had and I also said that Mr Agrizzi was not part of those discussions.  So I do not know what discussions Mr Watson had subsequently with Mr Agrizzi.        Chairperson it can only be that Mr Watson had that discussion with Mr Agrizzi and shared with him what we were discussing amongst ourselves and that is probably where Mr Agrizzi got his information from.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.       The only way that he could have known about the discussion I do not know where else he could have heard it from.     Because we were not in discussion at any stage in – with Mr Agrizzi.    He was not in the meeting Chairperson.    He must have heard it from someone.    Chairperson as I have stated earlier this is my recollection of events that occurred way back in 2010 right and I am saying that as far as my recollection or recall for the lack of a better word is Mr Agrizzi was not part of our discussions.    So he was not part of the meeting.    Chairperson.    Chairperson as far as my recollection goes.    As far as I recall he was not there.    That is correct Chairperson.    But Chairperson as I have indicated that he could have only heard it from someone else.  He could have only heard it from someone else because if my recollection is that he was not there then he must have heard it from Mr Gavin Watson.    Can you just repeat the question?    Chairperson I – my scenario is that as far as my recollection goes Mr Agrizzi was not part of that discussion or in the meeting.    The [00   Excuse me – my apologies.    That is correct Chairperson.    Ja.    That is correct.    Chairperson when I arrive at – even if it is my friend’s houses I do not walk around in their houses.  I move from the reception door to the lounge area wherever you going to sit.  So that is how I know the house of Mr Watson.    No Chairperson I am not aware of a gym.    I am not aware.    Chairperson as far as I know is that I have – it is quite a big house that Mr Valance Watson is staying in and unlike the courtesy that was extended to Mr Agrizzi to show him a gym I have never seen a gym there.  I was not shown so I am not aware of any gyms in the premises.    I do not know.  I do not know.    Chairperson as far as my recollection goes Mr Watson has a lounge suite.  Now whether it is beautiful or not I do not know.  I cannot say.    As far as my recollection goes Chairperson of the house of Mr Watson and I have the area to where I is there is a lounge suite that is brown in colour.  That is what I know.    There is a lounge suite.    With a brown colour yes.    Chairperson I beg your indulgence to say that the area that I know the house of Mr Valance Watson is in fact Milpark.    In Port Elizabeth.    I do not know an area called Waverley in Port Elizabeth.    There is no residential area called …    Well Chairperson as far as Mr Watson’s house is concerned.    That area there.    That is I am saying…    I know it as – I know the area the suburb that Mr Watson stays as Milpark.    Chairperson I do not know what the Persian carpet what is meant.  I know there is – there is carpets in his house whether it is Persian or not I know there is carpets in Mr Watson’s house.  Part of the house is carpeted.    Yes.    Chairperson as I have stated I have been to that house of Mr Watson numerous times and I cannot recall being in a meeting with Mr Agrizzi in Mr Watson’s house.  Once again taking into account that this happened – in fact I do not even know what the date of the meeting is. What year it is that Mr Agrizzi is referring – maybe you can assist me if you have that information?  What date it is that this meeting took place and also the time that the meeting took place and that can possibly assist me.  But just to say that there was a meeting and this and that I cannot recall the version that Mr Agrizzi gave.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is my evidence Chairperson I cannot recall that. And as I have said if I could get more particulars and specifics Mr Agrizzi if he says it happened then he must have details of that visit as to when it happened.  And that – that is my best recollection of what I have as far as that statement of his is concerned.    I checked with Mr Watson.    Mr Watson also cannot recall such a meeting taking place.  He said no.  I asked him and he said no he cannot remember that.    His direct words was that he cannot remember such a meeting taking place Chairperson.    He simply said that he cannot remember such a meeting taking place.  He said – he said to me when I asked him, he said there is people coming in and out of his house who are working for his brother or whenever they in PE or whatever so he said he cannot recall this specific instance that is being referred to here.    That is what he says yes.    Chairperson…    Chairperson as far as I know and even when this money thing is concerned I have never received money from what Mr Agrizzi is referring to here from Mr Watson.  Even where there is other people there or not I – I have not – I have not received that.  Mr Watson simply said and I am going to use his direct words if I may?    He says Angelo is talking nonsense.  That was his direct words. Because I asked him.  This man says I got money from you in a meeting that he was in.  And he said no.  He said no.    He says no.    He simply says no he never ever passed money onto me in the way that is being referred to here by Mr Agrizzi.  That did not – that did not happen right.  As far as meetings and things are concerned he says he cannot even recall that taking place.    I – I did not request any confirmatory affidavit from Mr Valance Watson Chairperson.  Maybe if is Mr Valance Watson is requested to make available an affidavit you can find out.    Mr Valance Watson when I discussed these matters with him as a family they are very upset with the fact that firstly their brother Gavin Watson died under mysterious circumstances and they have a particular view.  And I do not want to – I do not share easily into what they discuss as a family.  I am not involved in those type of discussions but you can see whenever the situation is – if he gets angry he is very upset and he is agitated with the allegations that Mr Agrizzi is making.   ADV NOTSHE     I did not request any affidavit – confirmatory affidavit from his Chairperson.  I asked him actually what is our view in terms of interacting with – because it is mentioned – it was – a lot of things are being said or whatever.  And he simply said to me that he is still consulting with their legal advisors on the matter.  And given that answer Advocate Notshe I did not pursue the matter any further.  Because if he says they are consulting as a family on the matter with their attorneys then I cannot enter into the space to say and give me then a confirmatory affidavit.    Chairperson I do not want to go into the dynamics of that family which is quite a sensitive issue.  Yes they are brothers but the levels of interaction is completely different from one another.  I do not want to – to go into that.  They will be in a better position to explain that.    I do not remember that Chairperson.  That is the version of Mr Agrizzi for whatever reason he is mentioning it in that way I cannot remember that.    That is correct.    That is also what I questioned Chairperson in terms of the version of events as Mr Agrizzi said.  Logic tells me if that you coming there with this load of money that you give to somebody why would you give it to something – someone else and then that one gives it to someone else.  That is the – I simply in terms of what I state in my affidavit say that.    It does not make sense.    I understand what you saying.    Yes.    Well my view Chairperson is that I struggle to follow the – why Mr Agrizzi would come to this type of conclusion around money that was passed from one person to the other side.  I do not know what his thinking is in terms of what he has put to the commission.  Because I share a different – a completely different perspective in terms of the approach of this thing.    No I follow what the Chairperson.    I follow what Advocate Notshe is bringing to the fore.    But…    It did not happen.    So what is the question Advocate?    No I do not agree.  I do not agree with that Chairperson.  I – my – if I must go back.    To after the meeting that took place Chairperson at BOSASA is that we returned to Cape Town.  I returned to Cape Town personally and it was in Cape Town because we had duties to fulfil there and it was during that period that I had interaction with Mr Smith.  This thing of a meeting in Port Elizabeth at Mr Valance Watson’s house I do not know where it fits in or where it comes in and that is why I say that maybe if – since Mr Agrizzi kept such meticulous record of the gym and furniture in the house and all of that then surely he must know the date that this meeting took place in Port Elizabeth.    I…    No, no.  So I cannot – I do not understand where this meeting fits into after the engagement from …    There is no date.    It is long ago Chairperson but that – this type of incident that is referred to here it would have assisted me if the specifics were available.    Because I know I was in Cape Town and it was within probably two weeks after being to the office there that Mr Agrizzi and – and that is the first time by the way that I met him.  Mr Njenje came to Cape Town and I cannot – I do not know where this fits in.  And that is why I say give me more details but I can definitely say Sir that.    That is correct.    That is my submission Chairperson.    And that is why with respect that is why I say this episode now of Port Elizabeth.    And Waverley coming in.    I really cannot remember that Sir.    Yes.    Yes.    No Chairperson I – as I said earlier I have never served on that committee.  Never ever served on that committee and after that visit that took place and I think Mr Agrizzi also if I am not mistaken in his verbal evidence that he gave – when they reported back to Mr Watson that they were not happy with the outcome of the discussion.  And after that I had no reason to be further interested in the matter as it is – as that specific matter is.  Not meaning that I seized my inter – friendship with Mr Watson and his brothers and all of that.  The friendship still continued.  And even up to today we are friends.    Mr – after the visit to Parliament and Mr Gavin Watson was not part of it.  He called me and he said to me you have heard that the meeting did not go well. These guys said they just left nothing happened.  And that was the time when he called me to say that it did not work.  They tried to engage but – have a discussion with the Chairperson of that committee but it did not work.  That was basically almost I think if I can remember well almost on the same day or the following day.    That was it.    No.  You know what Chairperson I think and I want to make use of this opportunity of the type of person that the late Gavin Watson was.  A very persistent person.  Very persistent person probably that is why he got involved in business and things like that.  But Mr Watson always had a passion for what he was doing and he believed in what he was doing and the way that he was doing it.  So that even on occasion when you discuss the broader politics of which he followed in the ANC and call you and he will come and he talk about this or that.  Or when the – the sport situation in the Eastern Cape unravelled, did not work out he would speak to me.  He called me, speak to me and say, but you know what why you guys – because at one stage I left Eastern Province Rugby I resigned.  I think it was 2014 I left     Chairperson, with respect.  Is it possible just to ...[intervenes]      ...to answer a call from nature.     Even shorter, Chairperson.     It is up to you.     Okay.     Mr Smith agreed, he said when they are there he should – he will be able to join them.     Well...     Well, Chairperson, I can recall that after mentioning it to Mr Smith he said no, it is fine, he will meet with them and he never came back to me to say that he felt ambushed or unannounced or whatever in terms of the engagement that took place there.     Well, what I indicated to him, Chairperson, was that they would be in Cape Town as they have said and it was Mr Watson, would be in Cape Town during the course of that weekend.  He said no, it is fine.     I will meet whether – so it was not a specific thing that was set down.     As going to meet, they were in Cape Town, they said – because Mr Watson was not there, Mr Agrizzi and Mr Njenje came.  So I was also surprised when the two of them came and no the one that actually asked for the meeting.  So they said they would be in Cape Town and then I said, after having spoken to Mr Smith he said no, it is fine, he will meet them.  So there was no – not a specific agenda or date set down for this to take place.  They said during the course of the week they will be there.     It is possible, yes.     Ja.     Chairperson, I did not engage with Mr Smith again on the matter because I did not want to come across to put him in a situation where he was not comfortable or upset with that meeting that took place, however short it may be, so I did not discuss the matter again with him, I just left it there.     Yes, I have said earlier, Chairperson, that the Portfolio Committees - that is one of their responsibilities, Advocate, in terms of overseeing the executive but given the broad powers that the rules of parliament give then they can basically do whatever they decide.     No, of course, it is not helpful to do that and that is why in terms also of the rules that are there it is very, very clear in terms of what their roles and functions are.  We generally – generally, when the committees engage with any entity whether it is the governments or entities or individual persons you would expect them that they must always be cognisant of that.     Chairperson, I responded to Mr Watson as a friend who needed advice because he has always been complaining about this thing, he is losing business, they are taking things from – they are dropping standards, he will complain about a lot of different things so I simply said that listen here, if you guys feel you have a case, proceed but it is your decision that you should take.  It is your decision that you should take and you must decide what you must do, I cannot tell you whether to go this way or that way.     Chairperson, as I said in my affidavit, I responded to say that it is your decision, I cannot – and I did not give them any instruction to drop litigation in terms of anything that they were busy with because I did not even know what the extent of the matter is because I was not privy to that type of information and I responded to him as a friend and said that you want to do business, look at what your strategy is in dealing with the matter, consider the options that are there but ultimately it is your decision, you can take that decision, sorry.       What I said was that since the operations, as Mr Watson always referred to, they do work for social development, they do this, they do that and what informed me to say that to them is I know in litigating government departments take very, very long and it usually has an impact in terms of your relations with the different government departments that are there and that is why I said it is your decision but just be aware.     That is correct, Chairperson.     You must decide.     Chairperson, Mr Watson on previous occasions when he would call and he raised different things and say that he is going to take them to the cleaners and this and that, so he mentioned it a few times to me.  Mentioned it a few times to me and I did not ask him why he is calling me.  My understanding was that he called me because of the collegiality, friendship that is there between us and the fact that you could see that he was very, very frustrated with what was happening around him and I did not pose that question to him why are you calling me?     Chairperson, there is four of those brothers and the one who would call me, apart from Cheeky and Valance, would regularly contact me about different things what is there.  Just as an example, Chairperson, as I have indicated earlier, Mr Watson was very concerned in 16 as we were heading towards the local government elections and I want to contextualise this.     Is that at that stage the operational centre from where the ANC Local Government elections campaigns was running from, was in fact based at the BOSASA campus or whatever they call it, right?  And then he would call me because we use a system, the cloud system, where from across the country the different branches and election structures can upload information in terms of what they were doing for the day or for the week. So he would stand there and he would call me and he would say that I do not see anything happening in Port Elizabeth, especially in – there is a certain area in Port Elizabeth we call the Northern areas that is vital in terms of the swing as to which party is going to get the majority and he would say that but there is no information coming through and I would tell him, no, no, we are sending the information through, it is coming through.  He says but I am standing here, there is no information here, there is absolutely nothing here.   Or, as we went – he had keen interest in what was happening in our movement and structures as we went to the 2017 conference of the ANC at NASREC.  He would always call to find out what is happening with – you guys, you do not even have proper branches, when are you going to do this, what are the balance of forces, which way do you think it is going to go?  So we would engage on those things.     Excuse me?     Not the slates, we did not discuss the slate but he had keen interest as to – Chairperson, I will ignore that comment.     So we would call – excuse me.     So he would call me and he would raise these issues continuously and say that but, you know what, I have heard in terms of the balance of power and the ANC, it is shifting this way, or it is shifting that way.   And even when, as the conference was unfolding, he would call and say what is happening now?  Is it true what they are reading on social media and things that is taking place?  So he had keen interest as far as that is concerned. Also, as went to the general election after the 2017 conference – and remember, we had the change in the head of state as well in February that year, so he would call, we would discuss those type of things, what is happening and – he also had very firm views around certain issues when I can recall there was a committee that was looking into the issue of land expropriation without compensation and he had a certain view as to what it can or cannot do to the economy of the country and he would call and he would give his view like this and you cannot do this or why do you not try this and that and that?  So he really had interest in those type of things even as we moved towards the 2019 general election that was taking place. So he would call – sometimes he would get me, other times he would not get me or I would return the call to him and that was the nature or our relationship.  If he, for instance, with the – there is one incident I can also remember with the Soccer World Cup that was taking place and he had a particular view about South Africa trying to put in a bid again and I said no, but it does not work like that, it is a little bit more complicated like that because he believed that the infrastructure that was there is not being utilised optimally in terms of the economy.     Yes.     I was never part of BOSASA, Chairperson, we would engage each other at that level and even if he then attempted to raise issues about the company I would say that no, wait, just hang on with that a bit, that is a particular issue that you guys must deal with internally so that you can look into the matter as to what is the best possible outcomes that you can achieve.     68?     Trying to get there but – yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     The print is a bit small.     Yes, yes, I have seen it.  Yes, I have seen it.     The 6/03?     2017.  Yes.  No, I do not remember having a discussion with Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  There was a particular matter I know when she subsequently – she referred it to me when she was in parliament that she was experiencing with the committee on Water and Sanitation that she was the head of department and you know sometimes part of my work also include facilitating, Chairperson, discussions between the Chairperson of a committee and a Minister if there are differences of opinion on how to proceed with the matter but I can also say that you have referred to a number of calls to and fro, we did not have sufficient time last night to go through this.  However, a number of them says no, there is call duration zero, zero, so …[intervenes]     I cannot recall getting a call from Ms Mokonyane.  As I have said, I recall a discussion more or less at that stage in 2017 around the committee matter that she was not happy with.     Yes, I returned a call and she was on voicemail.     On the 7 t h?     Ja, ja, I am trying to do that but it would have been easy if I had a ruler here to...     Thank you.       Chairperson, I see there is a number there.     083 and then it goes on and it ends with …[intervenes]     On 70, Chairperson.     Towards the right, towards the end where it is written Nomvula Mokonyane.     And there is a cell number that is in there, 26 and it ends with 44.  Can you see that Advocate?     And it is reflected as my number.  It is my number but it is a telephone that is used by one of my children who is very active in the ANC in the Western Cape.     Where Comrade Nomvula is one of the deployees, he is part of the – or was part of the University …[intervenes] .     ...thing and it – I am just saying that it could be discussion related to that [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I cannot dwell further into that.     Yes, I see that.     Jonas Joe Gumede is an old comrade who is working with or for or used to work at BOSASA.  Now let me contextualise that for you.  That was at the time as we were going towards the conference of the African National Congress in NASREC and there were certain services that were provided and Mr Gumede was also at that conference or he was coordinating some work towards that conference there but even there you can see that there was no discussion that could take place because a call duration in terms of the second is 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9.  So I remember seeing him, not as a delegate at the conference but he was one of the service providers who were there.     Well, I do not know why, I subsequently, even though I saw him, he just greeted and things and that was it.     Yes.     Yes, Papa is a person that also works or used to work in one of the subsidiary companies at BOSASA.     Yes and similarly, Papa Leshabane used to – I used to see him sometimes when he comes to parliament in Cape Town or on whatever business he is coming to do there and we would greet but that is – I cannot say it is a friend, it is more an acquaintance but in terms of the content of the discussions that was taking place there.  I cannot really recall what it was about.     Yes, no, he used to work there.     Who is that?     I do not know Mphaphuti Dlamini.     I know Papa for a long time because – and the first time I actually met Papa Leshabane was when he attended a funeral service of the Watson family in Port Elizabeth when the mother passed away.     Chair, but I – no, I really – no, I am not saying that there was no call but the thing is I cannot really remember what the discussion was or the reason was for that call.     I know Papa was also very passionate in attending these events and things that was happening, so I cannot recall that.     Seconds.     Chairperson, if I may?     I also indicated that we received this information late yesterday afternoon.     And initially we difficulties in terms of the spreadsheet and the way it was printed so we had to go to quite some length to get some idea as to what is everything in here.     I know Mr Leshabane, yes.     I know Joe Gumede.    That is correct.     I have met Sisinisio once.  I have met once when he was – or possibly on more than one occasion, if my memory serves me correct, when he was in Port Elizabeth and the place where I met him was when I went to a discussion with Mr Valance Watson and he was apparently in Port Elizabeth and he came in there.  So that is from that time that I know him and [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Excuse me?     No, I do not know.  You must keep in mind, Chairperson, that that number, that 0 – the 267, the 267 number is displayed on the website of parliament, business cards, everywhere.  That number is everywhere, so I cannot say with certainty he got the number from this one or that one.     No, I cannot recall, sir.  As I said, we did no really have even time to go into the depth of the document that was sent out yesterday afternoon.      That is correct, Chairperson.     As I have said earlier, if I may?     That he is the type of individual that basically was a person who – irrepressible, if you can call it that way, that you must continuously slow down and say no, no, no, wait.  Or it is something that really is not within my scope of doing it.     But we had that type of relationship and that is how I know those brothers, that is how I know them.  They are good friends of mine and that is the way they engage.     May I respond, Chairperson?     Yes, no, I understand.     Absolutely correct, Chairperson.     You must remember that Mr Smith was after the 24 t h in elections involved with the constitutional review committee and Mr Smith did two important tasks up to 2019.   The one was the inquiry that he headed into the SABC and the second one was all these public hearings that took place across the country to get the views of South Africans on the – also the amendment of the constitution to make the expropriation of land without compensation possible.   So as with Mr Smith and other Chairpersons who are busy with important processes, they will call for procedural advice or they will call and they will say the logistics are not in place or the hotels that members are staying in is of an – not of a good quality that we expect or the transport, this has happened, or there is a problem with the staff allocation or the oversight visits or the venues were not booked on time.  So they would call continuously and they call any time of the day or night, Chairperson.     And the nature of my work is, is that I must entertain them.     No, Chairperson what I do know is and you stated it correctly is that they definitely said that they had a problem.     They have a problem however if I may?     Portfolio committees have no powers to award and to withdraw contracts.     That is between the relevant department and the entities that are involved or the companies that are involved.  Portfolio committees do not get involved in allocating of the contracts, withdrawing of the contracts they can report and then secondly any matter that is raised in front of a portfolio committee cannot simply be swept under the carpet also they have a role and responsibility to play with it.  And that is why the standing committee especially when it comes to financial matters are concerned on public accounts are of such importance.  It happens now and then Chairperson that certain issues fall off the radius screen or there is certain things because portfolio committees they also in the law making business, they conduct all these different types of things that they do and in parliament we do not have that type of capacity where you can probe each and every contract that is awarded by the department for whatever reason, we do not have that capacity.  So committees rely a lot on what is presented to them right and to follow up then on the issues and then ably supported by the office of the Auditor General then.  The Auditor General will then flag and the committees will then zoom in specifically.  Also keep in mind Chairperson that the Auditor General does not audit all the books it takes a sample of what is there in the different government departments but it is impossible to hide a matter that is in front of a portfolio committee because the portfolios committees are all multi-party committees and in the case of SCOPA it is a committee that is led by as per our tradition and practice in parliament by a member of the opposition and that is the task and responsibility that they do.   And it does happen at times when there are issues that are arising that the two committees will work together they will confer on a specific matter and that is how they go about doing their work.     No, I agree with that Chairperson.     It is suffice to say that and maybe at another time in the Commission again because we are busy with another – I do not want to go into details with it you should be aware of it and when we come back that is a matter that we will go into great deal.     No, Chairperson I think it is important.     To get that view not from an organisational perspective but…[intervene]     But from parliament institution and the different political parties that are part of these type of processes.     I always remind people and when students also visit the institution I said this place that you walking in is not an administrative building this is a vicious political terrain that you are moving in.  Now without pre-empting Deputy Chief Justice committees report and they make very, very important recommendations.  In terms of the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive it then becomes the responsibility of the executive to follow up and to deal with the recommendations that was made by portfolio committees.   In the submission that we are looking at and that we will explore again is that that is the question that we posing.  If a committee reports then on all these things why did it not change, why was there no change in behaviour or if a certain company or entity has been accused of wrongdoing for years and whatever they continue doing business with the State or you find that you have what you call the – for a lack of a better word I do not want to call it recycling.  The movement of certain core personal where fingers are pointed at in a specific department and then they disappear for a while and then they just surface in another department again.  But that is the type of thing that we are looking at Deputy Chief Justice and we will make that submission.        That is correct Chairperson.         That is correct.      That is correct.         No, there is a youth centre but the way they packaged the visit included a number of other things and Mr Komphela was not comfortable about that.  So the centre is there and as I stated earlier the intention was to go and to see the youth centre but the way that the program was organised included basically the entire place where they do their operations there.         No they said that there would be a – they would require some type of transport or something because it involves extensive walking around the place and keeping in mind that Mr Komphela has a disability and he was very agitated actually, he was very, very agitated when he saw that no this thing is now a lot bigger that was agreed to and also he had to catch his flight back to Bloemfontein and the time allocation that was set aside for all of this to happen now was simply too much.        That is correct.       When I grew up Chairperson I did not grow up in all those suburbs, I grew up in the townships.       There is a suburb called Mill Park.      No, I do not know a suburb called Waverley.      No, I have never heard of a place called a suburb called Waverley in Port Elizabeth.     No, I did not receive money upon any visit of mine to – on that visit to BOSASA.          Just give me the page again Chair.         And the page Chairperson?        I have got it Chair.     No Chairperson I do not.     And especially when it comes to officials of any different departments and things I do not get involved with that type of detail so I really do not know what they are referring to.      Chairperson I see you want to close this session.     If I may just make a remark please I think it is important for the work of this Commission.        Because the Commission was initially faced with a number of challenges as far as the leaking of information is concerned of witnesses that was still going to appear.  I thank you for the opportunity to have come to give my version of what has transpired and so forth and I wish to indicate that on all the – not all the other dates there was a date in April if you can recall that I was supposed to come but then we went into lockdown.  Then there was a date in July again…[intervene]        But then I was part of the Covid situation that was that was there but I did receive a message the first time that I was going to appear here.        And I am not going to name any names Chairperson from a journalist and it was a text message that the journalist sent to me it is about the working of the Commission trying to imply and say you know what you are going to be charged for corruption who is your attorney that is going to represent you.  Why are you going now to the Commission to cross-question certain witnesses and do all these type of things and you already - a warning statement was taken and all of that, and I referred it to my lawyer that is there but I think it is very important Chairperson for you as the Chairperson of this Commission to be aware of the attempts to drive the narrative from the outside which I really think is undermining the work of this Commission and it will make it very, very difficult for the Commission to proceed in terms of its mandate and what they and when they need to report.  I do not want to go into historical issues that are there but I just thought I wanted to put it on record that that is what has occurred. 
MR VAN ZYL:   Chair, if I may interrupt?  Perhaps to get the chronology correct.  If the witness can just tell you from when he had this relationship with Mr Gavin Watson and the other Watsons. 
FROLICK: And to keep executive members accountable, that is one of their responsibilities.   Chairperson, the nature of these arrangements between Blake Travel, I did not get involved in the operational issues.  You will be told that there is travelling arrangements that has been made and will be going there and in executing those tasks, you are under the impression that it was arrangements that was done by the office of Mr Watson and Eastern Province Rugby Union.  It only arose later, only arose later when here was a specific payment of from the office of EP that they came and they said there is an amount that they must payment because that was the agreement between me and the Eastern Province Rugby that if there a personal costs involved, for instance, if I struggle to secure a flight or whatever, then I will say to them make arrangements for me and give me the invoice then I will pay for it and in such instances I would go and on more than one occasion I paid the money to Eastern Province Rugby.  I did not formal check of its small amounts in cash.   Yes, no thank you Chairperson, Chairperson as I stated the intention of that visit and that is why we did not proceed with it, we did not proceed with the visit because they wanted to take us on something like a four-hour thing of the entire complex and whatever they are doing and we said but where is the issue then of the youth centre and they said they were not ready for that, right.   And it was not about as Mr Agrizzi stated rugby as I have stated Mr Watson spoke about soccer/football being there and other recreational activities that they are trying to introduce.  So our purpose was specifically that and it is because of that reason that we did not proceed in going ahead with that visit because it had also the element in it that you cannot just then walk into an entire setup that is there for four hours and you do not come to the youth centre that the primary purpose of it was and that the youth centre they are not ready to scale down the visit at least just to include that that was the intention of our visit.
