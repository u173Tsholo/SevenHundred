CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Good morning Mr Agrizzi, I am well thank you.  Mr Pretorius you ready to proceed?    Before you proceed I need to deal with the issue that I promised to deal with this morning first.  On Sunday this past Sunday a number of – or certain newspapers carried articles concerning evidence that Mr Agrizzi who was alreadygiving evidence before this Commission was yet to give.  It would appear that certain newspapers had access to a copy of Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit that is before the Commission.In some cases it may be that they did not have access to the affidavit itself, but were given information relating to the contents of Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit by certain people.  Obviously there was no problem whatsoever with them publishing articles concerning evidence that Mr Agrizzi had already given before this Commission, but they went further or some of them and published evidence that he was yet to give in the Commission.I want to start off by saying that I have the highest respect for manyjournalists and editors and newspapers who conduct their business professionally and in accordance with the law and with due regard to other people′s rights, however, it seems to me that there are certain journalists, editors and newspapers who decided that they would publish information relating to Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit about which he was still to testify and did so in breach of the regulation that I already told everybody about.  It was end of last year.  That is Regulation 11(2) and (3) of the Regulations applicable to this Commission.   He will clarify his question.  Mr Pretorius?    Who is “they” now?    Oh.    Yes, please.    Hm.    Alright …[intervenes].    Well if, if you say it is maybe confusing.  I am sure you are going to ask what I wanted to ask.  Go ahead.    Were they the only shareholders?    Oh, there were other shareholders?   Okay, but do you, was your understanding that together they formed, they held the majority of shares or not?    Okay, thank you.    Yes, thank you.    I am sorry, I am sorry.  Why do you say you do not even think Correctional Services knew themselves?    Oh, but then who issued the tender then?    Oh.    Oh, is that what would normally happen?    Okay.   Fences for Government departments?    Yes.    Ja.    Ja, okay.   Oh, is that normal?    Hm.    The fencing was, what was contemplated was that the fencing would be done for Correctional Services throughout the whole country.    Okay, alright.  Yes.    Did you say those companies that you are talking about would be the ones listed in 27.9?    Live Wire (Pty) Ltd, Gordian (Pty) Ltd, Mavundla Ironclad (Pty) Ltd, L J Civils (Pty) Ltd and you say there was another company which was represented bysomebody called Jaco Pitso.  You cannot remember the name of the company.    Okay, thank you.    So …[intervenes].    Yes.  I am sure, I am sure if it does not Mr Pretorius will ask further questions if he wants you to give more.  So basically what you are saying is there was a discussion involving Bosasa and Correctional Services in the form of Mr Linda Mti and Mr Gillingham that had preceded this arrangements being made.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, thank you.    Yes, do so if it is relevant to what we are talking about.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    I am sorry, I am sorry Mr; I think he has not finished.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    But you are saying what is more likely is much more than that.   Yes and if it took two days to do each one of them you are looking at probably more than 100 days ahead and probably much more than that.    Yes.    Just to confirm what I think you said already.  So the idea as you came to understand it was that for this particular tender that was going to be advertised in due course Bosasa did not want to be the ones who would submit a bid.  Phezulu would submit the bid and then Bosasa would benefit it effect and in reality through the arrangements that it would have made with Phezulu and with everybody else that you have told us about?    Thank you.  And that was because the negative publicity about Bosasa had already started, is that right?    Thank you.    So technically the shares would transferred to the trust?  I think you said two trusts?   Two trusts which fall under Bosasa or the Watson family, is that right or Mr Gavin Watson?    Yes.  Technically that is what they would be – the shares would be transferred to those trusts and then what those trusts did with them then it was up to them and – but that was – they were – those trusts were part basically for all intents and purposes of Bosasa?    Thank you.    For Phezulu now?    Ja on behalf of Phezulu?    Okay.    Were the two also there or they were not at – in that boardroom on that occasion?  That is Mr Mansell.    Did you say this was in the evening?    Okay.    Mavundla?    Mavundla as well?    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  At that stage what was Beta Fence’s roll or had it fallen by the wayside?    Oh Beta Fence was there okay.   Okay but they were going to be – that is Beta Fence they were also part of the companies that – they were one of the companies that were going to be part of the bid?    Ja, ja.    Ja, ja, thank you.    Which one was that?    Yes.  Those that were going to be sub-contractors I would imagine that Phezulu would disclose them in their bid to say in order to be able to execute this project properly and efficiently we will use the following companies as sub-contractors.  So my question is, was your understanding that their role as sub-contractors was goingto be made known to Correctional Services and to whoever in terms of it being public?    You cannot recall that?    Ja, ja okay but is my understanding correct that normally if you bid for a tender you would normally disclose whoever you will use as a sub-contractor or is that only sometimes?    Well I thought that Phezulu being the ones that would put in the bid may have wanted to be able to answer certain questions.  Maybe they might not have bothered about them being asked any questions in the circumstances like do you have capacity to do A,B,C,D if so how do you show us you have got the capacity?  So if they are going to sub-contract they then say we ourselves do not have that capacity but we are bringing on board a sub-contractor which has that capacity so if you give us the tender we will be fine.  I thought that then the whole scheme might still have contemplated that sub-contractors would be made public on that understanding but you are not sure?    Ja, okay, alright.    Not just a lack of capacity actually lack of experience as well in this kind of job?    Yes.    Yes thank you we will take the tea adjournment and we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. MEETING ADJOURNS MEETING RESUMES    Yes Mr Pretorius.   No that is fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Siyaya Fencing?    Okay that would be S-i-y-a-y-a Fencing?    Thank you.    Your – the bid documents the information that any company thatwanted to bid for this tender would have had to include information about all of these sites?    And would that be information that would be difficult to get unless you visited the sites or is it information that could be obtained by use of technology in one way or another?    Yes.    But that was 2005?    So whereas Bosasa we know that on paper their name was not going to appear in regard to this tender?    But in effect Bosasa and that was – that may have been intended – maybe I should say was on your evidence intended by certain individuals within Correctional Services to ultimately effectively benefit from this?  There Bosasa was given a number of months before even the tender was advertised or the bid – or bids were invited?    Yes and then anyone else would have had – or had only about sixweeks to submit their bid, is that right?    Ja thank you.  Do you know or do you not know whether this short period that was given to everyone else was deliberately intended to minimise the chances of anybody else putting up any tender that would really compete with effectively Bosasa’s tender although in the name of Phezulu?  Or was this the period that was normal to be given for tenders?    But with special reference to Correctional Services are you able to say what the normal period they normally allowed to bidders to put in their bids in regard to other tenders at that time?   Ja okay.    Okay thank you.    And what was the period for the submission of the – of the bids from the time of advertising or inviting bids?   Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay alright thank you.  And then of course if it is four weeks – if it was four weeks then on your evidence there is simply objectively speaking no way that any bidder would have been able you say to visit all these 47 sites?    Ja.    And it is not as if Correctional Services would not have appreciatedthis, is that so?    Thank you.    That – was that half a – more or less half a billion was that the value that was known to everybody at the time of bidding?   Ja okay.    Thank you.    Do you – do you know who were the trustees in the two trusts that ou have told about?    But you know some of them?  Would you  not – was Mr Gavin Watson not one of the trustees or not really?    Yes.   Okay.  No that is fine.    No that is fine, that is fine.    You designed it?    Yes, okay.    Yes.    You told us earlier on when we were dealing with the fencing…[intervenes]    Projects that at that time the National Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services was Mr Richmond Mti, is that right?    When this one was happening that you are now testifying about was he still the National Commissioner of Correctional Services?   Thank you.    Let me just go back a bit to the issue of one account.  As I understand you, you were saying there may have been a number of companies under Bosasa, but they shared one account, bank account, is that right?    That bank account who was the holder of that account, or whichcompany has its name on that account?    Okay, thank you.    Sorry, I thought you were spelling Nontsikelelo?    Oh, the name is here, I am sorry I did not see that.  Nontsikelelo.  It is in 29.2.    It may be Nontsikelelo that is a normal name rather than Nontsikelo.    No, that is fine.    Yes?    Yes?    Was she within Bosasa or from within Correctional Services?    No, that is fine.    Yes.    But she was raising that objection in a meeting?    In a meeting?    Now, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  So are you saying that the decision toextend that contract was taken in a meeting and you must – can you just say who was at that meeting if you are able to remember?    Or at least some of the people?    Ja.    Oh, okay.    Okay, okay, alright.    But you might need just to be careful with the word lodged, because Mr Pretorius had just used the word lodged in his question.  You had simply said that she objected now?    Now if you talk about lodging that implies there was a document containing the objection, is that what happened?    She raised an objection?    Yes, okay.    Yes.   You base it on knowledge?    Yes, on knowledge that you have.  Okay, alright, yes?    Okay, but at least as far as Mr Agrizzi is concerned Ms Schreiner raised an objection.    In what form might be another issue.    Yes, okay.    Okay, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am just looking at 29.5 with regard to Mr Mti′s resignation and what you said.  You have just told us that he resigned you think around November 2006.  The first line of sentence of 29.5 says after Mti′s resignation, during approximately 2007, I met Mti.  So the one idea that came to my mind is that the approximately 2007 related to the resignation, but it is possible that you – it is there to say when you met Mti for the second time?    That was the second meeting.    But what I am saying is that period that you are talking about?    Approximately 2007 does not relate to the resignation?    It relates to your second meeting with Mr Mti?    Okay, alright.    Okay, okay.    Yes, yes.    I am sorry just repeat that about the invoices being changed?    Yes.    Yes, thank you.  Thank you, it does.  Thank you.  You may proceed or …[intervenes].    I am sorry before that, so after the house had been built and furnished that is Mr Mti’s house is your evidence that the building, the building and the furnishing was never really paid for by Mti himself, but it was paid for by Bosasa?    Or he may have paid some portions or you do not know?    Okay.  Okay, thank you.    So we should just abandon that to a house close to …[intervenes].    [Indistinct], so we delete in and put close to, thank you.    No that is fine, thank you.    [Intervenes].    Well was one in Savannah Hills another one close to Savannah Hills?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Huh-uh.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm, ja.  Well I was about to ask you.  You said Riekele Construction had an interest in Autumn Storm Investments 119 (Pty) Ltd.  Who else had an interest in Autumn Storm Investments, if you know?    You do not know.  Okay, but your understanding is that Riekele heldthe majority of shares in that, in Autumn Storm Investments?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm, him.    Hm.   Now when this happened or when you discovered this was it during Mr Mti’s time as Commissioner or was it after he had resigned?    It was after.    Yes.    Hm, hm.  Okay, thank you.    And when was this meeting and where was it?    The one close to Savannah?    Oh, the one okay.    Yes, ja and when was it if you are able to remember?    Oh, okay.    Thank you.    Joking about Mr Mti?   Yes, but now as at the date of this meeting that you deal with in paragraph 29.6 Mr Mti had already resigned from, from Correctional Services is that?    Yes.  Now since he had already resigned from Correctional Services what was Bosasa or Mr Gavin Watson seeking?  What benefit did they seek to get from him in giving him more money in these grey security bags?  What could he still give Bosasa or was it arrears from earlier?    Well I think yesterday you told us that I think I do not know if, if it was Mr Magagula one of the members of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services, I think you told us that when he I think left the Portfolio Committee or left Parliament I am not sure payments to him stopped, but with regard to Mr Mti payments did not stopwhen he resigned from Correctional Services.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    I am sorry.    Did you just say till today or till to…?    Up to the …[intervenes].    Yes.    He was still getting paid?    Monthly?    Okay, thank you and that would have been, this was now you left Bosasa at the end of 2016.    Yes.    So that that, that actually was almost 10 years to the dot from when Mr Mti resigned from Correctional Services.  You said he resigned in November 2006.    So for about at least 10 years thereafter he continued to be paid.    Money.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes, okay thank you.    I, I think Mr Pretorius was simply looking at the tense.   You exactly had always, you know that is …[intervenes].    Up to that stage what you were, your understanding or what Mr Gavin Watson’s exact words prior to that he had always delivered.  So there was no reason to …[intervenes].    To doubt that he would deliver.    Whenever he was, he had made a promise.    And that is over what period more or less …[intervenes].    Yes.  So from around end of 2006 up the time that you left Bosasa in November 2016.    There were a number of times maybe 30 or thereabout.    When you accompanied Mr Watson to Mr Mti.    And on some of those occasions there would either you or Mr Watson would carry a grey security bag with money to hand over to him.  Is that what, is that more or less what you are saying?    Thank you.    Hm.    Well Polokwane Conference was, I think was in 2007.    Yes.    Okay.  Alright, Mr Pretorius.    So after Mr Mti had left Correctional Services is the position that there was nothing new that he was delivering to, to Bosasa?  It was simply that the contract that Bosasa had obtained or maybe I should say contracts that he had, Bosasa had obtained during Mr Mti’s time at Correctional Services was still going on and the, the arrangement was that as long as that contract was still going one should be paid.   Hm, okay.    Was your father-in-law alive at the time this account was used?   Oh, you just used the name.    Oh.    Oh, okay thank you.    Mr Pretorius I am looking for paragraph which deals with the payments of – payments for Mr Mti’s childrens studies?    Okay thank you.   Maybe before he does that Mr Pretorius are you able to recall how much money you gave Mr Joe Gumede for the purpose that he told you the purpose of getting rid of the criminal charge against Mr Mti?    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Okay no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius you can maybe repeat your question.   Did you not say your brother only did one invoice?    Oh okay.    Yes today we will sit until five in terms of the arrangement yesterday but I know nothing about – about that.    Yes carry on.    Yes.  From my side I do not mind if we adjourn at half past one if that is going to be convenient for catering and lunch purposes for the legal team but I am – I do not mind if we adjourn now either.    Okay alright.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius you may proceed.    Yes Mr Agrizzi.    Yes do that.    One second.  Yes.    Yes.    As is.    Yes.    Yes.    Are you able to say why it was necessary for the dividends to go to the attorney’s trust account first before they were transferred as they were to Bosasa’s account?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay thank you.      That is on page 60 of your affidavit.    Paragraph 29.5.8.    Yes.    And he agreed?    Thank you.    Now that reminds me the house that was built by Riaan Hoeksma’s company for Mr Mti do you have a recollection of what its value was more or less?    As of now or as at the time when it was built?    As of now.    Okay so it would be your estimate is that it would be around R18 million in value?    18.    Okay thank you.    Ja just before you proceed on that let me just complete the picture with regard to what we have referred to as Mr Mti’s house.    Is you evidence that ultimately Mr Mti lost out on that house.  It never got registered in his name as had been planned initially?    Even to this day?    He may have enjoyed the benefits of living in it but he paid rent which he – he thought would be returned to him but ultimately it was never returned, is that correct?    So he lost out?    Yes and that was mainly because the SIU had started working – investigating is it why he lost out?    And there was fear that if it was transferred to him it would just spell trouble?    Ja thank you.    So, so before he – before he left Correctional Services the department was paying his rent?    And after he had left the department Bosasa paid the rent by way ofincreasing his monthly payment or it just increased his monthly payment and he would then pay the rent himself?    Thank you.    He had been – okay maybe let me ask this.    In terms of time or year where are we now in regard to that meeting?   2007?    Okay so if you say Mr Khulekani Sitole used to be Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services that would have been before Mr Mti or even before that?    Ja but you will.    Okay alright thank you.  You may proceed.    Did you finish telling us the people who attended the meeting?    Okay thank you.    Regional Commissioner of Department of Correctional Services in Gauteng?    Oh okay.    So is what you are saying this that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss what was to be done about Mr Petersen’s refusal to have anything to do with Bosasa, is that right?    Ja, ja and you say it was agreed at that meeting that the – is it two or three correctional services people Khulekani Sitole, M Nxele is it – it was those two?    Ja that they would be paid an amount of R1 millioin which they would distribute among themselves or it would be paid in certain amounts that and you do not know what amounts but the amount for them was R1 million.  Was that R1 million per month?    Yes.    Yes.  But – oh I think Mr Pretorius is still going to come to it let me allow him to do that.    Okay maybe I will ask this before because I want to know it now.   But in terms of the agreement reached at that meeting what were the two people going to do in order to – what were they going to do for Bosasa because the National Commissioner was Mr Petersen and he wanted to have nothing to do with Bosasa, what were they going to do?  He was the top man, is it not?    Oh so what was thought was that they would do whatever was necessary to put pressure on Mr Petersen I guess to make sure that the attitude towards Bosasa changed?    Okay thank you.    The money that the two got Mr Khulekani Sitole and Mr M Mxele do you know what Mr Mxele’s full name is or was?    Oh okay.  So this R1 million was for the two of them as far as you understood or were they to share it with other people?    Does that mean that it was hoped that part of it would – that they would try and use it to try and get Mr Petersen to change his attitude or it was clear that Mr Petersen was not that type of person?    Yes so but.    Yes but what you are saying is they would use it for themselves but they would or could use it to help other – to get other decision makers within – within Correctional Services or to get other people who could put pressure to put pressure?    Okay.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    So you say that you ultimately you said to Mr Watson you were wasting money on these people, is it the two that you have talked about in the previous paragraph that you are talking about?    Is your evidence that they were not delivering?    Yes.    Yes and by the, and did Mr Watson agree that…[intervenes]    He did not agree.   So you continued paying them?    Okay.    Okay, well do you know how it was spelt?    Oh, okay.    Yes, okay.    To Nxele?    Yes.    The Correctional Services uniform?    Ja.    R57 500?    At the hotel now?    And those were the people who were at the meeting as well?    So it was three people?    Thank you.    So this is now in the months after that meeting.    Okay, alright.    In Durban.    Okay.    Oh, so you went to this meeting at Beverly Hills with a security bag containing money for him?    Yes, ja.    Yes.    Trevor being Mr Mathenjwa?    Okay.    So on that occasion you were present when the bag was handed over to him?    Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius, I do not know, you know sometimes when you read the transcript later, because the transcriber or the one typing the record does not know how a certain name is spelled, they can write things that do not relate towhat exactly happened.  Maybe we should spell some of the names that may be difficult for purposes of the transcriber, what do you think?    Ja, I am thinking particularly of Nxele, because it is Nxele, but the witness pronounces it not as Nxele and somebody who is typing the surname might write Nene or something else.  So it might help.    Nxele is Nxele[spelt].  Okay, let us move on, thank you.    I am quite happy as long as it is done, even if we do not do it here, just to make sure that when they type they have the right spelling so that, that can be done.  If there is another way doing it without us spelling the names here I am quite happy.    Mr Pretorius do you want him to give more of that evidence himself?    Okay, alright.    I am sorry.  When you say it is also signed by Mr Mti, are you saying the same document or a similar document is signed by Mr Mti?    Is the signature that appears at the right hand corner the bottom ofthe document at page 350, is that Mr Mti′s signature?    Does not interfere, is it interfere?    ″Or rather has no conflict of interest…″    Yes, Xoliswa.    Ja.    And what was the full amount for Mr Modise?    You cannot remember.    Okay, alright.    So who was at the meeting, yourself, Mr …[intervenes].    Yes and did you say this was at the Intercontinental Hotel at OR Tambo.    Is that, but that is the same hotel where you had met Mr Nxele atsome stage?    Yes.    Yes, okay.  Oh, mister, your meeting with Mr Nxele in the same hotel at some stage was in a restaurant in the hotel?    Yes, okay.    So, I am sorry.  Mister, did Mr Modise accept the, the money the bag, security bag and did he go with it?    Did he take it with him?    Okay, thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry.  I may have missed this.  Mr Modise was not one of those who were getting monthlypayments.  Was he?    At the time, he was?    Oh, okay.  Okay, thank you.    Yes.  Yes, Mr Pretorius.    What page is that Mr Pretorius?    The page no, the page where I would find that.    Thank you.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Thank you.    Ja.    Hm.    I think he wants to know what happened after that.    Hm.    The contents of the article.    I think Mr Pretorius is asking whether you are able to assist to say this is where she, he must have or he did get the information from.    Hm.  You, you had nothing to do with the information being given to, to him?    Yes, okay.  I think Mr Pretorius was just trying to see whether there might have been somebody inside who was giving the …[intervenes].    Yes.  Okay.    Okay.    Okay.  I think it is a point you have made also before to say the shareholding used to change very regularly.    Yes, okay.    Those or – I am sorry those on whom Bosasa decided should be spied on well was it those that were seen as having a negative attitude towards Bosasa or what?    Ja okay.    Okay.    I do not know if the two of you may have spoken at cross purposes just now but the conspiracy theories that you are talking about.    Were intended to defend/protect the image of Bosasa.  I thought you – it was within Bosasa that somebody came up with the theories?    As a response to some – to negative publicity about Bosasa?    Is that right?  Okay.     Conspiracy theories.    Thank you.    Was the action that you are talking about delaying of criminal complaint with the police?    Yes.    Okay.    It might be a good idea to take a short break.    And maybe of ten minutes.    Are you suggesting we take it now?    Okay we will take a ten minutes break and we will resume at ten to four.   We adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Thank you.    Blakes Travel was going to co-operate with this?    And they did?    But what you – you destroyed in terms of this instruction what you ultimately destroyed was not just the paperwork it is the computers as well?    About how many computers did you destroy?    Yes.    And you say Bosasa was a big client of Blakes Travel?    Yes.    So they knew exactly what you were going to do with the computers and why you?    So they knew why you wanted to destroy the computers and they co-operated?    Thank you.    In Bosasa?    Yes no that is fine.    Ja.    Ja.   That was in relation to the period preceding the destruction of evidence?    No, no, no I understand that the writing up afresh of information.    Was post the destruction?   But I want you to confirm whether the – the information that was being written up now related to what had happened prior to the destruction?    Okay alright.    Now you do say that what had prompted or this or at least in part was that a journalist it appeared had copies of documents from Blakes Travel which showed that Bosasa used Blakes Travel to facilitate travel arrangements of amongst others government officials.  Now you had – you destroyed the records, Blakes records relating to travel arrangements made at the request of Bosasa?    For a certain period.  Now what was the plan as to how the information that this journalist seemed to have was going to be dealt with?  Was it that it was going to be suggested that it was authentic?    Information?    Okay.  On the basis that – on the basis that anybody who went to Blakes Travel records would find something different?    Thank you.   But of course at the destruction of – of the evidence was a true conspiracy?    Yes.    Okay, alright.    Yes.   Before you deal with that question Mr Agrizzi, I am looking for the paragraph here and I do not see – yes I think it is paragraph 30.7 that Mr Pretorius referred to a few minutes ago.  You say Blake was subpoenaed to testify in a matterinstituted by the SIU in the Pretoria High Court.  Gavin Watson instructed me to a meeting with Blake and his attorney to ensure that Blake would not implicate Bosasa in his evidence.You might not be able to answer this but if you can please do.  Do you know – you know the idea that an attorney must go and have a meeting with somebody to ensure that they do not, that person does not implicate somebody else seems strange.  It is different if he is going there to listen and note whether what his evidence is.  What was your understanding of what Mr Biebuyck′s role was really going to be there?  Was it just to go and listen to what was being said or was it much more than that?    Yes, but this was – was this not an independent attorney?    Oh.    So are you saying to me that from what you knew in terms of his role and the interactions between himself, that is now the attorney and yourselves and Mr Gavin Watson with him, all of them, he knew that his role was to prevent Mr Blake telling the truth?    Well what you are saying is quite serious.    Particularly in respect of an attorney.    So I just want you to make sure that you are quite clear that what you are saying is really true.    Yes.  Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Alright thank you.    Which attorney?    Thank you.    No that is fine.    Yes, I am sorry, I am sorry Mr Pretorius, before you proceed.  Just to go back to 31.3.    You say you found a document that appeared to be an agreement between Mr Gavin Watson and Mr Mti about that Mr Mti would ensure that Bosasa was favoured in terms of contracts from Correctional Services and he would be paid by Mr Gavin Watson that is what you say?    And you said you made a photocopy of that agreement, did I understand you correctly?    But you proceeded and said that you do not have it?    Did it get lost in the meantime or?    But you saw it, you had it for some time?    So you had had a chance to read it properly?    Ja, okay thank you.  It was signed by both?    Okay, alright.    Okay.    But Mr Mti too would know that this was a wrong agreement what they were agreeing to do was wrong and he probably would not like there to be a written record of what he was a party to.    But you say you are not sure about Mr Mti′s signature on thedocument, but you are sure about Mr Gavin Watson′s signature?    Okay.    Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius he has not finished.  Mr Agrizzi has not finished, so say what you wanted to say?    Thank you.    Yes, no, no, obviously you can understand why Mr Pretorius is asking you the questions that he is asking you and I am asking you the questions I am asking you.  Simply because the question would be what would be the value of that agreement to both Mr Mti and Mr Watson.  They could not go to court and use it if they did not comply with their obligations.    Yes, thank you.    Before Mr Pretorius asks you questions on that, did the raid happen?    It did not happen?    Okay, thank you.    Okay.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    What was put in response to; what they said in response the subpoena?    In response to the questions.    Yes, okay.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    That is fine.    No that is fine.    Okay, thank you.    Here he is on the second paragraph from the end of or bottom of page 280 and he is on line three.    Has he found the paragraph?   Okay, alright.  Okay.  I am lost.    It has been a long day.  Okay.    Okay.  Let me tell him Mr Pretorius.  It has been a long day     Are you on page 280?    Okay.   You see if you go to the bottom of the page.    There is a paragraph that has three lines only.  Can you see that?    And then there is another paragraph above that.  It is a big paragraph.    That starts with during the course of …[intervenes].    A search and seizure yes.    Go to line three then.    He must find it first.    Have you found it now?    Okay, alright.    Okay, but is, but is it necessary for him to read the whole of it?    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.  No, I think Mr Pretorius would like you to read the whole paragraph.    Okay, go ahead.    Ja, just this part, ja.  You start; did you want him to read silently or aloud Mr Pretorius?    Oh, okay.  Alright, okay.    Well, well I am sorry.  Mr Pretorius if the witness has questions after reading it I think we better adjourn.  Let him have time to look at it properly and then we can continue tomorrow.  How is that Mr Agrizzi?    Ja, yes.  In fact it is not going to make much difference a few minutes.    Okay.   Okay.    So we adjourn at this stage Mr Pretorius.    In the affidavit we finished at, at what page or paragraph?  Just need to note it where we; Mr Pretorius are you …[intervenes].    Hm.    Oh, ja.  Ja, okay.  No that is good enough.    Okay.  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn until tomorrow at 10 o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Yes, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  Morning Mr Agrizzi?    Yes, I am thank you.    Mr Agrizzi we were dealing with the evidence in your affidavit…[intervenes]    At page 52.   When we adjourned yesterday.    Can we start today at paragraph 27.1?    In that paragraph you deal with the matter preceding and ultimately the conclusion of a contract with the Department of Correctional Services relating to high security fencing?    Would you begin with the events of 2005 and yourdiscussions with Mr Gavin Watson in this regard please?    Did you have the capacity within Bosasa to provide fencing?    Security fencing at that stage?    Alright, did the discussion continue with more detail?   Yes.  Just go into more detail please in relation to the discussion?  In relation to paragraph 27.2.    Is it Rodenburg?    Yes, sorry I interrupted you, please continue.    Sorry, just before you go on Beta Bastion which later became Beta Fence was that an international company?    And who would buy 26% of the South African branch of that company?    Alright.  Was this proposal or contemplation processed?    Please tell the, Chair, what happened?    Yes, please just say what happened between Bosasa on the one hand and Beta Fence on the other.    Sorry, tell the, Chair, please what agreement was concluded?  Between whom?    Just before you go on.  At that stage had the Department of Correctional Services published any intention or made known any intention to issue a tender?    Why would then this series of events that occurred?  In other words can you explain why Mr Gavin Watson would make all these preparations?    May I carry on Chair?    Alright.  Well whether by way of subcontract or whether by way of cooperation or whether by way of simply of becoming a supplier to the main contractor there was an arrangement or a contemplated arrangement at least that there would be cooperation between various entities with the prospect of supplying fencing, security fencing to the Department of Correctional Services.    Sorry, just before you go on.  Sondolo at that stage was Sondolo IT (Pty) Ltd at Bosasa Group Company?    Right.  Go on please at paragraph 27.6.   So that is the sale in broad terms of the interest in Phezulu Fencing (Pty) Ltd to Mr Watson or to …[intervenes].    Those are two trusts in the group of entities under the Bosasa …[intervenes].    Control or management?    Yes.   Hm.    Carry on please.    That was maybe a bit confusing.  Did you want so say something Chair?    Let us take it step by step then.    In order to carry out the arrangement that was now contemplated between these various role players.  It was contemplated that a company would be bought called Phezulu Fencing (Pty) Ltd?    As I understand what you are saying it was contemplated to or decided that the shareholding in the company would only be transferred to the buyer the Bosasa Trusts once a contract had been awarded by the Department of Correctional Services?    But the management of Phezulu Fencing I understand was immediately taken over by interests within the Bosasa Group?    One of the shareholders at the time – that is before the shareholding is transferred in terms of the agreement – was a, Ms Josephs?    Right and you say she was Rodenburg’s wife?    Oh, I see.  Ms Josephs and Mr Rodenburg’s wife were both shareholders in Phezulu Fencing?    Before the shares were transferred?    Right.    And although their shareholding would in due course be transferred to interests within the Bosasa Group they would retain an interest in the arrangement I understand through another company Gordian (Pty) Ltd …[intervenes].   And that company would subcontract within the contractual arrangements.    Right.  Were there other contractual arrangements made at the time before there was any talk of the Department of Correctional Services issuing a tender?    What were those arrangements?    You deal with them in paragraph 27.8.   So that is because the agreement between Beta Fence and Bosasa and I use the latter term loosely was that Beta Fence would supply fencing material to Phezulu Fencing at a lower cost than it would supply those materials to any other company?    To any other competitor?    And was there any quid pro quo or any …[intervenes].    Benefit to Beta Fence?    Or to …[intervenes].   Bosasa?    So as part of these complex arrangements Beta Fenceand another entity you mentioned, spell it please.    Right, those two entities transfer 26 percent of shares in which entity?    Yes.    Yes and those two trusts as you have told the Chair are Bopa, B-O-P-A and Phafoga, P-H-A-F-O-G-A?    Right.  Now before we go on, you have told the Chair of a very complex series of agreements, understandings and intercompany share transfers.   And you say this was done in contemplation of a tender to be awarded by or a tender to be awarded, yes by …[intervenes].    Correctional Services.    But at this stage there was no public announcement of any such tender being issued.    Right.  Continue please.    Well when you say submitting as subcontractors, let us bear in mind that no tender or invitation to bid had been issued at this stage.    Let me ask you why would all these complex and detailed arrangements be entered into if there was no tender on the horizon?    Let us just clarify one answer you have just given Mr Agrizzi.  You spoke of the group of companies and entities who would act as subcontractors to Phezulu Fencing.    If there was to be any response to any bid to be issuedin the future those subcontractors would be part of a bid on the part of Phezulu Fencing?    But you say there was also an arrangement that these various entities would bid separately for any tender that was to be issued by the Department of Correctional Services?    Yes, we will come to that in a moment.    What you do not say in your statement and perhaps you can assist the Chair in this regard Mr Agrizzi.  Did anyone in Bosasa have any knowledge of what the intentions of Correctional Services were in relation to issuing tenders for the provision of high security fencing?    There is the question, but let me just give you some background to the question.    So you can understand why I am asking it.    There are two possible scenarios.  The Bosasa decision makers could have been very confident that they would persuade Correctional Services to issue a tender and therefore it would be worthwhile to go to these great lengths to prepare for the provision of such services.  Alternatively the decision makers and Bosasa could have known that such a tender was about to be issued.  Do you know which, and the former situation would arise where there was a degree of influence exercised by Bosasa over Department of Correctional Services Officials, but you tell the Chair if you know anything about…[intervenes].    What was happening between Bosasa and CorrectionalServices before the tender was issued.    Thank you Chair.  In regard to the tender about to be issued was anything done by anyone and Bosasa regarding specifications?    Did you have an opportunity to look at that specifications document?    And again just to confirm, did this occur before any tender was issued?    But not only, let us just summarise not only did Bosasa personnel compile specifications, but also had access to Correctional Services Sites in order to survey those sites in order to assist in the preparation of the specifications and any bid documents that would be submitted in the future.    Well you say, well the other potential…[intervenes].    Would you explain to the Chair what advantage that gave the Bosasa Enterprise in relation to this bid, in relation to the position other potential bidders would be in once tenders were issued?    So the idea as I understand it was that Phezulu Fencing would be awarded the bid and as soon as that occurred the shares would be transferred to Bosasa?    Within Bosasa?    In paragraph 27.12 you deal with you particular tasks inthe bidding process.  You talk about the bidding process.  Of course we know from your evidence that there was no bidding process at this stage.  But what tasks were you asked to perform?    So the preparations for the response to the invitation to bid were made in collaboration with various other entities that were to bid separately?    Right and did you see anything in this regard yourself?  You deal with that in paragraph 27.1.3.   Just say again I might have missed it Mr Agrizzi who wasin the boardroom at that stage to which you refer?    And was this …[intervenes].    So present as I understand it were companies that would form part of the Phezulu Fencing bid?    But would also – some of whom would also bid separately?    Before we move on to the next phase of your evidence in regard to the fencing tender let us just summarise.  At the beginning of the process you have told the Chair that Bosasa had no capacity to provide high security fencing?    Certainly on the scale that was contemplated at the time?    You then described to the Chair an elaborate and detailed set of corporate arrangements in order to build capacity?    And you have also told the Chair that there were persons who attended at sites to measure and calculate what would be required in relation to fencing quantity and perhaps quality as well?    My question is simply, over what period of time did this take place?    Right and this was all before the tender was promulgated?   Alright.    Perhaps after the break we will explain the relevance of that to the Chair.  May we take the short adjournment?    Thank you Chair.  You have told the Chair of the history of the preparations made in relation to the Correctional Services contract for security fencing?    And what you have told the Chair that took place over several months was all before the fencing tender was eventually advertised?  When was …[intervenes].    When was the fencing tender advertised?  You deal with that in paragraph 27.14.    Right when was the fencing tender advertised?   Sorry just check that date please.      Yes.    Right by whom?    Was the contract eventually awarded?    That is roughly six weeks after the fencing tender was first advertised?    So advertised 14 October, awarded six weeks later. How long would each bidder have to prepare documents and submit?    You refer to the PPP’s what were those?    Let us just go back to this six week time period.  One does not have to go into too much detail in relation to the tender process but a invitation to bid would be advertised?    Which  you say happened on the 14 October 2005?    There would then as you have already mentioned be a process of interaction between the various bidders and the Correctional Services?    There would then be the submission of the bid?    And then the bid would still have to be evaluated?    Go through several committees and finally be awarded?    So given the process that normally takes place in relation to tenders that six week period from advertisement to award is not the period for the submission of the tender or the response to the bid – invitation to bid?    That is a lesser period than six weeks.    And the value of this contract was what?    Half a billion rand?    You say in paragraph 27.15 that this project ran its course but there was a further contract awarded.  Tell the Chair about that please?    And to whom was that contract awarded?    Did this contract award go through a tender process?    Were you involved in the execution of the contract after it had been awarded to Phezulu Fencing PTY LTD?    Right did you have anything to do with Beta Fence PTYLTD?    Right and did you have anything to do with dividends arising out of the finances of Beta Fence PTY LTD?    What role did you play there?    Well he might have held that trust account on behalf of the shareholders?    And we know that the two trusts were 26 % shareholders of Beta Fence at that time?    And did it eventually transpire that the shares of Phezulu Fencing PTY LTD were transferred after the contract had now been awarded by Correctional Services into the names of the trusts Bopa and Phofoga?    Alright.  So Phezulu Fencing is awarded the contract and in terms of a prior arrangement Bosasa in its most general sense takes control and ownership of Phezulu Fencing?    Well on paper we have as the real beneficiaries of the Correctional Services Fencing contract Phezulu Fencing and its shareholders, Bopa and Phafoga Trusts.   From your own knowledge who was the real beneficiary of the contract?    Let us move on then to page 57 and paragraph 28 of your statement.  You speak there of a meeting with Mr Gillingham in late 2005?    What happened there?  We are now dealing with a new contract?    Just deal with the rating requirement please?    Yes, and would you just tell the, Chair, when you continue how it came about that you received instructions to design this system?    Yes, thank you.  Were there talks at the time about computerising the offender management system?    Alright.  You have told the, Chair, that you, in conjunction with others did in fact design such a system?    Your design I presume was incorporated in a single document?    What did you do with that document?    Was it given to anyone else?    Paragraph 28.3?    Did you then receive an instruction from Gavin Watson?    What was that instruction?   Alright.    Now what you have related to the, Chair, in relation to the discussions that took place involving amongst others Mr Gillingham in regard to the design of a system?    Which you have described and in regard to a preparation of a specifications document, when all this occurred had an invitation to bid been advertised?    And at that time everything that you have narrated to the, Chair, about this contract had already taken place?    Did you receive an instruction to respond to the invitation to bid?    And did a Bosasa company respond to the invitation?    Now when you say Bosasa did not and Sondolo IT did, you already told the, Chair, about Sondolo IT, but let us just remind him.  Did Sondolo It have any relationship with Bosasa?   So Sondolo IT Pty Ltd was part of the Bosasa stable?    Alright.  Did you know when you received the instruction from Gavin Watson what the likelihood was of Sondolo IT being awarded the contract?    Alright, how do you know that?   And was Sondolo IT Pty Ltd ultimately awarded the contract?    That is about five months in this case after the advertisement of the invitation to bid.    Alright.    The initial contract value of the contract in relation to the television services, what was that value?    Alright.  Was that the annual amount or is that the total amount certainly at that stage?   Alright, let us move on then to a different topic.  You deal with in paragraph 29 of your affidavit and it concerns Mr Mti and what occurred during 06, would you tell the, Chair, please of what happened?    Tony Perry was the company secretary?    Do you know why the company was to be registered?   Alright.  Alright, and then you deal in paragraph 29.2 with events that took place during July 2007 in relation to the catering tender.    Is that the catering tender of which we have spoken?    What happened?    That name Nontsikelelo would you spell it please?    Jolingana.    Do you know which position she held?    Are you sure of that spelling?    I am instructed that you may be correct, Chair, it may be Nontsikelelo.    We will check that.    Let us just deal with that in a little more detail then.  You say there was an objection from amongst others Jennie Schreiner?    What position did she hold at the time?    Let us just clarify your evidence then in that regard, because we do not want to get it wrong.  You have not mentioned Ms Schreiner′s name before.  You say, if I heard you correctly she was against the protocol that should have been implemented?    And then you say she objected to the improper extension of the contract.  Please clarify?    Alright.    So the two extensions that you have referred to in paragraph 29.2?    I understand your evidence to be these extensionsshould have gone out for further tender?    They did not and the contract was merely extended for the benefit of the Bosasa stable?    No, that is in order.    And you say that at that meeting, well there must have been more than one meeting, because the contract was extended twice?    But at one meeting several members of the Correctional Services bid adjudication committee were present?    And indeed the contract was extended on two occasions?    First for a year and then for a further six months?    And that at some stage during that whole process an objection was lodged by Ms Schreiner?   Alright.    But this matter was investigated.    But…[intervenes]    I understand the point you are making.    I am not sure, I must stress it.    Correct.    Yes, let us ignore the word that I used, Chair.   Did Mr Mti eventually resign as Commissioner of Correctional Services?    Do you know when that occurred?    Alright.  Until then had you had any direct contact with Mr Mti?    Did you have any indirect dealings with him?    Alright.  Now you have told the, Chair, that from…[intervenes]   Let us go back one paragraph, we have not dealt with that.  You have told the, Chair, that from time to time there would be negative publicity concerning Bosasa and its activities and in particular its relationship with government departments?   Do you recall more or less when the first media publication of this nature occurred?    Yes, let us go then to page 345 of the bundle.  At page 346 there is a collation on that page through to page 348 of the content of various press articles.    And if one took time to read them they are revelations in the press of the relationship between Correctional Services on the one hand and the Bosasa group of companies on the other.    And mentioned by name in those articles are amongst other persons Mr Gavin Watson, Mr Mti and Mr Patrick Gillingham.    Alright.  Did these sorts of exposures of the Bosasa group of companies′ activities continue?    And it was obviously a matter of some concern to Bosasa and its officials?    Alright, then would you – the relevance of that will become apparent later, but would you then go on to talk of the meeting with Mr Mtiduring 2007?  You have highlighted this for the, Chair, already.    Well you provide detail on page 59 and perhaps you should place that on record.    Riekele[spelt].    Prande Four[spelt]?    Yes, thank you.    Was another method used to conceal expenses?  You referred to that in the last sentence of paragraph 29.5.1.    Where?    Where was this mezzanine floor?    No, it is not necessary.    Sorry, you were going to talk of a method of invoicingthat was used to …[intervenes].    To conceal costs of the construction on of the houses.    So for work being done by Bosasa by the Bosasa stable for a Government entity invoices would be inflated and the monies used to pay for the building of the houses of Messieurs Mti and Gillingham?    Then at 29.5.2 you talk about the registration of the Mtihouse in the name of a particular company.  Would you tell the Chair about that please?    And the name of that company as you record it here was Autumn Storm Investments 119 (Pty) Ltd.    In regard to the furnishing and décor at what we have referred to as the empty house what were the arrangements?    And did Bosasa pay for the furnishing and décor?    You then refer in paragraph 29.5.4 to the rentalarrangements in regard to the empty house.  You have told the Chair what you say here that the house was rented by the Department of Correctional Services pursuant to some sort of tendering process as you put it.    Right and you say that rent was paid by the Department of Correctional Services to the company called Autumn Storm Investments 119 (Pty) Ltd?    And what happened to that rental monies to your knowledge?    Who would access the funds?   Do you know whether this ever happened or not?    Right, so that was the agreement that was never implemented according to your evidence?    Was there also any agreement about the final fate of the ownership of the house?   You have told the Chair that Mr Mti resigned as Commissioner in November 2006.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi you say that Mr Mtiresigned as National Commissioner in November 2006?    Did he leave the house then?    Right.  Do you know for how long he remained in what we have referred to as the Mti house, the first house?    Yes and then in 29.5.6 of your affidavit you say   Did Mr Mti receive any benefit from Bosasa in relation to this house and I am talking about the Bosasa stable here?    And what was that?    Right and then you say in relation I do not know to which house, because the house close to Savannah Hills you say was owned by Mti, but then you talk about a potential transfer.  Please explain what you say in paragraph 29.5.7.    Alright.    But which house are we talking of now?    But you say in paragraph 29.5.6   But why was it necessary to transfer the house to him if it was already owned by him?    Which house are you talking about?    I see.    Yes.  You, you have told the Chair that in relation to, let us refer to it as the first house, there was an arrangement or an agreement that it would ultimately be transferred to Mr Mti.    Let us refer to that as the first house.  Are you sayingthat house was actually in Savannah Hills?    Okay.    Thank you.  Let us move on.  Did you have occasion to meet with Mr Mti together with Gavin Watson at some stage after his resignation?  I am referring to the meeting at 29.6.    Who attended that meeting?    Who attended that meeting?    Right and what occurred at that meeting?    And were you given any tasks?    In relation to the 2010 World Cup?    Right, did anything else of note happen at that meeting?    What did you see?    The grey security bag?    Right, how did you learn of this payment?  Apart fromseeing the grey security bag being handed over.  I am referring to a discussion that you say you had with Gavin Watson.    In other words what did he tell you?    Alright.  You have referred the Chair to a conversation that took place between yourself and Gavin Watson.    On the way back from the visit to Mr Mti.   And during that conversation mention was made of “monopoly money” paid to Mr Mti, because Mr Mti always delivered on his promises.    Right.  The words used by you here and it may be important because Mr Mti had always delivered on his promises.    No, hm.    Did you learn anything about the frequency of payments and the amount of payments from Mr Watson during that conversation?    Did you actually see transfers of grey security bags to Mr Mti?    On how many occasions approximately?    Thank you Chair.  Did you become aware at that time of any other benefits which the Mti family enjoyed at the expense of Bosasa with theBosasa stable?    Who is JJ Venter?    And did you say that that account was used to invoice and pay for travel expenses incurred by Mr Mti?    Right.    Let us just clarify that in case it is a subject of further investigation.  Were there tickets booked in the name of JJ Venter or was an account registered in the name of JJ Venter?    So in cases relevant to him, Mr Mti?   Right and then you have told the Chair the information recorded in paragraph 29.8 that Bosasa paid for the studies of two children.    Of Mr Mti.    Were any other services provided at the home of Mr Mti at a later stage after the World Cup?    No, I am just asking whether security services were provided at the home.    At the home of Mr Mti?    Aright and what services were those you say the provision of a guard?    Alright.      Yes paragraph 29.8.    Right you then relate in paragraph 29.8 an incident relating to a criminal charge brought against Mr Mti and please if you would deal with the information you provide and tell the Chair how you come to know of what you are going to tell him?    Do you know – that is why Mr Gumede requested the money according to yourself you know of that obviously?   And you know what he told you obviously.    But are you able to confirm that the money was actually paid for the purpose you related?    So you are telling the Chair that the reason you gave Mr Gumede the money that he requested was the reason related to you by Mr Gumede you have no further evidence?    Alright.  And would you tell the Chair please of the further circumstance referred to in paragraph 29.8 regarding the submission of invoices?    Yes.  In the last five lines of paragraph 29.8 you refer to certain circumstances which allowed money to be raised and paid to Mr Mti, how was that done?    Yes perhaps as you have undertaken you could takeyour time record that evidence.    And if and when appropriate we will deal with that by handing in a supplementary statement up.    But I would like to clarify what you referred to in paragraph 29.8.  Your brother would render fictitious invoices for electrical services rendered to Bosasa?    The money which was then paid by Bosasa was handedover to Mr Mti?    And your brother as you say here became uncomfortable with this arrangement and the practice was terminated?    Right.     Chair I am about to move to a new topic.  Oh no I am not sure of what the arrangements should be.  I am told that lunch will only be served at    Yes, no it should not influence any decision now.    I am about to move to a new topic, would now be a convenient time?    Yes I think in this case my feet should take priority Chair.   Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.      We also omitted to refer to paragraph 29.5.8.  If you would go there please and just tell the Chair about the meeting referred to in that paragraph.    29.5.8.    And the events which are referred to in that paragraphare the events related to the house of Mr Mti?    And it might clarity matters a little.  Savanna Hills is not a suburb it is a townhouse complex I understand?    If you go please to paragraph 29.9 Mr Agrizzi.     Who paid the rent for that house?    Mr Agrizzi you say during mid 2007 Vernie Petersen was appointed as National Commissioner, National Commissioner of which department?    You say you attempted to communicate with him about possible future ventures but he would have nothing to do with any of the companies in the Bosasa Group?    Right.  At around that time was a further meeting held with officials of the Department of Correctional Services?   Could you please tell the Chair of that meeting?    That is a trade union?    What was the subject matter of that meeting?    You say that the subject matter of the meeting was an attempt to find a solution to Mr Petersen’s refusal to communicate with Bosasa?    Yes what happened?    When you say it was agreed that they including Mr Nxele would paid a million rand per month what is the detail?  Was that for all, some, who were the they?   Who would provide you?    Who would produce the invoices?    Perhaps I will thank Chair.  You say that invoices were produced, fictitious invoices on behalf of the team for R1 million per month and these would be paid by Bosasa?    Yes and you refer in the last sentence of 29.10 to thatvery quick pro qua?    What was the intention of the payment?    What was the intention of the payment?    And what was the purpose of obtaining Mr Petersen’s co-operation?   But it may be obvious in the light of your earlier evidence but let us be express here what was the purpose of obtaining his co-operation?    Alright were these payments made?    On a monthly basis you say?    And for how long did they continue?    I understand you evidence to be that the recipients of the payments were unhappy that the R1 million included VAT?    Alright.      Was that amount of R1 million amended at any stage?    And the contract that you lost specify that please?    At Correctional Services facilities?    You have spoken about that contract earlier, have you?    Alright, well what happened during 2008 in this regard?    What seized?    Right let us just stop there, because it may be confusing.  It could not seize and continue.  Just be a bit more particular.    So what happened to the arrangement in 2008?    Completely?    And in relation to Mr Nxele?    Well will you tell the, Chair, about that please?    Was Mr Nxele happy about that amount?    What did he want?    Before you go on, who was present at that lunch?    And Mr Nxele?   Well do I understand that the meeting and the lunch were the same occasion or am I incorrect?    Are you still to come to that?    Yes, alright well let us get there.    You deal with it in paragraph 29.15.   Alright.    I have done so, but perhaps I should do more.    Yes.    There are other ways to do it, we can provide thetranscriber with the statement.    Yes, I think of Frans for example, how that would be spelt by the transcriber and we have got lots of experience with that.  You refer in paragraph 29.16 to two purchases and you say this occurred at some stage.  Can you recall when?  More or less.    Well perhaps there is another way of dealing with it.  At that time what position did Mr Gillingham hold?    Department of Correctional Services?    Yes, and what happened?    The Polo was purchased according to your evidence from who?    And how were these payments to be made?    Whose personal accounts?    If you cannot remember that is fine we can move on.    29.17, if you cannot remember from whose personal accounts these payments were made, we can move on.   And would there be any refund to the person who financed the purchase?    How would that be affected?    Alright.  And which company affected the refund?   Alright and did an issue arise in relation to this arrangement?  You deal with that in paragraph 29.18.    What happened to Mr Gillingham duringSeptember 2008?    Did Mr Gillingham contest his suspension?    Was he assisted in any respect by Bosasa?    Alright, and what happened during 2008 in relation to the SIU investigation and Mr Gillingham?    Did you meet Gillingham?    At the time do you know whether – well you know that Mr Gillingham was still employed albeit on suspension by the Department of Correctional Services?   Did you know whether he was also a consultant for Concilium?    At that time?    Do you know whether he was a Director of Concilium Business Consultants at that time?    There will be evidence later about the SIU search on the premises of Mr Gillingham, but in the meanwhile did you receive any instructions from Gavin Watson relating to ramifications that the raid might have had for those concerned?    In particular what did Gavin Watson tell you to do?    What did he say should happen?    All the moneys?    That who had received?    Did you do that?    Where are those agreements?    Do you have any in your possession?    Alright, let us take that step by step.    Perhaps I pre-empted your evidence.  In paragraph 29.23.2 you say that you were also instructed to do something by Gavin Watson in relation to the outcome of the raid or the search and seizure operation.    What was that?    Alright, before we go to Annexure L, let us just get two things clear.  You took the declaration to Mti at the Protea Midrand?    You asked Mti to sign?    Mti initially refused?    You phoned Mr Gavin Watson and spoke to him?    You then handed the phone to Mr Mti?    Whilst Gavin Watson was still on the phone?    And a discussion probably took place, is that correct?    I am just summarising and then he can add anything more.    After that discussion, what did Mr Mti do?    Yes?    Sorry?    He signed it?    Okay.    Yes, I am just taking it through step by step.    It might have been unclear.    Would you go to page 349 of the bundle, which is the cover page and then there is a document at page 350?    What is this document?    Who got typed up?    And this document was typed?   It is a document signed by POC Gillingham?    And it reads   At that time Mr Mti?    And it reads   And it is against the date 12 April 2006?    Is this the document that you were referring to?   Is it signed by anyone other than Mr Gillingham?    Alright.  There is a handwritten note on that document.    I am getting there, Chair, it is the handwritten portion in the bottom right hand corner.    Well page 350 is initialled by two persons, presumably as you said yourself and one other?    That would have happened when this document was commissioned?    By this document I mean the affidavit and the Annexures?    But the particular memorandum that we are referring to has some handwriting in the bottom right hand corner.  Do you see that?    And if I can read it, it reads   ″To the Department.″    Okay.  Do you – you were at the meeting that you havejust referred to.  Were you present when this was signed by Mr Mti?    And were you present when the note was made?    Who made the note?    Alright.  So at the meeting you have referred to the document was produced, there was a discussion with Mr Watson and pursuant to or after that discussion a note was placed on the document and signed in your presence by Mr Mti?    You speak of Mr Peterson, Vernie Petersen, Vernie Petersen again in paragraph 29.24 and the period late 2008, what happened then?    Who was that person?    And that is Xoliswa[spelt].    And Sibeko[spelt].    Now after she – you say she was appointed as the National Commissioner for the Department of Correctional Services?    After that appointment did you receive information regarding the fate of the control room contract held by Sondolo IT Pty Limited?    What were you told?    Alright, before you go on which contract was this?  You say the control room contract?   Was it the staffing of the control rooms?    Alright, and you have referred to that contract before?    Alright, and then who was Mr Modise at the time?    What happened at this meeting?   Had anything happened earlier that day to give you an indication of what this parcel was all about?    And what did you actually see physically at the meeting in relation to this bag?    What did you see physically that happened at the meeting in relation to the bag?    Did you speak to Mr Leshabane about that particular event after the meeting?    And what was Mr Leshabane’s response?    Alright.    Would you go to page 352 please?   You go on now in your affidavit to talk of a media release.    Would you go to page 352 of Bundle S1?    Is this the document that you are referring to?    Right.    It is what appears to be a press release or a transcript of a press release under the heading “Prisons Graft here is the proof Minister”.    And the by-line is that of the Journalist Adriaan Basson Johannesburg South Africa, 30 January 2009.    January, the 30th.    352.    You say this article is accurate to your knowledge?    Well let us just stick to this article shall we.    It reads   Do you recall those advertisements?    And the second paragraph reads   It continues to read   It goes on to read   And the amount?    Right.  The first bullet refers to the receipt of confidential documents leaked to Bosasa by the Departments former Chief Financial Officer andBalfour confidante Patrick Gillingham.  Leave aside the relationship between Gillingham and Balfour for the moment please.  That fact is it correct?    Alright.  You are at page 352?    You see in the top third of the article or the …[intervenes].    Document     There are three bullets.    Right.  I am dealing with the first bullet.    I am not asking you about the relationship between then Mr Balfour and Patrick Gillingham.    What I am asking you is whether it is correct to your knowledge that confidential documents and documents confidential to the Department of Correctional Services were leaked to Bosasa by Mr Gillingham?    Is that correct?    Right and you have given evidence of exchange ofdocuments.    Already and you may give more.    The second bullet reads   The first point?    You would like to go back to the first point.    The third bullet reads   What happened?  I do not recall it was in your evidence …[intervenes].    Thus far.    We should try and speak one at a time if that is possible.    So tell the Chair about that spying operation or event.    So what actually happened?    Them meaning Correctional Services Officials?    And the event at which this occurred was a workshop which was held in 2006?    And did you supervise that exercise?    Right and to whom did the report of this exercise go?    Right.  The next paragraph deals with Mr Gavin Watson.  We need not deal with that.  The next paragraph deals with Lindela and perhaps we should just read that onto the record. “The Group also runs the controversial Lindela Repatriation Camp...”    “…for the Department of Home Affairs…”    “…and has large contracts with the South African Post Office, Airport Company of South Africa and theDepartments of Justice and Transport.”    You have testified to those matters.  It goes on to say   So the Special Investigating Unit …[intervenes].    (SIU) did attend at Bosasa premises and carried out certain search, searches there in particular copying of servers?    [Intervenes] detail of that in due course.    But is it correct that three weeks after that event and notwithstanding that event Bosasa was re-awarded the catering contract that was originally or had originally being granted in 2004?    Right.  It goes on to read   It goes on to say   “Petersen was later transferred to the Sports Department in what was widely seen as a reprisal for hisopposition to Balfour’s attempts to extend the 2004 contract.” That is what the report says, but you give no evidence in regard to Minister Balfour.    But in any event it is correct you say that Vernie Petersen suspended Gillingham in September.    Of which year?  2006 is it?   After, let us just interpose here, because it is relevant and will become relevant later.  After Mr Petersen had suspended Gillingham you say Mr Petersen or the article says Mr Petersen was later transferred out of the Department of Correctional Services.    What happened to Mr Gillingham after his suspension or after this suspension?    No, but do you know whether he was reemployed or was finally dismissed?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Was there an earlier occasion on which Mr Gillingham was suspended?    Okay.  We will deal with that evidence in due course.    Let us get back to the text of the press release on page 352 and I am sorry I took you out of sequence.    Do you know what role Mr Gillingham played in relation to the award of what is referred to here as the latest catering tender?   Right.    Right and we will get to the detail of that when we deal with the SIU Report.    And then there is a heading “2004 A New Romance”.     That contract.  It goes on to read   So that is a communication of information relevant to the bid to yourself approximately three weeks before the tender was first advertised?    The article continues   is it correct?    “On August, the 6th Bosasa was awarded the entire contract worth R239 million a year for three years.”    It goes onto read   Yes.    And that paragraph concludes   Alright, but do you know anything about the further extension of the contract being a matter of some dispute between Petersen and Balfour?    Alright.  It continues that is the article continues and we are at page 353. “In July 2004 the department also gave Bosasa a R1 million tender for nutritional training for prisons kitchen staff.” Is that a correct fact?    The paragraph continues   So just to summarise again once more you were in possession of tender documents including bid conditions and specifications before the advertisement of the tender?    Alright.  We will get to the detail.    Of four particular tenders investigated.   Reasonably comprehensively it appears at least from the …[intervenes].     Documents by the SIU.    We will deal with that.    Hopefully sooner rather than later.    Then there is a heading on page 353 which reads “2005 You Have got Mail”.  Do you see that?    The paragraph under that heading reads   It continues to read   Was the interest in Sondolo IT limited to 40 percent?    Yes.    Other companies …[intervenes].    Bosasa.    Within the Bosasa Group or external to the Bosasa Group?    In any event the reference here to the CCTV Contract is this the same contract to which you had referred in your evidence earlier today?   Just before we go on do you know what documents Adriaan Basson had in his possession to enable him to author this press release?    Well where did he get his information from?    No, I am talking generally about …[intervenes].    The contents of …[intervenes].   Ja.    You have given your evidence and this is the point of thequestion …[intervenes].    You have given your evidence from your own memory and your own records?    This information if you had nothing to do with any communication with Mr Basson presumably came from some other source.    But you did not give this information …[intervenes].    Right and it was given at a time when I understand that you were still loyal to Bosasa.    Right.  So well we can submit, but perhaps I can just place on record the submission will be that this is corroborating information from another source.    Let us get back to Sondolo IT.  You said you are not sure of who the shareholders were, but you confirm it was 40 percent owned by Bosasa Operations in 2006.    The article continues to say   “…and former Strategic Fuel Fund Chairperson Seth Phalatse, P-H-A-L-A-T-S-E.”    Do you know that as a fact?    Right and then the article continues in the next    So once again before the publication of an official bid document by the Department of Correctional Services you had in your possession withthe assistance of Mr Johan Helmand tender specifications?    The articles continues on. “On April, the 29th Sondolo IT was awarded the contract.” Is that correct?    “In 2005 Agrizzi and Gillingham started emailing each other prison research reports and newspaper clippings.” Is that correct?   What was the purpose of that?    What was the purpose of that?    Oh. “On August, the 29th Gillingham sent Agrizzi a copy of questions from City Press put to the Department about the Bosasa contracts the leak documents show.”    Right.  It continues in the next paragraph. “On December, the 9th 2005 Bosasa landed a R487 million prisons contract for security fencing through a small Cape Townfirm Phezulu Fencing it had purchased.”    Is that a reference to the evidence you have given earlier this morning?    The article continues to read   “Three months earlier on September, the 25th Agrizzi emailed Mansell a voluminous document containing bid specifications.  “Please verify and check.  We can sit tomorrow am” Agrizzi wrote.”    Did that occur?    Right.  Well do you have any independent recollection of …[intervenes].    Communications with Mansell containing or in relation to a document containing bid specifications?    But that is all you can say about that?    Right.  It continues the article that is to read   “…under the subject line “Fence Doc Final…Very Confidential…”.”What do you recall of the report in that respect?    And what would you have done or what do you recall doing with that document    And the executives mentioned here of Behaert Bastion and SA Fence and Gate Michael Rodenburg and Geoff Greyling, do you know them?    Is that the same person that you referred to earlier in your statement Rodenburg?    Right.  And what would the purpose of – did you recall or do you recall sending that longer version Fence Doc Final to the gentlemen referred to here?    And were the persons mentioned in the paragraph we have just referred the relevant parties?    It goes on to read that article that is “this contained the full bid conditions and specifications published by the department on October14 that is eleven days later” is that correct that statement?    But do you know whether you had in your possession at some stage and you transmitted to relevant parties a document containing the full bid conditions and specifications which were later published by the department?    Right and you have testified to these facts albeit in different words this morning?    Then that paragraph continues to read “Bekaert Bastion supplied cladding material and SA Fence and Gate was contract to do part of the installation.”  Are those facts correct?   And you mentioned.    I am sorry I interrupted you.    You mentioned those other companies involved this morning?   It goes on to read “This week Greyling categorically denied seeing a copy of the bid document before it was published.”  He said “it should be recorded that the tender was based on the standard public works of Correctional Services specification with which we are all well acquainted from previous bids.  The prior possession of the tender document by anyone would therefore be of no specific advantage to such person.”  Now I am not sure that you were privy to what Mr Greyling might have said?    But there Mr Greyling says “does it matter if you have got prior possession of tender documents because it would be useless these matters are consistent or these – this information is consistent with standard public works Correctional Services specifications and it is of no use to anybody.”  What do you say to that?    So is it correct to say specifically the prior possession of the tender document by anyone would therefore be of no specific advantage to such person?    Interestingly in that paragraph although the report saidMr Greyling denied seeing a copy of the bid document before it was published his explanation seems to indicate that not that he had not seen it but that if he had seen it would be of no use to anybody.  But I just make that remark in passing it is not necessary to comment.  Let us continue then on page 354 the report continues to read “Collett Stofberg of Bekaert Bastion now called Beta Fence replied that years before this contract Beta Fence provided technical specifications to the Department of Public Works that were used in this tender.  Do you know anything about that allegation?    Right the third paragraph reads “according to an industry inside of the big advantage lies in knowing the quantities required for the tender weeks before your competitors”.    It continues in the next paragraph to read “on October 10 05 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a six page document titled Equipment Specifications and Guidelines the same section featured in a tender for a comprehensive television systemcomprising six thousand TV’s for communal cells published four days later.”  Is that correct?    On November 28 Agrizzi emailed Mansell the confidential evaluation sheet the department used to adjudicate the TV tender which Sondolo IT won on March 17 2006.  Is that fact correct?    Then in – the article continues on page 354 under a new heading reading 2006 Spies In The House.  Paragraph – the first paragraph under that    Did it occur as stated?    It continues.  “The tender was officially advertised on May 19.  Seven days earlier Gillingham sent Agrizzi the confidential evaluation sheet for the Waterval tender with a message “Hi attached please find the reworked evaluation sheet for your comments.  You will notice the evaluation sheet for sites visits cannot be published and will not form part of this document.  Regards Patrick.”  Do you recall that having occurred?    Not only does it seem that you were provided with a confidential evaluation sheet you even asked for your comments?   Did you provide comments?    The report continues   On April 24 2006 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a letter in which an anonymous writer asks the chairperson of Parliaments Correctional Services DennisBloom to “sort out” the attack on the department by “international capitalists and activists Afrikaner companies”.  This week Bloom confirmed receiving such a letter.”  Do you recall that having occurred?    Right.  So attacks on Bosasa it appears were characterised by what is referred to as an anonymous writer as attacks by international capitalists and activist Afrikaner companies do I understand that references here correctly?    The article continues in the next paragraph to read “on June 21 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a surveillance report of a prisons department securityworkshop?    At a Drakensberg Hotel in June 2006.  The 25 page report makes it clear that the agent was asked to spy on the department’s Chief Deputy Commissioner Of Security Willem Damons, D-a-m-o-n-s and his subordinate Tonie, T-o-n-i-e Venter.  The report also contains pictures of people and cars at the hotel as well as the inside of the conference room.  You spoke earlier this afternoon Mr Agrizzi of the spying operation that you were involved in, is this the same operation?    And is it correct that someone was asked to spy on thedepartments Chief Deputy Commissioner of Security and his subordinate?    The article …[intervenes].    Who instigated this spying operation?    Yes.    And the purpose of the spy operation?   Yes in short these were conspiracies that were created or sort to be established in order to undermine the good work that Bosasa was doing?    Yes.    I am not sure but let us try and clarify it Chair because it may be relevant to other evidence that will be lead before you Chair.  Bosasa continued with what you have said are its unlawful activities?    There were attacks on Bosasa from amongst othersmedia sources?    And Bosasa was attacked for doing what it had done?    In response to those attacks Bosasa said there is no merit to these attacks they are merely     Attacks by international capitalists and activists Afrikaner companies for their own conspiratorial purposes?    Ja.    The article continues “in his message to Gillingham Agrizzi wrote I did not see the reason need to email you the rest nothing actually happened.  Gillingham replied the next day “hi thanks for the report and it seems as if they behaved well during their session.  Regards.”  Do you recall that exchange between yourself and Gillingham?    Is there anything to add to that that might interest the Chair?    Right it continues that is the article continues “Bosasa’s lawyer Brian Biebuyck advised his client not to answer the Mail and Guardians’questions.  He warned the Mail and Guardian to publish “at your peril” and said Bosasa would pursue charges of criminal deformation if defamatory material were printed.”  We know that material was printed because we see it here, reference to it here in these pages, was any criminal defamation action ever instituted resulting from this article?    The final paragraph of the article reads   Chair it is a – I do not know if you are taking a break this afternoon?    Very good idea Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Let us move then to paragraph 30.2 of your statement you refer to the use of Blakes Travel.  Tell the Chair about that please just very briefly?    Thank you.  Paragraph 30.3 you relate an incident concerning the records at Blakes Travel.  How did this matter arise?   Who gave the instruction?    And who – to whom was the instruction given?    And the instruction once again.   More or less when was this?    2009?    Right.    Right pursuant to this instruction from Gavin Watson did you then meet with Brian Blake of Blakes Travel?    What did you tell him?    What did he give to you?    Right and after collecting the computers and documents what did you and I presume Andries Van Tonder do?    Ryno is spelt R-y-n-o is that correct?    Right and the name of the hostel to which you have referred?    Luipeerds Vlei right.    Was that a property which belonged to Bosasa?    And what was the condition of the site?   And you say in your statement exactly that it was being revamped and was a construction site?    And did you dig a hole?    What is a TLB?    Anyway there was a hole, what did you do then?  You threw the documents and computer in the hole, you set it alight?    Let us – one at a time please.  There was a hole, you threw the computer and documents in the hole, you set it alight as you said?    Was anything further done to conceal the operation?    Right.    Okay that is the cover up?    And thereafter in relation to the travel orders that subsequently occurred, what was the arrangement?    Right that was in relation to travel after the cover up ofthe documents?    What was done in relation to the records that were destroyed?    Well now we have a travel company with no records?    Yes then I do not understand the allegation in paragraph 30.5.  Would you explain that please to the Chair?    Not with regard to?    Yes please.    Will you tell what happened there?    So just in summary then after revelations in the media concerning the activities of Bosasa in relation to favours concerning travel and accommodation Blakes records were destroyed and Bosasa’s records were recreated?    I must point out, Chair, and to you Mr Agrizzi that in paragraph 30.1 you refer to Annexure M as the media release containing information from Blake′s.  The portion and it appears to be a portion of Annexure M which we have just dealt with in your evidence does not appear to refer to Blake Travel.  I stand to be corrected, but it does appear that, that media report attached is not complete, but we will check it.    Yes, in fact if we go back to Annexure M – if we go back to page 351 where we see the article and turn to page 354.    At the bottom of the page we have pictures from a confidential surveillance report of a senior department of and then the document says no more, but it appears that there is further content to this Annexure.   Well we will check that and revert if necessary.    In paragraph 30.6 then you say what the position was after the destruction of the Blake′s Travel documents and the arrangement that was made in relation to travel for very important clients of Bosasa, correct?    They were fictitiously recorded in the books of Black′s Travel, is that correct?    Then in paragraph 30.7 you say that Mr Blake was subpoenaed to testify in a matter instituted by the SIU in the Pretoria High Court.  Very briefly what was that matter?    And what happened in relation to that subpoena?    To your knowledge?    Were you to your knowledge successful in your endeavour to prevent the subpoena being carried out?    Do you know whether Blake ever testified in court?    Then in paragraph 31 you go on to deal with information received by Gavin Watson arising out of the SIU investigation.  Would you tell the, Chair, what happened in respect of the SIU investigation and the records of Bosasa?    Well let us just understand your evidence in that respect.  You understand as we said in opening before you gave evidenceMr Agrizzi…[intervenes]    That we are not presenting a case to the, Chair, we are presenting ongoing investigations.    They will be tested in due course.    By further investigations and they will obviously be tested in due course by cross-examination of you.    And the submission to the, Chair, of different versions.    Only thereafter will the, Chair, make up his mind and only thereafter will we make any submissions in regard to the truth or otherwise and the reliability of your evidence.    So we are in an investigation process at the moment.  Let me just say in relation to this, if the attorney concerned was briefed by Bosasa to protect Bosasa′s interest there may have been a legitimate interest in finding out whether Blake′s Travel a client of Bosasa had any information that might implicate or prejudice Bosasa?    Well it may be that your understanding of the meeting is a gloss that you put on the contents of the meeting, which is your own perspective and that the facts of the meeting were really Mr Biebuyck making legitimate enquiries of the attorney of Blake′s Travel.    Which attorney?    Let us go on then.  In paragraph 31.1 you say that Gavin Watson received information in respect of the progress of the SIU′s investigation?    We will refer in more detail later in your evidence to the receipt of information by Bosasa and its representatives concerning the SIU investigation, but I want to ask you please about the contents of paragraph 31.1 where you say that an instruction was given to an IT specialist.  Let us start, who gave the instruction referred to here?    And the IT specialist referred to, was that an employee of Bosasa group or an external specialist?    And were you present when the instruction was given?    What was the instruction?    Which files?    Right, at this stage had the SIU investigators searched the premises of Bosasa?   Before the instruction was carried out was any process undertaken?    Alright, I am referring to the information which you say was ultimately destroyed.    Apart from the destruction was the information preserved in another form?    How?    Alright.  The document at page 356 what is that document?    Right this is the cover page of a document.    The document at page 357 is that part of this disaster log?    Where do we find the scope of disaster and its classification referred to in the contents list on page 356?    No.  Sorry.  Let me be clear.    On page 356 there is a document headed Bosasa IT disaster log 8 November 2007.    Under the head contents…[intervenes]    There is a list presumably of those contents, one, background, two, scope of disaster, three, disaster classification, four, and recovery strategy.    Can you help us please, because I am not an expert, and I presume the, Chair, is also not an expert.  Where do we find in this document or the document on the following page the scope of the disaster, the disaster classification and the recovery strategy?    In any event on page 257 there is a paragraph which    In paragraph 31.2 you refer to a telephone call that you received from Gavin Watson as you say on a Sunday afternoon.    What did Mr Watson tell you?    Alright.  Did Mr Watson tell you whether Mr Seopela told him in turn when this raid as you describe it would take place?   Yes, the day following the telephone call from Watson to yourself?    And did Mr Seopela tell Mr Watson anything else that Mr Watson related to you?    Right.    Did you go to the office?    And when you arrived there did you find Mr Watson there?    Who else was there?    And did you receive any instructions?    Did such a document exist?    How do you know that?    And do you have that Photostat?    So if I understand you correctly you saw a document?    Being an agreement between Gavin Watson and Mr Mti for the payment of money in return for an undertaking to favour Bosasa in relation to the awarding of tenders?    And did it say what you have said in paragraph 31.3?   And were you instructed to look for any particular documents?    Those documents to which you have just referred?    Alright.  Did you find those documents?    What did you do in respect of those documents?    No I am dealing with 31.4.  What did you – you found the document and then what did you do with them?    It seems improbable if not very strange that such an arrangement would be recorded in writing and signed.    Do you have any comment?    And what is also a matter of some concern in relation to your evidence Mr Agrizzi is that yesterday and previous days you have testified not once but I think more than once that it was Gavin Watson′s affirmed practice never to reduce things to writing and never to sign anything.  If this was an exception it is a veryunusual exception.    Perhaps that evidence Mr Agrizzi will be tested in due course under cross-examination, but for the present it seems that even on your own evidence Gavin Watson would no sign documents, because as you say he did not want to be held accountable for any evidence that appeared in writing.   But if that was his practice…[intervenes]    Just to put the perhaps obvious follow up question if Mr Watson signed only when he slipped up or only on the odd occasion in other words in the exceptional circumstance…[intervenes]    It is rather remarkable that the recording of an unlawful transaction would be such an exceptional circumstance?    Alright, you say then that in relation to these documents that you were asked to look for and remove that you in fact removed the documents?    What do you mean by removed the documents, is that the putting in storage that you referred to now?    Alright, and then did something later happen in relation to these documents?    What was that?    Did you do that?    That is the document you refer to in your evidence now.    And …[intervenes].    So you did not destroy that document.  What did you do with it?    We are going to now get onto matters relevant to the SIU Report and you introduced a topic at paragraph 32 of your affidavit on page 6 of EXHIBIT S1.    Alright.  Well not that nothing happened.  Something did happen.    But it could not be described in your mind as a raid.    We will refer in due course to detailed evidence in regard to what happened.    On 6 January 2009, I am not sure it is in dispute, the Department of Correctional Services apparently awarded Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd a new catering contract.    And the number of that contract, which becomes relevant later, apparently HK14/2008.    For what period was this contract?    And the documentation used for the prior catering contract tender was that same documentation again used for the second catering contract awarded to Bosasa.    Alright.  Now in paragraph 32.2 you refer to a meeting.  Let us tell the Chair about that meeting please.  Between who was this meeting?   Who is we?    Oellerman?    Can you spell that, Clint?    Oellerman.    Well I am sure that name appears in documents.    That we will refer to in due course, but this meeting did it take place subsequent to another communication between?    Bosasa on the one hand and the SIU on the other?    What was that communication?   You refer in paragraph 32.2 in the second sentence to a communication.    That preceded the meeting.    What was that communication?    Right.    And the meeting then took place.  Was any; what was the outcome of that meeting?    So do I understand you correctly, it was agreed with the SIU precisely when they would come to image the hard drives and laptops at Bosasa?    Right.  The date that was arranged in that meeting with the SIU did it remain or was it changed?    Why?   Who instructed the postponement?    Right and did representatives of the SIU eventually make mirror images of hard drives and laptops?    Right.  In paragraph 32.5 you talk about interactionbetween two Bosasa servers.    Please explain to the Chair what you are saying there.    Yes, we will hear of Mr Malan later, but.    To simplify things whilst Mr Malan or otherrepresentatives of the SIU were copying the data on the server that activity was being monitored on a connected server by the two gentlemen referred to in your affidavit?    Were the two gentlemen you refer to entrusted with any other task?    Right.  Let us deal with paragraph 33.1 then.  Did you ever see a copy of the SIU Report?    When did you see it?    When did you see it?    Right, when?    Can you recall more or less when you saw it?    And in paragraph 33 you list some of the contents of the report.   Containing information that you say you were indeed previously aware of and then you list a number of items in paragraph 33.  Just please read those out for the…    Chair.    Now you have given evidence about some of these issues in this list that you saw.    On, in the report.    Did you yourself give any evidence or information to the SUI investigators?    So the information that they gleaned and placed in their report must have come from sources other than yourself?    Chair because the SIU Report then may well constitute particularly on further evidence corroborating evidence it is our intention to go throughit, but will take some time, but before we go there perhaps we can just deal with 33.2 and 33.3 and then I am going to take Mr Watson.  I am sorry Chair, it is late.  Mr Agrizzi through the contents of the report.    Did you discuss the content of this report with Mr Watson?    What was his attitude at the time?    And did he give you any assurance?    Did he give you any advice?    [Intervenes].    Right.  Subsequent to the release of the report were any subpoenas issued?    Amongst others to Mark and Sharon Taverner?    And did you receive any instruction in relation to those subpoenas?   Do you have anything further to add and again please …[intervenes]?    A period of 18 months you say elapsed?    But along period from …[intervenes].    From the issue of the subpoena to the execution of the subpoena?    But eventually you say the subpoenas were complied with?    Right.  The SIU Report appears at page 279 of Bundle S1.    Yes.   And in terms of your instructions you ensured that this occurred?   Chair you are aware that the document at page 279 is incomplete.  The complete and by complete I mean basic report as opposed to the report plus all annexures is later on in Annexure S2.    EXHIBIT S2.    But because our preparations took place and my notes are in this document were put on this document in preparation for the evidence before the fuller one was put in the bundles.  Would you bear with me please if we go throughthe document at page 279 and then when necessary go to the document, the full document for the subsequent pages?    Otherwise I have to transfer all my notes.    Thank you Chair.  This report is preceded by an executive summary which appears on page 279 and in paragraph 1 of the executive summary it appears that the SIU’s intervention was authorised by a presidential proclamation.    Which was gazetted on 28 November 2007.    Reference is made to   That is what the executive summary says.  So as we will discover this SIU investigation deals only with contracts between the Department of Correctional Services on the one hand and Bosasa or Bosasa related companies on the other, right.    And it deals only with four contracts, what is referred to here as the Kitchens Contract, what we referred to in your evidence as the CateringContract.    Or contracts.  The second contract is the Access Control Contract.  Is that correct?    The third is the Televisions or CCTV Contract.    And the fourth is the Fencing Contract.    So it is only those four contracts between those two parties or sets of parties that are dealt with in this report.    We know of course that there are many other contracts tainted with the type of evidence that you have given.  Is that correct?    Alright.  The allegations that were investigated which came from the Public Service Commission and the Office of the Auditor-General are listed in the middle of paragraph or in the middle or page 279.  One of the more serious    The same issues were the subject of the investigations by the SIU.    Yes.  Well in some respects you are correct and in others not.    The SIU Report contains other information and some ofthe evidence you have given is not contained in the report.    But the purpose Chair of leading this evidence and taking the witness through is again to see what in the report this witness knows from his own knowledge and also to understand what evidence the SIU investigation produced.  We have that evidence in a series of affidavits and it will be impossible for this commission to call each and every witness, but those affidavits will be placed before you in their proper form and will be summarised and presented to you, but in short the evidence that this witness has given and will give appears at least to some extent to be corroborated by the outcome of the investigations of the SIU and the detail will follow.   And so the executive summary continues Mr Agrizzi to    In the executive summary the findings in respect of the Kitchens Tender HK2/2004 are set out.  Now you have given evidence of what you refer to as a Catering Contract or Catering Contracts.  Do you recall that?    Are those; is that evidence in fact the same relating to the same tender as is referred to here the Kitchens Tender?    Right and do you recognise that number HK2/2004?    And is that one of the contracts about what you have testified?    According to the SIU investigation it was awarded to Bosasa on 20 July 2004.    Evidence that you had not given and this may be given later Chair is referred to here in the SIU Report the summary of the executive summary   So we know that you paid the money.  We know why you say you paid the money.  According to your evidence of course still to be tested and we know that according to the SIU investigation as confirmed by you the recipient of that money played an integral role in the procurement process.    And as described here was irregularly instrumental in developing the tender specifications.  You have given that evidence.   And that appears to be confirmed now by the SIU    But you do know and you have told the Chair that there was an exchange of information between yourself and Mr Gillingham.    And Mr Mansell.  You have also told the Chair that this, well I am not sure that you have, but did this exchange of information take place over a computer?   Exchange between electronic devices?    The report goes on to read   “...the SIU Cyber Forensic Expert determined that this document originated from the computer of Mr Agrizzi, Bosasa’s Chief Executive Officer/ManagingDirector.” Leave aside the description of the post, but you have testified that documents were exchanged in relation to the bids between yourself and others and Mr Gillingham?    Alright.    Let us take it step by step because you have gone ahead.    Alright.  Let us deal with the first sentence.   Relevant to what we are discussing now.  It reads   “…the SIU Cyber Forensic Expert…”    “…determined that the particular document referred to originated from the computer of Mr Agrizzi.” What do you say about that?    You see the fifth paragraph.    It reads   Just a second. “Determined that the particular document that he is referring to originated from your computer.” Now let us just stop there.    Have you found that paragraph?    Sorry.    Are you on page 280?    Well perhaps Chair if I may interrupt.  I apologise,perhaps we should give the witness an opportunity to read the whole paragraph.    Yes, I think so.   Take your time.  We are over time, but perhaps we should finish this part.    No, he can read it silently to acquaint himself…[intervenes].    Every allegation in context.  Perhaps I am being unfair this late in the day by picking and choosing the sentences that I want to refer to.    Contrary …[indistinct] I was going in sequence, but I do not want to argue with you about that.  That is futile.  Just read the paragraph.    We cannot answer questions unfortunately, because we, it is your evidence.    But I would advise, you have legal representation?    Read it carefully, discuss it and we will discuss it tomorrow.    Thank you Chair.    About to answer your question.    We were on page 70.   At the end of paragraph 33.3. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Morning, Chair, are you well?    Good morning adv Pretorius, are you well?    That is good.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes, we can.    That is correct.    Thank you, Chair.  In June 2005 I had informal discussions as we would always have, Chair, with Gavin Watson regarding various things and this specific morning it was about high security fencing at the Department of Correctional Facilities.  And I remember that the discussions were initiated by him and it was evident that he was aware that the department needed some specific solution in this regard and I was at that stage I did not know that they needed something, but it was mentioned to me and he saw it as a potential business opportunity for the company.    No.    No, we had never done fencing before, Chair, it was something new to us.  We have never ever put up a fence.    Yes, we actually discussed it.  We said, listen we do not have the capacity to do this.  It was clear to me, sorry, does that answer your question?    Okay, so it was clear that, you know, he had been thinking about it and I know that him and at that stage Danny Mansell was thinking about it, but anyway, he indicated to me that he had discussed the commercial viability with a gentleman by the name of Mr Michael Rodenburg from Beta Bastion.    Rodenburg yes.   Not a problem.  It was at that stage Beta Bastion if I recall correctly and it then changed to Beta Fence during which the procurement of 26% shareholding of the South African branch of the company as a BEE was raised.    Correct.    That would be, well that would be Gavin Watson.    Yes, it was.    Do you want me to talk about the BEE deal?  Sorry, Chair, I just want clarity or can I take you through on what I say in my statement?  On how thetransaction was done?    Okay, thank you, Chair, for the clarity.  So Beta Fence, I was one day at the office and Beta sent some test panels, so I do not know if, Chair, knows what the fence looks like, but if you look at the clear view fence, that is maybe the better, the best example I can give and I got quite a few panels delivered to Bosasa.  They were delivered there and I asked, you know, what are these for?  And I was told, no, they – we need to look at how we can utilise them and are they up to the standardthat I would put out in the facilities.At the same time there was a taught wire system that was delivered to the facility and a taught wire system is basically a long box with barbed wire attached to it, at intervals strands, so if somebody tries to touch it, it triggers an alarm which goes through to the control centre. So I had no clue what to do with it.  I really just – they stood in storage for a while, but then I later became aware of the fact that there was actually an agreement that had been concluded already.    The agreement between Beta Fence and Gavin Watson or Bosasa, I do not know, because it was actually Bopha and Parforgo which are trusts, but I will just use the word Bosasa.  So alright, the agreement had been concluded between them for the 26% deal.  So soon thereafter I attended a meeting with Watson was there, Mansell was there, Rodenburg was there, who is the Managing Director ofBeta Fence.  There was a gentleman an engineer called J P Hobbs and there is a gentleman called Riaan, but I cannot remember his surname, but he was also from the same company as J P Hobbs and during this meeting it appeared that J P Hobbs and Riaan were involved were involved in a company called Teqcon and Modutech.  Those were the two companies and what they manufactured Chair was the taut wire systems as well as a sensor which went on the wired mesh which was a detection process system, a detection product for the system.  What was interesting was I, I did not really know about it so I started reading up on it and I understood that the specifications that they used it for was high security applications.  So if you go to a facility that has a fence you have the Bode Mesh from Beta Fence.  Then inside of that you have the taut wiresystem from Modutech.  So those were the two companies and then I started realising that this has been put together for a reason and this is why we are meeting.    No, there was absolutely no discussion of that.  As a matter of fact at that stage they were actually under pressure financially, because they had used up their budgets and I was battling to get payments out of them.    The Department of Correctional Services.    It becomes clear later that it was a, it was a ploy between Mansell, Rodenburg and Modutech, Riaan, J P bless him.  He is not here, but the otherpeople who were involved in it that was a ploy.  It was a plan to capture what was left of the fencing business at Correctional Services.    Alright.  I think the discussion really went specifically about how companies can work together and especially on getting a project with Correctional Services and one of them raised it that well perhaps what should happen is that Sondolo should subcontract to one of the other bigger companies and later the two companies, I mean, between Modutech and Sondolo they then become the prime, became the primary suppliers.  So Modutech did the taut wire and Sondolo did theinstallation of the cameras, the metal detectors, x-rays, screeners if it was necessary.  They did the installation of alarm systems all that type of thing.  So between the two companies they were the suppliers but at the, the third company was Beta Fence who would supply the welded mesh.    That is correct.  The additional thing is the beauty for …[intervenes].    That is correct.    Correct.  At that stage there was a lot of controversy already about the Bosasa Group.  So I was not directly involved, but I am giving you exactly as I know it.  So Gavin, Gavin and Tony Perry and Danny Mansell negotiated with Michael Rodenburg and a lady called Jean Rodenburg, Michael Rodenburg’s wife and a lady by the name of Gloria Josephs alright to buy a company which was owned by the Rodenburg’s and Gloria Josephs called Phezulu Fencing.  I do not know the specifics of the actual agreement, but what I do know is that the sale was destined only to go through once the contract had been awarded to Phezulu.  That was made very clear to everybody.  It was public knowledge at Bosasa that we had to avert any negativity at that stage towards Bosasa and the only way you would avert this, because this ismassive contract one of the biggest fencing contracts ever done, you know, and because they did not want attention we said, they said alright.  Phezulu is there.  Award the contract to Phezulu and on top of that the sale would only go through of Phezulu once the contract had been awarded to Phezulu.    [intervenes] let us rather use – let us not personalise it I think Chair.  Let us use Bopa and Phafoga.    Yes.    Correct and the sale would also only go through when the Duplo fencing, because we called it Duplo …[intervenes].    And it was called the Duplo fence.    So this was – that was a fact.  It was done to hide that that Bosasa Group would receive any more contracts.    Now during that period it was also agreed that Gloria Josephs who was heading the company and was a shareholder together with Michael Rodenburg’s wife and Phezulu would be paid a nominal fee of a few million Rands for the company, but then they would be allowed to subcontractors Gordian (Pty)Ltd.  Gloria would have only really to appear in meetings as the Kwazi CEO as Phezulu’s CEO and she would basically just be there for name only, but the management of Phezulu was taken over from day one of the signing of the contract, but the shareholding would only come through later.    Okay.    That is correct.   That is correct.  It would be a process - to add an explanation – it would be a process that would be undertaken undercover very quietly so that nobody really knew about it and nobody would question it.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct.    Incorrect.  Chair Mr Rodenburg’s wife was Jean Rodenburg and she was a shareholder as was Gloria Josephs.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair, no …[intervenes].    There were other shareholders, but I cannot recall who they are.    Together Jean Rodenburg and Gloria Josephs held the majority shares.    That is …[intervenes].    Yes.  So the agreement was – just to recap Chair for clarity – Bosasa would pay a couple of million Rand for the shareholding in Phezulu as well as agree to subcontract a large portion of the tender to Gordian.  That was the arrangement that was made.    Correct.    Well …[intervenes].    Yes.  At the same time we entered into a supply agreement with Beta Fence whereby Phezulu, where at the time when Phezulu Fencing be awarded, is awarded the contract for the Department of Correctional Services for the Duplo or the double fencing Beta Fence would supply all fencing material to Phezulu Fence and it would be at a lower cost.  So it would be at base cost.  Now the Duplo – if I can give a little bit of history to it – is a normal mesh fence and we put an extra strand on the outside of the fence which gives it slightly more rigidity, but what it does do is it changes the makeup of the actual product which is then patented.  So in actual fact it was my idea Chair but Michael Rodenburg patented it and his idea.  It did not worry me, but just so you know the detail.  Nobody else could manufacture that fence because itwas patented.  So there was a premium price put onto it Chair so anybody could buy it, but they would have to pay the premium price.  Whereas the tendering, the [indistinct] that put this together basically had a price advantage of 30 percent already.    Correct.    That is correct.    Ja.    Well …[intervenes].    Beta Fence …[intervenes].    Beta Fence at that stage was financially in trouble in South Africa.  They were literally in a bad state.  So they needed a massive transaction like this and at the same time they also needed empowerment.  So they had another company called Syngenta and unfortunately as I mentioned yesterday I did not have time to put everything in, but this company gave up their 26 percent shareholding which was then given to Bopa and Phafoga so that they would have empowerment as well.  Not a sent was paid for the shareholding.    Syngenta.  It was a group called Syngenta.  S-A-G-E-N-T-A [spelt].    Into, in Beta Fence?    In Beta Fence and it was transferred over to the two trusts that are held by Bosasa.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Nobody even knew.  I do not think Corrections knew themselves.   After …[intervenes].    Because it was a shock to them when the tender started coming out.  I remember attending meetings.    Well it was Corrections but maybe, maybe I should clarify.  Maybe one or two individuals or three individuals who actually knew about it.  It was done totally, because remember normally this Chair would go through Public Works.    Public Works is responsible.  So …[intervenes].    Yes, ja.    Normally …[intervenes].    Correct.  So if there was a need they would have to put a need in.    Public Works would attend to it, but I do not want to digress into that.  I cannot talk about …[intervenes].    That too much.    Hm, but what I can tell you is that in 2005 Chair I went to Bloemfontein with Danny Mansell.  We flew in.  I remember it because we nearly crashed the plane, because they overloaded it.  So it is vivid in my memory and we met with the Greylings at SA Fence & Gate and the goal of this meeting which I only found out when I walked into the offices of SA Fence & Gate from Danny Mansell that they needed to become subcontractors to Phezulu Fencing after it had been awarded the Duplo fencing Correctional Services Contract for the installation of the fences and it was not the only one.  That was the only one I attended, but other arrangements were made with a company called Live Wire, Gordian, Mavundla Ironclad and L & J Civils.  L & J Civils was a company that was owned by Mr Danny Mansell and Jarryd Mansell, his son, and his other son was…[indistinct] Mansell, but I cannot recall if he was a shareholder and there was a gentleman by the name of Jaco Pitso who represented a company which I just cannot remember.  This was over 14 years ago.  So the arrangement was what they agreed which I will still - and I was there - the aforementioned arrangement required each of them to submit separate tenderapplications for the Duplo fencing tender.  So what I am trying to explain Chair is that the agreement was we are submitting as subcontractors for Phezulu, but at the same time we are also submitting as our own company.  So …[intervenes].    Well, no it is not very normal.    It is not normal at all.    Nothing whatsoever.   The reason Chair is because – let us get our ducks in a row.  This is the biggest fencing tender in the history of South Africa, Africa and probably the Southern Hemisphere.    Correct.    Originally the plan was to start with Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3.  Phase 1 would be the fence at 47 of the Centres of Excellence they call them to make sure that everybody sees them and at that stage as well there were quite a few escapes and that type of thing.  So this fence would prove as the solution, the utopia of how to run a prison and it is being applied in, it is a very good system being applied internationally and South Africa’s prisons would be the first in the world to have all ofthem using this technology, but it was also the monopolising of the fencing contracts with Correctional Services, because once you were in you were in for life.  You controlled the source.  You controlled the client and you could rape our country of as much as you wanted to, because you just start charging more and more and more.  That is a fact.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct, but perhaps I failed to explain that.  They would bid in a controlled manner.    Okay.    Correct.    That is correct.    Are you; sorry Chair I want some clarity.  Are you asking me did somebody in Correctional Services liaise with somebody in Bosasa and knew what they wanted out of this deal?   Yes.    Yes, sir.    Chair this was …[intervenes].    Chair this, and I am being frank, because what you said this morning was so true.  I did not come here to be crucified by the press.  I came here to rid this country and to try and help free us of all the corruption that is killing us and is destroying our future of our kids.  So the answer is very simply this was …[indistinct] Correctional Service specifically Richmond Linda Mti and Patrick Gillingham would do as they were instructed as they had been captured by Gavin Watson, Danny Mansell and Bosasa including myself.    Does that answer the question?   Correct and the rest of my affidavit …[intervenes].    Will actually show on this specific topic …[intervenes].    How it went about.    Mr Mansell complied, compiled the specification documents for 47 of the Department of Correctional Services Facilities Chair.  This was for the fencing and the security.  He also did the specification for the taut wire.  So what he didwas he got the companies who would do the taut wire virtually to provide specification and print them and put them into the specification.  He personally sat and did them.  I know that.  I attended one or two of the meetings.  At that stage he was staying at the Cedar Lodge in Krugersdorp and he had quite a large room and he had often asked me to come over there and just have a chat with him in the evenings and I would go there and we would just talk generally, but I think he was lonely and he needed to talk.  Just like I do right now.    Yes, I did.   This happened before any tender was issued and I can add to this if you need me Chair.    It is.    It is part of my statement.    So he also informed me at one of these meetings that his son was already working on the various correctional sites already now this is before a tender is even promulgated and he was doing surveys with a specific …[indistinct] light that we had bought and an engineer who we had employed unbeknown to myself and he was pointing out the various Correctional Centres already.  It was disturbing because how can you go and work on the site and rather let them do it, let them do thespec and this happened long before the tender documents were even issued.  So those …[indistinct] light plans and that were ready before the tender specification was always, ever put out.  It is …[intervenes].    That is correct Chair.  If I can give you an example.    It takes you on average two days to do say JohannesburgManagement Area.  We had 47 sites to do.  Take 47 times about two that tells you how long before the time more or less it was done.    I am just giving you, I am just giving you how long    Before it was.    Because if you take 47 sites it will take you at least let us say just a day to do a site.    Say we are working really hard.  47 sites …[intervenes].    Times a day gives you 47 days    Correct.    You are 100 percent correct.    Chair the regulations are very clear that the bid must be advertised and there is a period of time that it must lay and the response must be in bya period of time.  So I cannot recall exactly when the response was of the top of my head.  We can get to that later in my statement, but the benefit is that if I had done the surveys with the …[indistinct] light at all the facilities that would come out and tender.  By the time the tender is put out I have done all the work.  The other people have to run around like mad to try and measure the sites and get the distances and all that accurately.  The advantage is here that the Bosasa Group through Phezulu and Bopa and Phafoga had the advantage.  We had headway before everybody else could even see the spec.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct Chair.    Well to the two entities Phafoga and Bopa yes.    Within – indirectly Bosasa.  It is all these various names andthat Chair is…    That is right.    You are hundred percent – you are hundred percent correct.    You said it Chair.    Okay I was asked Chair to oversee the bid – the bidding process.  Normally in the group of companies I would be personally involved with every single bid that went out of the company through the bid office.  So I was asked to put a team together to draft the tender bid and the submission thereof.  I requested that I was at that …[intervenes].    On behalf of Phezulu.   That is correct.    So I requested that you know another team be put on the project because there were people available that were not busy.  That I was extremely busy it was a time when we were extremely busy operationally I was spending weeks away on the various catering sites and on the Sondolo Security installation sites.  So for me to get into the office to do the research to write up on fencing and especially because I knew nothing about fencing I actually did not enjoy it.  I did not want to get involved with it.  So they agreed.  It was agreed and – but it was told to me that from the management and directorate that I must still keep oversight.  They would release me from it but I need to be there for oversight and to make sure that the quality of the product put down at the end of the day was suitable.  So from my side I just maintained oversight and then what happened was I then learnt later on that the team that had been put together which compromised of certain people that had been recentlyemployed from a fleet management company that worked with Transnet I think it was called HAS.  So there was a team that we employed from them, put them in there, they then did the tender and the bid submission and it was done in conjunction with various of the representatives from the various other fencing companies.  Because remember by now the agreements had been tied up with the various companies to do that.    That is correct.    Interesting.  I attended the office and if you know where – if you had been to my office you would know that my office was on the right hand side in the executive block but the executive block does not have nice toilet facilities and I always liked to go through to the main boardroom where I would utilise the facilities there and make myself a coffee and then go back to work.  So one evening I was there working late and I walked through to the boardroom and I saw every single one of the companies as listed there – they were all working on the bid.  So in one of the boardrooms everybody was seated around the boardroom and they were busy working on the bid document and the submission of the bid itself.  I then raised a concern.  Two reasons number 1 is I asked “did you switch off the camera systems?”  I remember this vividly and it is not in my statement.  But I asked “did you switch off the camera systems?  Because if that is happening in the boardroom there was at that stage a camera in the boardroom.  I said it is not a good thing to show everybody, everybody sitting around the same table doing figures and I raised this concern with both Danny Mansell and Mr Watson.  But I – like everything else I was always told “do not worry wehave it all under control.”  Does that answer …[intervenes].    They were not in the boardroom.  They were not in the boardroom at that stage.  They were outside the boardroom.  And then they actually came and sat in my office and they were in and out of my office as well.    Yes it was one evening ag seven o’clock, eight o’clock.    In the boardroom were representatives.  I cannot – no I actually can – there were representatives of each of the companies that were part of the bid submission.  So it was Phezulu, Gordian, Life Wire.  It was Bosasa people who were in there?    Sorry?    Mavundla Ironclad and Jaco Pitso’s company as well was there.    No Beta Fence was there as well Mr Michael Rondenburg.    But he was interacting more with Mansell and Watson.    They were one of the companies’ part of the bid but they would not submit a bid.    Because they were only a manufacturer.    Correct.   That is correct.    Yes.  It had to look authentic Chair.    Some of the other companies would bid separately so they would put in a bid but then they would be told to put in a separate bid in their own companies’ name at a different price so that it would not look obvious that it is only Phezulu bidding.    Chair I cannot recall that.    I cannot recall it at all sorry.    It is only in the times of bonafide tenders and bids.  This was caucused.  This was corrupt.  They did not have to follow any rules really.  It just needed to appear real.   It was not normal.    That is correct we would never.   Correct.    You are hundred percent right Chair and I will substantiate that by saying they had asked me to put up a test panel and it was a flop.  We could not even do ten meters of it, it was an absolute flop.  I had a maintenance guy by the name of Hennie Viljoen who is mentioned in the statement try and put it up it was a gemors of note.   Yes.    That is correct Chair.    As I indicated earlier I mean just look at the number of sites and times it by the days at minimum two, three months before a tender even was promulgated.    Far before.    Correct.    Yes Chair.    That is – that is correct Chair.    I am just trying to find my space Chair.  25, 26, 27.14.  Sorry Chair I am taking my time.    Chair if I can just mention I remember the other company now Mr Jaco Pitso’s company.   It seems to be jogging my memory.      Just for the record it was called Siyaya Fencing.    Correct.    Correct.    Well the fencing tender was advertised on the 14 November 05.    27.14?    14 October 2005 it was advertised.    By the Department of Correctional Services.    Chair the contract was awarded to Phezulu on the 29 November 2005.    Correct.    Depends Chair if they would have to visit the sites.  Because when the tender is advertised they normally have a site briefing session that takes a day.  Then normally what happens is the bidders would have to go to site and understand the site itself, the 47 sites.  Now with the electronic GPS theodolite you can do it in maybe 47 days.  If you do not have a GPS theodolite it is going to take you pretty much longer.  So they were given six weeks to do it.  I can tell you now it was virtually impossible for anybody to put in a bid that was of substantial value like this in that period of time.    That is correct.    The only technology that could have perhaps been used was the theodolite.  I do not think Google Maps was really working well at that stage so in today’s time you could perhaps do it with Google Maps.    But that would still be a stretch.    That was 2005 there was no Google Maps then.   Correct.    Chair that is correct.    That is correct.    Chair it was not the normal period because everybody knew that this was very tight timing.  They could have given them – there are some tenders out at the moment I am busy working on one where you have a three month’s response time.  This was specifically made six weeks.  Not the normal thirty days but six weeks to say no but we have made it longer than normal.    At that time I do not want to speculate Chair but let me give you an example.  The PPP’s we had up to a year to put in a bid document.  On the catering tender I think it was thirty days on the one.  On another one there was sixty days so it varies from each one.    You can see in this one there was specifically the time was limited for a reason.    Those are Public Private Partnerships.  I headed up aconsortium to submit tenders for the building of the private prisons previously that was cancelled.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct Chair.    Correct it is actually…    Chair he is actually correct.    Chair I do not have that information available.  I was not intricately involved with this bid.     But what Advocate Pretorius just mentioned is a hundred percent correct.  There were four weeks literally left.    They must have used the minimum time.  So it was not six weeks it was four weeks.    Impossible.    Thank you Chair.    Correct Chair.    It was R486 937 910,00.    Well that was not the total value.  Eventually it – I mean it grew and grew and grew.  I cannot recall but that half a billion rand that is correct.    That was the submission value.    You will recall earlier I also eluded to the fact that there is like with the other tender, with the catering tender I was not involved with the pricing of this one but basically you know there is ways and means that you get variation orders and you grow the tender.  And I cannot recall who the accountant was at that stage but he was – I remember they – a bright person but they manipulated figures as well if I recall correctly and I actually caught them out at one stage.  I will recall the name later on.    Well there was a maintenance contract.  So after you have implemented the fence you need a maintenance contract.  Like when you implement CCTV you need a security guard, control room contract.  So there was a maintenance contract which was supposed to run I think it was for three years thereafter and it wasbilled separately.    It was internally awarded from Phezulu to Sondolo IT.    No.    Chair I would – I would give oversight when I had to but it was not – I was not interested in it, I really was not.    Yes unfortunately I would have to attend on behalf of the BEE shareholders.  I would have to go to meetings occasionally I would take one or two of the directors with me so that we appeared as a company to be BEE.    Yes I did.    Chair when you have a shareholder and they are entitled to dividends the dividends are normally paid into the bank account.  Correct.  The problem comes in when you have played games with the dividends – with the shareholding and where does the shareholding now – the dividends now get paid to because you talking considerable amounts of money?  So the instruction to me was to instruct the attorney that the dividends for – that would come to Bopa and Phofoga would basically be paid into the trust account of the attorneys which is Mr Brian Biebuyck.   Well that is – no that is not true Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Tony Perry was the company secretary at thetime and he arranged that.    Well in terms – that is correct to put it that way.    Chair I cannot give you the trustee’s names I am sure they are on record.    No I – Chair what I can tell you is there is normally about ten people that sits on various boards and that would have been one of those people because they get swopped around a lot.    So it suited them they would move around and this month it would be Joe Gumede next month it will be Carol Makele the month after that it would be Muneride or Livera and it would change so I cannot remember.    Exactly and unfortunately Chair I do not have documents available I rely on what I have got.    Correct.    Well Gavin Watson and his family ultimately that is how it worked.    That is right.    Chair, what happened was, it was in 2005 I was at the office and I bumped into Mr Gillingham for about the fourth time and Day Masso[?] was with him as a matter of fact and we were having a five minute informal discussion and one of the things that he raised was that the televisions were problematic in correctional facilities, because offenders are not there, because they are stupid, and they are therebecause they are very clever.  So they would get TV agreements with these Early Bird and those high ring companies, who would put a TV in their cell and they just do not pay.It is very difficult for someone to come and fetch it, but there were major issues with TV′s and TV programmes that were watched at night and that was basically what he discussed with us and he said can I design a system where you have a centrally distributed TV management program that – let me try and explain that.So in other words, what would happen is, they wanted a system where each cell, right around the country had a TV screen that would be able to be programmed so that you could decide as the head of prison what they would watch, what volume youwould set it and what would be distributed to that television.  They wanted it a bit further, take it a step further to network all of these together and create a system whereby, for instance if the Minister who at that stage would want to speak to every offender, he could stand in one place and we would be able to stream over IP nationally. So I designed a system like that for them.    Well together with assistance yes.    But the, can I continue?    Okay, so the rating of the system would have to be an IP65 which is Ingress Protection 65, which means that the unit had to be waterproof and vandal resistant, so it was a unit that we needed to make sure that nobody could breakit, nobody could tamper with it and nobody could splash water on it, because it will become very expensive to repair.Can I continue?    Well Mansell and Gavin Watson indicated to me that that department, because obviously they were talking a lot with Richmond Mti who was the Commissioner, Patrick Gillingham who was then made the CFO.  So they said that Correctional Services had surplus funds in their budget and they needed to use it quickly and the problem with that is, if they do not use their funding, this is what I wastold, it goes back to Treasury and it goes back into the big pot and somebody else will get to it.So what needed to happen was, they said to me I need to go ahead with the design of the television system and I must make sure that it has to incorporate a network that is interfaced, because in the future we can use that network.  So set up the infrastructure, the network infrastructure there and later on you can use that network infrastructure to – that you put in, to transmit the data on TV, which you can then use where you can at a later stage, you can then sell, on sell extra products that you cannot – sorry, to the system.  Sorry, I am born in South Africa, but I talk with my hands.  So unless I sit on my hands.  Sorry, Chair.So they wanted a network in there so that you could then plug in other value adds for instance, cell phone detection.  One of them was video, thermal imaging, because sodomy was a major problem.  We have been experiencing the same problem at the youth centres and you are allowed to, according to our law you are not allowed to put cameras where people change or sleep, but you may put thermal imaging in,because you are not getting a clear picture, you are getting thermal imaging pictures.  So that was one of the future plans as well.So the whole idea was to create this network using the TV camera systems and create it so that we could plug in other internet protocol devices.  Does that answer the question sir?    Correct, at that stage as well one of the biggest problems in, because we were working daily with Correctional Services, we understood their issues.  One of the things that they had, needed, was an integrated computerised offendermanagement system.  So we were given the documents to design a system on what basis, on all the Correctional Services forms.  I think Gillingham actually spent time with some of our people in the IT division, actually designing a system.I do not know if it has been implemented yet, but it was a fully encompassing system that designed from the offenders court appearances right the way through to what to do with his body if he needed to be buried or repatriated.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That document was given to Danny Mansell and was – became part of a tender specification.   It was, if I remember correctly, sorry I just want to catch up with my notes, you are going a bit fast.    Sorry, it was given – after the design was done it was given to Mansell and to Gillingham, the same process, but by then they had realised that I knew about it, so I would put it on a disc and just hand it over to them.    Yes.    Well the instruction was that the specifications I had to draw up the actual nitty gritty specifications and the diagrams and the component level diagrams for the tender specification.  So I asked one of the manufacturers who is actually innocent in this, but I asked them to assist me in drafting the actual – because they are diagrams, they are plans, that type of thing, and that was Elandre Fourie from Pinnacle Micro at that stage.    Yes, Chair?    That is correct sir.    That is correct sir.    Yes sir.    The invitation to bid was only advertised after the planninghad gone into it, but …[indistinct] to the fencing won the bid.  Document was only issued out, advertised on 14 October 2005.    That is correct.    Everything I did was based on instruction, Chair, that is correct.    No, it was done through Sondolo IT which was a recently established company that was set up.    It is one and the same, Chair.  The easiest way for me to explain it, Chair, is to say that every single company in the group has one bank account and that is a singular bank account.  So it all filters from all this, filters into one central bank account.    That is correct.    It was a given.    Because it was prepped before the time, it was – everybody knew that this was going to happen.  You know the famous words were do not worry about it my mate, I have got it under control we will get it.  That is how it went.    On 3 March 2006.    Correct.    Correct, Chair.    If I recall correctly and I am sure I am right it was Bosasa Operations Pty Limited.  I never had access to that account, but I recall that was the account.    It was R224 364 480.    That was as I mentioned earlier, Chair, where it all started.  It then needed to grow.    Well in 2006 I remember it was actually very comical, because poor Tony Perry had to subject himself to prayer meetings every morning and he did not enjoy it and he would complain excessively, but he was asked by Gavin Watson to register Mti′s company called Leonora Investments.  Leonora is basically Richmond Mti′s mother′s or late mom′s name, but I remember it vividly, because of the fact that poor Tony Perry was an elderly man would have to come in and get on his knees and he complained that his knees would get very sore in the prayer meeting.    That is correct.    I do not know why.    Correct.    Correct.    Well the catering tender, the one that started in July – during July 2007, the catering tender was extended for a further year, as it was about to expire in September of 2007, so it was then also then further extended by another six months. The person that ensured that it got extended was a lady by the name of Nontsikelelo Jolingana and she was the acting head at that stage of the bid adjudication committee of DCS.    Nontsikelo[spelt].    That is correct.    Nontsikelelo.    Correct.    I am not sure of the spelling.   My apologies if the name is incorrect.    But I actually you know when one starts to read through this, Chair, sorry…[intervenes]    One starts to remember things and it reminds you.   I actually recall in the meeting when this was extended that there was an objection at the time from the Jennie Schreiner and there was another person that objected and there was a big feral about this.  So perhaps, I do not know if the investigation team just wants to check up, there are minutes to that.    Yes.    She was at a senior level, I do not know exactly what position she held, but I do recall getting a call saying that this whole thing is not going down very well with everybody to have the extension and they should have put it out on tender, which is correct.    No, she was in Correctional Services.  Sorry, it just jogged mymemory now.    But she assisted, well not assisted, she was against going against the protocol that should have been followed.    So I recall that.  Sorry.    Yes.    Yes, it was in the actual meeting.   Correct.    She was not happy that the contract would be extended like this.  It needed to go out to tender again.    I remember that.    Yes.    That is correct, Chair.    Chair, that is correct.  I do not want to confuse issues by just giving this information right now, but it came to my memory and I thought let me just give it to you so that you can – the team can collaborate that what we are putting before you is the truth.    Chair, …[intervenes]    Chair, there were two/three – there were two people at the meeting that I know of.    And then the other members of the bid adjudication committee would have been there, but the record is there.  We can pull the record.    And we can verify it.    Correct.   That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    The objection was lodged for the record on the first extension which was a year extension.    Yes.    I do not know about that.  I know that she raised an objection.    Yes, and I think let us stick to that.    That is correct.    I think, Chair, that was in November 2006.    No, I had not.    I just assisted with things that I was told to do by Mr Watson, assistance in terms of documents or if he needed some information or research done I would do it for him.    Yes, so it is November 2006 and then in 2007 of the new year that is when I met him.    So what I mean by that is during approximately 2007 it wasthe second meeting.    Yes.    No.    Correct.    Yes, so it should have read after 2006 during 2007, that is what it should say.    That is correct, Chair.    It happened in about 2005, Chair.  That is where it really started and it was predominantly the Beeld and Die Burger, it was Karien du Plessis and Adriaan Basson and it is marked in my bundle as Annexure K.    That is correct.   That is correct.    That is correct.    Most definitely.  It was perpetual.    Most definitely it was uncomfortable.    Chair, during 2007 it was – I cannot remember exact dates and that.  I met Mr Mti for the second time so I would, it was in the morning sometime I went with Mr Watson to Richmond Mti′s house in Savannah Hills Estate and I was informed, we sat outside waiting, because he had gone on a morning walk I think and we sat outside waiting and Gavin said you see this beautiful house, he was actually being vicarious and said you build for this politician meaning that you know he was being, he was saying that we worked and we earned the money and he would say that you actually build it, because it was an expensive house.So I was also informed that all the furnishings in the house had been doneand later on the scheme when the SIU report broke and that and everything started coming out I was then only really informed of the scheme that happened.  Until that time I did not know how they had done it.  I suspected that there was bribery in terms of Richmond Mti and the house and all that, but I did not have a clue who had organised it, how it had been done, it was very secretive.    Well there is a company called Riekele Construction.    That is the correct spelling there Riekele.  Riekele[spelt] which is operated by a gentleman of the name of Riaan Hoeksma.  He did not only build that house, but he also was involved with the building of the house for Gillingham and Gillingham′s house was at Midstream Estates.  It was I think Hartengate, I cannot remember, obviously I am not going to give out the actual addresses, because that would put them at risk and that type of thing.So, at this stage Riekele Construction had been given a lot of work by Bosasa.  He was busy revamping certain parts of Lindela.  Then we bought up two hostels, the old hostels, one is – one was called Two North and so they were doing a lot of work and there was a lot of building taking place.  So all the payment of these costs of these houses the construction of them was done via Bosasa through Riekele or whatever, but the payment of these costs of the houses done by Bosasa was done via a company which Danny Mansell had set up to handle this type of thing and was called Prande Four Pty Limited.    Grande[spelt], okay, is that fine?   Subsequently false invoices were submitted then by Grande Four to Bosasa.  So the reason I know about Grande Four is, because when we had to do a clean-up we had to specifically go look for Grande Four and we had to take the invoices out, we had to change them manually as well.So they then submitted these false invoices into the books with the original ones were destroyed when the SIU report started coming out.    So what happened was when we got wind of the SIU Report coming out we had to look for every single aspect that could be used to nail Bosasa especially Gavin and Danny Mansell.  So what had to happen was we had to drill down - the computerised system is called Great Plains Dynamics.  So we would have to drill down.  You would do a search, Gillingham.  So you type in Gillingham in searches and it would show up certain invoices.  Those invoices the detail on them would say thiswas for Richmond Mti.  He wanted his room a little bit bigger.  So we built an extra 400 m² onto the house so that he had his own private swimming pool inside and all that detail was there.  So that detail had to be removed and a dummy invoice put in its place which said work at Lindela.  We built a stadium for the detainees to play soccer in.  So we swopped the invoice, because your reference cannot be taken off the Microsoft System at that stage.  So that is why there were fraudulent invoices going around, but it would need really forensic work and I mean that is why I have tendered my assistance to assist there.    Does that clarify it for you Chair?   Yes.  So what would happen is and there was one specific example with a mezzanine floor that needed to be built and concrete needed to be thrown where our …[intervenes].    Sorry.    This was at, at one of the construction sites at Leopards Vlei.  If you want the detail I can give you the detail Chair.    Okay.    Okay.  Sorry you …[intervenes].    Okay.  So basically they inflated those costs and then put some of the house costs through there.    That is correct.    Well it was a very, I do not think this does it justice at all and, and quite simply it cannot be explained.  You know, one needs to do it forensically, but basically the house was registered in a company called Autumn Storm Investments which was a company which Riekele Construction had an interest in.  That is how it was registered.  The whole idea was that there was a tender out, put out, for the accommodation of the National Commissioner at that stage. Riekele bid for it, got it and then just basically moved him into the house.  So the tender came out – I would prefer if we do a forensic on that, but to put it in a nutshell a tender was promulgated and Riekele got the business.  The house had been already built and all that happened then was Public Works entered into a rental agreement with Riekele and the department paid the rent every month for that property.    Correct.   You know I am commenting Chair on this, because I found this out afterwards.  I did not know what had actually happened there, but Bosasa paid for the furnishings of both the houses and Mark and Sharon Taverner owned and operated a company.  I think it was …[indistinct] or something like that which then sought to the furnishing and the decor and invoiced Bosasa for that.    Yes.    Chair that is correct.    Yes.  That is correct.    The agreement, the agreement according to Mti was that rental would accumulate and accumulate and eventually once Mti was out of politics and out of Government then he would be able to say it was a growing investment.  He would be able to then access the funds.    Mti.    It would not have happened, because in 2009 with the release or 2007 with the release of the SUI Report they would not, I mean it would be too obvious.    That is correct, but it can be corroborated by the investigators.    Well yes, the house was supposed to be transferred over to him.  That never happened.  I believe that, you know, the gentleman Riaan Hoeksma took advantage of the situation and sold the house.    You are 100 percent.    Everything was paid by Mark and Sharon Taverner.  The building was paid by Riekele Construction and there was rental paid by Correctional Services.    If I can correctly correct.    No, he did not leave straightaway.  He left a while later.  He, he relocated to another house, but he continued to pay the rent, because he thought he was getting the money back from Riaan Hoeksma.    I refer to my statement and I say in 29.5.5 it was approximately 18 months.   Correct, but just a correction.  It was not at Savannah Hills.  It was close to Savannah Hills.  There is another estate just down the road.    Savannah Hills.    Okay.  So that was an oversight Chair.    Yes, most definitely.    Well furniture, repairs, maintenance a variety of things that, you know.  There are certain things that I know of and certain things I will not know of.   So later when Riaan Hoeksma was supposed to actually transfer the house to Mti we actually said to him, I went to a meeting with Andries van Tonder and we said well everything had kind of quietened down a little bit.  We were …[indistinct] so we said, we went to go and see Riaan Hoeksma and said you need to transfer the house now.  That was the agreement you had made with Gavin and Mansell and Mti, because they us told us that was the agreement and Hoeksma said, look sorry guys I have registered a bond over the house and I used the rent to pay thebond.    We are talking about the Savannah Hills house.    Yes.    No, no there are two houses.  There are two different houses.    So the first one in 29.5.6 is the Savannah Hills he, where he relocated to Savannah Hills.  That is a complex and we actually drove past it thismorning.  It is a complex right next door to Savannah Hills.  Remember I said in 259.5.6    Savannah Hills is a complex.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    The complexes are right next to each other.    One is a high end complex, Savannah Hills.    And then there is a slightly middle class/upper class complex next door to it.    Which he also owned a property, but that one was registered in his name.    So we then went, if you look at the chronology that I have put    “He then was living in the, the new town house.”    Alright.    “In the, in the estate close to Savannah Hills.”    I do not know.    That is correct.    So if I can just clarify.    I want to just explain.  So you had Autumn Storm Investments.    That company should have been transferred over to Richmond Mti.    That was the agreement.    There should be no bond there or anything like that.    Riaan Hoeksma must have got himself into cash flow problems.    So he went to register a bond.    Because then he got four/five million or R6 million out on the property.    And he then says, we asked him but you are supposed to have this pot of money.    Where every month the rent was paid into and you are supposed to not have a bond there.  Now you do not have the pot of money and you do not have the house, because it is bonded up, but of course he has got a beautiful game farm and all those type of things.    It was after.    Because that was specifically why everything had calmed down.   And we went to go and see Riaan Hoeksma to move the property into his name, because he was asking for it.    Does that clarify?    Correct.    Just repeat the question sir.  I did not hear that clearly.    The meeting was attended by Gavin Watson, myself and Mti.    Well he wanted a proposal to be presented that he couldutilise for presentation on the 2010 World Cup Security.    Chair I was given a task to prepare a security plan and assist him wherever possible in doing the presentation that he would at a later stage present.    Correct.    Yes, Mr Mti got his monthly fees paid over by Gavin Watson.    I saw the grey bag being given to Mr Mti.   Correct.    It was at Mti’s house.    No this one, this one was actually at Savannah still.    Correct.    It was just before the World Cup presentation.    I would say about two/three months before they did the World Cup presentation Chair.    No, I am not aware of it.    On the way back, I would drive the car normally.  What happened was Gavin Watson jokingly said you see we pay monopoly money, but this man delivers on his promises.  That, he called him that fat man, delivers on his promises.  He would always call fat people fat, but I am just giving you, he said that man delivers on his promises. If he promises something he gets it done.    Yes.    That is correct.    This was because, I mean as long as the contract lasted the agreement with him and, and Watson was as long as the agreement last, the contract lasted he would be paid.    Correct and I mentioned the other lady as well Ms Winnie Ngwenya.    And Ruben Pillay.    So with the junior people.    That is what happened.    But because Mti was instrumental, he and Gillingham were instrumental in Correctional Services that is why to today they are still being looked after.    Because those contracts are still in place     Because those contracts are still in place.    Well till …[intervenes].    Chair up to the time I left.    Which was on 15 December 2016.    Correct.   Correct.    15 December 2016.    Was my last working day.    Yes, you are right …[intervenes].   That is correct.    As a matter of fact Chair.    And I think it is further on you will see in my statement.  I will not go there now I had actually refused to do a delivery and Gavin Watson came to fetch at, at my house and he did the delivery.    But I will get into it later.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.  He always delivered on his promises.  I do not understand question.    Okay.    Had an …[intervenes].    But …[intervenes].    Yes.    Correct.    No, it was only later after the conversation that I learnt that it was a monthly amount and there was a monthly fee of R65 000 a month, but from thenon I would start accompany to more and more meetings.    Yes, I did.    Well every month from 20, when he was released from the World Cup and even before, but every month that Gavin Watson would go through to Mti I would accompany him.  So it is phenomenal.  I mean at least for 24/30 times.    From when he left Correctional Services, because that iswhen I really got to know him.    Correct.    Yes.    That is …[intervenes].    Spot on.    Can I just ask you Chair when the Polokwane elections was, because there is a timeline there as well that I can refer back to then?  I am justthinking now when.    Yes.  No, just.    Sorry it just ties up with, with what I was saying.  Sorry.    Yes, I did.  I became aware of travelling costs that were paid for.  I became aware that apparently a holiday was arranged by Gavin Watson’s brother-in-law Mark Taverner at the Bushman’s River, but I would be often tasked as well to do, arrange flights for the whole family.  I was instructed to just make sure that everything went well.  So I had to open up an account with Blakes Travel and the account’s name was in JJ Venter’s name.  There were payments for some of the studies of the kids and from the previous marriage his son actually worked at Bosasa and there would be various other ways that we could assist and, and try and make him feel good.    Of course.    He was actually my later father-in-law.    That is correct and other people as well.  Other politicians as well would use that account.    No, we just used the name.    It was not registered or.    There was no, Brian Blake from Blakes Travel knew me exceptionally well and he was not interested in being, I just used the name JJ.    I submitted all the documentation to the team and with the accounts as well.  There are accounts in JJ Venters name, but the tickets and the names on the tickets.  For example at the Jazz Festival and that is in the person’s name who actually did the travelling.    Correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Well there was a security official put there to look after him by Bosasa.  Joe Gumede arranged it.  There was an incident one evening I recall whereMr Mti pulled out a gun and there was an issue there and there was driving under the influence.  So those are the type of things.  Is that the answer you are looking for?    That is correct.    That is correct.  The answer is that is correct Chair.    Correct.    Well I was not involved in the sense that I had to go to court and sort out the thing.  But Mr Gumede requested money once, cash money to – he needed to bribe an official at one of the courts and it was to pay – to make a payment for – to get rid of a drunken driving charge.    That is true.    Chair that is true.    I cannot confirm that Chair I can only confirm what I gave Mr Gumede.    That is correct.    Well Chair my …[intervenes].   Chair I cannot recall but it would have been more than just pocket change.  It would have been considerable – it would have been between R10 000,00 and R20 000,00.    I cannot remember the exact amount let me rather not say.    Chair and it is not the only one I have to refer to another issue as well that happened and that was with – that involved a business school Ndlala which my – I was – I started off with son but there were two – there were two issues and sorry my apologies Advocate Pretorius as I said this was done very quickly.  The issue with regards to my brother was that my brother Watson said – I happened to be in the car with Watson when I went to go and visit a business started by my brother.  The business Watson tried to get us to pay Mti because Mti at that stage was complaining that he was not getting a salary and the banks were starting to get suspicious and he could not deposit the cash.  So he needed to filter money through my brother and put it through his business.  My brother was very uncomfortable about it.  I think he did one transaction and he terminated it.  He said listen this is not how I was brought up and heis not going to do it.  So he was very annoyed with me about it.  And basically what it was was to pay Mti money and then Bosasa would be invoiced for electrical work or whatever work he did for them.  So he was very uncomfortable about that.  And a similar situation happened with my son where he started a consulting business and what happened was I was asked by Gavin because the son of Mti was not – he was going through a rough patch and he needed to be paired up with somebody who would motivate him and encourage him.  So unfortunately Watson said well there is Angelo he has got a son and my son was doing very well and why do you not set up the two.  So I asked my son please can you work with this guy you know develop him, see what can happen?   Maybe there is something in the future.  Because he was havingphenomenal problems with this boy.  So he needed a role model, he needed somebody to guide and aspire him so – and I am sorry this is not in the affidavit but I will follow up in writing.  So what actually happened was my son got involved with – through me I made the mistake.  So there was a meeting held I think we had it at Clearwater Mall at a restaurant.  I tried to motivate the kid.  Well my son was there, Richmmond Mti was there, I was there and my son was there and the youngster was there his name is Vukani and we – we had a chat but nothing happened of it because my son also turned around and said look I think he registered the company and then he just canned it.  It did not trade a day.  So it was those type of situations that we were always subjected or I was subjected to.  You got to speak to this one, you have got to help that kid, you got to do this, you got to do that and it started to have a toll on me and on my family because my brother who I had raised started looking at me and saying well why?  My own son was being brought into this thing.  It was – you know it was terrible.  I mean I recall – I recall – sorry I am diverting sorry.  Sorry Advocate Pretorius.      Yes I will.    My apologies.    Correct.   Chair that is correct.    That is correct.   I cannot remember exactly I think it was one or two invoices.    And he just canned it he was unhappy with it.    Excuse me Chair.    Can I just for completeness just clarify something before Mr – Advocate Pretorius begins.    I just would like to clarify 27.17.    In terms of the payment of the dividends into the trust accountof the attorney.      I just want to clarify that.  So the dividends from Beta Fence would be paid into the trust account of the attorneys and it would then on instruction be transferred into the bank account of Bosasa Operations and that would be the flow.    As a transfer of dividends.    So the – there was no need to open up an account for Bopa and Phofoga.   Okay just for completeness.    I am – I am willing to tell you Chair.    And the reason is simple because the shareholders would have normally had to receive the dividends.  In this instance the shareholders who were reflected on paper were actually not shareholders.  So they did not get the dividends.    And a simple search and a request you would be able to verify that the dividends were never actually paid to the shareholders they were paid to Bosasa Operations.    Every single time.    Sorry Mr – Advocate Pretorius.    Sorry could you repeat the paragraph number please?    Sorry I am just looking.    Ah there we go sorry, sorry I did not see that.      Chair I together with Andries Van Tonder on instruction from Gavin Watson then had to attend to a meeting that was held with Riaan Hoeksma and the reason why was that we needed to make sure that he did not present a version to events – of events if he was questioned during an investigation that might incriminate any of the parties.  And at that stage and I believe to date he has still not been interviewed by anybody from the SIU.    So we attended a meeting to say to him please cover up in short.    He agreed.    The one in Savanna Hills that is correct.    Chair it is a townhouse complex situated if you coming from Johannesburg side – if you driving towards the Protea Hotel it is on that road.  It is on your left hand side Savannah Hills.  If you need details of the actual I can provide that.    It was on the market for about R6 million if I am not mistakenat one stage but that was quite a while back, about ten years ago.  And so the value of the property if I compare it for instance to my property I mean it is much more elaborate and my property is only valued at about R10 million.  That property would be valued at closer to about R18 million, R16 million between there.    No, no as of now.    Yes.    R18.    Correct.    29.9.  During 2007 Mr Vernie Petersen was appointed as the National Commissioner and on numerous occasions I tried to communicate with him – with him about possible ventures but he would have nothing to do with the Bosasa Group of Companies.    Yes.    That is correct.   Even to this day.    That is correct.    He lost out.  He walked out with only the furniture.    That is correct.    He was given an option of either staying in the house and staying in jail or moving out of the house so it could be covered up.   At one stage we increased his payment from R65 000,00 a month in cash to R100 000,00 in cash.  That was when he left the department.  Because the department originally was paying for his rent of the property which Bosasa had built.    That is correct.    We increased the monthly payments so that he could pay the rent.    Thank you Chair.      Of the Department of Correctional Services.    That is correct.    Correct.    Chair a meeting was co-ordinated I was called into the meeting it was the – it was not the first meeting, it was the second meeting and at the same meeting it was arranged between myself, Gavin Watson, there was a gentleman by the name of Khulekani Sitole who used to be the previous chairman – Commissioner of Correctional Services.  Another person that was…[intervenes].    Yes Chair.    2007 Chair.    Correct.    I am not too sure when he was.    But it was before.    There was another gentleman by the name of Sbu or I cannot recall his surname.  At the time I was told he was the I think the General Secretary of Popcru.    Yes.  I cannot verify that I was told that Chair.  At that stageyou know I was not really interested in the process.    Well the subject meeting was to discuss how they could swing Vernie Petersen and get to a solution where he would start communicating with Bosasa.    The one person was Sbu, it was Khulekani Sitole those were the people that attended with Watson and myself.    I cannot recall if there were other Bosasa directors at themeeting.    Correct.    Well it was agreed that they which included Mr Mxele who was the Regional Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services would be paid a million rand per month.    No, no in KZN.    That was for the team.  How they were going to distribute it I have not got a clue I was not involved in that.  It was an invoice that they would provide us.    Well it would normally come from Sitole would get somebody to email it to us and I would then receive it and pass it on to accounts.  Get Gavin Watson to approve it and put it through for payment.    I cannot recall my – I do not have my laptop anymore that is in possession of African Global but the invoices would be sent to me and I would thenprocess the invoices and it was from – on a company letter – invoice which was called Vleissentraal.    The group of companies you are correct.    It was those two that were there from the previous correctional services.    R1 million a month.   And at that stage Chair and I think I go into it later on.  There was even a dispute in terms of the VAT payment.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.    That is correct.  Chair my and once more it is my thinking from what I heard in the meeting was that they would put undue pressure on the department and on Vernie Petersen through the associations with Popcru and with the unions and the people.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Well the intention was to utilise that to get influence against Vernie Petersen and to get him to either agree to work with us or to feel the wrath of Popcru.    At that stage he was the decision maker he was the accounting officer for Correctional Services.    Well because obviously we wanted more business and new opportunities.  I mean all the opportunities had now dried up.  All the effort and the money that had been spent before it all disappeared.    Yes they were.    That is correct.    I cannot recall exactly how long they – or what period they were at but what I do recall is that at one stage there was an issue with regards to the VAT which I said was their baby and their responsibility and at one stage we lost thestaffing of the control rooms at Correctional Services.  And so we reduced the amount from R1 million to R700 000,00.    Yes.    Chair I cannot pronounce it but it is I can provide you with it later. Well it is in the record somewhere.   No we were told that they were the leaders of the pack and they would share it with the other hungry – what do you call them people.    Mr Petersen was not that type of person.  I do not know how they – they would have tried to do it.    And I did not ask.    Correct.   It was Chair it was dropped down to R700 000,00 per month and purely because there was one contract that Sondolo lost so it was taken down to R700 000,00.  And then eventually I think we had realised and I went to Mr Watson and I said look we wasting our time with these guys just stop it, we wasting money.    That was the staffing of the control rooms if I am not mistaken.    Correct.   That is correct.    Correct.    At the end of the day it was just they were not delivering anything to us.    We were just paying money out to them every month on an invoice.    No.    No.    It continued for months and then it was cancelled and he agreed to cancel it and he offered them an option, an optional alternative.    Well it seized.    The payment of the R700 000 and what happened was it continued, but because Nxele was the Commissioner of KZN and he made life verydifficult if he did not pay on time.    Just repeat your question please?    It seized.    It seized with Sithole and Sbu.    Well it continued, they continued but on a different basis.    Yes, so let us say that agreement stopped, but we realised that and there was enough pressure and at that stage I never even met Nxele.  I am just giving you as it was.  He put a lot of pressure, he would phone up Gavin Watson all hours of the day.  I remember one day strangely enough that he sent a message toGavin Watson and to all the other Directors to say abakathi I do not know what that means, but I got it as well.  Angelo, he mentioned my name abakathi something like that.  I do not know, I do not know what the word means.    I probably got the message here.  I will find it.    Sorry, these things are coming back to me, Chair.    But what happened was it was agreed that an amount of R57 500 would be given Nxele on a monthly basis for his influence.   Yes.    For in the KZN region of the Department of Correctional Services.    No, he was extremely unhappy about it.    Well it was about the same time and I accompanied Mr Johannes Gumede to a meeting with Nxele.  So whenever they did not want to pay somebody they will always take me with and I will have to explain about the auditors that are all over us and we cannot do it anymore and that type of thing.  So I went to the meeting and the meeting was held at the Intercontinental Hotel at O R Tambo in the Quills, I think it is called, restaurant.Down at the bottom in the furthest left hand side and the meeting startedvery cordial.  As a matter of fact Mr Nxele was in his full regalia, full uniform and I commented…[intervenes]    Correct, yes and I commented on how smart he looked and he was getting on a plane back to KZN so he had limited time to meet with us.  Or he was on his way to Johannesburg, I cannot remember what the – if he was leaving or coming.    But he was at the restaurant with us in uniform.  This was my very first meeting with him.  I never met him before.  Now prior to that meetingMr Gumede and myself were in the fault when Gavin Watson was briefing us on what to say to him and also packing the money for him in one of the security envelopes.  So I specifically looked at the amount and I asked what the amount was and I checked that it was packed in properly and it was R57 500 and the bag was sealed…[intervenes]    That is correct.  The bag was sealed and the bag was placed – Mr Gumede took the bag and then during lunch we actually sat with him.  He was very cordial.    At the hotel.  So I am just telling you about the packing of it, because it has got relevance and he said that he was unhappy with the amount that was paid to him and I explained to him that Bosasa at that stage was not in a position to increase the agreed upon amount and the security bag was handed over across the table from – actually it was handed to him by Mr Gumede.And then during lunch everything was fine, but after lunch he actually – sorryduring lunch everything was fine.  When it got to the end of lunch he said that he was unhappy and he would convey this dissatisfaction to Gavin Watson.  Alright, he said that the money that was in the bag was not the money that was promised to him.  So I thought and I confronted Joe Gumede that maybe he had taken out some money.It was not the case.  He did not take out anything.  Joe would not lie to me about something like that and we found out that it was actually the amount and that he was just unhappy with it.  So he phoned Joe and he left messages for Joe Gumede.    Myself, Johannes Gumede were present at that lunch.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    No, no, you are 100% right.  That is the meeting at the Quill′s lunch and then there is a second one that was held.    Yes.    Okay.    That is right.  So Nxele was still not happy and satisfied and he conveyed this dissatisfaction to Gavin Watson.  Numerous messages.  As a matter of fact it got so bad that eventually he would be passed from one handler to the next.  So first Ishmael would handle him, then Joe will try and handle him, then Joe will give up and then Trevor had to handle him.  So Trevor Mathenjwa was now given the responsibility of handling Mr Nxele.    It is two weeks later, it is three weeks later, Chair.    Okay, so, Chair, what happened was I was then told to oncemore accompany Trevor Mathenjwa who was at that stage a Director of Sondolo, Managing Director to the Beverly Hills Hotel in Umhlanga.    Oh, okay, Durban, right next to the Oyster Box.    Okay, and so we went through to the – I went through to Beverly Hills Hotel, because I had my own vehicle down there and we had a meeting with Mr Nxele and it was a long meeting, it was about two hours and at the meeting I explained to him that we were not – that Bosasa was not in the position to increase the amounts.They were not in the position to give him any more and he was not happy with it at all.  He was not happy.  He said he would deal with it in his own way and he left with the explanation, he was not happy.  He just said I am leaving, he was not happy with the explanation, he got up and stormed out and he left without taking the grey security bag.  He left that with Mr Mathenjwa.So I was sitting…[intervenes]    Yes, R57 500.    This is the second one.    So what happened was comical, because we sat in the Beverly Hills lounge, we offered to give him the bag, he said he is not taking it and he stormed out and about ten minutes later he then phoned Mr Mathenjwa up and he saidwhere is my bag, can I come back and fetch my bag?  So it was a bit comical at this stage and he then told Trevor to make arrangements for the collection thereof.    Correct.    So he got his bag at the end of the day.  I was with Trevor when he phoned him to ask where Trevor was so that Trevor could still give him back the bag.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I think this – the timing of this was probably in the region of about 2006/2007 I think, Chair.  I stand to correction.  I stand to correction.  In terms of 29.16.    Mr Gillingham was a Chief Financial Officer.   That is correct.    Gavin Watson instructed Frans Vorster that he needed to buy a new E-Class Mercedes for Gillingham from Constantia Kloof Motors and Andries van Tonder had to purchase a new Polo VW from The Glen for Megan Gillingham his daughter.    From Volkswagen, The Glen, which is in Alberton.   Look the payments had to be made from electronic transfers from personal accounts, because you cannot very well go with a bag of cash and say I want to buy a Mercedes E320 or I want to buy a new Polo.  People are not going to accept it.  It is going to raise a lot of concerns and you cannot just deposit it into their account.  So the only way to do it is to actually do an EFT and to pay for it like that.Or to do it like every other normal person and take it over on a HP contract.  So it was done via EFT from personal accounts.    I got to remember now, sorry, Chair, this is quite some time ago.    Excuse me?    Well I know it was through Frans Vorster′s personal account and Andries van Tonder′s personal account.    Yes, yes.    Well how it would be done is a bonus would be put through for the person and the payment would then be made, the tax payed them it and the cheque or the EFT would be deposited into the person′s account that had to make the payment.    Well the refund would have been done via Concilium Business Consultants.    Well there was an issue, because the Mercedes Benz had to be paid immediately.  They needed the payment and when you order a car from Mercedes Benz you basically have to take delivery of the car.  You cannot turn around and say well I prefer Mr X to take over the car.  The car was ordered by Frans and the only way to get it into Gillingham′s name would be to do it through a company or to do it – to actually order it in his name.So what happened was I received a bonus of R150 000 which I then paid over to Carlos Bonifacio who was a Bosasa employee as a loan and then I would be reimbursed via Concilium Consultants.  I received the bonus, I paid my money to Carlos and Carlos in turn paid Constantia Kloof Motors.    He was suspended together with Zach Modise.    Yes, he did.    Yes, we paid his attorney fees.    Well the SIU raided his house, Mr Gillingham′s house.  Gavin Watson phoned me and said that the SIU had raided the house, come across aBosasa laptop in the possession of Gillingham with the specification documents on it.  He instructed me to go and meet with Gillingham and I left the office and was on my way to Gillingham and to meet him at his house.    Yes, when I arrived at his house he mentioned that the SIU had also found a business card printed for him by Dr Jurgen Smit which showed that he was a consultant for Concilium Business Consultants.  I did not – I must just add I knew nothing about that.  He then informed me he was instructed by Gavin Watson to accompany Dr Jurgen Smit to a meeting with the manufacturer of items for the Department of Correctional Services and that they had to believe that he was a Director of Concilium Business Consultants.So…[intervenes]    Correct.    He was not.    He was not actually a consultant for Concilium, because I checked afterwards and he never appeared on Concilium′s payroll.    No, he was not a Director.  At the meeting he was to leadthem to believe that he was a Director of Concilium Business Consultants.    Most definitely.  I was told that the legal ramifications needed to be dealt with and we needed to sort, to get strong legal representative.    He told me…[intervenes]    He told me that I needed to arrange fictitious loan agreements between – that needed to be drafted and concluded between Gillingham and the various Bosasa employees for all the moneys.    That they had received.   That Gillingham had received and the benefits.    Yes, I did do that.    Those agreements are currently with the attorneys and with the various Gillingham himself and the people.    I mark here Annexure L which is the only thing that I had in my possession relating to that and that refers to a declaration that he made to theCommission at that stage with Mti, which was back dated so that it coincided with when Mti was the Commissioner, that basically said that he had declared some of the loans.    Okay.    Correct.    I had to prepare a declaration in terms – on behalf of Gillingham declaring that the money and the benefits he received were in fact loans to Mti and I had to back date the declaration.  Mti was then to approve the declaration and hold on, given back to Gillingham and I then took the declaration.  I got Gillingham to sign it, took the declaration to Mti where I met him at the Protea Midrand who after – he did not want to sign it, but after I had spoken to Watson over the phone handed him thephone he then agreed to sign it.  And it is reflected in Annexure L.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.    That is right.    Correct.    Well after that discussion what can I say, Mr Mti what did he do?    No, no he just left it.  I mean he just gave me the documentback.    He back dated and he signed it.    Yes.    Sorry, I thought that was in my statement, I thought you had seen it.    Okay.   No, no, after he had spoken to Gavin Watson on the phone he gave the phone back to me.  He received an instruction from Gavin Watson and he just did as he was told.  He just signed and gave it back to me and it was back dated.    That is correct.    That document is, every year I was told that I was explained – it was explained to me that they do a declaration of any gifts or anything that needs to be declared.  This is a document that we got typed up.    Patrick Gillingham got it typed up.  Well I assisted typing it, he got me the letterhead.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    That is the document.    Chair, it is also signed by Richmond Mti.    No, it was the same document, Chair.    Just above my signature, yes, Chair.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    I do.    Yes.    ″Please ensure that this does not interfere with your job or…″    ″With the Department.″    Or to the Department.    I was present.    I was present.    Mr Mti.    That is correct.    Well during late 2008 we still could not speak toVernie Petersen, so he was sort of moved to the Department of Sports and Recreation and the lady who was at Sports and Recreation as the Director General was moved and appointed as the National Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services.    That person was Xoliswa Sibeko.    I think it is pronounced Xoliswa.    That is correct.   That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, sir.    We were told that the Department of Correctional Services was going to cancel the contract and Xoliswa Sibeko was adamant that she did not want the Bosasa group involved with Correctional Services.  So I was tasked by Mr Gavin Watson to accompany Papa Leshabane to the Intercontinental Hotel again at O R Tambo Airport to meet with Mr Zach Modise.    Correct.    That was the staffing of the control rooms.    Yes.    Mr Zach Modise was at that stage in charge of Correctional Care Chair and Security at the Department of Correctional Services.  So he was pretty high up in, in the department.  He had a Chief Deputy Commissioner status.    Well I, the meeting commenced with myself and Mr Modise and I was busy explaining to him the benefits of the outsourcing and it was then that Leshabane arrived and he gave, while we were discussing the benefits of, of outsourcing he gave Mr Modise a packet, the grey security packet wrapped in a newspaper.    Well earlier that day Gavin Watson and myself had actually a grey plastic bag with cash to be handed over to Modise and the bag was given to Leshabane.  So very similar to what happened with Joe Gumede previously where he took the bag with him.  In this instance it was Papa Leshabane who took the bag with him.    Sorry, could you please clarify that question.   Well the bag was handed over in the newspaper.  So you can see whether the bag is not fully covered and wrapped.  It is not wrapped like fish and chips or something.  It is still sticks open.  So there was a newspaper and it was handed over in a newspaper.  That is what I saw.    I spoke to him afterwards and just to confirm that he had given the full amount to Modise.   That he had.    Chair I cannot remember?    I think I mention it in the statement.  I think we get to it.    Yes, you can get to it.    It was myself, Papa Leshabane and Mr Zach Modise.    Yes, but we did not have lunch.    That is correct.    This meeting specifically was in the foyer where there is a lounge area not in a restaurant.    At the hotel.  We were having lunch.    Must have.    Must have.  He was actually on his way either to Cape Town or to Durban one of the two.    Correct.    I am there.    Yes, he was.    That is correct.    That is correct.   I recall the article very well.  It was probably one of the most accurate articles.    Most definitely not like some of the smut being written today.    My apologies Chair.    Correct.    I do.    Correct.   Correct.    I think, you know, of one adds up everything together.  I have not done the exercise right now but it looks, it was an accurate article.  It was actually a very good article.    I cannot comment.  I would have to actually work it out.    In terms of the Balfour, sorry can you refer me to the paragraph and it is in my statement.    Yes.  I am just reading the article.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    That is right.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    That that is correct.  I would like us to go back to the second bullet.    The first bullet.    Mr Balfour, alright at that stage Minister Ngconde Balfour actually only received probably a glass of wine from Bosasa when he visited us.  He did not receive anything.  I want that clarified.   Please.    [Intervenes].    And there is no, I mean he maybe had a glass of wine.    Red wine.    That is correct.  It was done.    Well it was an instruction.    It is…    My apologies Chair.    What happened there Chair was that basically I was asked to do a spying exercise on them by Patrick Gillingham and at that stage he was so powerful and Richmond Mti was so powerful he just followed.  Whatever they wantedthey got.  As simple as that.    Well there was a company employed to go and take photographs and to actually mingle with them.  I cannot remember which company it was and to give a report back on them.    Correct, yes.    Correct.   I just got feedback from it.  I actually if, if you ask me if I supervised it.  Yes, I would take responsibility and I supervised it.    It went to Patrick Gillingham.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    I said that this is probably the most accurate news report, but I did not say that it did not have errors in it and the one error is that there were threeweeks after the raid.  There was not actually a raid.  It was arranged that they come and copy the server file.  So that is not correct.    Yes.    Yes, it was, but it was not a raid.    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I think Balfour was innocent in this.  I do not think he tried to extend it.  I think what happened was he walked into a meeting if I recall correctly.  He was annoyed with Vernie Petersen, because Vernie Petersen had accused him of receiving a vehicle from Bosasa and what happened was and I am sorry.  I did not comment on this, because I did not think you would ask, but basically he was annoyed with Vernie Petersen and he said I will show you who is boss.  That is apparently what happened, but I can tell you now that there was no evidence ever that Balfour had received a vehicle or anything like that and I do not think it was Balfour that pushed him out.    That point is correct.    It was later.  It was about 2007 I think, 2008 around there or I cannot recall.    That is right.    Well he sat as home and.   Sorry, just explain again to me.  I do not understand.  He was not dismissed.  He was, he was put on suspension.    And he went on suspension for about a year.    I do not know if that clarifies that Chair.    Then he resigned.    He actually resigned from the department and he was in.    That is what it was.   No.  Not that I am aware of.    Okay.    Yes.    Well as far as I know he was the Head of the Tender Committee.    Bid Adjudication and the Bid Evaluation Committees.    Yes.    Correct.   That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes, I do.    It is 100 percent correct.    That is correct.    I think I do cover that in my affidavit as well.    That is correct.    As I mentioned earlier there was a discussion between Petersen and Balfour and there was an altercation about the vehicle, the actual altercation was about the vehicle which Petersen wrongly accused Balfour of.   I am not fully aware of that, no.    That is, that is correct, because and you will recall yesterday I alluded to it in terms of the function that I was invited to by Dr Smith.  That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct, but I just want to clarify something.  I think this refers to the HK2 2004 which was a catering tender.    Okay.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    I am happy with that Chair.    Ja.    I do Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.   Which is owned by Bosasa?    Yes, it was 40 percent.  The others, shareholding was held by other companies.  I cannot recall all of them at the moment.    Other entities.    Other entities.    I cannot recall.  Sorry, Chair.  That was the early days and I cannot recall.    Correct.    In terms of?    Are you talking specifically about the, the travel invoices?  Are you talking about …[intervenes]?    Oh the contents.    This was common knowledge.  He had done his homework.  He had actually gone and looked for the, for the information.    Well he got it from inside the company.    Most definitely not.    There were, there were a couple of people inside, yes.    Yes.    Oh, yes.    I have spoken to him once or twice and that is it.  [Intervenes].    No, I would not have spoken to him in those years anyway.   Unfortunately yes.    Chair just to give you a bit of background.  The shareholding changed like kids eating sweeties.  Sometimes they like separating and having blue ones and sometimes they are yellow smarties and sometimes orange smarties.  This was a mess.  One never knew what the shareholding was.  It was how Gavin got up in the morning.  So I cannot recall.   Correct.    Correct.   That is correct.    Yes that is a fact.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    He would send me often his resource papers and all that type and …[intervenes].    Sorry?    Perhaps he was trying to keep me informed of what was happening in the industry.  I really was not that interested in it.    That is correct.    That is correct.     Exactly that.    I think I explained it in detail.   I …[intervenes].    I cannot recall that specific date, but if it is in the document it occurred.    No.    I would have responded to him if he had sent me an email and I would have responded in that manner.   I cannot, I cannot recall it.    Correct.    I recall that I would have been sent that document, because I did not have time to do it as I mentioned in my statement.  I would have been sent that document by Danny Mansell or perhaps one of the team that were working on the actual document itself.    I would have literally sped read it and I would just forward it back to the team.    Yes.    That is exactly the same gentleman.   Yes you must remember that Mansell had emailed it to me and I was the responsible party.  He would want to say he said in his email on the 25 September we said there that we would sit and we would go through it.  I then would have passed that document on to the relevant parties to look at it.    Yes.   I cannot recall that specific date.    If you have a look at – if you have a look at the sequential flow yes that happened.    Yes.    Well they un – incomplete I would say.  Because the – if you look at it we testified this morning that the cladding material was actually the fencing, the actual mesh and SA Fence and Gate was not the only person that was sub-contracted to do the fence.  There was a lot of others.    Yes.    Yes.    Corrrect.    I cannot comment Chair.    Not entirely true. The standard installation process might beexactly the same as reflected in the tender specifications of public works or any other department but the actual mesh was mentioned was different.  We had made the opening and closing mechanisms different so it was not just a normal gate opener it was an electro-magnetic slider.  So that was different and there were some other changes made as well.  So that paragraph is not entirely true.    No it would be definitely of an advantage.    No I am not aware of the truthfulness of that.    That is fact.    That is correct.    That fact is correct.    That is – I recall it.    Yes it did.    I do.    Yes he did.    I do not think I did if I recall correctly.  I cannot recall that specifically.    That is correct.    I recall it vividly it was always conspiracy theories created by certain individuals.    Chair if I can just add for completeness.  Every time there is an attack on Bosasa or anybody of – anybody there it gets blamed on racism, it gets blamed on international espionage.  It is all these conspiracy theories so that statement there is one hundred and ten percent correct.    Correct.    That is exactly the same operation.    That is correct.    Yes anybody who was negative or problematic.    Would be spied on.    The actual instigator behind the scenes?    Was Gavin Watson.    Was to try and confirm a conspiracy theory that was – I used to – may I add for completeness?  I used to have to draw up organograms that were fictitious in nature to try and show the conspiracy of the Afrikaner Broederbond from Stellenbosch and then it was not the Stellenbosch it was another crowd from wherever.  It was always conspiracy so I cannot confirm you know that they were true because I never saw them.  Does that answer your question?    Of course it was always a conspiracy to undermine and it was from the devil.   Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   Vividly.    I actually said to him that I was uncomfortable doing it because nothing actually happened.  There is no – there was no conspiracy theory there at all.  These guys were doing their job and they were at a function.    Chair we did take action against Adriaan Basson at one stage but we did – we were not successful at all.    No it was – we had taken it to the press ombudsman I think the press ombudsman was Mr Joe Thloloe.   And the funny thing was he had made a mistake he must be getting on in years and responded he sent a message to Ferial Haffajee and said how should I respond to this email. So I – and by accident he had actually sent it to my email address as well.  So that was – and then we took them to court and nothing really happened.    That is correct.   Briefly you know Chair flights, travel, accommodation and on occasion quite frequently there would also be booked by me on the Bosasa VIP account at Blakes Travel for Mti, his wife and his family and I have provided the supporting documentation and all the flights in a box to the commission.    Chair it arose when they started publishing information with regards to Blakes Travel.  What actually happened at that stage was that we had to go and fetch all the computers from Blakes Travel as well as the invoicing books because they had copies and we had to make sure that they were all destroyed.  He obliged and handed everything to us.    Instruction came from Mr Watson.    To both myself and Andries Van Tonder.    Was to go to Blakes Travel, collect the computers, collect the documents, take them to Luiperds Vlei, destroy them.    This was just after the media report that you read just earlier.    Yes.    Yes.    He did because most of his business came from Bosasa.  We spent about R1,7 to R2.2 million a month with them and we were going to replace everything.  He took it further if I may clarify for completeness and he then issued us with blank invoice books.  Because remember Chair when the invoice has been captured on the computer it refers to an invoice number so the invoice number was apaper document which had to be replicated and put in the file for the auditors to see.  But also the names were changed on the document itself.    That is correct.    I think there were about three that were being used specifically.    So we replaced them.   We would spend between R1,7 and R2.2 million per month.    With them.    No we told him, we told him.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.   I told him that we were instructed to collect all the documents and to have them destroyed.  He obliged and he gave it to us.    The documents and the computers.    That is right we drove to a hostel which we were busy developing at that stage and there was a big hole there and I – we threw them in there and asked someone go and fetch us some petrol, a gentleman by the name of RynoRhoode who was responsible for various gardening and maintenance and oversight over the – like a groundsman type person and tasked him to go get us some petrol.  He brought the petrol and we poured it over the items, lit it and burnt everything, burnt all the evidence.  We had been instructed to do it.    That is correct.    Luiperds Vlei.    It is directly opposite – parallel to the Bosasa offices in the same street.    That is correct.    Well it is a const – it was a construction site at that stage.    Correct.    Yes we used a backakter.  There was actually – sorry there was actually a hole there.  Gert Van Der Bunk was the guy who drove the TLB.    Front end loader I do not know what – all I know is it is yellow metal I have never really looked into it.   Threw everything in there, poured petrol over it.    That is correct.    It was covered up.    Literally.    That was covered up Chair.    We have gone into that already in terms of the JJ Venteraccount and basically what happened was that account would be any VIP travel would be booked under that account.  And that account then would be reconciled and given to Doctor Jurgen Smith at the end of the month who was running Concilium Business Consultants Chair and he would then reimburse me through Concilium for the actual travel.  So he would take all the travel documentation let us say maybe perhaps I booked my family or my children somewhere to go somewhere.  He would go through each and every invoice, have a look at it.  If there was personal stuff he would book it to me personally and deduct it from the amount, the total amount and give me the balance that was used for the individuals.    Correct.    Could you just explain yourself?    I think I explained it earlier that there was a certain computer that was used for Bosasa or certain computers that were used for the Bosasa account.  So it was not that they had no records.  They had records but they had just the total figure as an opening which would be an opening balance when they start the next month.    Yes.  No that was not to do with the – that is to do with the Bosasa records not with regards to Blakes records.   Blakes records to do with Bosasa’s records of travel.  Let me clarify.    Chair.    So what happened is there was a certain employee that was instructed because Great Planes would refer you to an amount.  The auditors might very well come and say can we pull that invoice please?  So what would happen is this lady was instructed by Gavin to rewrite every single travel invoice.   In Bosasa because unfortunately Blakes Travel would use a carbonised invoice book so they would write accommodation for Mti at the Paxton Hotel on this date.  This was his extras, that is their commission ten percent and that is the total.  Then that would be transferred onto a statement.  So you had to now rewrite that invoice you could not really scratch it out because there were three copies.  So Matel Wils – sorry I just want to correct that because I had slipped out the name.  This person would and – sorry I did not want to mention her name for fear of safety.    Okay they do have the name of the person.  The person would write out the invoice but instead of now putting Mti they would write there Agrizzi and they would put it in my name.    Or they would put it in someone else’s name.    Then that invoice would be attached and be given back to Blakes Travel, their copy, the other copy would be retained in their accounts folder.  Does that explain the question Chair?    That pre – no it was not preceding the destruction of evidence it was post the destruction.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.   Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    It would be a conspiracy theory from Stellenbosch.    Correct, it was.    It was you are right.    If I can just add there?    I recall, Chair, there was actually pictures of Photostatted invoices, handwritten ones that appeared with that.  So there should be more there.  I think that was the only Annexure I had at this stage, but I am sure if we ask the paper concerned they will provide it to us.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes, correct.  Thank you, Chair.    Correct.    That is correct, Chair.    The SIU wanted information, records, documentation and hard drives in terms of any dealings with the Bosasa group of companies and that is what itwas about.    Well the subpoena was…[intervenes]    To my knowledge, I know, because I was integrally involved, Chair.  The subpoena was postponed and postponed.  There were numerous arguments and excuses given and basically ended up with a meeting that took place at Brian Blake′s attorney′s office one morning with Brown Biebuyck present, myself present in Randfontein where we tried to intimate to their attorney that he must start to postpone and play for time with the SIU.His attorney was not happy, because he said you know you people are trying to and he told Brown Biebuyck he actually said to him that you are playing with fire, because you are trying to interfere with witnesses.    No, I do not think, no, I do not know at all, no.    I am not aware.    Chair, …[intervenes]    No the role that was played and you must remember, Chair, asI mentioned right in the beginning of my testimony if an instruction was given to you and you did not follow it out there was a dustbin with your name on it.    It does not matter.  The instruction would be do not use him anymore.  And who was his biggest client?  It was us.    So he would do whatever he had to do.    It was to stymie the investigation.  That was his role.  He went out there to stymie the investigation and there is a second occurrence with different people as well, Chair, so it is not just one isolated occurrence, but the fact is and this is what I try to get across right in the beginning, that even I cannot say a Judge, I do notwant to take that chance, but even the dear Pope would probably be corrupted if they had to deal with the situation.    Very.    Correct.    Chair, I would not lie.    I did not spend fortunes to get to this point.    And my time and my effort to lie to you.    I will come and tell you the truth.    And the fact of the matter is he had to stymie the appearance.    Of both Mr Brian Blake and also…[intervenes]    Which he did very successfully.  He stymied it for I think close to two years.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.   Correct.    I am well aware of that, Chair.    I would not know what the legal ramifications are.  I will just put it to the, Chair, as it happened and this is what happened and this is what I am putting to the, Chair.  In terms of the legal ramifications of that it really does not worry me in the sense that I would rather just tell you the truth.  Hopefully you can provethrough this all that the justice system in South Africa actually works.    The attorney was quite annoyed, Chair.    Mr Blake′s attorney.  So I will leave it up to the investigators as was suggested by adv Pretorius that the investigators do the investigation and theymake their own conclusion rather.    That is correct.    Every single instruction came from Gavin Watson.    It was an internal person in the company that worked in IT.   Yes, I was.    The instruction was to fake a crash, server crash and destroy files.    Any files that could implicate the company, before the investigators could gather evidence.    No.    There was a disaster log created on the server and I circulated a memo in this regard, but unfortunately I could not find the memo, so I have what is known as the disaster log reflected in Annexure N.    Yes.    Yes.    It was preserved in  - before the destruction of evidence I requested that it be preserved on two hard drives or three hard drives that I have madeavailable to the Commission and made available to the HAWKS.    Sorry, I just need to get to it.  Annexure N refers to a data log which is called the disaster data log for 8 November 2007.    That is correct.    That is correct.   Well – sorry are you asking me where do we find the extent of the data that was damaged or lost?    Yes?    Correct.    That is right.    Correct.   Chair, I cannot answer this.  I definitely probably less versed in computers than you are.    Correct.  Sorry, I cannot help there, Chair.    I was at a hotel.  I was actually entertaining guests, Americans that had been working with us on the PPP project and I received a call, it was on a Sunday, yes, it was a Sunday afternoon and I was told that the offices were going to be raided the next Monday.  I was only supposed to come back on the Tuesday, because these were Americans and they were on a game safari drive and that type of thing.  Ihad to leave them.  I was instructed to come back.I had to leave them there, arrange transport for them back and drive back to the office.    He told me that he got information from Mr Seopela that the HAWKS were going to be raiding, someone was going to be raiding the office.  I cannot remember if it was the HAWKS or the Scorpions, I do not know who it was, but we were told to meet him at the office, so I met him at the office.    It was apparently Monday, the Monday.    Correct.    He said they were looking for specific documents and specific transactions.    And I was just told to be at the office.    Yes, I did.    As a matter – I found him in his office.   Andries van Tonder was with him.    Yes, the instructions were, they gave at that stage -  I cannot even remember, but at that stage Andries was ahead of me, we were instructed to go through all the offices to have a look at anything possibly incriminating evidence, the information that Gavin received from Mr Seopela was that they were looking for the sale of shares agreement in respect of Phezulu Fencing as well as the agreement between Gavin Watson and Mti for the payment of money in return for an undertaking from him, they were not sure that Bosasa would be given preference in the awarding of tenderswith Correctional Services.    Yes, it did.    Because I saw the document and I actually made a Photostat of that document.    Unfortunately I do not have that Photostat.    Yes.    It was a three page document and it was very specific.    It is exactly.    Yes, we were instructed to look for them.    That is correct.    We found those documents.    Well in terms of – are you referring me back now to 31.3? Because you are asking me if we found them?    We removed the documents, Chair.    Yes, Chair?    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.   I do not.    Chair, they were all packed together and they were stored.    Yes, Chair.    Correct, Chair.    It was not signed, it was only signed by Gavin Watson.  Icannot recall if it was signed by Mti.  I know that it was signed by Tony Perry as a witness.    I cannot recall seeing Mti′s signature.  I would be lying if I told you that I had seen it, I cannot recall it.    It was done.    It was done.  It was recorded in writing.    I think that Mr Richmond Mti perhaps knew Gavin better than all of us and he insisted that there be a signature.    Chair, you will see later on that the agreement was actually found much later on and it was actually the – it was then shown not only to myself but to somebody else as well and then handed back to Mr Watson.    Chair, I can guarantee you that the signatures that were on the document were very noticeable signatures.  They were Gavin Watson and Tony Perry and there were other signatures.  I do not know if it was Richmond Mti′s signature, I cannot recall.  I have seen his signature on one other document and that was post the fact when we got him to sign the acknowledgement of debt and that is why I cannot comment.  I cannot say that was his signature.    His name was there, but whether it was his signature or not I cannot say.    I am sure as my colleagues start presenting you will see that he did maybe sign one or two documents that were important.    So there are the odd occasion when he would slip up and he would sign something and if you recall this started off in 2003/2004 at that stage it was very bullish in the company and I can tell you what I saw and I saw the signature.  Other people will testify as well and then yes we are welcoming, I am welcoming the cross-questioning.   Yes.    It was a major deal for the company.  I think, Chair, I can only attest to what I saw.    Chair, I know that, and you know that.  It seems to me thatthey did not know that.  It is as good as having the side agreements in terms of fronting and giving somebody shares, it is the same thing.  It is illegal you cannot do it.    Yes, we did.    No, what we happened was that we put them into storage, we just packed them into the boot of my car, because he wanted them out of there and wetook them and we stored them on a farm.    Yes.    There were newspaper reports coming out that were rehashing the whole SIU investigation.  Gavin Watson approached not me, but Andries van Tonder and myself only at a later stage to say to us we need to go and destroy the documents.  So what I am trying to say is Andries came to me and said to me that we have to go and destroy the documents.  I then phoned Gavin up and checked with him are you right and he said I want you to go and destroy documents.    He asked us to look specifically for the document he was concerned, because he had not seen the document yet that he had signed between himself and Mti.   31.6.  That was the only document that we had to hold back for him.    We want that document.    No.  As I said to you earlier I had made a copy of it.  So the copy that I made was not then, my correction.  I got a bit confused.  It was 31.7.  Then what happened there was we took the document to him and he was very relieved,visibly relieved, because he thought that would be the end of his life.  He then put it, he shredded it by hand.  He put it in a ziplock bag.  You know the sandwich bags that you get and he put lots of water with it and just kept making like a papier-mâché and then flushed it down the toilet and he was very relieved.    Correct.    Chair no, nothing happened.    No.    The only thing was that we had reached an agreement with the SIU that they could come and copy the servers, but there was no raid.   Yes.    Not at all. There were not blue lights and flashy cars like you see on TV with the, when the Scorpions used to go and arrest and raid.  There was nothing like that.    That is correct.    That is correct.    This was a three year contract.    Well in terms of the specifications, correct.    Well in terms of that period of time a meeting was arranged between the representatives of the SIU.  So we had heard all these rumours that they were investigating Bosasa and all that.  So the suggestion was made have a meeting whit them and find out.  So we had a meeting with the SIU.    Myself, Andries van Tonder, Gavin Watson was not there.  He would not attend that.  He was, he was rather be away from that.  Frans Vorster was there, Brian Biebuyck was there and if I remember correctly Advocate Lourens …[indistinct] was there and basically we had the meeting with the SIU.  There was Zuid Jacobs I think that was there, Clint Oellerman was there andthere were various other people from the SIU.  Those were the people who were there.    Sorry?    Oellerman.    It is like a school test.  O-E-L-L-E-R-M-A-N.    Yes, it was.    Yes.  That was …[intervenes].    That is correct.    So the meeting, the, the other meeting was sorry we cannot have the servers checked now, because we are busy with month end and year end.  So we tried to postpone it.  So it was a letter of postponement.    Yes.    Correct.    That communication was to say that we have heard via thepress that we are being investigated and we would like to have information regarding that so that we can tender our assistance.    Going forward.    Well a date was arranged for the investigation and for the mirroring of laptops and that type of thing.    That is correct Chair.    It was changed Chair.    Well it was changed because it was postponed on instruction, because we needed to give enough time to the IT Specialist to actually remove potentially damaging information.    Well the postponement was instructed by myself and obviously I was instructed by Gavin Watson.    Yes.    Correct.    So for redundancy purposes you would have two servers.  The one being a Bosasa main server.  The other one was linked to another server.  That is how I understand.  I am not an IT Specialist, but when something is done on the one you can actually monitor it on the other one.  So it is a mirror image.  You have to arrange with a chap by the name of William Brandon and Max Leeson and those two youngsters have actually studied with one of the nephews and they were very trusted.  So he, Gavin, personally arranged with them as he had a relationship with them to monitor what the representatives of the SIU, I think it was a Mr Jacques Malan who was to check up on what he was looking at and what he was doing and …[intervenes].    Yes.    Correct, yes.    I cannot; yes they had to delete potentially harmful information that was on the, on the server.  I think we actually mention it here. “They had to ensure that they removed information which might damage or implicate Bosasa prior to the mirror image being made.”   Yes.    Sorry?    I was sent a copy by Biebuyck.    I was actually in Paris at the time with Andries van Tonder, Gavin and we were on a holiday trip.    It was in 2009.  I cannot remember.  Well let us think, it was summer in Paris.    Yes.    Yes, I will…    I will read them out. 1. Furniture bought for Gillingham and Mti. 2. Architectural fees. 3. Certain holiday trips paid for.4. Certain cash deposits. 5. Certain vehicles purchased. 6. Certain sponsorships for children’s varsity fees and/or tuition. 7. Provision of Forex for travel allowance. 8. Certain repairs and maintenance on houses. 9. Construction of houses. . Purchasing of imported kitchens. 11. A retirement village concession for Gillingham’s father. 12. Numerous other favours such as rugby season tickets, computers, printers and even a Matric dance dress for Megan Gillingham. 13. Trading of certain vehicles where the person could not obtain a lucrative settlement.  These were bought by individuals and subsided by Bosasa.    Yes.   Correct.    I did not.    Correct.    Ja, we did.    No, his attitude was he blamed everybody else.  He marked Mark Taverner.  He blamed Danny Mansell.  He blamed Tony Perry for not taking precautionary measures.    He told me everything is under control.    He said I had to stick to him.   He told we had to stick to him otherwise the future is very bleak.    Yes.    That is correct.    I was to meet them and to take steps to delay their appearance as much as possible.    I was to attend every single meeting with them and Brian Biebuyck and make sure that Brian Biebuyck was the attorney on record for them.  They were not allowed to use anybody but whoever Brian Biebuyck agreed to if he did not do it himself and I had to make sure that Bosasa was not compromised in all of this and I had to assist that I saw their statements.  Before they were submitted I did this and eventually they appeared in compliance to the subpoenas after about, if I am not mistaken, it was about 18 months.    If I am not mistaken.  I might be mistaken.    Very long.   Correct.    Correct.    I just want to clarify.  You asked me a question.    If they complied with the subpoena Chair.  If they complied with the subpoena?    They complied in terms of appearance.    But what was put into the subpoena was not necessarily the whole truth.  So you …[intervenes].    The questions.    Okay.    Yes.  Well not me directly, but yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    In this report, you are right.    That is correct.   Most definitely.    I do think mine is a bit comprehensive though.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    I am sure it is identical.   I do.    That is one of them.    That is correct.    Yes, he did.    That is correct.    Yes.    I cannot.    And Mr Mansell, correct.    Yes.    Yes.    I think it is the same gentleman, yes.    Well I think Mr Malan’s comments are incorrect. 1. I was never ever the Chief Executive Officer.    I was an Operations Coordinator and according to Mr Malan the document was saved on my computer on 28 June 2004.  I cannot say that I actually created that document.  It says that the same day the DCS comments, it was screening of the bids received in respect of the Kitchen Tender.  So I just want to clarify because it says there …[intervenes].    Sure.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    If you read it in context it says it originated and this is where Iam having an issue.  It says it originated from a computer.  You are talking about Bosasa’s Chief Executive Officer according to Malan, the document was last saved, I am reading something totally different.  Sorry, on what paragraph are you?    Yes.    Yes.      No, I am still looking for it.    [Intervenes].    I am on page 280.    I still cannot find it.   I am sir.    Yes.    Yes.    It starts on the evidence of the whistle-blower.    Okay, yes I have got that.    Correct.    Yes, I just want to get …[intervenes].    Yes, I have found.    Chair I have found it.    I did not read it.    I think I need two days there is something …[intervenes].    There is one section that says Chair that it was, could not determine the date of the first creation and that is where I am getting confused.  So if I could just read in context.    Okay.    That is why I am getting confused, because we are hopping and it confuses me.    Sure.  I would like to ask the Chair a question to explain to me it says there determine…   I do not mind.    I understand.    Yes.    I am happy with that.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.
