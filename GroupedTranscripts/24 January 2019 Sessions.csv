CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Morning.  Yes, Mr Pretorius?    Before you do that you confirm that when you say the cash you mean the bribery cash?    Okay.    Yes.   Yes?    Would the people who you are mentioning be based at the Head Officer of Correctional Services or different offices?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    What was the name for Mkabela?    Okay.    Okay.    You do not remember which region?    Okay, alright.    Okay.    Yes.    Well let us first say you want us to look at the list appearing at page 361.    And that list at the top that list has got the date 25/02/2016, is that correct?    Yes.    Does that date reflect the date when this list was compiled or written up?    Okay, alright.  Yes, go ahead.    Is that the first name on the left column?   So you say that one is?    Was the amount R50 000?    Okay.    Yes.    So just to remind me of the evidence you gave us either last week or early this week the principle guiding the codes you decided upon was that the code for each person would consist of three features.  The one feature would be that at the beginning of the code would be the initials of the ultimate recipient and then next would be a figure that represented the amount that that person would be paid, but you did not write the whole figure for example R50 000 you will write 50 only?    And for R100 000 you will write 100?   And then after that figure would be the initials of the Director or intermediary who would take the money to the ultimate recipient?    Am I right?  Those were the features that guided how you decided on the code for each person?    Oh, it would change frequently?    Would the features change as well?   Ja.    Ja?    Ja.    Ja.    Oh, so you might not have initials?   But you put in something else that in your mind represents that person?    So whatever would come before the figure in the code or rather let me first say there would always be something that comes before the figure, is that right?    Whatever you had before the figure was what to your mind represented the ultimate recipient?   And then there would be the figure?    And then after the figure whatever you, or did you ever change the name of the person, Director, the initials of the Director?    Okay, what you change regularly was what represented the ultimate recipient before the figure?    Okay.  So when we look we must not necessarily look for somebody′s initials?    Because it might not be – it might be something else?    Yes?   Not always.    Okay, alright, no thank you very much.  You may proceed then.    So you said the IMN represented?    That is one of the Directors?    Yes, okay.    Yes.    And the amount appearing in regard to Mr Ngubpo you say reflects an amount thereto was paid later, not the amount that was paid initially?    And that after MMM you have got 50, does that represent R50 000?    Okay, you may proceed.    Yes?    I am sorry, can we confirm that on that column on the left hand side of page 361 at the top where the MMM appears the person to take cash to the people the intermediary is the same person except what the last two?    Yes, but the rest are the same person?    Yes, that is Ishmael, you mentioned him just now.    Yes, okay, alright.  Okay then you may proceed.    You still cannot remember his name?    Okay continue.    Does that…[intervenes]    It does not appear?    Oh, but I think Mr Pretorius wants you to, I do not know if he wants you to go through the whole list or only those in – to identify those in paragraph 34.    Yes?    In paragraph – at page 361 we have at the top that column which has got MMM?    Then there is a space before we get to another column?    Which seems to start with I do not know whether it is JSC and that isthe second column and then there is a space and then there is a column of two names then there is a space and then there is another column.  Which column – which of the four columns must we look at?    Ja.    Ja.    I am sorry, okay I see there are numbers that are circled.  I see nine?    Is that the one that we must look at for the next person?    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    He was paying journalists as well?    To do what?    Including writing good stories about Bosasa?    Okay.    Okay.    When you say the letters before a figure represent the initials of the ultimate recipient it makes sense.  When you say I would change the initials and put in something else just so that the information does not get out that still makes sense.  Now Leshabane is not the ultimate recipient he is I call intermediary, because he takes the money from you and he goes and pays.   Now CCV how did you decide on CCV?    So it was just an arbitrary?    Oh, okay.   Ja.    Okay.    So it was just an arbitrary…[intervenes]    In regard to CCV.    Did you write somewhere to make sure that you did not forget the code, you have somewhere else to go and check in case you forgot it?  There are many people to be paid?    Yes.    Yes.    So, but would it serve to help you remember in case you forgot?    What a particular code represented, who it represented or what it represented?  That is where you would go in case you forgot?    No, no, no, I think the amounts would be easy, because for a long time it would be the same amounts, is it not?    There may be some change, but for a long time it would be the same amounts and where you used initials and you used them for quite a long time you would remember, but I was just thinking that you did not want the risk that you might forget and have nowhere else to check, but you say your black book would have helped you?   Okay.    Okay, okay.    Yes, yes.   No, thank you, you may proceed.    At 361?    You are talking about the signature now?    Of the whole page?    And would…[intervenes]    Yes?    Yes.    The codes are written in your handwriting, is that right?   All the codes on this page?    And where there is a signature on the bottom right hand corner?    Is that your signature?    Yes, and then just above that signature there is written CCV1686CT whose writing is that?    Hmm?    Same person who signed as well?    Who signed?    Oh, that signature is the signature of the Commissioner of Oath, okay.  I am sorry.    Okay, alright.    Okay, okay.    Thank you.    Now I understand, ja.    Mr Pretorius.        No, but let, let me understand what the position is with him.  Are you saying that his name or he is not, there is no code in this, in this list that represents him?    On any of the pages where you have got those, is it four lists.  Are you saying that he is not represented or are you saying he is represented?    Oh.    Okay, okay.  I remember.    So you said a certain amount would be given to Leshabane.   And among other people he would, he would give part of that money to Zach Modise.    On that specific list, ja.    Okay, alright.    Have you dealt with Josiah Maako?    I, I do not remember that I.    Is it on page, still on page 361?    Okay.    Ja.    Yes, the last name on the top column on the left on page 361?    Okay.    Yes.    Oh so, so a code representing her appears here, but she did not getany amount.    [Intervenes], because she was no longer in the department?    Okay.  So the 15 represents what?    Oh, which she would have got if she was still in the department?    Okay.    I am sorry, I am sorry.  I am getting lost here.  Did you say that was Dikeledi Tshabalala?    Okay.    Okay.    So before that would her, would you have put her code on this list at page 361 on this occasion on the basis that she was one of those who was receiving monthly payments?    That is the reason why you put her code here?    And then you discovered she was no longer in the department?    Ja, okay.    Ja.    No what, what I was suggesting is that when you put the list as I understand the position before you gave it to whoever.    You would have put her name because you did not know or you had not been told that she was no longer in the department.    And then you discovered after     Ja, no we talking; we are talking at cross purposes.    I am talking about the list at 361.    I am saying to you, you put her code her.    As I understand what you were doing you were putting a list of people who should be paid.    And you were doing so on 25 February 2016.  Is that right?    And you would only have put her code if you thought she was still entitled to be paid?    But …[intervenes].   But you discovered that she was no longer there.    And then she was not paid?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    Okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Is that perhaps Josiah Maako?  Is that right?    I thought the one we were dealing with just now was Dikeledi Tshabalala.    Yes, but what I am saying is; okay, let me ask the witness.  The person we were dealing with.    That you said you found out had left Correctional Services.    Was it Dikeledi Tshabalala?    Is that, is that the person who is represented by the code JM – 15?    At 36.1?    That is not the person.    Oh, okay.  I misunderstood, okay.    Okay.  I misunderstood.    Okay.    Oh, okay.   Ja.    Ja, ja.  Okay, thank you.    Well he did explain it.   Yesterday.  Unless you just want to refresh my memory.  He did explain it yesterday.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, you may do that.    You can do that.    Mr Pretorius will ask you more if he wants further clarification.    Hm.  Earlier on you said the, or I understood you to say that the codewould be known to you and Mr Gavin Watson.  Is that right or not really?    It would be known to you and is it Jacques van Zyl?    The code would be known to you only?    [Intervenes].    Yes.   Yes, okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    Hm.    Mr Pretorius.    Mr Pretorius I wonder whether it would not be convenient with regardto these lists for us to write numbers one, two, three, four up to whatever so that when he refers to any particular code he can say the code at number two, number six or whatever.  Then, then it would be easier to find, because although some are legible.  Others are not so legible.  I have not, I have not identified the one the IMC that he is talking about.  Would that not help or would that confuse things.    Is …[intervenes].    Is IMC, you know at the top, you know the page 363 has got the, there are four columns, two columns at the top, two in the middle and maybe there is one at the bottom.  The IMC is it the one on the right hand column at the top, at the beginning?    Where there is the figure 50 between IMC and MNG it appears and then 100?    Okay.  That is the IMC?    Okay.    Hm.    You know what we, what we could to facilitate this is that maybe the witness could in his own time later prepare a piece of paper that can be insertedimmediately after a list which would have the codes as they appear in the list and the actual names.  So that if later on one wants to see who is, who a particular code represented.  There is something that can help.  Like you see at 363 you have a certain list.  So if there could be a page maybe marked 363A that explains the codes on 363.  That that could help.    That would be easy to do.  Mr Pretorius.    Ja.    Okay, alright.    He had covered 34.6.  The resignation of Gillingham.  I think he had, but I do not whether I am just remembering that from reading his.    Affidavit ahead of him testifying.    Ja.    Ja, okay.   In respect of Correctional Services Officials?    Mostly, okay.    Alright.    What brought about his resignation or what had happened?  Had he been discovered or what?    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.    And by the time you left Bosasa he was still being paid that amount?   Hm.    Was there idea if you know what the position is, was the idea that he would continue to be paid by Bosasa like this after having resigned from Correctional Services what, for like or for what?    Oh, they will be paid as long as the Catering Contract was still in place?    If it came to an end then the payments would stop as well?    Ja, ja.    Yes.  Okay, alright thank you.    Was your …[intervenes]?    Was your understanding that this meeting marked the commencement of discussions about involving Mr Mti about how the SIU investigation should be handled or was the position that those, this was just a follow up discussion. There had been discussions before?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Okay, thank you.    So those three names that you have mentioned were they the names or were they some of the names that he said Bosasa must be ready to pay them?    Huh-uh.    Oh, the actual amounts were not mentioned at the meeting you are telling us about?    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Okay.   So the – so the outcome of the meeting you are telling us about which you, Mr Gavin Watson and Mr Mti attended was that certain officials at the NPA should be paid money so that they could do certain things for Bosasa to assist them with investigation, the SIU investigation and possible criminal charges?    Oh it was?   Oh it was lots of     Anything connected with those law enforcement agencies?    Were there other people other than these three that you were told about at this meeting that needed to be paid money by Bosasa?  At that meeting not after?    Okay alright thank you.    Before that I see that in paragraph 35.1 of your affidavit the words “sort out” are in quotes.     That could mean they are your words but you put them in quotes for certain reasons but they could mean that Mr Mti used those words and that is why you are quoting them which is which?    Oh they were used by Mr Gavin Watson?    Oh not by Mr Mti?    Ja okay alright thank you.    I am sorry did you say he said she was poison?    Oh okay.    That is Jackie Lepinka?    Okay.    You are just telling what he said.    Yes.    Yes okay.      Okay.    Oh that is how he put it?    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes well.    Did you ever get to know why J as I understand in Ms Lepinka, Jackie Lepinka who as I understand your evidence and or what you were told by Mr Mti was secretary or PA to Ms Nomgcobo Jiba was getting more than Mr Mrwebi?    I see she was getting R20 000,00 and Ms Mrwebi was getting R10 000,00.    Okay.      Okay.  Thank you.    That is December 2016?    Did the three get – start to be paid only after the meeting that you have told us about?  Prior to that had they not – were they not being paid?    Yes and are you able to place the meeting in terms of time?  Was it 09, 2010?  Asking was it there about?    You cannot say when?  Okay no I just see in your paragraph 35.1 of   Ja.    Ja okay thank you.    So going back to the question Mr Pretorius asked you just before thisone that you have answered.  The position would be that you yourself do not have personal knowledge whether or not the three namely Mr Nomgcobo Jiba, Ms Jackie Lepinka and Mr Mrwebi whether they actually received any amounts from – from Bosasa but you – what you know is that amounts were delivery to Mr Mti and that Mr – the purpose for the delivery of those amounts was that they would be passed onto the three?    And that Mr Mti told you that they were being passed on?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Oh is that so.  Yes.    Yes okay alright.  We will take the tea adjournment.    I was told yesterday that there were temporary bathrooms provided.  Are those no longer available?   Well there seems to be an indication that they available so if that is the case is there a need for a thirty minutes break or should we keep to fifteen minutes?    Well I do not want to…    Should be adequate.    Okay.    Okay so maybe twenty?    Twenty-five minutes?    Okay alright.      Well let us say how is twenty minutes?    No, no.  Okay. If I – if we say twenty to twelve it will give you twenty-five minutes.  Is – ja it will give you twenty-five minutes.    Twenty-five we will resume at twenty-five to twelve.  We adjourn. MEETING ADJOURNSMEETING RESUMES    Yes, Mr Pretorius?    Ja, no that is fine.  Maybe we need a short adjournment for the technicians to sort this out.  Is there a technicians who knows how long it will take?  Yes, I think maybe find out from him?    Oh, okay, well whatever may be done to make sure that it does not come back, please do that.    Thank you.    He was given instructions by Mr Gavin Watson was that part of what the instruction was captured, do we know?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    And the one for Mr Nomgcobo Jiba he said he marked it what?    Okay.    So how many bags were inside the bigger sack that you spoke about?    Okay, okay.   Middledrift?    Oh.  So he was the Acting National Commissioner?    Oh it was a she?    Okay, alright.    And was Jolingana the surname or the name?    Okay, alright.    So that strictly speaking would have been an expansion of the scopeof the contract?    As opposed to an extension of the duration?    No, that is fine.    And this is now after Mti had left Correctional Services?    Yes, when he was still at Correctional Services he was getting more than R65 000 or not really?   Oh, okay.    Okay, thank you.    But as I understood you it was more than obtaining information from the NPA.  It included them I think you said assisting Bosasa and I would imagine taking whatever decisions where necessary to assist Bosasa with regard to the investigation?    Well…[intervenes]    Yes, how did those documents get to you?    Okay, okay.    Alright, so in other words if one goes to each one of those document?    What you are saying is each one, any of those documents they got to you either, because they were given to you by Gavin Watson himself?    Or by Mr Mti?  At this stage you are not saying which ones, because we are not looking at the documents, but maybe when we look at the documents you might still not be able which one you got from Mr Watson, which one you got from Mr Mti, but those are the two people from whom you got the documents?    Yes.    I guess, but we go back to the point that is the conclusion you reach, because of all the circumstances and that is what Mr Mti told you?    Ja, okay.    Yes.   Ja.    Ja, no, I have already looked at them and I just wanted to make sure that we understand what his evidence is.    That he personally never witnessed the handing over of the documents to Mr Mti by whoever.  He just knows that Mr Mti said he got them from the people concerned and he may have other reasons to believe that what Mr Mti told him is correct.   Ja.    Did you take them with you when you left the company?    Yes.    Oh, you had access to where they were?    That you had access to?   Okay.  Thank you.    Yes, okay, thank you.    Before you proceed Mr Pretorius, the administration side of the Commission should just talk to the owners of the building to see how the issue of bathrooms can be sorted out.  I understand that there were still problems, even now.  So that we do not have to adjourn for long periods during tea.  Okay, thank you, you may proceed.    Yes, that is what I was told, yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    They are open?    And they are working?    They are not working, but they are open.  Okay, no I just want to make sure this – we do not continue to have these problems where measures can be taken to make sure the proceedings are not delayed unduly.    Okay, thank you, you may proceed.    Yes.   Hm.    Thank you.    EXHIBIT S2, yes.    Is it too cold?    Too hot?    [Indistinct].    Okay.    Somebody in the, I think in the legal team should just make sure that the administration takes care of that.    Ja.  Okay.  No that is fine.  I think there is, if there is somebody whohas gone there.  It is fine.  Thank you.    So, I am sorry.  So you, you, you wanted the air con to make it colder?    It is hot here.    You say it is hot that side?    Oh.    [Laughing].  Well maybe a member of the legal team could just talk to, I do not know whether it is the technical people or somebody to say the problem seems to be around that area.    Hm.    No that is tine.  Somebody will take care of it.    Ja.  Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Thank you.    What page did you say Mr Pretorius?    On.    EXHIBIT S2 and that is annexure Q?    Q7 and that is at page?    Okay.  Mr Agrizzi you will indicate after some time if there has been no change.   Yes.  Okay, alright.  I have got it Mr Pretorius.    And to the extent that some of them are letters written from one person to another.  They are on what appears to be the letterheads of the NPA.  Is that right?   Thank you.    Did you receive it marked “Secret”?    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.  No, no that is fine.  What I wanted to establish is that when he received it, it was marked “Secret”.    As to who had marked it “Secret” is something else.    Mr Pretorius I do not know if I missed it.  Whether you asked about Ms S Sishuba referred, referred to in 4.4 as well as Mr …[intervenes] 4.2.  Any connection with the names that he dealt with of people who were being paid?   Maybe …[intervenes].    Ja.    Oh yes.  I mentioned Ngubpo and.    And Sishuba.  I mentioned four.    But Mr Pretorius is going to take you through those …[intervenes].    If you, if you pick up any other ones then you must mention it.    Yes.  No, he is taking you through them.    Thank you.    Were there people in the Bid Adjudication Committee which were,who were not on the payroll of Bosasa?    You do not know the whole committee?    You do not know?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    Or maybe before he does that Mr Pretorius well actually looking at the document itself there is or at 4.3 that is at page 407 there is Mr H T Mapasa who was in Bid Adjudication Committee about whom you have said nothing in regard to being on Bosasa’s payroll.    So …[intervenes]..    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Ja.    Ja.    All the ones who you have not mentioned as far as you know were not on …[intervenes].    Bosasa’s payroll, ja.    Okay.  Thank you.    Okay.    Yes.    She was one of those receiving monthly payments.    From Bosasa?   Okay.    Thank you.    Well Mr Pretorius he had asked you whether he should say more and you said yes.  I do not know whether you have gotten anymore?    Okay.    Okay that is fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Well maybe you should from what you have said it seems to me that you know the process that lead to this document.   And maybe you should tell me from where the first step was so and so said the following and so and so on and then the next step this is what was done, the next step and ultimately we got this document.  If you can just tell me in that sequence?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes okay thank you.    Thank you.  Well I said thank you but I am not – I am not entirely sure that I understand better.  So you and Mr Watson would receive some documents from Mr Mti emanating from the NPA?    Mr Watson would then say what next?   Ja and then you would go to Bosasa’s attorney.    And he would look at the documents and he would give his advice?    That is right.  And you say that you would – you would be wanting to see how best to effectively shut down this investigation and prosecution – possible prosecution?    And you say as far as you know Advocate De Kock was never involved in any wrong doing relating to Bosasa?    Ja.  But you say there was somebody and I do not know whether that somebody was within the NPA that you mentioned earlier who would have been spoken to and you think that person may in turn have spoken to somebody else at the NPA andI do not know whether that would have been Advocate De Kock.  I just want to understand that part?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh it does not relate to Bosasa?    Yes okay.    Okay.  No now I understand.    Now I understand ja.    In and out?    Ja.    And it was not written with Bosasa in mind?   Ja but once you – Bosasa got it it could make use of it for its own benefit?    Okay thank you.    Yes, okay, alright thank you.    Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment and resume at two.  We adjourn.    Yes, Mr Pretorius?    I am sorry is that 449?    445?  Okay, thank you.    Thank you.    Go away?    Oh, to just make sure that there were delays in them appearing in court?    Ja.  Okay.    210 is it 139 or 471?    471.    Okay.    I am sorry which page do you say we should go to?   Okay, thank you.    Okay.    And we have been told that by Mr Agrizzi that Ms Jackie Lapinka worked with or in the office of Ms Jiba.    Okay, thank you, but you wanted to say something?    So this document you say you received when at a time when you and Mr Watson were in Mr Mti′s house, is that right?    You received it from Mr Mti?    Okay and what you have added in terms of what you were told namely that the NPA could not just shut down the Bosasa case it had to shut down other cases as well that is what Mr Mti told you at the time?    Thank you.    So Mr Pretorius it looks like the top part of page 511 is the ending of the previous document and the next document starts after Ms de Kock’s name.  That is the document “Provisional Draft Authorisation”.  I got the impression when you started on page 511 that you thought that heading “Proposed Racketeering Memorandum” was for the new document, but I think that comes from the previous pages in regard to the previous document.    Yes.    Ja, the heading is the same for all, for all of, for a number of documents.    Oh okay, okay.   Okay, thank you.    555?    Huh-uh.   Ja.    Ja, okay.    Ja.    Okay.    Are we at 557?   Are we at 557?    Ja, okay alright.  Thank you.    I think Mr Pretorius is asking about the notes that says received from.    It is a note made …[intervenes].    It is a note made after you had received the document?    Thank you.    That is the document at five, page 557?    Yes.    It is …[intervenes].    It is a handwritten document?    Just repeat that.    And who was having a meeting?    The two of you?    Okay.  You cannot remember when?    Remember, ja.    Yes.    Okay, ja.  Continue, tell us …[intervenes].    How it came about.    That is Ms Jiba and Ms …[intervenes].    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  You just used the …[intervenes].   Code names.    Yes, okay.    Ja.    Ja.   Material to challenge?    Yes.    By Mr Mti?    Yes.    [Intervenes].    Okay.  You know maybe, maybe it would, it would have been better if you first read what is written here.  Then you can …[intervenes].   Explain if you are able to each one what is related to …[intervenes].    Those items.    Ja.    There is the legality of the SIU Report.  You have dealt with that.  I think that.    One could understand.  The second one is evidence as is contained in the report and how it may, it was obtained or it may obtained.  You said you were told by Mr Mti that there was a reference to fruit of the poisoned tree.    And then there is legality.  You want to …[intervenes].    Huh-uh, Mr Pretorius.    Ja, okay.    No that is find.  Before you proceed you did say earlier on that this term fruit of a poisoned tree if I understood correctly was something you did not know.  Is that right?    Oh you knew, hm?    Oh you, by this time you knew the term?   Oh, through these discussions?    Oh, okay alright.  Okay.  Then the legality item then you can take the items one by one.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    And who, whose handwriting is this on this page?    Richard Mti?   Did he write in your presence or when you arrived he had already written the notes?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.   Ja.  Okay.    So he said he, he came with his suggestions from a meeting he had had that is Mr Mti with Ms Jiba and Ms Lepinka.  Is that what he told you?    Okay.    That is Mr Mti?   Ja.    A letter being drafted by Bosasa …[intervenes].    Attorneys and he wanted you, he wanted to tell you that there is a letter that should be written by your attorneys that is Bosasa and it should be written urgently?    Oh, oh.  That is now, now when you went to him on that occasion when Mr Watson was away in Port Elizabeth I think you said.    Ja.  Is this the occasion or you are now telling us about anotheroccasion?    Oh, it is another occasion.    Okay, okay, okay.  No, thank you.    Do you, do you know, did you know whether Mr Mti was legally qualified?    Oh.    Oh that that, that.    Yes.  Okay.  No that is fine.    I am.    I am sorry.  I am still trying to.    See whether we are done with the other one.  You took a letter drafted by Bosasa’s attorneys to Mr Mti?    For what purpose?    Oh so, so that he could read it and see whether it accorded with the notes that he had given you.    Or the tips?    Ja.    Oh.  Oh, so he was going to take it back to the people at the NPA who had given him the suggestion of what should happen?    And they would need to satisfy themselves if it reflected what they had told him?   And then bring it back to him and then he would bring it back to Bosasa?    And then it would go back to the attorneys to then send it off?    Okay, alright.  Now I understand.    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.    This is the note at 559 that we are talking about   Ja.    Ja, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    Hm.    Ja, okay.    Can you just read them?    What is that SNS or it looks like SNS to draft?    Oh, okay.    Okay, okay.  You had, ja.  Basically Bosasa were to draft, was to draft representations to the NPA that is to Jiba.    Yes.   And the, oh the SIU Report, ja okay.    Ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Thank you.    Do, do you know where they used to meet?  Did he ever tell you?    You are talk about recently.  You mean recently then not recentlynow?    Ja, okay.    So the payments, monthly payments continued?    Hm, thank you.    Who was he referring to when he said he was going to tell the President?    Oh.  Was what?    I am sorry.  Did he – did he used to have frequent interaction with the President as far as you know with the then President?    Okay.   And where was it taking place at Mr Mti’s house?    Okay and the people present were yourself, Mr Watson and Mr Mti?    Okay.  Was the occasion one of those regular meeting that you said – I do not know if you said monthly meetings that you?    Oh okay.    Exhibit S3 is the recording?    Is the recording okay.  And the transcript is?    Okay.      I have got it.      Oh well I have got here.    Oh then it is one that I do not think I have.    Oh okay.    Okay.    I have got the transcripts.    Ja.      Thank you. [listening to audio].      Ja well.    Ja but also I must just say and it maybe it is just me I could not hearmost of what was being said.    I think – I think when – I think when I heard a voice that seems to be – seems to have been Mr Agrizzi’s voice maybe it was not.  There seems to have been his that I could hear the words more clearer.  There was a voice that I could hear clearer compared to others but the other two I could not hear most of the time.  Probably maybe if I – if one were to listen to it not in a big hall like this maybe one could hear.  Ja.    Yes.  Ja I saw the transcript there are lots of…    Ja.    Yes okay.    Ja well maybe the witness can give us the gist of what was being said insofar as it is relevant to.    Was one of the voices yours?    Ja thank you.    Other than Mti this time?    Yes.    Oh now – now you have just mentioned that he says.    Now the – it says they implicate but you say that is wrong.  He said they do not want to implicate Willie because Breytenbach and Willie and still talk as well Mr President.  Now this reference to Mr President in the transcript here – he says that as if he is speaking the President because he was role playing?    He was showing – he was acting like he was talking to the President already?    Okay, alright.    Okay.    Oh so that they is actually I do not want to implicate, it is not they?    Okay thank you.    So we should correct where the transcript says Tramaza we should change that to Ntlemeza?    Or in terms of your own recollection of what was said at the meeting.   What is the name you remember?    Okay alright.    Well Chauke being C-h-a-u-k-e?    Ja C-h-a-u-k-e.    Okay.    What did this you do not have much time left, what was that about?    You said this was 2013?    Okay.    Okay.    Oh, okay.    You do not think you might be too helpful?    Okay.    Yes.   Well I am not sure he seems to be – you seem to be uncomfortable dealing with it.    Yes.    Yes, let us maybe just allow him to do that.    Ja.    Okay, alright.    Well I must just say, hang on, hang on.  I must just say I do not know what the technicians may have done but it seems much more clearer now to me at least.  So I can hear much more clearer.    So thank you.  You may proceed. [Listening to audio]    Yes, I can hear.  Everybody at the back can hear the witness?  Okay, alright, thank you.  You may proceed. [Listening to audio]    Yes.    Okay.    Ja, ja continue. [Listening to audio]    I think I could hear, I could hear, yes, continue. [Listening to audio]    Just hold it there.  So Mr Agrizzi the person asking the question whether Ms Jiba has got a letter of appointment that she will be acting again is that Mr Watson asking?    But he is pretending that he is asking the President on thisconversation that he was going to have with the President?    Oh, okay, okay, thank you.  You may proceed. [Listening to audio]    Okay, thank you.    Hang on I want to hear more about that.  You were asking Mr Watsonto explain to Mr Mti what he had done, who was the he?  Mr Watson, moving people around?    Okay. Is that the Bosasa people?    Yes, but he was not in government, how could he move them around?  Say he had the power to get them moved?    Well I want you to explain exactly what is in your mind.  I do not wantto…[intervenes]    I do not want to…[intervenes]    I do not want to – I want you to tell me exactly what you heard, what you knew about this moving of people?    Yes, remember that you have not told me about that.  I am hearing about that for the first time.    But I do not know that.  So you have got to tell me.  You talk about him moving people around.    So…[intervenes]    Okay, but that is what he told you?    Ja.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Obviously those would be people that he thought who were not cooperating or were problematic for Bosasa?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    The only thing I – Mr Pretorius my recollection was  that or I may be confusing different pages what is at 36.1 and following related to I thought it related to a change in the method of making payments, because – was it Gillingham had expressed concern about how the NPA people were being paid but I think that part seems to be at page 73.  I may be misunderstanding.  You might have a better recollection and whether it is necessary, whether we have covered this or not.    Yes that is fine.    Okay, alright.    So you called Mr Watson in accordance with Mr Mansell′s request?    He will tell you if he wants you to stop or not go where you are going in the meantime just tell what happened.    That is in EXHIBIT S2?    I am sorry, just complete the picture.  Page 569 what do we find there?    Yes?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, so it was a false representation that he was doing work for Bosasa?    Yes, but that was basically part of a scheme in terms of which he was going to be paid?    Okay.    Is it time?    Okay no.  But now you remember we are not sitting tomorrow.    And the witness is aware?    Yes.  Well on the pace we have been going and I am not criticising you, because I think his evidence is very important and it is important that it be dealt with properly, but just on the pace we have been going I thought we might take another two days at least, but you might have a better picture.    But it is okay, it is important.    It is important to make sure that the issues are dealt with properly.    Yes, okay, no that is fine.  Understand Mr Agrizzi you know about the fact that we are not sitting tomorrow and that you will be back on Monday?    Okay thank you very much.  We are not going to have a hearing tomorrow, because I am not available.  One of my duties as Deputy Chief Justice is to sit in a committee called the Judicial Conduct Committee.  That Committee is sitting tomorrow.  It considers complaints against Judges.  So I am sitting in that Committee 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Morning, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Agrizzi shortly before the adjournment yesterday afternoon you were dealing with evidence concerning payments to the Department of Correctional Services officials.  We have not named those listed by you in paragraph 34.3, but may I take you to Annexure P1 to Annexure P4, just give me those Annexures P1 to P4.  P1 is at page 359 of Bundle S1, do you see it?   Would you identify this document please?    What can be collected?    The cash.  Who compiled this document?    And when did you compile it?    And are you able to identify any names on this list?    Please go ahead then and in relation with the list in paragraph 34.3 tell the, Chair, whose names are encoded as you have given evidence on this list?    Let us go back to your lists please.    At page 359 to page 365 appear four lists marked P1 to P4 respectively.    Do any of the names you have just mentioned appear here although encoded by you?    Yes, we are there.    Well before we get to Jacques van Zyl let us, please examine the issue of whether the names you have mentioned appear on any of these lists.    Whether in code or not.    Please.    Well his initials were not MMM.    MMN?    Triple M that is Mollet Ngubpo?    Okay, continue.   Alright.    Before you go on to name other names you say that MMM on page 361 represents Mollet Ngubpo?    Next to his name and the code is the figure 50?    The figure in paragraph 34.3.7 is R15 000?    There is an apparent discrepancy can you explain it?    And if you say by here you mean paragraph 34.3?   And…[intervenes]    Are there any other names that you have listed in paragraph 34.3 that appear on any of these four lists to which we have referred?   Yes, continue please?    May I ask you a big favour please?   Mr Agrizzi, when you refer to an entry on a document either in the text of your affidavit or in an Annexure just please place on record the page number so that – or the paragraph number so that the record someone reading the record will find it easy to follow.  Thank you.    So we have dealt with Mollet Ngubpo and Maria Mabena.  Are there any other names on the list on page 71 of your affidavit?    On any of the Annexures?   Right we have done three names, are there anymore?    The SSS that appears on page 361?    In the column in the top left hand corner?    Yes, go on please?    You are comparing the lists with the list of names and paragraph 34.3 of your affidavit.    So perhaps would you just tell the, Chair, please if the remaining three names in paragraph 34.3 appear on any of these lists encode?    Yes, I see you have…[intervenes]    Those are the numbers that have been encircled?    Alright you were telling us about the next name.  Where is that to be found?    What did CCV stand for?    Sorry, if I may just interrupt, Chair?    To correct, before it slipped my mind.    The, Chair, asked you is it someone else′s handwriting on the whole of page 361 you said yes?    Perhaps you should just establish clearly Mr Agrizzi on page 361.    Any entry in a handwriting other than yours …[intervenes].    Apart from the Commission of Oaths initials.   So that is the only handwriting other than yours that was made at the time this list was compiled?    Okay.  Let us get back to paragraph 34 please.  There are two names you have not mentioned as appearing in code on the lists.  Can you help the Chair there please?    No, you have told us about Zach Modise.    [Intervenes].    We have not dealt with two people on this list.    In relation, two people on the list in 34.3    In relation to the lists.    Those are Mr Josiah Maako and Ms Dikeledi Tshabalala.  Do their initials or codes or names or references appear on any of these lists?    Would there be a prior list with her name on?    You have not got that list in these annexures?    Right.  Now you are still on page 361 and you were tell in the Chair about …[intervenes].    Another entry.   Well if you go back to her initials or code on page 361 you will see the letters JM at the bottom of column one and dash 15, but there is no third code as would exist.  Can you explain why that is?    The final name in paragraph 34.3.5 does that appear in code or otherwise on any of the lists?    No.  We have dealt with Josiah Maako Chair.  Dikeledi Tshabalala.    Yes, we have finished dealing with him Chair.  He us; that is JM – 15.  That is the person who had left.   The purpose of my questioning just to assist Mr Agrizzi is just to ask whether the names listed in paragraph 34.3 appear in code or otherwise on your lists.  You have given an explanation now in respect of all of them.  The final two persons we have dealt with Josiah Maako.  You say is indeed listed in code on page 361.  Correct?    And the final person who we dealt with on this list Ms Dikeledi Tshabalala I understand is not on these lists and your explanation is that bythe time these lists were being compiled she had left the Department of Correctional Services?    If we could go then to paragraph 34.4.5 and that is where we left off yesterday.  I am not sure that you may not be repeating yourself, but in relation to the process followed and the system implemented take the Chair through what you say in paragraph 34.4.5 and following regarding that system.    Yes.    Just to place this current evidence.    In its context so that it is understood.    I would like it Chair just to go from paragraph 34.4.4 and five, just to explain to the Chair the process in the paragraphs 34.4.5 and 34.4.6.    No, we have dealt with the beginning.    In other words how you receive the instructions and what you would do after receiving the instructions.  You have made that clear.  You then said in evidence yesterday you compiled a list of who needed to be paid and what amounts and you got Gavin Watson’s final approval for those payments.    Now you have told the Chair about those lists and all I want to do very briefly is say what happened after that?    Thank you Chair.    We have dealt with the lists Mr Agrizzi at pages 359 and 361.  There are two further lists at pages 363 and 365 of EXHIBIT S1.  Is there anything in those lists that is relevant to the evidence you have just given?    Just take a look at them please.   363 and 365.    Well.    No, insofar as they coincide with the lists that you have referred to in 34.3.1.    You say …[intervenes].   Second column.    IMC.    Yes.    Who is IMC?    And that is a bulk amount?    Well in, on page 363 there are two columns and IMC appears at the top of the second column.  Is that correct?    IMC you say is who?    Right.  So I would Chair.    But I     Chair if I may just wrap this up for the purposes of theevidence legal team would like to lead in any event.  I do not want to interrupt you unduly.    But all I want to know from our part is whether the names in paragraph 34.3 appear in addition on pages 363 and 365 and you can answer a yes or no.    I will leave the rest to you Chair.    We will decode the lists.    Thank you Chair.    Then in paragraph 35 you continue to speak of the delivery system in regard to payments to Department of Correctional Services.  Explain the process that you refer to in paragraph 34.5 or the part of the process you refer to in paragraph 34.5   Well.    Did you mention the name of Mr Seopela now?    Alright, will you please deal with 34.5.    Not 34.6.    Ja …[intervenes].    At what time was this?    I am sorry I interrupted you.    So the system in 34.5 is another system other than that in 34.4?    Then 34.6 would you deal with that please?    Right.  Let us move on then please to paragraph 35.  You say here that during approximately 2009/2010 you accompanied Gavin Watson to a meeting with Mr Mti.  Where did this meeting take place?    What was discussed?  Who attended this meeting?    What was discussed?    Is this the SIU investigation?    Yes.    Please do.    At that particular meeting to which you are now referring in paragraph 35.1 did Mr Mti mention any names?    What were those names?    Right, continue please with your evidence at paragraph 35.2.    Thank you.  Let us just summarise then what you have said in paragraph 35.1.  You went with Gavin Watson to a meeting with Mti at his house?    A discussion ensued at that meeting in regard to lawenforcement agencies investigations into Bosasa?    And into Mti himself?    Mr Mti then suggested that certain individuals had to be in your words “sorted out?”    And he mentioned certain individuals in the NPA?    And the names mentioned were Jackie Lepinka,Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi?    Alright now was the decision in relation to who and in what amount and I am talking about the sorting out of individuals then finalised in your absence?    But you were told that by Mr Watson?    Right then please would you continue and was this decision executed?    Right and in paragraph 35.2 you describe how the decision was executed?     Well you do say in paragraph 35.1 that he and in the context that it Mti suggested to us that we have to “sort out” certain individuals in the NPA?    By whom?    Let us go on then to paragraph 35.2.  You say the decisions made in whatever words were used were executed?    How were they executed?    Please do.   What are the amounts to your knowledge that were paid?    Per what?    Right.    Right.  And do you personally know of the delivery of these amounts or were you told of the delivery of these amounts?    Thank you Chair.  The question that I raised with you last in relation to deliveries.  Let me make it more clear.  Were you ever present when a delivery was made to either of the three persons in the NPA?    Did Mr Gillingham – then in paragraph 35.3 you say these amounts were paid and received on a monthly basis.  That information would be information received from Mti?    Then in paragraph 35.4 you mention the name of MrGillingham.  Please tell the Chair what transpired?    Well in relation to the product of these payments we will deal with them after the short adjournment that as you say you received documents purportedly emanating from the NPA working files?    Containing information that could only on the face of it have come from the NPA?    Those documents were given to you by Mti?    And he told you he received these documents from within the NPA?    We will deal with those after the break.      Chair the – you are aware then that there is no water and in fact the bathrooms have been locked.  So.       I have – I am not sure of those.  I think they are outside I am not sure.    In your hands Chair.    Fifteen minutes should be.    Except you know the lifts and the number perhaps.   Twenty to twenty-five minutes.    Twenty-five minutes.    Yes Chair.    We – legal team drives a hard bargain.    Fine Chair. Absolutely fine.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Agrizzi we were at paragraph 35.4 of your affidavit and you were telling the, Chair, about the intervention of Mr Gillingham in respect of the arrangements regarding personnel at the NPA?    In paragraph 35.5 you deal with the contents of a meeting or you – another meeting after Mr Gillingham had raised his concerns.  What happened after Mr Gillingham had raised his concerns?    Did you receive an instruction from Gavin Watson at this time?    What was that instruction?    I am sorry I interrupted you, what did you do with thesebags?    Sorry, may I stop you there please.  Chair, I note that the broadcast feed has died and I told by sign language that it has been cut somehow.  I am not, it is important that this information is properly publicised if it is going to be given in evidence as before.   It is back on, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.    Alright, would you go back please and start that section of your evidence again?    No, you can continue with…[intervenes]    I think we can start, Chair, because we did repeat a littleof the evidence.    With the instructions given by Mr Watson.    To Mr Agrizzi.    Before you go there please?  Just let us clarify, you saythere were three extra bags?    One for the person with the surname Jolingana?    We have mentioned someone earlier I am told Nontsikelelo?    Is that her first name?    You referred to her earlier in your evidence?    How much did she receive?    Alright, would you just wait for my question to finish so that the record can pick it up please?  And then the third amount?   Alright then let us get the order straight.  The first amount?    Alright.    To summarise thus-far then arrangements were made to pay certain amounts to officials in the National Prosecuting Authority?    Your evidence is that these arrangements were executed in the manner in which you just described?    The purpose as I understand was to obtain information regarding the process of investigation and contemplated prosecution of Mti himself and Bosasa as well?   In relation to the first purpose, did it produce any results for Bosasa?    Alright.  You deal with that in paragraph 35.6.   Of your affidavit and I am going to take you through the contents of Annexure Q, that is Q1 to Q17.  Q1 appears at page 366 of Bundle S1, but before we go there let us just forewarn the, Chair, of what this evidence is all about.  You say in the introductory portion of paragraph 35.6 that the arrangement relating to the payment of money to officials and the National Prosecuting Authority had various goals and you say in paragraph 35.6 an execution of this arrangement Mti did various things.  What did he do?    Did you receive information?    In what form did you receive the information?    To whom was this information given?    The documents to which you have just referred and which we will refer to in a moment to whom were they given?    We spoke about…[intervenes]   Information.    I am not referring particularly to documents.    And the documents in Annexure Q.    Now we will go through the documents one by one in order to identify them and to consider or for the, Chair, to consider their probable source and to consider whether that is consistent with the evidence that you are giving.   But the documents in Annexure Q, you know what those documents are, because you gave them to the investigators?    How did you come into possession of those particular documents?    We will go through the documents.  I just want to ask one or two more questions in relation to the documents before we do that.    But, Chair, quite independently from the evidence of this witness no doubt the, Chair, will look at the documents to determine the more than probable source.    Yes.    Yes.    And you referred amongst other things to telephone conversations?    And where those telephone conversations become relevant you will no doubt inform the, Chair.    Right.  Now you say you received these documents from the persons mentioned and in the manner mentioned.  Since that time several yearshave lapsed, what happened to these documents, who kept them?    And then at a stage you handed them to the investigators of the Commission?    You say you created this storage space?    For the very purpose of securing these documents?    Let us deal with the first of these documents, it isAnnexure Q1 and it appears on page 366.    Chair, there are facilities on the ground floor outside the building, but when I got there certainly they were also locked.    But insofar as we are able to give instructions and insofar as people listen to us we have tried to sort that problem out.    I now believe even the bathrooms here are open.    Yes.   No.    Yes.    Page 366, the document referred to is on page 367.  Now this appears to be an affidavit of one Hendrik Andries Truter.  Do you know who that person is?   Now he himself on the face of it says so in paragraph 2 of the affidavit beginning at page 367?    We need not go into the contents of the affidavit, safe to say that it does indeed deal with procurement issues within the Department of Correctional Services.    But if you would look please at page 381 which is the last page of that affidavit you will see that again on the face of it, it was commissioned at Pretoria on 7 July 2009?    And the person commissioning the affidavit appears tohave been a Mr Cornelius Daniel du Toit Chief Forensic Investigator, Special Investigating Unit, Rentmeester building, Watermeyer Street, Pretoria.    The inference is to be drawn from that can be dealt with in due course, Chair.  The second document is Annexure Q2 and that appears at page 383.  Again it appears to be an affidavit, this time attested to by a Willem Hendrik Jacobus Pretorius.  Do you know who that person is or was?    Alright.  According to this affidavit at page 383 thedeponent Mr Pretorius was employed by the Department of Correctional Services as Deputy Director Tender Management at the Head Office in Pretoria.    The affidavit then goes on to deal with matters relevant to procurement and deals with contracts such as the outsourcing of catering services at a youth centre, the outsourcing of catering services generally and his activities in that regard.    He says for example on page 385 at paragraph 12   Alright.  So it seems that the subject matter at least of this affidavit is the series of contracts investigated by the special investigation unit?    Once again if one goes to page 387, the last page of that affidavit one will see that it was attested to on 20 July 2009, the Commissioner of Oaths there was a Mr Johannes Senekal and below the name of the Commissioner of Oaths is the words in handwriting ex officio SIU second floor Rentmeester building the same address.    Right.  Once again, Chair, the inferences to be drawn from that can be dealt with separately.  These documents generally did they come to you or did they come into your possession on one occasion only or over a period of time?   So you have some of the documents that came to Bosasa from whatever source over a period of time?    And as far as you know directly from Mr Mti?    Alright, let us go then please to Annexure Q3 which appears at page 389?  This appears on the face of it to be a memorandum from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions Pretoria, Special Commercial Crimes Unit Pretoria, from Glenis Breytenbach to adv Simelane described in the document as the National Director of Public Prosecutions.It is copied to other officials and it concerns in its own terms the Bosasainvestigation and it is dated 4 February 2010.  It seems that at this stage from the contents of this document that the investigation and any contemplated prosecution was now in the hands of the NPA?    We need not go into the contents of the document in any detail, but simply to say that this memorandum is a report from Ms Breytenbach to adv Simelane concerning the progress of the investigation into Bosasa?    For example and relevant to the position of Mr Mti and Bosasa one can look at page 391, amongst the various topics reported to the NationalDirector of Public Prosecutions by Ms Breytenbach over the three pages of the report    Is this consistent with what you knew yourself at the time?    Then if we may proceed please to Annexure Q4.  It appears on page 393.  The document itself appears on page 394.  As this document has relevant information in regard to the progress of the contemplated prosecution and investigation.  I am going to deal with certain statements in it but on the face of it, it appears to be a document on the letterhead of the National Prosecuting Authority?    It is dated 8 February 2010?    It is a memorandum which on the face of it emanates from Advocate M Simelane the National Director of Public Prosecutions and it is addressed to Advocate G Breytenbach.  Do you see that?    And it is copied to various persons?    The memorandum reads at least in the first paragraph   “It is mischievous to say the least.  Firstly there is no police docket or investigation under way.  Secondly and by your own admission there is still an assessment to be made on the evidentiary value of the information currentlyavailable.  How therefore you can start speculation and making suggestions regarding any person is beyond belief unless of course it is a manifestation of a mind-set with predetermined outcomes.  My suggestion would be that you follow the advice in the last sentence of paragraph 3 above.” And that is the, well it is not a suggestion.  It is an order to withdraw from the case.    These sorts of facts or reports concerning the progress of the investigation who was involved who was not involved and how it was progressing, were these given to you in any other form from time to time?   Yes.  You in fact gave that evidence towards the beginning of your testimony.    Then another document of some interest is the document marked Annexure Q5 which appears at page 397.  Again I do not want to go into too much detail in relation to the contents of the document save to point out that it is integral to information concerning the status of the investigation and contemplated prosecution.  If you would look at page 397 please.  It appears to be a document dated 9 March 2010 and it is referred to in its own terms as a Special Extended MinisterialMeeting.    And on the face of it, it was a meeting chaired by the Honourable Minister of Justice Mr Radebe?    The Secretariat referred to on that same page includes Ms J Lepinka.  Do you see that?    If you would go to paragraph 3 on page 398 please.  It appears from the minute at least and on the face of it at least that a report waspresented to amongst others the Minister by Advocate Simelane?    And under the head “SIU Report re Bosasa Investigation” in paragraph 3 on page 398 Mr Simelane is reported to have said at least    The reports you were getting were they consistent with the documents that you were getting?    Then if we may go to the next document which is Annexure Q6 which appears at page 401 of EXHIBIT S1.  This document appears to be a document on the letterhead of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit.  It appears to have been addressed to the National Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Menzi Simelane and it appears to have been authored by Advocate M C de Kock dated 17 November 2010 and the subject matter is “The Bosasa Matter”.    The purpose of this memorandum appears to have been as recorded under paragraph 1.“The purpose of this report is to apprise the NDPP of the status quo with regard to the Special Investigation Unit Report on Bosasa.”    There is then an analysis in the following page of that report in some detail.    On page 403 there is a conclusion reached in the middle    Under the head “Conclusion” on the same page, page    The next document appears at page 406.  It is Annexure Q7 and it appears in the second bundle Chair, Bundle S2.    The document …[intervenes].    Alright.   We are going to …[intervenes].    Annexure Q7 at page 406.    Q7.    406.    Thank you Chair.  Thus far just to summarise the documents you have received seem to cover the subject of the status of the investigation and contemplated prosecution into Bosasa and others?    And the documents go into a great deal of detail in that regard?    And contain original minutes of meetings and reports concerning that topic?    There is an information note dated 17 October 2011 which appears at page 406.  Do you see that?    It is addressed to …[intervenes].    Well we have no instructions as to the status of thisdocument Chair.    Just that it certainly was no longer secret by the time the witness received it.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.  The significance it appears of that is not only were you receiving minutes of meetings and reports, but also secret documents or documents marked “Secret” rather?    It is an information note addressed to the Commander of the Anti-Corruption Task Team the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations.  That is at that stage the Hawks, South African Police Service.  So it is an information noteaddressed to the Hawks headed “Progress of Investigation Bosasa Investigation PC5 Pretoria Central” and then there is a case number or a reference number at least.  Do you see that?    And for example in paragraph 3 it says or names witnesses that have been consulted and refers to draft statements being prepared for signature.  So you would know as a result if the receipt of this document who was being consulted and the progress of statements being taken?    And three names are mentioned in paragraphs 3.1 to3.3.  Persons from whom statements were being taken.  Then in paragraph 4 under the head “Investigation Outstanding” in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.11 the report states exactly from whom statements were intended to be obtained and that is clear from reading of this document and its context.    So you would know from the documents you were receiving exactly who was going to be testifying or from whom statements were going to be taken?    Including for example in paragraph 4.8 Mr Maako?    To whom payments were being made?    Payments by Bosasa?    Then in paragraph 5 is a report regarding various meetings that were held in relation to the prosecution.  You were given detail of the contents of those meetings between whom they took place and what was the content of those meetings?    [Intervenes].    Yes, I gave one example, but perhaps you are correct.    Not perhaps.  You are correct Chair.  It is better to list them all.    You were told in the document at page 407 Mr Agrizzi of various people who are going to be interviewed for the purpose of the taking of statements?    And 11 people are listed.    You refer to one person in paragraph 4.8 Mr Maako who was as you put it and in summary on the payroll of Bosasa?    And by payroll I mean was the subject of what you havereferred to as bribes?    Alright.  So have a look please at the names listed in paragraphs 4.1 and 4.11 and please tell the Chair whether any of the persons mentioned in this list were being paid by Bosasa.    Sishuba was also apparently on the Bid Adjudication Committee and Mr Maako also employed by the Department of Correctional Services as indeed the other two were in the post of Contract Management.    But in short you were given information secret information as to the progress of investigations as to who was being interviewed, from whom statements were being taken and some of whom were persons as we havecolloquially said on the Bosasa payroll?    Would you go back to paragraph 2 please?    They were not, they were not on …[intervenes].    Would you go back to paragraph 2 please on page 406.  Under the head “Statements Obtained Since Previous Report - Mr J Shlebane”.  Did you know who he was?    Yes and you were told in this secret document that a statement had indeed been obtained from him?    Then if we can go back to page 407 please.  At the bottom of the page paragraph 5 is heading “Other Meetings Attended” and we have told the Chair that you were given information of various meetings relevant to the investigation, who attended those meetings and the content of those meetings.    Then in paragraph 6 on page 408 is a heading “Recordsof Executive Management Meetings” and it appears that you were also given details of other meetings at an executive level.    The document at its foot on page 409 appears at least on the face of it to have been authored by Group Commander Kriel and Commander Moodley.  A Colonel and Brigadier respectively in the Anti-Corruption Task Team.    Interestingly these are not signed and also on page 410 another author at least potential signatory Major General Meiring Head of theCommercial Branch.  His name appears but again it is not signed, but what does appear on page 410 is that this information note was on the face of it compiled by Colonel D J Kriel.    On page …[intervenes].    Annexure Q7 continues then at page 411.  There is what appears on the face of it to be another secret information note.  It is addressed again to the Commander of the Anti-Corruption Task Team Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations South African Police Service.  Do you see that?    Under paragraph 1 the information contained there is alist of 39 people from whom statements had been obtained to date.    So at the time this was given to Bosasa it would know notwithstanding that it was the subject matter of the investigation at least in part the names of 39 people from whom statements had been obtained, correct?    Are there any names here that you would recognise as having been perhaps on the payroll of Bosasa?    What was the position in relation to Ms – Mrs Mabena?    Here it refers to her as being on the bid evaluation committee?    Is that in addition to the role?    And what is relevant in regard to Mrs Mabena?    And then under the head in paragraph 2 Bank Statements Obtained in terms of Section 205 of Act 51 of 1977.  A number of bank accounts are listed.  Fourteen in fact.    Belonging amongst others to Mr Mti.  I see here a mortgage loan account in the name of Autumn Storm Investments 106 PTY LTD?    You have given evidence regarding that entity.     The item or account listed in paragraph 2.3 refers to what appears to be Mr L Mti Volkswagen Triptronic – Triptronic it says here with higher purchase and supporting documents.    So you were told exactly which bank accounts and other financial documents were being investigated?  Was this information useful to Bosasa?    Then you received information in paragraph 3 on page413 concerning witnesses consulted and draft statements being prepared for signature.    And then in paragraph 4 under the heading Investigation Outstanding on page 414 of the bundle you are told what the plans are in relation to the obtaining of further statements and from whom?    Once again there are persons named on page 415 as being either authors or responsible for the report or as co-signatories but it appears from the bottom of page 415 that this information note was compiled by Colonel DJ Kriel?   Perused and verified by Brigadier Simon?    It is not necessary save to place it on record Chair to go back to the previous bundle but it appears in paragraph 35.6.8 that you received a confidential document signed by Advocate De Kock of the Special Commercial Crimes Unit dated 28 October 2011.  It is unsigned but it appears as Annexure Q8 on page 418 of the second bundle Exhibit S2.  Can we go there please?  This document is marked Confidential.  It runs from page 418 to page 243.  It is not necessary to go into the contents of the document save to place on record that it appears to be a memorandum examining the validity of a subpoena duces tecum that was served on the special investigative unit during February 2011 by the Mail and Guardian Newspaper?    Do you know anything about this?    No.    Well perhaps you should because it appears that this document would have been useful to Bosasa in any attempt it would make to quash theinvestigation?    Save that it is an opinion given by Advocate De Kock to his employer, a law enforcement agency, the Special Commercial Crimes Unit.    So not only improper but irregular?    So the conclusion on page 443 appears in paragraph 8.    Yes I just want to go to the conclusion.    And then allow him to.    Expand insofar as he wishes.  In paragraph 8 on page   Then briefly on page 449 is Annexure Q9.  Again in the series of documents you have told the Chair you received through these arrangementsto which you have testified.    This appears to deal with legal issues concerning subpoenas issued in terms of Section 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act?    It is a document that goes into several pages.  It does refer to Mr and Mrs Taverner on page 461.    But generally as an opinion in relation to subpoenas issued in terms of Section 205 of The Criminal Procedure Act?    You have made comments and it is also authored it appears on page 469 by Advocate De Kock?    The conclusion reached in the middle of page 469 reads   Alright.  Perhaps during the long adjournment you could have a look at the contents of the document because there are matters relevant toBosasa in here and the conclusion reached by Advocate De Kock is that there was a letter forwarded to Advocate Mokwebe which in her opinion constituted an irregular attempt to review the issuing of subpoenas, avoid the required court appearance by the witness and mislead the NPA as to the true facts concerning the legal process.  If you know anything about that letter you can tell the Chair about that in due course after the adjournment.    Chair is that a convenient time?    Thank you. MEETING ADJOURNS MEETING RESUMES    We were dealing Mr Agrizzi with Annexure Q9 onpage 445 of EXHIBIT S2.  It appears to be a memorandum authored by adv de Kock and one other concerning a letter that had been forwarded to adv Morebi concerning the issue of summonses in the Bosasa investigation and concerning the legality or otherwise of those summonses.  I asked you…[intervenes]    445.    The conclusion is on 469.    Do you have any personal knowledge or any challengeor contemplated challenges to subpoenas issued pursuant to the Bosasa investigation?    Alright, and do you have any information regarding this particular document?    Would you tell the, Chair, of that information please?    So on the one hand there is an investigation by law enforcement authorities.    Into the affairs of Bosasa and others.  Correct?    Pursuant to that investigation it appears that certain summonses were issued?    Bosasa had an interest in avoiding execution of those summonses.    And whilst you were considering what you should do you were favoured with what the law enforcement agency was saying about those summonses?    And in particular you were favoured with an opinion authored by adv de Kock regarding the legality of the very summonses which you had an interest in challenging and wished to challenge?   Then if we could go to Annexure Q10 please?  On the letterhead of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit is a memorandum from the specialised…[intervenes]    471, Chair.    Sorry, I should have said that.    471.  It is from the Specialised Commercial Crime Unitapparently adv Mokgatle, de Kock and Jansen van Rensburg to adv Mokwebe Special Director of Public Prosecutions head of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit and the subject line again is in RE representation Eversheds subpoenas issued in terms of Section 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act issued to Sydney Mark Taverner and Sharon Hope Taverner. Again it seems that this concerned the issue of the subpoenas about which you have just spoken.    In relation to Sydney Mark Taverner and Sharon Hope Taverner, do you see that?    And it is a report to adv Ngwebi concerning the status and perhaps to the legality of those summonses.    And is this one of the, well you have already told the,Chair, that there were two of the summonses about which Bosasa was concerned?    And concerned to take action in regard to?    And you were in receipt then of communications concerning the status of those summonses from the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit concerned?    If we could go to page 474 please?    474, Chair.    This is an email apparently sent on 22 November 2012 and next to the designation from it appears that, that name had been scratched out.  Do you know anything about that?    Alright, and you do not know what was scratched out?    Do you know what appears under the scratched out part?    Yes, well the person who scratched out apparently to conceal from whom the email came must have forgotten to scratch out the apparent author of the document at the bottom of the page?    And there the name Ms Jackie Lapinka appears.    Alright.  So it appears at least on the face of it that this email came from Ms Jackie Lapinka whose position or designation at the time appears to have been Manager, Executive Support to the National Director of PublicProsecutions.  It appears and we need not go into too much detail, but from the email train preceding that email at page 142 and 143 that the person designated as ANDPP was seeking a status report on various cases, do you see that?    Including the Bosasa case?    Those cases are listed in the email dated    Let us go back to page 474 if we may?  IF ANDPP, Chair, stands for the Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions, I am informed that at that time that person was Ms Jiba.    It appears on the face of it Mr Agrizzi that this email was sent by Ms Jackie Lepinka to Silas Ramaiti and Lawrence S Mrwebi?   And copied to certain other parties?    The subject line reads SCCU Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit status on the following cases, importance high.    And I am going to put it on record, parts of it on record if I may?    ″The said report should outline the following   Do you know anything about this communication and its content other than what you have just told the, Chair?    We are going to go then to page 478 which is Annexure Q12.  By the way all these documents I presume from your evidence and all the documents listed under the head Annexure Q were documents received by you from Mr Mti in the manner that you have referred to in evidence?    Well perhaps we should go to page 476 first which is the    Yes.  It seems that there was a meeting in prospectregarding these cases.    Let us move on then to another document in the bundle of documents marked Annexure Q.  That is the one that appears at page 478 it is Annexure Q12.  Again it is on the letterhead of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit, it is addressed to adv M Mokgatle, Acting Regional Head SCCU from adv de Kock and it is dated 26 November 2012 and the subject line is the progress report on the Bosasa investigation.Now we know that earlier on you referred to another progress report under the hand of adv de Kock, do you see that?    The email chain in which Ms Jackie Lapinka makes her comment concerning the status of the case against Bosasa and said that there is no evidence or any prospect of a successful prosecution is dated 22 November 2012?    Adv de Kock who has seem to play an important role in the contemplated prosecution, her memorandum to adv Mokgatle is dated four days later 26 November 2012?    And its subject is progress report on the Bosasa investigation.  It is clear from the content that it is indeed a progress report on the Bosasa investigation.  I just want you to mention to the, Chair, a few lines contained in the report to indicate what adv de Kock′s view was at that stage.   Then on page 479 under matters under investigation and    Then on 30 April 2013 it appears approximately five or six months later there is another progress report on the Bosasa investigation that apparently ended up in Bosasa′s possession.  It is again addressed to adv Ngwebe special Director of Public Prosecutions and it appears to have been authored by amongst others adv de Kock. It is dated 30 April 2013.    1.1 reads   Then under the paragraph number head 1.3 the    And that knowledge came to your attention despite the contradictory reports earlier, is that correct?    Do you know whether a charge sheet was ever served on Mr Gillingham?    Well that is interesting, because you were also given and this is Annexure Q14 at page 486 and following, you were actually given the draft charge sheet.    Before he even received it.    And it is headed draft charge sheet POC Gillingham 30 April 2013.    And contained in the charge sheet are a number of alleged acts some of which you have given direct evidence about?    And then if one goes on to Annexure Q15 at page 502 of S2 you will see what appears to be a draft memorandum.  It is headed proposed memorandum under the further head proposed racketeering memorandum confidentialdocument 8 August 2013.  Do you recognise this document?    It appears from page 510 where there are a number of headings and no content to those headings beneath that this was an early draft of this confidential document?    What is this document?    That were contemplated?    If you go to page 505 under the heading D, identification of the accused there are listed some 27 people and entities who apparently are those that are intended to be subject matter of the racketeering charges?    And you were informed of this fact?    Then before the memorandum was even complete?    And on page 511 once again a draft document.  It appears under the head proposed racketeering memorandum confidential document 8 August 2013.  It may well have been, but we are not sure, an Annexure to the prior document that you referred to, but again it is a provisional draft authorisation in terms ofSection 24 of Act 120(1) 1998 and that is the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.    So you would have known at that stage that charges were being contemplated in relation to racketeering in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act?    Before any such charges were actually levelled?    And in fact it is followed by a provision draft charge sheet and the accused some 27 accused are listed on page 513 and 514.   Yes, perhaps I did not make it clear, but …[intervenes].    The heading is the same.    Up to page 512 and then on page 513 the heading changes.    And there it is “The Provisional Draft Charge Sheet Racketeering as per the Instruction of NDPP – Confidential.  Subject to Amendments – Investigation Still in Progress”.    And there follows a draft charge sheet which goes right through to page 555.    Yes Chair.  I better check.  Well no, I am wrong Chair.    It goes through to page 527 and sets out the detail of racketeering charges.    Then on page 528 a new document begins, but it seems part of the set of documents.    It is headed “Provisional List of Racketeering Activities – P O C Gillingham and L M Mti.”    “Note this list is still incomplete and subject to amendments, draft document only – confidential.  For attention of Advocate Ngwebi, Advocate Mosing and the NDPP only.”    So it seems that this document was intended only for the attention of Advocate Ngwebi, Advocate Mosing and the NDPP.  Correct?   Also it came into your possession with the other documents?    Let us go then please if we may Mr Agrizzi to Annexure Q16 page 557.  This document about which you will hopefully testify to the Chair now was this document another set of another source?  It did not come to you via Mr Mti.    Now …[intervenes].    But this is not a document purporting to come, I am sorry.    I am sorry Chair, yes.    What I am trying to Mr Agrizzi.    You and I know at this stage and the Chair will know shortly, I do not think it is a problem leading you on this.  This is not a document that purported to come from the N, the National Prosecuting Authority?    But it does relate to the issues that we have discussed?    And it is the note you referred to this morning that weshould get to.  Well we are finally here.    Explain, there is a note at the bottom that appears to be a note that was placed on this document on one of those sticky notes.  That note which says received from Mti in 2013.  Notes in his handwriting what Jiba said they should be.  Is this part of the original document?    It is?    [Intervenes].   Was that a note made by a person as part of this investigation or what …[intervenes]?    Or was it later than the origin when this document originated?    So we should ignore that?    You can give that evidence?    Alright.  So you tell the Chair please what this document is?    There is a barcode there.  This particular paper on which this document was written do you know where it came from?    Be that as it may tell the Chair what this document is all about please.   Can we pause there?  I am sorry to interrupt you.   But you are having this discussion with Mr Mti.  The context of the discussion as a potential challenge to the investigation that was conducted by the SIU?    We know from the documentation that you received from the, from Mr N P, from the NPA via Mr Mti that indeed there were a number of opinions and comment, there was commentary regarding the legality of the SIU investigation?    Just to put it in its context.   I am sorry I interrupted you.  I will not again.    [Indistinct].    Sorry.    We may take it even more slowly Chair if you do not mind.    The second paragraph, evidence as contained in the report and how it was obtained.  You mentioned both fruit of the poisoned tree that concept?    And you also mentioned the authorisation for the stepstaken by the investigators?    Sorry Chair.    Is this the actual original document or did you have, it cannot be, but did you have the original document in your possession?    So the original document that we are dealing with here this is obviously a colour copy is in possession of the investigators?    This …[intervenes].    These pieces of advice do you know where they originated?    Okay.    Of course Mr Agrizzi we should not lose sight of the perhaps obvious fact that when Bosasa contemplated steps to quash the investigation and contemplates prosecution it was acting not only in its own interests, but also in the interest of Mr Mti.    And Gillingham.    Page 559 is Annexure Q17?    Again it has what appears to be notes on a stick note placed on the document, but because that may well be the investigator’s note we ignore that for the moment?   Would you tell the Chair please about this document?    To who?    Just pause there.   Pursuant to the meeting with Mti recorded on page 557.    You took that information.    To the attorneys.    A document was drafted?    You forwarded that document or you took that document to Mr Mti?    This conversation which you have recorded here on page 559 took place after that?    Okay.  Go on please.    Yes please proceed to explain to the Chair the contentsof this note.  May I just check?  Was this note made at the same time that the conversation was taking place?    How long after?    A day.    Right.  I just want to establish it is technical.  Do not concern yourself for the reason for my question Mr Agrizzi, but were the contents of the telephone conversation you held the day before you made this note still fresh in your mind?    Yes Chair and it is …[intervenes].    A contemporaneous note for whatever purpose.    Okay, right.  Please tell the Chair the contents of the note.  What this note represents?    Right, before you go on then I have been under misapprehension and I have perhaps because of that misapprehension.    Misled the Chair.  This is not a note of the telephone conversation?    I thought it was.    So it is irrelevant whether the contents of the telephone conversation was still fresh in your mind when you made this note?    This is a note of a conversation that took place directly between yourself and Mr Mti?    Thank you.        The source of this advice to Bosasa in your mind and according to your knowledge and according to …[intervenes].    Jiba and anyone else?    You can return to your statement please in the bundle S1.    At the time these discussions were being held what was the status of the payments to which you referred earlier in your evidence to Ms Jiba, Lepinka and others?    Right.    What happened on 8 May 2015?    Paragraph 35.9.    We are going paragraph by paragraph.    So a conversation takes place between yourself, Mr Mti and Mr Watson?    At this time the efforts of Bosasa with the assistance of Mr Jiba appeared to be falling off the rails?   Coming off the rails.    And what is contemplated then by Mr Watson is a visit to President Zuma?    And during the conversation from what I understand Mr Watson conducted a role play.  He showed both you and Mr Mti what he was going to say and how he would approach the President?    Alright.      Was this conversation – I am sorry.    Was this conversation recorded?    This conversation that you telling the Chair.    Right well the Chair does not know that.  Yes.      Who recorded it?    Did you keep a copy of the recording?    Or did you keep the recording?    Alright.  Chair the recording is Exhibit 3.  The transcript of the recording is at page 562 of bundle S2.    Yes.   At page 562.    Of bundle S2.  Yes the transcriber certificate appears at page 561.    Yes Chair I am advised that I must correct the Exhibit number as it appears in the statement.  It is Exhibit S4.  Is that right?  Sorry I am told it is.    No sorry Chair it is Exhibit S5.    Yes well it is going to be played now Chair.    Anyway that is just a numbering matter we can clear up.   But for the record the recording referred to in paragraph 35.9 on page 77 of bundle S1 is Exhibit S5.  The transcript of the recording is Annexure R which appears at page 561 and following.    Thank you.  May we play the recording?    I am sorry I omitted to place on record so that we can follow the transcript more accurately.  Person 1 who is that?    Yes.    Right Person 1 is Gavin Watson.  Do you know who Person 2 is?    And Person 3?    Thank you.  Sorry to interrupt you.    Okay before we go on Chair it is apparent that there are a number of errors on the transcript.    Yes particular in relation to some of the words and as to who is speaking.  So we need to corrected transcript.    Yes well I heard a little more I think that what was transcribed.    Well that is why we have asked a transcriber to preparethe transcript but unfortunately the transcript is not.    It is not accurate in all respects.    So we will correct that.    But in the meanwhile if I may because I am not sure all of it is relevant to this matter but let me ask …[intervenes].    Just let me ask the witness if I may?  There are two topics that appear to be the subject matter of the discussion on this recording.    The one is the contemplated prosecution of Bosasa?    And the involvement of various parties in that?    And you say in that respect Mr Watson was intending to make representations to President Zuma and was in a way rehearsing or role playing what he would say?    Alright we will get there.  The second topic here appears to be the South African Revenue Services and the so called Rogue Unit?    What relevance – does that have any relevance to thisinquiry?    So all that is relevant for present purposes is the transcript up to page 553, is that correct?    Because when they talking about Smit that is another matter?    Alright.    What was being said here?  Let us take it step by step. Person 1 is Mr Watson?    He says Jiba would try and close down twice but Dramat did not want to give the docket over to close it down?    What – what is the reference there?  What is being said?    And then the next sentence?   Yes.    Now that De Kock is that the same person that we have spoken about earlier?    I know it is late in the day – sorry we must not speak together.    Before you go on you have referred to documents which indicate that De Kock was indeed told to stay off the case and that it is apparent shewas later involved in the case?    Right.  Carry on please.    Okay before you go on the word “Ntlameza” there is that a correct transcript of the word actually used?  You mentioned Ntlameza now?    Not Ntlamanza?   No but for the moment.    No, no, no.    Sorry just before you go on.  You say for present purposes and subject to a proper check.    We can delete [Shagukeng] and replace that with Chauke?    Yes and then what about one of them got a goose?    So just pause there please.  So we can delete Kwebo there and replace it by Mokgwebi?    Well you have done fairly satisfactorily up to now.    But if you would just take a minute to read page 3, because we only going to go up to two thirds of the way down page 3 of the transcript that is page 563.  Just take a minute to read it and see if there is anything useful you need to tell the, Chair.    Do you want to listen to the first part of the exchangeagain?    You just signal to our technician.    So let us start at the beginning again. [Listening to audio]   So we do not have to go on.  We do not have to go on any further, because the topic of conversation apparently changes now.    The last portion there you are person three and you say   Alright, because from the context it appeared to at least to us here that you might be saying to Gavin Watson ″have you explained to the President in your role play what you caucused and arranged to move those investigators out Gavin″, am I right?    Well…[intervenes]    Well let us just pause there a minute, because I am not sure what you are saying now is consistent with what you said on the transcript Mr Agrizzi.  Two thirds of the way down page 563 against the words person three, that is yourself?    It reads   So the you is Gavin?    So have you explained to him who is the him?    Alright so this sentence then reads, as explained by you,have you explained to Mti what you caucused and arranged to move out those investigators and that Gavin?  So the you is surely Gavin?    So you are asking Gavin, ″Gavin what have you caucused and arranged?″  Is that not clear from that?    So the person doing the caucusing in this sentence is Mr Watson not Mr Mti?    Okay.  As foreshadowed, Chair, we will produce a new transcript.    Perhaps with another transcriber who dare I say can hear better.   Let us go back please to your statement to page 77 paragraph 36.  I am not sure we have to go into the generation of cash, once more you have given quite thorough evidence on that, but if there is anything in paragraph 36.1 that we have not dealt with we should put it on record now.  Would you just briefly take an opportunity to read 36.1?    Well, Chair, that question may come, but the method of generating cash and the involvement of service providers in order to generate cash has generally been dealt with and I can ask subject to one question first that I do want toask whether this scheme or these schemes existed both before 2009 and after.    That would clear that up entirely.  In 36.1.4 you mentioned Kgwetlo events.    I am not sure you have mentioned that concern before?    Right, but that is a new concern?    The scheme that you referred to here, or the schemes that you referred to here for the generation for cash are in the same terms as you gave evidence concerning previously?    Did this or did these arrangements exist both before and after 2009?    Alright.  Then in paragraph 36.2 you talk of a Mr Andries van Tonder.  Please tell the, Chair, of what you talk in paragraph 36.2?    Yes, and again you talk in the same terms of arrangements about which you have already testified.    You talk about for example the garage.    In Belfast.   And you talk about dummy invoices created for companies, some of whom did not even exist?    Alright, okay, I am corrected, Chair, Kgwetlo, I am not sure it was Kgwetlo events, but Kgwetlo indeed was in fact referred to before in paragraph 13.2, just to correct that on record.    Do you remember more or less when that conversation took place?    The President visited Bosasa?    Not Russia?    Never mind.    At that same time?    Right.  And I take it that it is reasonably obvious that thePresident referred to there was President Zuma?    At paragraph 37 you discussed the role of Mr Danny Mansell and his ultimate fate, would you tell the, Chair, about that please?    You have supplied the Commission with documentssupporting these payments?    S2 page 569, Chair.    Well you tell us that the document is there.  I am not sure that this evidence is too controversial, so perhaps we can just accept that the document is there if we need to check it.    And that is a fictitious invoice?    Alright.    Of course if the real purpose of the payment was to buy silence?    And the apparent purpose was an expense in the books of Safest Fences any purported deduction for tax purposes would be improper?    But continue please?    And that is in 2012?    2012?    Perhaps before we move onto the task that Mr Agrizzi was given and its implementation, it is two minutes to and I could spare…[intervenes]    I could stretch the application out for another two minutes.   Yes, Chair.    The witness is aware and he has agreed to postpone arrangements to return on Monday and I am hoping perhaps beyond hope, Chair, that we can finish on Monday or at least on Tuesday.    Well perhaps you are correct, Chair.    The counsel′s estimates are notoriously wrong.    Thank you, Chair, but there are not matters to interruptus such as SIU reports and the like. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Good morning, Chair.    Yes, I can.    This document would be the list that I would provide to Jacques van Zyl to pack so that they can be collected by the various people.    The cash.    I compiled the document.    This would have been deliveries between the 20th and25 April 2016.    Yes, I am.    Correct.    If you look at paragraph 34.3, Chair, the following payments were made to the Department of Correctional Services officials on a monthly basis.  The first one is 34.3.1 is Josiah Maako, the amount of R15 000 was paid to him.  Mr Maako was the contract′s manager for Correctional Services.    Or is the contract′s manager.    The second person was Maria Mabena.  She was responsible for catering and development and care.  Then it was Commissioner Shishi Matabela who received R10 000.    These are based at Head Office.    Shishi Matabela who is the Commissioner for Developmentsand Care.  She would receive R10 000.  These were the initial amounts, Chair.    There was a Commissioner Mkabela who was…[intervenes]    I do not recall his first name.  I think it is mentioned further on.    But right now I cannot recall his first name.    Mkabela would receive R10 000.  There was a lady who used to be Head of Procurement called Dikeledi Tshabalala.  She would receive R15 000.  There was a gentleman by the name of Zach Modise.  At that stage he was responsible for a region of Correctional Services and at that stage he would receive R20 000.    If I recall it was the Free State region if I remember correctly, it is quite a while back.   So this was before his promotion to National Commissioner.    With the amount then increased significantly.  Then there is a gentleman by the name of Mollet Ngubpo who was responsible for finance.  Those were the initial people that were during 2007 appointed, well identified by Ishmael Nxaba, Papa Leshabane and Joe Gumede as being influential in terms of the Correctional Services contract and also more importantly because Mti had resigned and left they needed to be able to yield some power in there.These amounts up until – with exclusion of Zach Modise was all paid byIshmael Nxaba or Dikane, he changed his name, Dikane that was taken by him on a monthly basis.  Zach Modise would be handled by Papa Leshabane.    Does that answer the question?    Okay.    Correct.    If we can go to AA361, sorry 361.    And why I would like to refer to this is specifically because it corroborates my statement in terms of the fact that the handwriting and the signature atthe bottom of the page is that of Jacques van Zyl.    Yes, I will.    I will.    Chair, if you look at the one that is highlighted on 25/02/2016 MMM is the initials.   Correct.    That is correct.    Right at the top you have got…[intervenes]    That reflects the date the list was compiled and the bribery money was packed.    MMM stands for Mollet Ngubpo, his initials were triple ″M″.    That is correct, that is correct, Chair.    MMM is Mollet Ngubpo.    MMM.    We always called him triple M.    Yes.    That amount was R50 000.    R50 000.    And if you look behind that it has got IMN.    That was the code I used for Ishmael Nxaba.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    And the code would change frequently, Chair.    Yes.    No the features stayed the same.    But what would happen is for instance if a person had a nickname like one of the people was J.    So they had a nickname and I would have to use the surname, I would change, I will switch between the two.  There would be various permutations.    So the thing is I would know, but nobody else would know and the problem with codes is that if you do not – if you use the same code every time people start to recognise it.    And they start to make the association.  So we try and change it frequently.    The initials, correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Sometimes, Chair, I would change it, but not that often.    Correct.    Not always.    Sorry, Chair, mostly.    But not always.    Sometimes it would change.    Ishmael Nxaba.    That is correct.  These are mostly the Correctional Services people.   In number one.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair, I can explain the discrepancy.  These figures as quoted here specifically relate to the initial amounts that were agreed in 2007 when Mti resigned.  These have grown.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    If you look at the second one it is MMB.    And that was my code for Maria Mabena.    If you look at MKB…[intervenes]    The last two are different people.    Yes, correct sir.    Nxaba.    Yes sir.    Will do, Chair.    Correct.    If you have a look at page – paragraph sorry 34.3, 34.3.4 Mkabela if you have a look at, if you flip over to 361 on the Annexures and if you look at the next name MKB20IMN so would refer to Mkabela.    Yes there are.  If you have a look while we still on page 361.    I cannot remember the first, it was a M I think it starts with M.    SSS would be Shishi Matabela.    That is correct.    That is correct.    There was then a payment to if you look at KLA that is KloofMine AMCU Union.    It does not appear.    No, but I am going through the list.    Correct.   I will do.  If you look at, I am just trying to find, sorry, because Papa Leshabane would have done the delivery for Zach Modise so I am just finding it.  If you go to 361.    Number 9 at the bottom on the right hand side you have got TMK.    Correct.    Correct.    Alright, if you look at, you have got number one on top.    Number two, you have got number three, you have got number four, alright?    You have got number five, then you have got number six, seven, eight and nine.   That is correct.    If you go to…[intervenes]    Correct.    That is correct.    Okay, that code is totally different.  Alright, that is PLS which stands for Papa Leshabane that is the Director.    Okay, so this one is different as I said earlier.  That is 71 and it has got a code behind CCV.   That was a total amount that was given to Papa Leshabane and from that amount he would pay Zach Modise as well and he was paying journalists and people from Lindela.    Correct.    Chair, to give information and to work with them.    Presumably, yes.   So he would get a fixed amount, he would get R71 000 a month and he would distribute it and of that money would go to Zach Modise, but we will get to Zach Modise a bit later on.    Because, so that was part of it.    CCV it just stood for it is a bulk amount for Papa Leshabane.  So there were two bulk amounts, the one underneath that is for Thandi Mokoko and that was…[intervenes]    That is correct.    Chair, if I had known that today what I know now – then what I know now I would have coded it perhaps using a standard code, but I think you must remember that this was done very clandestine, it was between me and Jacques van Zyl and the Directors and there was no need to follow a proper secure system that you would come back to.    It was arbitrary.    And it was a code so if – if ever Mr Watson or Mr Leshabane stood in the dock and they got asked what is JAC30 they would say well I do not know it is just a number, that was the whole idea behind this.    But if you look at – I mean, I have not looked at page 362 yet, but if we page over to the next one or you can go there, you can see on that one there it changed as well.  So there for instance Ishmael Nxaba is coded IMC50MNG and that was – I know it was for Mollet Ngubpo.    So it was a…[intervenes]    It was arbitrary.    And the reason was quite simply so nobody could actually point a finger and unless you knew the code you would not be able to work it out.   Yes, in my black book it actually has, some of them have codes, some have the full name.    Because remember the black book was kept in the vault in Gavin Watson′s safe.    And that was just there for him to check up on the book if hewanted to reconcile the cash.    Yes.    Correct, and, Chair, one thing I must tell you is that after a while doing the same thing repetitively you start to remember people and the amounts.  You link people and the amounts.    Correct.    Correct, and also you must bear in mind the codes I would, I use mind maps in my head to remember things and the codes I would associate with people.    So for instance one person I know has glasses, because he wears very think glasses so his code would be GLS, that is how I would work it out.    And it was a unique system that I needed to apply, Chair, in doing this.    And if anybody asked me at the time who is JGM that is Joe Gumede and how do I get to that well it is Joe Gumede so the G and the M that is how I memorised it.    And I think, Chair, why, and I am sorry, but I think why I am actually mentioning if you look at the bottom of the page…[intervenes]    At 361 that is not my handwriting, that is the handwriting of Jacques van Zyl.    Not the signature the hand, the actual handwriting.    Yes, correct.  So he would have totalled it for me, so he would have said CCV1686 so it was 1.6-million DCT that would be the code which would say to me that it is packed and it is in the bag.   No, no, sorry, Chair, the handwriting on 361 is my handwriting except for the bottom.  You will see the handwriting is totally different.    Yes, that is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    Chair, no that is the signature of the person that witnessed or attested to, commissioned this document.    That is Jacques van Zyl.    That is Jacques van Zyl′s handwriting.    No sir.   The signature was signed by the Commissioner of Oaths the signature.    Not a problem.    And if you look at, if you have a look at it, in my total there I would put there CCV1986DCT and it was confirmed what was actually packed at the bottom CCV1686DCT so in other words he only packed that amount for me.  Therewere certain things that were not packed and he has not double ticked them.    Okay, does it make a bit more sense?    Alright.    Does that clarify it Advocate Pretorius?    Yes.    Yes.    Next to the Commissioner of Oaths’ initials is handwritten “note there CCV 1686 DCT” and that is from Jacques van Zyl.    That is correct Chair.    If I recall correctly the two names that do not appear wasZach Modise.    Okay.  Sorry …[intervenes].    On 361?    He is represented in the Leshabane total.    The second one.    You understand.    That is correct.    On that specific list on 361?    Correct.    Yes, I do think we have.  Have we not?   Could you …[intervenes] which one?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, they do.  If you have look at the attached list JM at the bottom.    That is right.    Under paragraph 1.   JM …[intervenes].    That is right.    15.    And to answer the question about Ms Tshabalala is that about 16 she had left the department and therefore was not entitled to getting a bribe.    She …[intervenes].    That is correct.    The 15 was 15 000.    Correct.    The 20, K20, KZO.    Yes.  She was, she was not at the department in 2016.    She had left to go to the Department of Education.   Yes.    I will, I will go through them again but I, as far as these are all the lists I had.    Correct.    Correct.  The other entry is …[intervenes].    Correct Chair.    That is correct.    No.  When it started Chair in 2007 she was in the department.  I think she only left the department in 2014 or 2015.  So her name would have been on the list right until she left.    So …[intervenes].    Otherwise I mean …[intervenes].   Correct.    No, I …[intervenes].    The list on 20, on paragraph 34.3 reflects the lists if you look at.  They made payments on a monthly basis shortly after Mti’s resignation until approximately end of 2016.  So that was the initial list.   Okay.    Yes.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct and we were going to.    Give the money if she was there.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Probably because I was, somebody interrupted me or I wasbusy and I just did not put anything there.  It is just an error.  I think I must just reiterate that this piece of paper was only between three people.  It was myself, Jacques van Zyl and Gavin Watson.  Jacques van Zyl would do the packing.  Gavin Watson would do the deciding and who needs to be paid and I would do the verification and the discussions with the directors.    So that is how it worked.    This paper was never supposed to be, this is just by chance.    If you look at it was in a packet in my, in my briefcase.    When I had left.    So it was never ever compiled to be able to prove anything.   Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.  So …[intervenes].    It is not …[intervenes].    Chair that is not the person.    The person represented by JM is in fact Josiah Maako.    Okay.   So sometimes we would have to give a little bit extra to a person and you would then add in a person.  For instance there were often requests that can I, I need to buy something to build my house finished and I have to pay them for the roof an amount of eight, R80 000.  I only get R50 000.  Can you advance me R30 000 and we used to do that.    So that is possibly why, you know, there is no number behind that 15.  It was probably an advance, an extra advance as well.    That is the only explanation.  I, if I had known that today would come I would have maybe been more methodical.    In my approach, but the reason for my vagueness on these documents is purely because of the secrecy that went with it.    Thank you.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.  34.4 starting off at, when the whole background on the.    Chair would it be, it might be easier for me, because here I talk from my, off the cuff …[intervenes].    To, to go from.    Right from the beginning 34.   Okay.    That is correct.    Chair what I would do then is I would compile those lists asyou saw in 361 and 362 and I would then give it either by hand or if I, if I did not have the book with me the paper with me, because you will see everything is written on blue paper and in fountain pen in my, in my purple fountain pen.  I would then give that to Jacques van Zyl or email him the list if I was not in town and I would code it.  I would then give it to him.  He would then prepare it.  He would pack it.  He would then give me it back with the total amount that he would write at the bottom of the list as you saw in 361 and I would then take that and call the relevant director who had to pick it up and say your stuff is ready.  When are you coming to fetch it and it would be in the, in the Company Secretary’s safe.  In the two safes which you saw on the video which are opened initially.  It would be kept in there and as they would come I would tick it off that they had received and taken it.  That is how it would actually work.  Does that, is that sufficient for you Chair?    No.    No.  [Intervenes].    Correct and it would be known to the person I am handing it to.    Because I would tell them.    That this is for that person.    Sometimes it would help them.  Sometimes like Ishmael needed a bit of help.  I would write down the code and I would write down the person on a piece of.    A post-it or something.    And give it to him like that.    Let me just take …[intervenes].    Well 36.    Yes, I can tell you exactly whose name is on the list here.  Would you like me to …[intervenes].    Go through it.    Yes.  Some of them …[intervenes].    They do coincide.  Some of them I give an example.  IMC, if you look at 363 Chair    [Intervenes].    Second column.    I have put in IMC – 50 SHR. That was Shishi Matabela.  Ishmael Mncwaba collected it.  It was R50 000.    Ishmael Mncwaba.    That is correct.    Ishmael Mncwaba.   That is correct Chair.    Yes.    That is correct.    They do, yes.    That would be easy to do Chair.    No, I have not yet gone through that.    34.5, on the instruction of Gavin Watson I would deliver to Seopela payments which would be handled to hand it over to officials from the Department of Correctional Services according to Seopela which included Senior Government Officials.  I would …[intervenes].    I would …[intervenes].    This was from 2009/2010.    Sorry.  So what would happen Chair is on a monthly basis there would be special payments.  As I alluded to earlier yesterday there was the increase from 500 to 750 000 and there were certain officials who would be handled in a group with Mr Seopela and he would collect the money to handle them.    Mostly, yes.   Yes.    That is correct.    Well Gillingham had to resign from the Department of Correctional Services and there was a reason for that.  That the evidence against him would have been too much and it would be better if he resigned, because then theywould not have been able to lay claim on his pension fund.  So he resigned from the Department of Correctional Services in November 2010 after he had been suspended.  I think he was suspended for two years.    Well he had been charged.  He had actually been charged based on the SIU Report.    So he was physically, he was charged by the department and he was to appear before a Disciplinary Committee and at that stage they used the State Advocates to handle the matter.    We, as Bosasa we were assisting him by utilising BDK Attorneys.  Sorry I should not have mentioned the name, but we were using a group of attorneys to assist him in defending the case.  The day before he, the day he appearedbefore the case, at the, the case I got a call from Seopela to say that Gillingham has just resigned.    And, and he just resigned and that is when he came back to us and he said look now what.  I need to get my salary, because I am not going to get a salary anymore and that is when Gavin Watson agreed that he would increase his salary double it up, because he was getting R47 000 a month.  He would double it up and pay for small incidentals like his medical aid and his pension fund.  So it went up to R110 000 a month.    Correct.  In the video clip you see.    That he actually says to Andries, he says to him pay; you will take the money to Patrick Gillingham, because at that stage I just refused point blank.    As long as Bosasa had the Catering Contracts the senior members who were involved in arranging those contracts would be paid for life.  As long as the contract was in place.    That is correct Chair.    That, apparently that is what the arrangement was.   I did not know about the arrangement from the onset.    This meeting as far as I can recall took place at Richmond Mti’s house in Savannah Hills.    I was at the meeting.  Gavin Watson was at the meeting. Richmond Mti was at the meeting.    What was basically discussed, it was an informal discussion regarding to the investigation of Bosasa.  Richmond Mti wanted to know what we were doing and how we were active and wanted to create an alliance and formulate the way forward on how to handle this investigation.    Correct and the potential criminal charges at that stage.    Can I continue?    There had been discussions before.    And this was kind of a follow up discussion.    On discussing what was out in the press number one and number two what was happening within the NPA.    And then they would always go on about the political ramblings and that as well.   But the fact of the matter is it was a monthly scheduled meeting that I had suddenly become involved with as well.    Mti, Mti was very well aware of the investigation Chair and he suggest that we, we need to pay certain or sort out certain individuals within the NPA so that we could carry favour and also that they could assist us in telling us where and when to send lawyers letters that type of thing and on what basis to send it.  So there was a lot of documentation as well that came from Mr Mti after he had met with the various people.  The important thing was that he told us to, we needed to make up packages for certain people.  That was made very clear to me by Watson and by Mti that it needed to be done and needed to be done urgently.    Yes, he did.   The names Chair were Jackie Lepinka who had used to work for him previously as his Secretary and was now working for Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.  He mentioned Lawrence Mrwebi and that they were handling the investigation at the NPA.    Chair I was told to prepare money by Gavin Watson for thosethree names and the names and the amounts were decided by Mr Mti and Gavin Watson.  They had a private discussion about it.    I was just told afterwards this is what needs to get paid.    The meeting, I walked out.    And the meeting to discuss these amounts.    I was told in the car on the way back that this is what was being agreed between the two.    That is true.  It was not the SIU investigation it was the HAWKS investigation and the NPA’s …[intervenes].    Correct.    Mr Gillingham raised his concerns, there was a discussion onthe telephone between Richmond Mti and Gillingham in my presence where he told him not to be concerned that he has it all under control that he was dealing with Jiba, he was dealing with Jackie and Mrwebi.    Yes, I did, Chair.    The instruction was from Watson to take Mti′s cash earmarked for him as well as the cash delivered to a number of other officials as was done on a monthly basis.  Gavin Watson informed me that I was to take extra cash for the people at the NPA.  He explained to me that he had already packed the security bags for Nomgcobo Jiba in the amount of R100 000 and he marked it Snake.  Lawrence Mrwebi in the amount of R10 000 and he marked it Snail.  This would be marked with a Sharpie marking pen on the bag itself and Jackie in the amount of R20 000 and marked as Jay.    I took these bags together with the other bags to Mti and these were added to the regularly monthly payments made to Mti.  The complete bag which was a haversack with the bags inside it included the following amounts.  Mti was R65 000 packed in a grey, all these are packed separately in a grey security bag labelled.    From the Gillingham call?    Chair, Watson instructed me to take Mti cash that had been earmarked for him as well as cash to be delivered to a number of other officials which was done on a monthly basis.  Gavin informed me that I had to take the extra cash for the people at the NPA as well.  He explained to me that he had packed security bags. He packed them in a large haversack, plastic haversack which we will buy in bulk from the China Mall and he would say – he said to me that he had packed the security bags for Nomgcobo Jiba in R100 000.  He had packed the grey security bag inside the main bag for Mr Lawrence Mrwebi and he marked it Snail and he packed the bag for Jackie Lepinka and marked it Jay.  The amounts that were packed were…[intervenes]    R100 000 and he marked it for Snake.    He marked Mrwebi′s R10 000 as Snail and Jackie as Jay.  I took these bags together with the other bags to Mti.  So it was all in one bag all delivered to Mti.    There were six bags inside it.    Okay, there were extra bags.  One was for Jolingana who was at that stage the Acting Commissioner of Correctional Services.  He also referred to as Middledrift, the code name for her was Middledrift.    Middledrift, because apparently she came from that area in the Eastern Cape.    She was.    Yes, that is right.   She was an Acting National Commissioner if…[intervenes]    I do not know, I just know her as Jolingana, I think it was her surname.    Alright, but the code name for her was Middledrift I just recalled now.  Then for Grace Molatedi who was the Area Commissioner for somewhere in the Free State and the reason why that was, was because they had further extended the contract by an additional two contracts.  One of them was Groen Print and there was, I will remember the other one, it is further on in my statement, but she would get R50 000, because she extended the contract.There had been a fire at one of the facilities and they had asked us to take over and put in a mobile kitchen.    Correct.    Correct.  I have not gone into detail with the investigators, but we had such little time to prepare.    So Grace Molatedi would be getting an extra R100 000 as well.  Then in execution of this arrangement Mti over a period of time supplied me with documents which indicate…[intervenes]    Correct.    Correct.    That is the lady.    That is correct.  That is correct.    That is correct.    She received R100 000.    The third amount was Grace Molatedi which was R100 000.    The first amount was for Richmond Mti which was his standard R65 000 a month.    That is correct, Chair.    No, Chair, the amount that he would get monthly was R65 000.    Later on, after this it increases to R85 000, because then the company started paying his rental – his rental fee of R20 000 a month cash.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.  The purpose was also to get them to stymie the process.    Well most definitely.    Correct.    He liaised with the NPA people to get information from them and provide us with the information relating to that.    Yes, we did.    Information would be verbal.  It would be written, it will be copies of secret documentation, minutes of meetings, various other informationsources.    The information was given to Gavin Watson and then to myself.  Or sometimes, occasionally I would be there with Gavin Watson and it would be handed over to me.    Sorry, I thought I explained that.  Could you just repeat that in what context?    Yes?    Oh, documents, okay.    Yes.  Those documents, sorry, Chair?    Those documents were given presumably by the people within the NPA to Mti.  Mti would give them to Watson normally, or if I was there he would give them to Watson and myself at the same time.    Correct.    That is correct.    Those documents in Q were given to me via Richmond Mti.    When you say via by whom were they given to you?    Well they were given to me by either Gavin Watson or Richmond Mti directly, Chair, I cannot remember each document, I need to go and lookat it and try and jog my memory, but they were given to me by Gavin Watson who got them from Richmond Mti or alternatively if I was with Gavin Watson at the meetings he would give them Richmond Mti would just give them directly to me.    Yes?    Correct.    Correct, and I think the important part that I need to clarify is these documents came from either Nomgcobo Jiba or during the meetings with Mti theywould hand him the documents.  He would then come and give us the documents.    That is how it would work.    Correct.    And I think if you look at the documents, Chair, you will see that they are highly confidential and secret documents.    There is only one or two people who would have access.    Okay.    That is correct, Chair.    Will do.    I kept those documents with me and kept them for safekeeping.    That is correct, Chair.    I did not take them with me, Chair, because I left, I was going on leave like normal.    So they were with me in a secure place, because I got to a stage where I wanted to use these documents and open it up.    They were at in a storage place that I created.    Yes.    That is correct, Chair.    To clarify, yes, not only these documents, but various other documents as well and hard drives.  So what I did do I hired a specific storage facility away from my premises.    I do, he is, I am not sure of his rank but he is in procurement for the Department of Correctional Services and he is very well versed in how tenders should operate and he was present when all the tenders were awarded to Bosasa.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I am well aware, he is a Deputy Director for Tender Administration and that at Correctional Services.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    There were numerous documents over a period of time, unfortunately I do not have all of them.  I have submitted what I had.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.  If I may just add, Chair, when I left on the 15th I had left with the intention of going on leave, coming back and getting more documents, but unfortunately I never went back.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.   Correct.    I do.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.  It would be confirmed to me by Sesinyi Seopela.  So there was always confirmation of whatever documentation I was getting and it would always collaborate.  So there were various sources of information that would come to me and because Sesinyi Seopela was close to Advocate Menzi Simelane they had a relationship.  I was introduced to him in, in Sandton.  I think I go through that in my statement further on Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct and Mr …[indistinct].    That is correct Chair.    Well before we received the assistance here of Advocate Menzi Simelane in helping us shut it down it was very tense at that stage, because we wanted to close it down.  There were new contracts to be renewed.  So I would be getting reports either verbal or in writing on a weekly to every second week basis.  Does that answer your question Chair?    Very.   That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair I just need to clarify that matter.  I think that that is a bit of a, they are adding too much spice there.  What happened was that the bid boxes are normally about 50 by 50, because people putting their envelope    Into the bid box.    However when we submitted bids they were literally busloads of bids.  So the files would be packed in big boxes and because, I mean big boxes and stacked, I remember that specific bid for the, for that tender there had 27 files, lever arch files.  So there was no way you could put in the bid box, but it was there before the bid closed.  That I can confirm.    That is correct.    Excuse me Chair.   Is it possible to let somebody check the air conditioning please.  It is …[intervenes].    It is too hot on this side.    Yes.    Very hot.    Like Nandos.    Sorry for the disturbance.    If they could Chair.  I think it is this section of the …[intervenes].    Maybe with all the equipment behind me.    Extremely.   It is like Nandos extra hot.    Chair if you allow me I, I can, I see there is an air conditioning unit.    Over there.    Okay, thank you.    Sorry for the disturbance.    I will.  Thank you very much Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Most definitely Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is right Chair.    The one marked “Secret” on the top.  I do see it, yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct Chair.   That is correct Chair.  Whatever we requested we would get.  There was no issue.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correction Chair.  I just want to clarify.  There is also Mr Ngubpo.  So I do not want to single out one if there is actually more people …[intervenes].    Sishuba.    Yes.    Hm.   I just wanted to make sure that that was clarified.    Thank you.    Chair 4.2, Ngubpo, Bid Adjudication Committee.  4.4, Sishuba and 4.8 Maako.    Correct.    Chair I …[intervenes].    I, I cannot comment.    Ja.    That is correct Chair.    I can …[intervenes].    I can confirm that as far as I know.    I do not know now.    But Mr Mapasa.    Mr Engelbrecht, Mr Basson.    Mr Secupa that I know of.    Correct.    Correct Chair.   Yes.  He was responsible for IT and he left the department in, I think it was 2014/2015.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    If I may also add Chair that sometimes we get unsigned documents first and then the signed documents later.  Sometimes we would get signed documents.  Sometimes we would get unsigned documents.    I am well aware of all the subpoenas issued as I was asked to intervene with some of them.    I do have information regarding this document.    Chair, in terms of the subpoenas issued and there were two specifically that come to mind, three sorry, my apologies.  Three, the first subpoena that comes to mind is the subpoena to Brian Blake from Blakes Travel to provide information to the SIU and to provide records that they were keeping.  The second one is one that was issued to Mark Taverner.  I was asked to personally get involved and to intervene with those subpoenas as well and to try and make them – how can I put it…[intervenes]    Stymie them, to take time.  The information was given to me,Chair, was that the longer it takes the less importance, the less important it is and it will also give time to clear up things.    As was standard practice, correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair, this is as I received the document that is how I provided it.  I did not scratch it out.  It had seemed to be scratched out.  I remember, sorry, it was scratched out by Mr Richmond Mti before he handed it over to me.    Well he did not scratch it out properly.    You can actually see on the form, after the line at the top it says from there and you can see a J, you can see a K, I can see an I, I can see a L, I can see a P and I can see an A.  So one can presume from my ability to decode certainfigures this is Jackie Lapinka, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    I am well aware of that.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.  If I can for clarity purposes…[intervenes]   That is correct, Chair.    I wanted to add clarity in terms of the names that were mentioned.  I recall receiving this document personally in the presence of Mr Watson at the house of Mr Mti and I was told categorically that they cannot just isolate and close down the Bosasa case.  It would raise too many concerns so they would have to do it as part of five other cases.Another case that was mentioned to me was the Coca-Cola case that wasclosed down.  I am not aware of it, but that was mentioned during these discussions as well, and based on this document we believed that the case would be closed down.    That is correct.    That is correct.    With specific reference to Coca-Cola, there was an issue there that is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I have explained everything that I am aware of.    That is correct.    I am not fully aware, I have never met with Palesa.  All I know is when I looked at the authenticity of the email I picked up that, you know that there was a chain and it showed authenticity.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is right.   That is correct.    I do.    That is correct.   Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No charge sheet, nothing has been done with Mr Gillingham.   That is correct.    Before anybody received it.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I do.    Correct.    This document was provided to me via Richmond Mti.  It was dated 8 August.  I received it if I recall correctly mid-August in 2013 and basically what it talks about is the racketeering and charges regarding to racketeering that would bebrought.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.        That is correct.    Correct.    No, this document came to me via Mr Mti and Mr Watson.    Correct.    Yes.    No, not at all, no.    Correct.    Thank you.    That is correct.    Sorry, this is part of the, the documents that I submitted.    Yes.  No that that was just the indicator note.  So that was.    It is a note where I recalled it.    Correct.    [Intervenes].    No, no this was made by the investigators when they tagged the file to actually make a note that it was received.   The note, yes.    Thank you.    Chair this document was written to me while I was sitting in the study.    That is right.   It has got 238 …[intervenes].    On top of it.    That is right.  It is called assignment writing pad.    It has got there assignment writing pad.    I have not got a clue but what, what is interesting is if you know the university they will be able to scan that barcode in and tell you which student was using that pad.    Chair we were having a meeting and it was post one of the meetings with; that Mti had with …[intervenes].    Myself, Richmond Mti were having the meeting.    That is correct Chair.    The meeting was held in 2013.  I cannot …[intervenes].    Cannot recall, but I do recall that it was at his house.   And he used his note pad, because he wrote it down for me.    Right, we discussed …[intervenes].    We discussed what had happened as we would normally after his meeting with the ladies, as he put.  So the ladies he referred to was Snake and Jay.    Lepinka.    Okay.    We never, just so you know Chair we never ever used their names in these …[intervenes].    Code name.    But for this purpose I will use their full names.    So we spoke about, he said we have got a challenge the legality of the SIU Report.  Two bases that is Mti writing this down.  He has given me instructions    To take to the attorneys.    And to give them a guideline on drafting a letter.    Correct.    The first thing that was mentioned was that the legality of the SIU Report in its entirety must be challenged and that is because according to the evidence which is contained in the report the way that the, they obtained subpoenas.  The way that they obtained evidence was tainted and I recall them using the term “fruit of a poisoned tree”.  So if there was fruit of a poisoned tree you could never regain that specific type of evidence.  That is what was explained to me.    By Mr Mti, yes.    So it was made …[intervenes].    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Correct.    Not a problem Chair.    So this was an instruction document like a blue print manual to go back to the attorneys so that the attorneys could actually draft a letter requesting this information, requesting that the case be closed down and not be prosecute, because based on the fact that they had broken the, the investigation stymied it, because they had gotten fruit from a poisoned tree.  That is why he mentioned it.    The other thing is that Brian Biebuyck, sorry the attorney was to write that the fundamental rights have been encouraged upon of the individuals.  The next point was timelines.  That the timelines for this …[intervenes].    Okay.  I will do that.    That makes …[intervenes].    That makes sense to me.    As well.    Yes.   Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Well I learnt about.    I learnt about it through this whole process.    Yes.    Correct.    Okay.  Legality was with regards to fruit of poisoned tree and also the process followed by the SIU to get the information and also the, the fact that the SIU Report before it was made public should have gone to the President which never happened and there was an issue with regards to that they wanted us to highlight.  The …[intervenes].    The most important one was the fundamental rights had been encroached upon.    Of the company and the individuals in the company.  That wasa big argument that the attorneys had to use.    Then it was the timelines and the period of time that had lapsed from the initial investigation right to the prosecution.    That was to be raised.    The other thing to be raised was that the legal basis for the ongoing persecution, as he called it, and harassment.  So they were going to play that angle as well to say basically, you know, games are being played and …[intervenes].   This thing is being delayed and it has put a lot of pressure on people.    Then the relief sought, so in other words what, what the intention there was, was to say alright fine we are going to put it onto the NPA that they have messed up.  Now how are we going to resolve this issue going forward?  So they; that was the argument that was put forward and then the approach and the unethical conduct of the process was to be used as an argument as well in terms of pushing for the relief.    That was sought.    Chair all this handwriting is Richmond Mti.    Correct.    No, he wrote it in my presence.  The reason …[intervenes].    The reason being Chair I did not have my book and my pen with me.    Otherwise I would have written it down.    But he was sitting in his office at his desk and he decided to write it down.    The original possession is in a box with all the other original documents with the investigators.    That is correct.    Do you …[intervenes].?    Well this is post his meeting.  He told me were coming backfrom post his meeting with these ladies Nomgcobo Jiba and Jackie Lepinka.    That is correct.    As a matter of fact Chair for clarity purposes I was at one of the operations and he phoned me and said I must come and see him, because he does not like talking over the phone.    That is correct.    And at that stage I think Watson was in Port Elizabeth.  He could not make it up here.  So I went quickly to see him and to find out this, because he wanted a letter drafted urgently.    Attorneys.    And this should cover these aspects here.    Correct.    No there is another occasion.  There are …[intervenes].    There must be about 30/40 occasions that I went there.    And Gillingham, yes.   That is correct.    No, I have got is CV.    But I will check.    No, he is very well educated, but …[intervenes].    That is correct.    Correct.    This document was actually written by myself whilst I was on the phone to him.    To Mr Richmond Mti.  So a document was drafted by the attorneys and it is titled reasons for the state to provide and nolle prosequi on the Bosasa matter which I then sent through to him.  Well I took it through.  I did not send it through.  I actually physically took it through to him.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct, to the attorneys.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.   So these were the notes once I had given him the document that had been drafted by the attorneys.  These are the notes …[intervenes].    Which I …[intervenes].    Sorry.    That is correct.   So that he could read it before we sent it to the NPA.    Hm.    correct.    As well as to be able to take it and go and check it with his source in the NPA.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Okay.    This note was made after the conversation had taken place.  So this note …[intervenes].    About a day.    He had to go and see the people at the NPA with the note and he would come back to me and tell me when I could reach him again.    Extremely fresh.    So if I can just quickly go back in the previous one I think it was 557 is a note that is given to me by Richmond Mti.  I take that note and I go and explain it to the attorneys.  They draft me a letter.  Reasons to, not to prosecute Bosasa.   Why a nolle prosequi should be issued.    I take the note back to him.  I go through it with him.  I leave it with him, because he is then going to see the ladies, Jiba and Jackie.    I leave it with him.  I then phone him that evening and he says to me look I must come around the following morning.  So this note here emanates from the discussions that following morning.    So the following morning at 7 o’ clock I was at his house and we went through what he had written.  I had, I took a piece of paper from his photostat machine.    And I started writing down notes.   And he was …[intervenes].    Okay.    No.  This is …[intervenes].    No.   [Intervenes].    That is correct.    Normally I would write on blue paper, because I use a standard book.    I did not have the book with me.  I sat with him.  He had phoned me and that is maybe where the confusion comes in.    He said we cannot discuss it over the phone.  I must see him the next morning.   I was there the next morning.  We then sat across the table.  He issued me with a piece of paper so I could write things down.  I then wrote down everything, because he was not and apparently they were not happy with the letter that was drafted.    So he had comments on the letter which he did not give me.    He gave me the; he read out to me what needs to be added in.   So what needed to be added in is the fact that points one to five were critical.    Yes.  We had to draft representation to the NPA, but specifically to Jiba.    I cannot recall what SNS was.  I think it was one of the advocates we were using perhaps.    I cannot, I cannot remember who it was.    Must be addressed to Jiba we were told.    The second one is we need to challenge the SIU Report legalities.    Okay.  The third point was, because we now had to change this whole letter.    How do we deal with the allegations made by the sources and what is the source of the allegation.    The argument there was that in terms of the criminal case that was opened up there was no complainant’s statement by who was then the Acting Commissioner Jenny Schreiner.    Alright.  The third, the fourth thing was the, something to do with the Public Service Commission.  I cannot recall now.  The Auditor-General and a problem, because the SIU went to Parliament, Willie Hofmeyr went to Parliament and did not follow the process of first reporting it to the President as it, as it is in the SIU Code of Conduct or something.  The fifth thing was we had to make a big song and dance about the impact on families, lost business and that it was a political issue.    Then we had to, the smaller points there which are not the main points are what we needed to talk around in the letter to allude to it that there has been a persecution by the media.  That there has been lost business opportunities.  That there was not fairness because of the length of the process.  That we had lost outon international opportunities and that factually there were issues with regards to allegations and then also we had to talk about the quality of service, the savings we had generated as well if there was anything illegal why is it that the contracts would be re-awarded to Bosasa time and time again.    They wanted me to make mention of the Watson family and the history and then why is Government fighting the fight of losing bidders and that was regarding Royal Sechaba and Prilla.    Okay.   Well I was told, I was told categorically that this emanates, this advice emanates from the meeting that he had had with Jiba and after he had shown her the letter that we had produced from the attorneys.    At that stage he told me it was Jiba.    Yes, Chair.  Opposite Savannah Hills there is a shopping centre there.  That is where they met recently and prior to that they used to meet at Illovo.  I think it was the Thrupps Centre.  Somewhere convenient.  Those are the only two places I know of.    Well I am talking recently in 2016.    The status would be that they would still be paid.    Most definitely.   Sorry, where; sorry.    Thank you.    Yes I did and I handed it over the investigators.    The person speaking now?   Mokgwebi that is correct."So how are you going to protect them Mr President?  By putting the right person in there.  I do not know who is advising you Mr President, but you need to make the right decisions now, you have not got much time left.″That is how he talks to the President.  That is what he actually says and he does.    Well, the…[intervenes]    I think it was 2015, Chair, we just need to check.    I think it was 2015.    Yes, he said to him ″you do not have much time left″ meaning that he does not have much time in politics left or as President.  That is how he spoketo him.  Now we need to get our facts right, okay.  Sorry, Chair, I would have to read through it again and I would have to listen to it again.    So I do not think…[intervenes]    I do not think I have too much time.    I just do not want to be misquoted.    You know.    Alright.    I would rather, Chair, if you played it, stopped it, and I could tell you what was said.    Because otherwise I might just misconstrued what was being said.    If I say stop then I will explain what happens, if the, Chair…[intervenes]    Yes I will.    So if you will play it again.    What he is saying there is that Jeeb[?] is trying to close down the case, but Dramat is holding onto the docket.  So Dramat is not handing over the docket and because of that Jeeb cannot issue a nolle prosequi.  What he is then saying is that he is saying that the person who is controlling the whole process is Breytenbach and he does not want to implicate Willie, ″because Breytenbach and Willie still talk as well to each other, Mr President, it is a fact, and he repeats, I want to say that.  He says Willie is sitting on the fence Mr President″ and carried on.    Good.    I am sure you might have heard that.  He is saying ″Willie is sitting on the fence, wherever he goes I can talk to you about this Mr President.″   I think there you hear clearly he says ″I want to get the facts.  I have got people working at Umhlamenza and I just want to get the facts.″  What he is referring to there is often he would request me to draw up an organogram or a spidergram showing various factions within the ANC and the political overview of the ANC and the country and where the attacks were coming from.    So these would be, this is what he was instructing me to do.   Thank you. [Listening to audio]    I think that is self explanatory.  I think it is much clearer now as well.    Sorry, Chair, is there anything I need to explain?    That is correct, Chair.    Chair, at that stage he was asking Richmond Mti if Mti knew if Jiba got a letter of appointment.    Yes.    What I was asking Gavin to explain to Richmond Mti was how he had arranged with various other people in I do not know who, he would not reveal to me who he was dealing with in the HAWKS and in the legislature and wherever he was dealing with people.  He had arranged to move people around in government.    No, I was asking him to explain to Richmond Mti what he had done by moving people around.    Correct.    No, Chair, those are people in the HAWKS and in senior government positions.    Chair,…[intervenes]    Chair, I said the other morning here…[intervenes]    That even the poor Pope could get corrupted.    Well he had people moved around government.  I mean when Vernie Petersen was moved by Sibeko, Siapela arranged that.    Yes, but there are many instances where people were moved around.    Correct.   All I was told, Chair, is that he had moved people around, he had to make sure that Smith and the investigators that were on the case were taken off the case.  How he did that, who he spoke to I do not know.    Chair, I am here telling you the truth.    I have exposed everything that I know.  I have exposed myself to South Africa.  I am not about to tell you a lie.    I cannot tell you who he used to move people around.    But I do know that he is influential and he had people moved around and that is what he was telling Mti at that stage.    That is correct.    Correct.   Yes.    Have you, yes.    Him is Richmond Mti.    Correct.    I am asking Gavin ″have you explained to Mti what you have caucused.″    That is correct.    Chair, there is one issue that I would just like to mention in 36.1.  I believe Jumbo Liquors changed their name to Captain Liquor.  I actually was informed yesterday evening by somebody who sent me a photograph and apparently that specific one has become a Captain Liquor so if the go there to look for the place itwill be Captain Liquor.    Just for clarity purposes.    In terms of – I think we have covered the various mechanisms you are right adv Pretorius to go through it again.    Correct.    Kgwetlo events was a hiring marquee, hiring company.  Brown Gwebo actually owned Kgwetlo, used to work together with us.  He was responsible for Gorano and then he passed on and it was decided through Carlos Bonafacio and the accountants that they would continue using Kgwetlo events tofilter cash through.    Correct.    Correct.    They did.    Well at this stage I started working very closely with Andries van Tonder who was the CFO of the group and he indicated to me, because at first I knew there were cash, I did not know how they were getting it out, but heindicated to me that this had been the practice for quite some time and he also indicated to me that the cash was generated in the various, you know, that is how I got to know about it, he explained to me that the cash had been generated through various other sources of income and he gave me the load down on it.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    And then one question in relation to that conversation, the transcript that you have testified to the roleplay conversation.    Yes.    It is actually recorded on a date when they verified it.  I think it was 2015 and I think it was just before the President visited Bosasa if I am notmistaken.    That is correct, yes.    Sorry?    No he visited Bosasa and then went to Russia.    Correct.    Oh, yes.    Danny Mansell was a previous partner as you know of Gavin Watson and in 2012 Danny was the link man between Mti, between Gillingham, to a degree Mti and Gavin.  So he was the guy who would write up the specifications, send them to me, go and market and he was the one who first really got involved with the whole Correctional Services thing.So during 2012 I think it was a report was given back to parliament on the Bosasa investigation by Willie Hofmeyr, I am not exactly sure of the date, Chair, but I remember we watched this movie playing out together with Willie Hofmeyr giving the report on rugby tickets and it was a big story and you know the next morning Danny Mansell I think appeared at my office who was extremely nervous, and I would    Yes, I called him, he insisted I called him and Watson did notreally want to deal with him, but he had to come to the office so he had to deal with him and he basically told me listen you just sort out everything you and Andries, fund the process, get him overseas, make him disappear.  Not in the sense that disappear, you know, not the Italian sense, but just get out of our way.So basically we had to do everything for Danny Mansell to move him out of the country.  And then Danny confided in me personally about the nature of Gavin.  I do not think it is necessary to go in there, but they had been working for quite some time together, many years ago they had both been involved with the small business development corporation and there was issues there as well.So the following was agreed with Gavin Watson and obviously every single thing we did we agreed with him.  We made sure that we had an agreement in place.  We spoke about it, there were not only two people, there were three, four people that knew about it.  So the instruction was to relocate Danny to the USA.  Bosasa would pay 7 000 US Dollars per month to Danny Mansell for as long as he was alive and stayed in the USA.So and did not divulge any details of Bosasa and that was the rule.  That if you, you get 7 000 US Dollars a month, but you do not talk about Bosasa and you do not come back into this country and you just stay away.  So he would invoice us on a monthly basis and I do not know if advocate, I do not want to take over, but there is a copy of an invoice and letters and that.  He would invoice on a monthly basis.    Okay, so we would get invoices, I would have to sign it off and I would also have to sign off his residency application in America as well.    Correct if you go to page 569, I can refer you to…[intervenes]    Just after the transcript.    Alright, so I would then make sure that he got his green card and all the information that he required.    On page 569 you will find the email from Danny Mansell.    To myself with an invoice for 7 000 US Dollars.   And it says at the bottom consulting for CCTV and system integration.    Well yes, because he did not do any work.    Correct.   Correct and that was his agreement that he had with Gavin Watson.  Our responsibility was to effect the 7 000 Dollars payment.    Correct.    That is correct.    Okay, so Mansell then provided me with the documentation I had to sign and agree to in order to facilitate his residency program in America, his application.  A meeting was then held with Gillingham, Gavin Watson was there andmyself and I was tasked to take over the role that Mansell had played with Gillingham.    Excuse me?    Correct.  This is when Mansell left.    I am well aware of that, Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZ:  And that is what needs to be paid. 
MR PAUL AGRIZZI:    After that meeting Chair it would be openly discussed each one – what each one was getting.  But the decision discussions I have – I was outside at the moment while they decided on the initial amounts.    Dealings yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    Not at this meeting no.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    I was not there when they decided the amounts that is correct.    That is correct.    Yes most definitely Chair.    Yes.    Chair you are correct.  That was the words used by Gavin Watson “sort out” so everybody adopted that “sort out” he would – that was used.    Yes that is why I have put it in inverted commas.    No it was used by Mr Gavin Watson.   Those were the words used.    They – what I am trying to explain Chair is that if Gavin says “we got to sort someone out” then Mti would say “we got to sort someone out”.  So that was the words used by Mti, by Gavin, by myself when somebody needed to get paid cash.    That is correct.    Well if I can go through 35.2 and it explains it.    They were given cash basically.  But Mti would tell us that he met weekly with the persons whom he gave code names to.  So he gave each person a code name so that they would not be compromised.  So he called Nomgcobo Jiba ‘Snake’ because she was very alert and the reason why when I asked him is because she was always poised to strike and ready to be on the offensive all the time and she was poison.  Then he referred to Jackie.    She was like poison, potent, strong.    So then he used the name ‘Jay’ for Jackie, he just called her Jay.   Lepinka.  That is correct Chair.    Then he used the word ‘snail’ for Lawrence Mrwebi because he said he was slow and his words to me was very lethargic.  He will not get anything done but he is there.  So I am not being facetious I am telling you.    I am telling you why he used those code names.    And what he explained to me.    So it was Snake for Nomgcobo Jiba, Snail for Mrwebi and Jay for Jackie.    Okay.  So at these meetings they would provide him with detailedstatuses of the investigation and the prosecution.  Now one thing I must mention Chair for clarity purposed is that he never ever mentioned that Mrwebi was at the meeting.  He mentioned the ladies were with me.    On the telephone.  So on the telephone he would say to me the ladies were with me.  Referencing because one day I asked him.  He said the reference was to Jackie and to – well Jay and Snake who were with.    So Jackie and Nomgcobo Jiba was with him.  That is what he told me.   And that is what he told Watson.  And they would then give us updates, very accurate updates because two lots of updates would come to us and one update was from him and it was always accurate and basically in return for that they received the cash on the monthly basis.  So the – that is how it worked.    And this went on since I think it was 2010.    Snake would get R100 000,00.      Per month.    J would get R20 000,00 per month and Snail would getR10 000,00 per month.  That is the amounts that were paid.    Chair I asked.    I asked the same question and the answer that was given to me is that she is far more active than him.  And she is far more important than him.  Because as long as he got his R10 000,00 a month he was happy, he was calm and he wouldnot interfere in anything.  He would let Jiba run with it.    That is the answer I got.    Chair I just want to clarify.  I did some of these deliveries a month to Mti.  That explains it I think.  I know about every single delivery that took place.  The last lot of deliveries which took place in December I actually refused to do and Gavin Watson …[intervenes].    2016 correct.  I refused to do them.  I had the packages with me and I just said that is it I am not doing this anymore and that was on the 15 December – sorry on the 19 December 2016.  I then fell ill and when I came out of hospital eventually Gavin Watson came to fetch that delivery, the last delivery for Mti, Snake, Jand Snail.    With exception of Mti but the others – the three did not get paid for the meeting no.  The meeting suggested that they be paid.    You know Chair when I left I had – everything was taken away.  My books, everything.  So I cannot recall the exact date.    Chair that is – you know I had met Mti before.    At his house but that was when this was discussed.    I was not at the delivery to the three persons at the NPA Chair.    That is correct.    Well at one stage because of all the stories with the NPA and that Gillingham was extremely anxious about these arrangements that were going on there and he was concerned about the NPA processes and that and what he was he – I actually got to a stage where I did not want to talk him because he was so nervous and I actually asked Gavin Watson to speak to him – that said to him – and he told him he has got everything under control and explained that he had personally spoken to everybody.  He was with Mti at the moment and everything – the NPA was under control, everything was sorted out.  That is what that reflects.    Correct.    That is correct Chair and how I knew that they were receiving it was because Mti would tell me that.    And also he had given me documents from them directly.    So – because I had that information I trusted him and I trusted that he would not lie.   That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct Chair.    If I may also add Chair he would often phone them in my presence.  So I would hear him talking to them.    And there is one incident where we were actually discussing the matter and there was handwritten notes where he was on the line and he was busy writing down notes as well.  So that he submitted as well.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I am just skimming through it Chair.  These would not have been part of the payment list as far as I can see with the exception of 137 – 137 Mabena.     Was responsible for development and care which oversees the catering contract for Correctional Services.    That is correct.    In addition to her role she would have had to sit on the bid evaluation committee.    Well she got paid every month.    The bribe money.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It was extremely useful Chair because you could from this information actually go and interview the witnesses and quite simply you will see later on in my statement and in the other witnesses it is very easy to manipulate when you have wads of cash especially witnesses.  So what would happen is very simple.  These names, these lists of names would be approached and they would have to change their statements.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    But I do not think it is necessary.    It is correct.    That is correct.    Most definitely.    Let me explain it and give you the context of this document.      This document was drafted and done by Advocate De Kock.    But I want to make it very clear Chair that we have never dealtwith Advocate De Kock.  Advocate De Kock was never involved in trying to stymie it.  This document was created because she was given an instruction which I know of because the big thing here was the fruit of the poison tree.  Now I am not a – I am not a legal expert at all but what I can explain is that this document was drafted via Mti’s request to Advocate Jolingana to give us an overview of how to shut down the case.  She must have contacted De Kock who then gave it to her.  Which is why De Kock authored this document.  I can only – I can only assume unfortunately that that is how this document came out but I have gone through this document so many times and it is quite clear that the document that was given us because we needed to know how do we go about closing down this case.  And that is why it is important just now to refer to the handwritten notes because that further collaborates this document over here.  But this is extremely useful in assisting us in – and the attorneys in not only closing down the case but kicking it into touch so that it would never reappear.    Yes Chair.    So we were getting documents and having meetings with Mti on a regular basis Chair.    What would happen is we would always say to him “well what do you want us to do, what is the next step?”   Alright so Gavin wanted it clear and concise.  He wanted me after every single meeting to get hold of the attorney – our attorney and go and see the attorney and if need be senior counsel and tell them exactly what transpired and give them copies of this document.  So all – Chair this is a small reflection of what is actually is available because I could not get – they were all at the office.    And they still presumably at the office.    But the fact of the matter is that they would then give us advice and who better to ask for advice on how to close down a case but the investigator officer or the prosecutor that is handling that case.  Without letting them know so you cannot say well the Bosasa case but give me a case similar and tell me what the risks are?  And that is how this document emanates and that is how the document comes to us.  But I in no way can implicate Advocate De Kock because I know for a fact thatwhenever whoever tried to get hold of her she was – she would not come forward with any information and she was kind of beyond reproach.  However if I raise this document it is going to make her look as if she is involved which she is not.  To my knowledge.    I just wanted to clear that up.    Correct.    What do you want us to do?    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair that is correct.  What I am explaining is that that document was – emanates from De Kock and there is no doubt about it however …    It was not given to us freely.  It was given to Jiba, Mrwebi or Jackie those are the only people I know.  Snake, snail and Jay.  It was given to them who then passed it onto Mti.    So this talks about similar cases.   No not only Bosasa.    It gives you an overview and what must have happened is they have said to her “give us an overview of how – what is the situation in the case?    Do you understand?    I know the – I know the document pretty well.    Yes.    So it does not refer specifically to the case but use this case studies.    Not in my – not in my opinion.    Correct.    And this then was being passed onto the attorneys and the senior counsel to deal with.    Correct.    That is correct and it is especially marked Taverner I think it refers to as well.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.   I was given this document and I – if I recall correctly we used some of the information here to challenge the subpoenas that were issues by – to Mark Taverner.    Will do.    Well on the 8 May I think it was when Ms Jiba was suspended or they were compromised.  In the media there was a big story about it and Gavin insisted that we go and see Richmond Mti at his house that morning.  And it was quite an early morning so we drove – we drove through there and at the meeting Gavin Watson emphasised that both Mti and Jiba were compromised and that Bosasa was at risk.  He made a proposal on how it should be handled and he was going to go and see the President soon so he made – he did a role play.  He sat down Mti and he said to him “let me explain to you now what I am going to do and I will tell you how to handle it going forward.”  And his words to me – and his words were “we will tell the Presidentwhat to do and how to sort these things out because it was getting a bit much.”    He was talking to Richmond Mti and he was referring to the ex President Zuma.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Well he had arranged the visit already so it was going to happen.  He was just telling – he was just telling Richmond Mti what he was going to do at the visit.    That is correct.    If I might just add he had that type of relationship with the President where he could tell the President what to do.  It was frequent.   Yes.  So he would visit the President quite regularly.  I remember the very first visit to Nkandla he told me what a mess it was in terms of the building and that and that it should not have cost R250 million and then he went on about having breakfast with Lady 1, Lady 2, Lady 3, Lady 4 there. The President’s wives.  That he would have to have breakfast at every single lady.    Which one?  The …    Oh this conversation.  Yes it was.    Oh sorry.  Sorry Chair.    I recorded it.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    No this was an extra special meeting because he had heard viasomeone else that there was a problem and that they were going to prosecute.    Yes.    Sorry that is Gavin Watson.      Richmond Mti.    Is myself.    Correct.    That is correct.   That is correct Chair.    And that is correct and such representations were made.    That is correct.    In terms of this inquiry I do not think we need to go there.    That is correct.    Correct.    Very seldom.CHAIRPERSON   Very distinct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well Jiba basically wanted to get the docket and Anwar Dramat would not release the docket because she wanted to close it up. That is what was told to us.    Well are we – sorry I just want to double check are we on page 562?    Okay the next sentence is then he talks and he says well then Jiba took De Kock off the case.  Now you must remember that he would have got his information from another source as well.  So somebody else has informed him on exactly where the process is at.    Correct.  Other than Mti and other than Jiba.    So he has got other information which he has got.  He says then Jiba would – he explained that Jiba had tried to take De Kock off.    That is the same De Kock.  That is why I said earlier that we needto be very wary because.    Not a problem.  But then De Kock came back on.  So he is referring to the 2012 matter where De Kock goes off the case and she comes back on.  Smuggled back onto this case he says.  So he – he has this conspiracy theory that Glynnis Breytenbach wanted De Kock on the case because she could control De Kock and De Kock could basically prosecute successfully Bosasa.    That is – that is correct.    So he says now the transcript is wrong here it says now I do not want to implicate Willie because Breytenbach and Willie still talk well Mr President.  So what he was saying was that Willie Hofmeyr and Breytenbach still have a relationship.  But he does not want to implicate Willie Hofmeyr in this whole thing.  It is a fact okay I want to say that.  Okay.    Yes.    That is correct.   As a matter of fact I think this was two or three days before the meeting.    Alright and it was before the visit to Bosasa I think by the President.    But Chair what he then says is – where it says “now they implicate” that actually is I do not want to implicate Willie because Breytenbach andWillie still talk.    That is correct.    It is a fact.  Okay.  So he then carries on and he says “you know I know that Willie is sitting on the fence and I know that he has done things for you Mr President” and he is specifically saying that to everybody, myself and Richmond Mti there.  He says “whatever – wherever he goes I can talk to you about this.”  So the role play that took place was to say “Mr President you have got a problem.  You have not got much time left.  You need to sort this problem out.  You need to get Jiba on board or you need to get Mtlemza on board or you need to get some lady from KZN on board.    No Umthlameza.    No.  I do not know what Hlamanza is.  No it is – here on the recording you heard the words Ntlamenaa.  So I have got people at Ntlemeza.    Well I – Chair to be franc with you I think what we should do is get a transcript done, a rescript done.  Because…    I am not registered as a transcriber.    Yes.    Ntlameza.      And he refers to that because he does have people well all over including there.  I have Ntlemeza working on their side so that I can get that right and I want to – what he was trying to get across or say is I want to say to people that this is a Breytenbach issue.  All she wants to do is discredit us as Bosasa in the paper so that when this thing comes up and our agreements with Correctional Services and the banks and everything else our overdraft facilities when they come up they throw this thing in the press.  So what he was saying was that when this issue comes up every time our overdraft facilities are renewed or banking facilities are renewed then something will pitch up the press and he was convinced that this was being caucused by Breytenbach and by the likes of Naddie Kirsh and the Stellenbosch Grouping to try and bring down Bosasa and the Watsons.  So then he says who is calling it up in thepress for they want something to stick to discredit us in the press.  So then he goes    Yes.   That is right.      I have not got a clue where that comes from.    C-h-a-u-k-e.    Well I do not know why he said that or that but that is what it is on the tape.    One of them got a goose.  I think one them has got to move.  I need to listen to it again but it is definitely one of them has got a goose.  Not one of that.  Well look at what has happened to Jiba.  Jiba is buggered up in the press.  He told me that.  He is now referring to Zuma.  Zuma told him Jiba is buggering up in thepress.  He said “Jiba is his person”, President’s person.  “Okay tell me must I ask” then
