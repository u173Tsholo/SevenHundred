CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Myburgh.  Good morning everybody.       Yes? ADV MYBURGH     Ja-no, that is in order.  If it is going to be convenient to speak from there, that is fine but otherwise, they can sanitise the podium and you go there.  You can choose which one suits you, Mr Van Zyl.  But then...     Yes.  The mic would need to put on.  Yes.     Yes.  The registrar will take that.  May I ask you to speak up a little bit.  I think your voice is soft.  Maybe it is because I think you are not short and the mic is far from your mouth.  [laughs]     Yes.  No, that is fine.  I guess that technically insofar as the right to cross-examine that Bombardier had been granted and the right to adduce certain evidence is concerned, I guess technically what you are asking for is, for leave not to proceed with the cross-examination and not to proceed to adduce evidence.     Because if it was before those rights were granted, the you could withdraw the application ...[intervenes]      ...for leave to cross-examine.  You could withdraw the application for leave to adduce evidence.  So now that those were granted already, technically, you are simply asking for leave not to pursue the cross-examination and not to proceed with the leading of evidence in terms of that order.     Yes.     Yes.  No, that is fine.  In regard to the request not to pursue cross-examination and not to proceed to adduce evidence, I have no difficulty granting leave.   In regard to whether, as you say, whether the correct terminology, withdraw or abort or whatever the affidavits that had already been lodged with the Commission, that might be more complicated than the other because, to the extent that the affidavits are already in the Commission.   It may well be that one cannot say they should be taken away from the Commission, as it were, but it may well be that the new owners of Bombardier might, before the Commission completes its work, having had the chance to look at those affidavits, they might communicate with the Commission to say, if that is the position, to say those affidavits should not be seen as presenting the current owners’ views or position of the current owners.   So all I am simply saying is.  I am not in a position to immediately say I grant leave for you to take the affidavits away because it might need more thinking.  But what I think you might need to do is just reflect on how it should be done.   Maybe you might communicate with the Legal Team of the Commission and maybe, ultimately, there might be, subsequent to publication, to deal with the situation.   Then I can apply my mind more fully because in effect that is evidence that has already been placed before the Commission.  It is just that it is writing, it is not oral evidence but nevertheless it is evidence that has been placed before the Commission.   So I would say.  Reflect on it to the extent that you may need to reflect on it.  Communicate with the Commission’s Legal Team and at the right stage, then maybe something can be communicated to me and then I can ultimately indicate what my final position would be.  Is that fine?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  It may well be that all that might need to be done is that when the report is prepared, it should be stated on record that these were affidavits that were filed at a certain time.   And that there was a request to – at this time to take them out or whatever the terminology is, once there were new owners.  So that whatever is made of them, is made in the context of whoever were the owners at the time.   So but you will get a chance to reflect and then indicate what your submissions would be.     Okay alright.  Thank you very much.  I think then – I have granted leave in regard to two matters and the other one is just left pending because it needs further consideration.  Ja, okay.       Thank you.     Thank you.  Anyone who wishes to be excused, is excused.       Okay.  Take this until I am told I need it.     Yes, Mr Soni.   Good morning and good morning everybody.  Good morning Mr Sacks.     Thank you.     Yes.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Yes-no, that is fine.     No, that will be in order.  Ja.     I am sorry.  Where are we going to resume from on...[intervenes]      Nine...?     Okay.     Okay, nine, zero, two.  Okay thank you.     Yes, I still have.     H’m?     Page 1?  Okay.      H’m.     H’m.  I’ve got it.       H’m.     H’m.     Creditors.  [laughs]  Ja.     I agree.     Certain recipients.     Ja, ja.     Yes?     They were quite busy on the 9 t h of April, right?     [laughs]     Yes.     I am sorry, Mr Soni.     Do I have that page that document you were reading from?     I think we should get it, Mr Soni, and it could be admitted as an exhibit.     Yes, ja.    Ja, that is fine.     Yes, yes, no, no, that is fine.  I think it is important.     Ja, ja.     Yes.  Ja, ja, ja.     953.     And I think you said yesterday but you will tell me if I misunderstood, I think – and you said yesterday for really doing nothing.     Other than being the middleman.       Yes.     I am sorry, Mr Soni.  Can I ask this question?  And your being an account and a forensic might enable you to answer it.  What are the chances that the price for the locomotives that was quoted to PRASA was inflated in order to make provision for amounts that would have to be paid to the middleman by Vossloh?  In other words, I do not see that if I am going to manufacture trains to sell to him if their true price is R100 then my profit is provided there, that if I allow you to be middleman, I am going to still quote R100 especially if your commission is going to be quite substantial, it looks like I would have to inflate the prices so as to accommodate what I must pay and still make a reasonable profit.  In terms of your own experience, in terms of your analysis, is that something you are able to answer even if not definitively but in terms of probabilities based on your experience?     Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine.  It may well be that trying to establish what similar trains may have been sold for are elsewhere by Vossloh or by its competitors at that time may help to say – because, as I see it, if Swifambo had no previous experience of in this sector or maybe in any sector, in this sector, maybe whatever prices they quoted were based on what Vossloh may have told them because they just – they knew they were going to get them from Vossloh.       Yes but obviously the responsibility to act in the best interest of PRASA started with the people who agreed to the price at PRASA.     What homework did they do before they agreed to the price, was this the going rate, you know, did they compare with other manufacturers internationally or whatever or did they just take whatever price was quoted to them by Swifambo?  So it would interesting – I mean, I do not know if you have worked out what percentage of the whole amount paid by PRASA for these trains went to Swifambo in terms of all these amounts including those that may have gone to Siyagena and so on.  What percentage in the end …[intervenes]     Sorry?     Ja, Swifambo, I think I saw in one of the pages some money that came from Vossloh Kiepe or something.     Going to Siyagena.     No, ja, I mean Siyaya.  Well, Mr Soni knows that for quite some time I kept on confusing Siyaya and Siyagena.  Ja, so it would be interesting to see what percentage went to – ended up with Vossloh, what percentage ended up with Swifambo or Mabunda and other people connected with Swifambo.     Ja, it would be interesting to know what price Vossloh would have quoted if they were dealing with PRASA directly.     Ja, ja, ja.  Okay, alright.     It is very worrying when people are appointed to important State Entities like PRASA, they are in high positions, they get paid quite well to look after the interests of the entity, but by the way this contract was handled it does look like the interest of PRASA were subsidiary to something else.     It is very worrying.     No, no I am done.     Do we know Mr Soni whether in the light of the High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal judgments against Swifambo, which have been there for some time.  The Siyaya one is rescinded.      The Siyangena one ja.  Whether government or PRASA has done anything to try and recover some of the money it has lost through the this conduct from its officials who makes certain decisions which appear to have either at best for them reckless or grossly negligent or may well have been because of some other agenda.   Do we know whether anything has been done by other than attempts to gain from I mean Swifambo was ...[indistinct].     H’m, h’m, because how much of the money that PRASA did pay out at some stage has come back?     Sorry?       Ja, obviously that is a far cry from the ...[intervenes]      From the billions ja, that were paid out.   I think that the entity should be looking at investigating the possibility of suing everyone who may have made decisions that resulted in these losses in circumstances where those individuals are not able to give proper explanations for their decisions.     That is true, and any of those officials, any of those officials who is able to place before PRASA or before – let’s start with PRASA, before PRASA evidence that there was nothing wrong with the decisions they took and PRASA is satisfied that is fine, they don’t have to be sued you know but if they don’t put that before PRASA and they are sued they can place that before the Court but they can explain to PRASA to say well I made this decision, these decisions on the basis of this information and it seems to me it was a reasonable decision to make under the circumstances but if their explanations are not satisfactory then PRASA could consider suing them.     Ja, because this is a lot of taxpayers’ money.     Yes, I mean I think yesterday Mr Sacks referred to a page in the course of his evidence a page in the report which reflects that a certain Ms Casa I think ...[intervenes]      Wrote emails to Mr ...[indistinct] and Mr Montana warning them about certain datas in relation to computing this contract if I am not mistaken.     Yes, yes.  Okay.     Let us take the tea break, we will resume, it is twenty past, we will resume at twenty five to twelve.     We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.     I didn’t say this when we started Mr Sacks but I just mention it now that the oath you took yesterday continues to apply.     Yes, okay.     Is it possible to have a page somewhere that just records that …[intervenes].     No, what I’m thinking is, if you lead him, which you must do, one will see that in the transcript but when one is looking in the Bundle one might not …[intervenes].     So, it might be helpful to have a page, maybe even if it’s at the end that says, in his report at page what, what, what this is what it says but actually it’s not correct, this is the correct position.     Sorry Mr Soni you say, at what?     Okay ja, if you could just mention the page number together with the paragraphs that will help.     Yes, okay, alright.          It would be good to get that information to see at what – as from what date he ceased to be a Director.     Okay, alright.     Does paragraph 14.10.5 which is based on Mr Mamabolo’s affidavit which says that Mr Buthelezi, the former Chairperson of PRASA Board, if an essential link is – which has – it says has a 55% in Sibenza Holding does that mean that even though he may have resigned as a Director of Sibenza at some stage throughout the time of this Swifambo transaction, while he was Chairperson of the Board, he had this connection with Hadis that has 55% shareholding on Sibenza, do we know that?     Something further.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja, and I guess if the police can do it, the Commission could do it as well in terms of issuing a summons to produce documents, ja.  Okay, alright, I interrupted you Mr Soni.     I guess, just for the transcript, Mr Soni, for those who read afterwards when you said page 873 of the report, it’s 873 of the Bundle.     The page for the report will be, not that…[intervenes].     Yes.     Ja that’s fine.     Ja, that’s fine, thank you.     Yes, obviously she was very troubled by the intelligence report that she says – intelligence information that she says she had received about Swifambo Rail Leasing and she asked for – to be afforded more time to look into whatever was said in that intelligence information and she says, in effect, if we don’t follow up this intelligence information that failure will sink the organisation and should the intelligence report prove true, we need immediate intervention as the Board.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.    Lindikyaha Zide, I assume is the one that at some stage became a company secretary and at some stage Acting Group Chief Executive …    Officer.    And siphiso@makana.co.za that seems to be the same email address that we associate with Mr Sifiso Buthelezi in the previous email.      Yes, okay.  So it’s two, about two weeks after the first email.    Okay.      So in terms of the last part of her email, it would appear that he had not, she had not, that is Dr Bridgette Gasa, she had not received information that she had requested with regard to this transaction.   Whether she is talking about information she may have previously requested from Mr Chris Mbatha or she is talking about the information that she may have requested from Mr Montana or Mr Buthelezi.   One might not be sure.  But it’s clear that she was, she had been seeking confirmation.  She of, she had been seeking certain information about this transaction.      And she says she had not received a response.  And it is clear from this email that her concerns include the capacity of Swifambo in terms of this project.  Is that right?    Because I think in the email she refers to capacity does she not?    Yes she does.      Second paragraph of the second email, there are concerns that have been raised around this particular entity and the subject is the follow up on the Swifambo Rail Leasing.   “There are concerns that have been raised around this particular entity and the FCIP is needing you to confirm that indeed a capacity check was properly done in relation to this contract.  And that you have satisfied yourselves that the necessary checks and balances have been done.” That is an important issue she was raising and of course now that we know what we know, if they had taken heed of her concerns, maybe PRASA and …[indistinct] would not have lost the kind of money they lost, but obviously.    So that, that is quite important.  Well it’s, it’s, it may well be that it might be important to explore the possibility of calling her.  Because she might be able to tell the Commission much more in terms of …    What were other issues that she raised in the discussions at board level.  And again of course Mr Montana should be coming in due course.  But Mr Buthelezi looks like would need to come as well.      [Indistinct] or how, what he did or didn’t do in response to these concerns when we now know that Swifambo had not checked records.  And …[indistinct] deal with these matters.  Yes.    Ja.  That ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  But slightly different.  But same thing, but slightly different approach.  Rather than saying will you tell us, I would say somebody must try and reach her over the phone and say, this is what emerges and we would like to you, would like an affidavit for you and we would like to prepare it for you.   And have a zoom consultation.  You will tell us all that you can share with the Commission about the concerns you had, that you raised, how did everybody respond to them?   The discussions at board level and on the day that it was approved by the board, what were the discussions?  I take it if we do not already have minutes of the board meetings at value when they approve …    We should try and get there.    So as to see whether the whole thing just was point of emotions or whether there was a serious and proper consideration of the, of the issues that she may have been there and she could know.   So if she gives all the information she knows, then somebody within the legal team can prepare that affidavit then send.  It might be a matter of – within a week we might have …    An affidavit from her.  So ja, it is the same thing, just …    Ja.  Ja, okay.      Ja, no, no.  These email are very critical.  Or all those that – ja, they were directed to him and it may well be that in ordinary things, certain board meetings, she raised the same issues so everybody who was a board member knew what the issues were.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  I mean one of the, one of the things that the Commission is going to, is looking at with regard to SOEs is where boards of SOE did not do their job, or what must be done, and was it a matter of incompetence or it be that the board or some members of the board were party to some agenda which was against the interests of the entity.   But also its, it’s important because it may well be that I could consider that subject to issues of prescription and so one, and you know the entities should seal them.      [Indistinct] whatever they can recover of the tax payer ’s money.    And also the Commission will have need to look at what qualities should people who get appointed as directors of these SOEs have.   And because it must be people who have integrity and it must be people who are prepared to make decisions that are in the best interest of the entity and not other decisions.   I mean an obvious thing with regard to this is, when the board approved this, what information did they have before them which indicated that Swifambo was an entity that could be given this kind of contract.    What did they know about this entity?    You know you cannot just make a decision without doing, getting certain, certain amount of homework to be done.    But clearly when it is not your money …    You are supposed to look after the public, after public money.  So we have got to look at all those things, because there ought to be some change in how things are done in these SOEs going forward.   And this Commission is in a position to come up with recommendations to say, going forward these are the things that should take.  Then it is up to the President if …[indistinct] the recommendations or not, but the Commission has a duty to look at why certain things happened at SOEs and what should be done to make sure they don’t happen again.      Ja.    I have noted …[indistinct].    Maybe before you proceed, let me just get this qualification Mr Sacks.  Is it correct to say when one looks at what one can call your findings in your report, one should limit one to the flow of funds section, because whatever came before that was just the background that would make the flow of fund, transaction understandable.  Is that correct?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  And of course part of that is why I am raising that, is that you will remember yesterday we – I tried to establish what was preliminary and what was not preliminary in your report.   And you, you did say the report was a draft preliminary report.  But you did say there are parts of the report which reflect your findings.  And I think what you are saying is that your findings are only those that relate to the flow of funds.   And I guess that because if the, if, if money did leave account A and went to account B, there’s not going to change as that is final.      Yes, yes.  Okay.  Alright.    No, that’ fine.     Okay.    Are we using red numbers here?    Okay.  Yes you may proceed.     Page 159 hey.    214.1.    Okay, alright.  I have got it.      Please just repeat the page Mr Soni?    Yes.     Yes.     No, I wanted to make sure that if possible, we adjourn for lunch only when you are done with him.      You are done, ja.  Thank you very much Mr Sacks for coming to assist the Commission.  Should the need arise we will ask you to come back, but we hope that or you will, you may have to come back because you have some homework to do for us.  So but some of the homework maybe might be supplementary after this is filed with the Commission without the need for you to come back for oral evidence, but I have no doubt that we have, if we do need you, you will avail yourself.     Thank you very much for assisting us.    We are going to take the lunch adjournment then and then we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn.   INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon.     Again.  Are you ready?     Okay alright.     Next witness?     Okay.  Registrar, please administer the oath.  Thank you Mr Muller for coming to assist the Commission.     Thank you.  You may be seated Mr Muller.        Thank you Mr Cilliers.  Yes.     As you answer, face this side Mr Muller.     I am sorry.  What is the page? 161?     161, that is where it starts?     Okay thank you.     Did you sign one affidavit in December or did you sign two?     I understood you earlier on that one, you lodged the complaint with the Hawks in May 2020.  Is that correct?     And then the Hawks initiated a meeting that they wanted more information and this was in December.     And then you have told me that the Hawks were contact with the forensic investigator that you had used and the comprehensive affidavit was prepared.  I think you say in mid-December if I am not mistaken.     Yes.  So I just want to find out whether it is one affidavit that you signed in connection with this matter in December or is two affidavits in December?     It is only one?     Okay alright.   And between May and December 2020 when the Hawks asked for more information, had you been informed who at the Hawks would be responsible for investigating the matter? MR     Yes.     Yes, but in terms of who the – who was in charge of the docket as well as the investigation, were you told, do you know, between May 2020 and December?     Trollip?     Oh, okay.  You understood him to be the investigating officer or not necessarily?     He conducted the ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Okay alright.     Did you say one, six, seven?     Okay.  Yes, you may continue.     [No audible reply]      It looks like it does that with recognising and then the recognition gets withdrawn later on because with the Commission too he received Regulation 10.6 Directive.  He complied and filed an affidavit.  But it was only after he had received a summons that he seized to recognise processes coming from the Commission.     Ja, okay.     Okay, thank you.     I do not think we can include as an annexure to the report but I think what you mean is put it immediately after the report.     It would still be a standalone document.     But it will be immediately after the report.     Ja, ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja, okay, that is fine.     I am sorry, Mr Soni, I thought I heard where you were but I think – I thought you went to page 3 of the notes.     Page 5 of the notes?     Oh, okay.     Hang on, I must also clarify, you said the first page of these notes would be 171.1?     Okay and then it goes on.     Ja, okay, alright, so you are on the last page.     Ja.  Let me just get that one.  So the property you were talking about is – I think you might have to just go back to that question about I think the property and 5 million.     Let me start - start by identifying the payment you are asking him about.     Which payment?     Report, ja.     5.2.3.6?     5.2…?     You know when you have got so many things they got confusing.  I have got 5.2 and then I have got …[intervenes]     Oh what is the page number of the bundle first, to make sure I am …     163?     Okay, right and the …[intervenes]     I can that, ja.     Oh, that is – I thought that is the last one on the first set of …[intervenes]     Ja.  Okay, alright, but that is the one you are talking about.     So it is a payment of R5 million.     Paid from Swifambo Rail Leasing to Sterlings Living.     Okay, alright, now I know which payment you are asking about, then you can continue.     Okay.     Yes, yes.  Ja, no, no.  Yesterday I think we understood that it was for the kitchen.     Ja.     Ja.     The house, the property itself, is it owned by Mr Mabunda or by an entity controlled by him or is it a rented house?     Oh, okay, okay.  Alright.     I assume that that means you have not seen the actual lease because otherwise you would know who the lessor is.     Okay, no, that is fine.     Okay, Mr Soni, I am trying to make sure we are on the same page.     Where is that reflected, is it still 163?     Okay, alright.     162?     Okay.     And interestingly on both occasions namely payments from RailPro Holdings and payments from AMC, Mr Landgrebe gets quite a big amount from that to Mr Mashaba.     And Mr Mashaba on each occasion gets 1, something million.  Mr Landgrebe gets many more millions than that.     Yes.     Yes.     Are you still looking at the notes, Mr Soni?     Ja, each time you move just let us know.     Okay, so you have gone to page 165?    Okay, no, before you proceed.  The figure that you gave earlier on to the question was it 52 million?    Yes.    Okay.  But you, have you got the – on which page do you have that total of 92 or you just added up mentally?    Oh.    But not on the, on the, on the report.    Okay.  It would help if there is something in writing.      Ja.    Ja, and also just a complete list.    Ja.    Ja, okay.    Note 1 again being page 171.1 hey?    Up to page …    Yes, okay.     Ja, no, no.      Ja, no, no.  I think ultimately you …    You got it.  Ja.    Ja, ja.    Yes.    No, no, no.      No, no, that’s fine.  Ja.      Ja, no, no, that’s fine.      Is that 171.3?    Okay.    Yes, I have got 169, what about it?    Yes.    Well it may be because there are negotiations.      Very much.    Not be to able to answer certain things because then when the negotiations are going on …    You need to be, to have options to …    Ja.    Yes, yes.  Okay.    Ja.    Ja, that’s fine.      I see, I see Mr Soni that we will have to be careful here, for purposes of the transcript.  Because in the document that we have paginated as pages 171 and 171.5 where he said to note one note 2 and so on.      But I see here at page …    214.70 That there is note 1 as well and there is no 2.    So when we refer to note 1 or note 2 we have got to specify.    Which one.    Ja.    Yes.  Ja, that’s fine.  Failure, failing which it will …    Will just say page whatever.    Without saying note 1 or note 2.    Because in the end it does not make a difference.    Ja, okay.    Please just repeat the page.    214.?    Okay, thank you.    Now I am just alerting you to this because it is a matter that we are interested in as well.  And if you look at page 214.135 that is two pages down.  Mr Mashaba says this is a schedule of donations that were intended for the ANC.  And the amount he reflects here is 79 odd million rand.      At page?    Yes.  Yes.    Yes, no, no.  That’s fine.  Thank you very much Mr Muller.  I have no reason to think your counsel was to re-exam now, re-examine.  Mr Cilliers?    Thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Muller, we appreciate that you came to assist the Commission.  You are now excused.    Thank you.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja you may, you may require time for some of …    The witnesses you have mentioned today.    But in terms of, in terms of others that you may have lined up from the beginning, you have covered more or less all except maybe one or two?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, okay, no that’s fine.  It’s 15   Earlier.  But I’m going to adjourn and if    We adjourn.    Yes, you are excused.     Thank you Mr Soni for staying.  Ja, no, no it appears that although I initially may have thought we would again be hearing the evidence relating to Mr Joubert today, apparently ultimately it was adjourned to next Tuesday.  So there is no evening session for today.   Yes so we will adjourn and tomorrow I will hear evidence relating to Eskom.  That is for the benefit of the public.  One must welcome every opportunity to have only one session yes. We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Good morning Chair.     Thank you Chairperson. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   [No audible reply]      Yes, thank you.  I hope to be quick.  I am Fred van Zyl.  I have been instructed on behalf of Bombardier Transportation. And I confirm what Mr Myburgh has said that the intention this morning of my client is to withdraw the previous application and the right to cross-examine and lead evidence.   And secondly, to request that we – I am not sure what the right terminology would be but to uplift the intended affidavits.  And the reasons for that has been set out in a letter that has been sent to the Commission which I would request permission to hand up formally onto the record.     Chair, if I may briefly just place on record then what the circumstances were? Bombardier Transportation had effectively been taken over by Alstom SA as the new mother company and Alstom has the strong principle that it appears to that it will not respond to evidence to any commission or any authority across the world but it has not verified in accordance with its very strict standards of compliance.   It is in those circumstances that we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused and the time taken but my client is simply not in a position to respond to this evidence today and out of caution is withdrawing and to make its own investigations. And that has been fully explained in these letters and I suppose in light of the recent events, we have to make clear that we are in a very much different position of not withdrawing or refusing the evidence but simply indicating that we are not in a position to continue.     As it pleases.     Yes.     Indeed Justice.     That is indeed.     We are clearly taking note of that.  Thank you Chair.     I can tell you that my client has already started the process of verification.  I do not anticipate from what I have seen so far that that process is going to be able to be completed timeously but I can assure you Cahir that my client will most certainly take the invitation and what you have said seriously.     It is most unfortunate that we have only the short time had a process but then out.     And then we now found ourselves here.  But we will - most certainly, we take the work of the Commission very seriously and to the extent that we can contribute.     My client has given the assurance that it will.     As it pleases Chair.     Thank you Chair.

ADV VAS SONI SC:   Morning Chairperson.     Chairperson, you will recall that yesterday we had interrupted Mr Sacks’ evidence, dealing with the flow of funds and the report he had compiled on that.     Chairperson, I have reflected overnight and I have raised with Mr Sacks that in light of the issues that the Commission is concerned with, there are certain details relating to when payments were made and what the amount was.   In the long run, for the purposes of the Commission, it does not take the matter further Chairperson.     What we want is the overall picture.     And – but not only to speed things up but also to ensure that we do not lose focus of what we want.     So I have raised with Mr Sacks and I want to raise with you Chairperson, that the approach I want to adopt into the rest or most of the rest of the report is for Mr Sacks to confirm the correctness of what is contained in the tables with the commentary. And there are certain matters that are quite important for example who were the directors of the companies in concern, who were the auditors and so on.     There will be those matters that we will concentrate on and the rest the consideration of his report.     And the next matter that I want to raise with Mr Sacks is.  You will recall Chairperson that in his evidence Mr Sacks said that there were two emails from Ms Gaza that raised red flags before the contract had been sighed.  It was after the award had been made.   Mr Sacks has now managed to get those emails.  They are contained in the affidavit that Mr Hodge Bauw(?) in response to what Mr Montana had alleged in his incomplete affidavit. So I will ask Mr Hodge because I think they are quite reflective of what the contents of those emails – or what – how strong the message was.   Then I leave that part and then I roll onto the EM 0’s because as I have indicated to you yesterday Chairperson.  The – some of the investigations that Mr Sacks did were based on what was said in the Swifambo affidavit. Now in the CM 100’s or notice to the CM 100’s that Mr Mashaba lodged with the master ’s office.  He reflects or indicates what the funds were for or where he is not happy about payments that were made by Swifambo.  He indicates what that is. Now Chairperson, for the purposes of the Commission, in my view, we need not go – we can dispute the correctness of that but we are not in a position to do so at the moment but what Mr Mashaba says in those CM 0’s is for the purposes of the Commission quite important. And that, effectively, if – and I do not mean to be crude but that is from the horse’s mouth, as it were, and we can take that as representing his position because the CM 100 is effectively an affidavit.     Yes.  Is that okay?     Mr Sacks, you have heard what I have communicated to the Chairperson about the approach...     Okay.  Now in – you finished at page 902 of Bundle L.  That is still your report.       And ...[intervenes]      From page 902 Chairperson.     Nine, zero, two.     Of SS-24, Bundle L.     Now at 14.2.2, you summarise the amounts that Swifambo received and paid but would it be correct that you thereafter in Table 5, summarise how Swifambo had utilised – well, had utilised the funds it had received from PRASA relating to the main beneficiaries and you identified yesterday.     And Table 5, if you could just indicate that – right at the top you say the amount received from PRASA was R 2 650 ...  R 2 650 207 950,29.  And then it made disbursements of – to Vossloh, Mashaba entities linked to these persons.  How much is paid to Vossloh? MR     And do Mashaba and Mashaba linked entities?     And Mr Mashele?     And then there were other disbursements in the region of R 231 million or a little more than R 230 million.     And what was the balance in Swifambo’s accounts as at the 30 t h of November 2015? MR     Now just to put the rest of the report in context.  The rest of the report actually in respect of each of those main figures breaks down which way the entities... In other words, this is the big picture and now in the rest of the affidavit, you indicate that this is the amount that went to Mr Mashaba himself through this entity, that entity and that entity.  Is that...     Now we will go through those to the extent that they are relevant.  Let us then look at Table 6 which is a point you made yesterday that on the 5 t h of April 2013, Swifambo received the first payment from PRASA.     And then you looked at how that money was distributed.  Is that correct?      And then the – would the rest of the – of flow interest Swifambo’s account, whether Swifambo Holdings or Swifambo Railing, they – you indicate when the funds were received and how many days later money was sent to Vossloh.     And you confirm the correctness of those figures?     The one that stands out is the 116-days period between the first payment that Swifambo received and the first payment made to Vossloh.  Is that...     And the others are in the region of three weeks and sometimes one week and so on.     Now in regard to the 116-days period between when PRASA received – when Swifambo received R 416 odd million from PRASA to the time it made the first payment to Swifambo.  You have done a calculation, looking at the bank accounts, of what amounts it had distributed to other people.     And that is what is reflected in the first document you presented yesterday.  Chairperson, you will remember we had the pictorial representation.     Okay we just want to go through that because it may be quite revealing Chair.     Alright.  If you just – you just need to give the dates and to whom the payments were made and what the amounts were.     Yes.  Now I think this pictorial representation starkly represents the point you are making and if I can put it in a slightly different context.  This was the priority of creditors as far as Swifambo was concerned.     Yes.  Perhaps that is a better word.     Yes.       Yesterday, I said to you one of the figures that stuck in my head was a payment of R 10 million to Landgrebe.  In fact, it is R 8.8 million on the 9 t h of April and then further payments of R 1.2 million and then for R 1.3 million and then R 2.2 million.     Yes.  Then at page 906 in paragraph 14.4, you indicate the payments that were made to Vossloh for the locomotives, and you have already indicated that it was a little more than R 1.8 billion.     I – this though is – there is something I want you to explain to the Chairperson, what is the source of this information?    So it is Vossloh who would confirm to the Reserve Bank and that is the information you based table 7A upon but you have obviously checked it against withdrawals from …[intervenes]    So the other information  in contained in your analysis of bank – is derived from your analysis of bank account.  This, though, comes from Vossloh itself.    Then …[intervenes]    Yes, I think you do say that in paragraph 14.4.2 of your presentation.    Alright.  Then at 14.4.8 on page 908 you look at the payments that Vossloh made to Swifambo and you say that that totalled R811 508.59 and you break down the different payments that were made.  Can I ask you, where these came – the concern – or not the concern but what stood out for me is Vossloh is doing things for which Swifambo needs to pay it in terms of Swifambo contract with Vossloh, is that correct?    Now this seems to suggest that it was Vossloh, the worker who was paying Swifambo the actual paymaster event.    Now you also said yesterday, and you can just confirm it, but it is in your report, where you say that Vossloh’s contract with Swifambo was signed on the 4 July 2013.    Now if you look at these payments, all except the fifth one were made to Swifambo before the contract was done.    And those were the smaller amounts.  The bigger amount on the 17 April 2014, that is almost a year after PRASA had been paying Swifambo, Vossloh makes a payment to Swifambo of R448-odd million – sorry, R488 000.    Was there any indication what that was?    Vossloh was paying for the rent in the meantime?    Yes.    I tell you why I am intrigued by this and it has only occurred to me now that is why I did not raise it with you earlier.  If you turn to table 7A on the [indistinct – dropping voice] you will see that according to Vossloh it had received money on the 1 August 2013, it had received money on the 2 January 2017, the 17 January 17, the 19 t h of …[intervenes]    Sorry, 14.  The 19 May 2014 and the 8 July 2014.    And then it then makes this payment on the 17 April 2014.    Well, obviously you cannot explain, those are not signed off.    But let me ask you a slightly different question which is not contained in your report.  It seems – and that is the reason examining and I take it that is the reason you included the payments that Vossloh made to Swifambo over this period, over the period 2012 to 2014.  Is there anything you have uncovered as to the benefit to Vossloh of this [indistinct – dropping voice] besides the money?    For what period was that?    It may be – and I know it is contained in the different part of your …[intervenes]    Yes.    As you please.    We will do it in a separate supplementary affidavit, so it does not [indistinct – dropping voice]    Chairperson, I must apologise, I only found out about this a couple of days ago.    Absolutely.    It puts the whole picture in perspective.    But I know, Mr Sacks, you deal with that later but maybe it is a good time just because we are dealing with the issue of Vossloh payments because you have mentioned then they made payments to Swifambo.  I would like you to turn to page 953 of your report.  Page 953, Chairperson.    Now you do not have to read this.  Would you indicate to the Chairperson what you deal with in the context of what you have just been saying.  You were saying there were major other inflows into South Africa from Vossloh.  So will you tell the Chairperson what this is.     Sorry, just for the record.  What is the compliance and enforcement division?  I am sorry, the financial surveillance department.  To which department does it belong?    And generally what is the purpose of monitoring?    Would it not also be to monitor if there are suspicious inflows or outflows of money which all countries in the world, just given the world we live in now, are required to do.    Now you say the last paragraph of    And in terms of the analysis you did of the major – I do not want to call them creditors anymore because – but the major beneficiaries of the outflows from Swifambo, Mr Mabunda and his company are a major beneficiary.    So that would mean that in respect of this contract Mr Mabunda and his companies received more than R140 million, take the 88,4 plus 54 that you were talking about.    That is more than the profit that Swifambo was going to make out of the entire deal.    Now adopting the approach that we indicate that we would just deal with the big amounts …[intervenes]    Swifambo, Chair.    Swifambo.    Into that mix though, Mr Sacks, one must also put this because you raised a question, well it looked an unfavourable contract, at the time PRASA contracted with Swifambo, Swifambo had not yet contracted with Vossloh because PRASA’s contract with Swifambo was concluded on the 25 t h of March and Vossloh’s – Swifambo’s contract with Vossloh was conducted three months later.     So even if PRASA had asked Swifambo what is Vossloh going to charge Swifambo could not give an answer because there was no contract between them?     But I mean it just reinforces the point you made that PRASA just didn’t care.     Yes.     So sorry Chairperson.     In regard to the payments that Vossloh made to Siyaya which were flagged by the financial surveillance department, when your report was finished did you send a report to them to say look you flagged this, should you not look at this further, or whose job, so what I am asking really is whose job is it to pursue such information when you get more damning information or more suspicious information?       So you would have expected the Hawks to take this up and say well look you flagged this, we have now got this further information.      The Siyangena one.     63million.     R63million, that’s what the liquidator seems to have yes.     From the 3,5billion.     If I could Chairperson, and I just am using the opportunity that has been raised, one possibility is a self review to join some of the officials who were involved so that they cannot hide behind the wing contractor as it were and then we are left in the situation where the High Court is faced only with the version of the Organ of State and it cannot identify officials because there has been no attempt to say but these are the officials and this is what A did, this is what B did, and this is what C did and that is why we want to use the Court to hold them responsible for it.    Indeed Chairperson.     It is something that has given me sleepless nights Chairperson.     Yes.     It is so and Chairperson on reflection and having been advised that those emails are in fact available I have made a copy of each of those two emails, I think one is on the 6 t h of November and the other is on the  t h.   I have made them available to Mr Sacks and I am going to ask him, because you will recall that was before the contract was signed and those emails certainly it reveals Chairperson the very point you are making that now you are told by a person who is a member of the Board that his is – this is really dangerous waters and you take your slip into those water, and of course the waters eat the ship up.     As you please Chairperson.     Now I interrupted the flow of evidence leading to where you identify in detail what each of the beneficiaries and the entities got, because we were dealing with the Vossloh payment to Mr Mabunda and his company. I want to take you back now, and this shouldn’t take us too long Mr Sacks.  At 14.5 you deal with the payments that were made to – or you call it payments linked to Mashaba, that’s Mr Mashaba personally and to entities that …[indistinct – dropping voice]     And if you look at 14.5.5, you set-out the four beneficiaries into which you can divide Mr Mashaba’s …[indistinct – dropping voice].     Yes, and the one in regard to AM Consulting Engineers, it appears at table 8 which is on page 913, the one on Amaroko Makolele [?] Trust appears at table 9 on page 914, the one for Mr Mashaba himself appears at table 10 page 915 and the one for Vuyinathi Properties appears at table 11 on page …[indistinct – dropping voice].     I just want to ask you for – and I don’t want to be finicky but it your report.  In 15.5.3 you say there were 9 payments but when you look at table 10 it appears there were 10 that obviously is a typographical.     I could lead him on that so that the record will reflect that.     Yes, you’re quite right.     Yes, as you please Chairperson.  Then we go to the payments and that’s 14.6 payments made to Mr – into the bank accounts of Mr Mashele and entities in which he has an…[indistinct – dropping voice].     And those appear at tables 12 and 13 at pages 919 and 920 respectively, is that correct?     And you confirm the correctness of what’s contained in those tables?     Now, I’m sorry I was trying to move on, there are matters that you mention in relation to other interested parties.  Can I just take you to paragraph 14.5.7.2 at page 911, where you make the point in regard to AM Consulting Engineers, the auditors are WKH Landgrebe and Co.?      And why do you find that…[indistinct – dropping voice]?     And then you note at paragraph 14.5.7.3 that the Directors of AMC Mashaba, a Mr Moloko Floyd Sibone and Landgrebe Secretarial Services.     Is that usual to have them or were they just the company secretary?     What you …[indistinct] is there appears to be a link between that firm and Mashaba’s entity.     And the flow of funds yes.     Alright, then at 14.6 you deal with the flow to Mashele, we’ve been through that, tables 12 and 13 and in regard to Barn Wheels[?] you say their registered auditors are Van Wyk Auditors.     What is the significance of that?     Alright, I think their name crops up as auditors of other entities as well in fairness, that’s how I read the report.     Alright, then at 14.7 you deal with payments linked to Mr Mabunda and his entity.     Now, I just want to make this point because you may not have been aware of it, at paragraph 14.7.3 you say that the amounts on your investigation, you say this is background, that the Siyaya or different companies in the Siyaya Group received the payments mentioned, R26million, R23million and Siyaya Engineers the amount to be determined.  I just want to point out to you, when Ms Ngoye gave evidence about the Siyaya Group, she said they had done - she been asked to do that calculation and she said that from about 2009 they’d been paid a total of more than a billion rand.  Chairperson, you’ll recall that evidence from Ms Ngoye.     From PRASA yes.     I’m just – you know, there’s nothing wrong with this but…[indistinct – dropping voice] from PRASA…[indistinct – dropping voice].  Anyway at 4.7.9 you set out the amounts there to each of the entities and these are there, detailed at tables 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 from page 924 to 934.     And you confirm the correctness of all of those?     Then the person who’s name you flagged earlier, Mr Landgrebe, you detailed the payments made to him.     And then you confirm that that’s at table 21 at page 936, you confirm the correctness of what’s there?     And just to, again, indicate why you lightly highlighted van Wyk Auditors earlier at 14.8.5, you make the point that these things auditors are Landgrebe but the auditors for Holdings are van Wyk Auditors.     Then at 14.9 you detail payments linked to Musa Capital and obviously through that, Ms Cynthia Parrish, this is the American citizen …[intervenes].     Sorry 14.9 on page 937.     Sorry, yes.     And this appears at table 22 on page 938 and you confirm the details as set out in table 22, Mr Sacks?     Then 14.10 the payments made to Sibenza and you detail these at paragraph 14.10 and table 23.     I’m not going to ask about this because in the auditor ’s – sorry in Mr Mashaba’s note in respect to the payment to Sibenza he says that Swifambo in fact, had paid R110million not R99million and so we’ll look at that.  That’s, effectively the head of Swifambo saying that that’s the amount.     And I’m not saying that your figures are wrong, I’m just saying that if they say they paid that…[intervenes].     And you didn’t have all the bank statements in any case.     Some of these may have been from those other bank statements.     Mr Sacks is going to prepare a supplementary affidavit.     Then at paragraph 14.11 you deal with the payments linked to Nkosi Sabelo and you say there were two payments again on account of the fact that Mr Mashaba sets out the payments that he made to this firm of attorneys and the reason for the payment, we will deal with this part – or these payments when we deal with his note on the CM tender relating to these payments.     Is it possible to look at CIPC documents and include this in the further…[intervenes]. MR     Oh, so only the police would be able to…[indistinct – dropping voice].     Sorry, Chairperson, we’re at page 945, these are the payments linked to Mezanni Engineering and you say there were 14 payments of …[indistinct] of R5million they are reflected in table 25, you confirm that what is set out in table 25 is correct?     And the payments linked to Mezanni Investments – I take it these are different entities, Mezanni Engineering and Mezanni Investments because one is at 14.12 and the other is at 14.13?     And, of course, if you look at 14.2.2 you’ll see that the auditors are van Wyk auditors for Mezanni Engineers and if you look at 14.13.2 the auditors of Mezanni Investments are also van Wyk.     So this is the name that kept popping up and this is why, I suppose you flagged it and thought it was something to look at, not that there is something wrong with it.     Then at 14.14 you deal with a payment made to Knowles Husain Lindsay Attorneys, again, this payment is dealt with by Mr Mashaba in a note to SEM100, I’m going to go through that with you in a little while, I’m not going to deal with it here and then, of course, the payment linked to SARS, I mean that’s not a matter that concerns us at all.  Paragraph 15 on page 953 is the matter we’ve been through already.    Now, before I go on to the next set of documents I want to refer you to, I want to refer you to page 873 of your report and this is where you make the allegation or you…[intervenes].     Of the Bundle, sorry.     No, sure, yes, that’s at Bundle L.     Now, I did mention it earlier and I said I was going to raise this matter with you, in paragraph 11.38 – sorry I’ll just take you back to the context.  You were raising matters that had been raised with the key people at PRASA and at 11.37 you made the point that, according to Mr Molefe’s affidavit, certain matter had been brought to the attention of Mr Montana but he ignored them, that’s not what I wanted but that’s the context.  At 11.3.8 you say, Bridgette Gasa, now let’s just identify her, what was her position in PRASA at the time? MR     Okay, she was a member of the Board.     Now, the point you made though is, based on what had been said in Mr Molefe’s affidavit she had raised serious concerns about Swifambo in an email dated the 6 t h of November 2012 to Mr Buthelezi  and Montana, let’s just deal with that.  Have you managed to lay your hands on a copy of that email?     Before you do that, Chairperson, I have a copy for you, it may be easier for you to follow it, may I have leave to hand it up and we will obviously include it in the further affidavit.     But at least for now, you have it informally and then it will formally be part of the record Chairperson.     So, let’s just put this in context.  Ms Gasa writes on the 6 t h of November 2012 and she writes at 19h25, when I say writes, sends the email at 19h25, is that correct?     Who were the recipients of this email?     Alright what does she do within this?     Yes, if you could read it into the record.     Now, this seems to indicate that there was an attachment to this email do you now – I mean, obviously you picked this up from Mr Molefe’s affidavit.     Chairperson, I want to deal with the second email and having regard to its contents, make a submission to you on how we can take that issue forward, Chairperson.     She makes another important point here Chairperson.     If we look at this as a contract for so many…[indistinct – dropping voice] if you look at what she says, this is R3billion worth of work over 15 years.     Now that’s even more worrying because as I understand it, the State contracts are not to be beyond a certain period, three years or five years. I recall in one of the – Mr Makwethu’s affidavit he flagged     I want to come back to how the approach – propose an approach we should adopt Chairperson.     And then there is a reference to a second email and that is from Ms Gasa again, what is the date of that email?     And the time?     And who is this email addressed to?    Just sorry, one second.  She says   That’s the one that you just read?    Absolutely Chair.      Yes.    Chairperson, this is what I was going to propose and that is just to expedite the outcome that you want.  There’s we sent, instead of sending a Rule 33 to her, because there is no implication in respect of her, is to send her a 10/6 Directive.      To say we have these two emails.    These are the concerns that appear to be raised.    Would you please prepare an affidavit by whatever date that deals with it, with the matters you have raised.  The reaction to these emails.  We don’t know if there was a reaction.  And as you have pointed out Chairperson what was the board’s approach.  And did you raise it at the board and what was the board’s ...  (indistinct).    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, absolutely.    But what we now know based on those that certain persons at least aren’t claiming ignorance that they were not aware, they were not alerted and in law Chairperson, is if you have a duty and you, you are asked to investigate and you don’t investigate, that’s a breach of the duty.      Yes.    And, and therefore the net might spread wider in terms of …    Implicated persons Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely.    Now Mr Sacks we have dealt with your report and I know, and this was a long time ago now, you indicated what the purpose of the report was.  You handed this report and we’ve dealt with the issues that arise from it even if one does not know all the facts.   What did you expect would happen next, after you had submitted the report?  And also you had make a presentation, what did you expect would happen next?    If you had been asked after the presentation or shortly after your report, or any time after your report, do you think any purpose is going to be served by continuing these investigations that you’ve largely, well not fulfilled, but you have started this process.  What would have been your …[indistinct]?    No, no, no.  What would have been your reaction to a question of that nature?  In other words should this matter proceed?      Is it worth it in terms of money, time and possible outcome?      Now of course it didn’t and you were not even briefed on the Siyangena matter which was going to be the next brief from the Hawks to you, is that correct?    Either than that obviously is the question who should be held responsible for – you could see the outcome?  We see where PRASA – well I mean the PRASA the …[indistinct] contract is and the accrued losses that have been incurred.   Plus the liquidator will come in after Mr Sacks to explain what the position is at the moment, but, but whatever the position is, from the position of good governance somebody ought to be held responsible for not acquiring, not on the allowing, but the acquiring Mr Sacks to pursue to the logical conclusion, this investigation that he had stopped.    Now Mr Sacks, after you presented your report, you didn’t, you have not heard from the Hawks since?    Now we, you have heard what I have indicated to the Chairperson should happen about that.  I’m going to take you to something else.   You have now been shown a report prepared by the liquidator of Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Rail.  Do you – a report to stakeholders dated the 18 t h of February .    And in asking you to prepare for the presentation of your evidence, I have indicated to you, I would like you to just consider having regard to the flow of funds that he sets out in comparing it to what yours are.   What, what, or the general impression created by the flow of funds?  What, what is the difference in views if any? MR    Not necessarily in every detail, because you didn’t have all the information.  Would the further information he has, it reinforces the, the correctness of the conclusions that or the correctness of what you have set out in your report.    And all one would need to do is just add the, the further investigations that have been done since as a result of the powers that be.      Now but there is nothing in his report that raises concerns about the cogency of your …    Now then can I ask you, I also said to you that after the liquidator had submitted …    As you please.  Now sorry, before I deal finally with the report, I have been told that there is a report in the Swifambo application, which deals with a comparison between what the tenderers, the different tenderers had tendered.  Are aware of that?    Now in light of the fact that the Chairman has indicated that is a matter that must be taken into account, I am going to ask that you look at the report and indicate in the supplementary affidavit precisely what is contained in that report to, as a comparator between what Swifambo was charging and what other tenderers were charging.      The background to that Chairperson is, apparently it is, it is, it is said by Judge Francis that the tender if, if the specifications imposed by Mr Mthimkulu had not been taken into account, another tenderer would have won.   But apparently there is a report which sets out precisely what that is.  And we just don’t want to be talking without all the, all the relevant facts.  But it, it may also then raise further questions about the bona fides of the decision making.   But that we will get Mr Sacks to, but I thought before he leaves, you ought to note Chairperson that that would be a further matter that he will address neither.    Alright.  Now in his report, oh sorry.  The liquidator filed his report to stakeholders on the 18 t h of February 2020.  Thereafter in July Mr Mashabo filed a thickened CM100 in each of – in respect of each of Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Rail.   Now the – I just want to ask you if you’ve had an opportunity to look at the new CN10s – CN100s, sorry.       Chairperson I just want to – I know Mr Sacks is not the, the – was not the recipient of …[indistinct] but obviously when you see what the CM10 deals with or some of the matters it deals with, it, it goes into some of the issues he has raised in his report.   And I thought it is only fair that Mr Sacks be given an opportunity and I see that and I accept that to the extent that Mr Mashaba says this, and it’s, it’s consistent with the bank accounts.   I cannot have any difficulty with it, having regard to the fact that I didn’t have regard to – I didn’t have all the information that the police should have provided me with.      So I am going to ask you – sorry Chairperson, we are now dealing with Bundle E1 and it is EXHIBIT SS4. That’s the liquidator ’s report to stakeholders.      Red numbers on the right-hand side as you …    Yes.    No, page – I’m not going to – the liquidator will deal with the report.  It’s just those matters that concern Mr Sacks.  And they are dealt with starting at page 214.1.    Yes.    Chairperson I should just indicate by way of background why that numbering is like that.  The liquidator when he filed his report, obviously didn’t have the 3M, the revised …[indistinct], the new CM10 – 100s.   They were included after our consultation with the liquidator because we indicated to him the importance of tying up the two reports, the liquidator ’s report and …[indistinct].   Now section, page 214.1 is the first page of the new CM100 in respect of Railpro Holdings.  You see that?    Do you know why it’s now called Railpro Holdings?    Okay, you can take it for granted that refers to Swifambo, what was Swifambo Holdings.      Okay.  Okay.  But the name has been changed to Railpro Holdings.    Now in regard to that CM document, the CM100 the date of that document is the 6 t h of December 2018.      Right.  Then at 214.18 is a so-called replacement CM100.    Now that was, that is dated and you’ll see it on page 214.20 that is dated the 13 t h of July.    Now it is this that – I don’t want to go too much into Railpro Holdings, but except in note 2 which appears at 214.35.  Sorry, can I just ask you in respect of notes to CM are you familiar with that or would I or should I rather leave it?    But what is said there is at all material times, Holdings was a non-trading entity.  Two, at all material times Holdings permitted leasing to deposit amounts into its account on the basis where such amount where the property of Swifambo Rail Leasing and for reasons that are unclear, Holdings entered into contracts with certain service providers including its auditors on the basis and understanding that all liabilities therefore, all liabilities arising there from were payable by and or with the account of Leasing, and Holdings accordingly is entitled to recovery from, I mean Leasing is entitled to, Holdings is entitled to recovery from Leasing.     That is what, I just thought that I will tell you that that is the relationship that is now said to have existed between Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Leasing.    Now for present purposes we need not go much further then to say that on page 214.38 the original CM100 in respect of Swifambo Rail Leasing was filed and then if you look at page 214.56 the new CM100 in respect of Swifambo Rail Leasing was filed.    And that is dated about the same time as the, the, the second CM100 in respect of Holdings.     Now I just so that we all know what we are looking at, I want to ask you if you could just please turn to note 1, which appears at 214.70.  Oh sorry, before you go there.  Can I just ask you to look at page 214.63 and 214.64.  This lists the creditors of Leasing.  Would that be correct?  214.63.      Yes.     Sorry, the ...[intervenes]     Debtors of leasing.    Now in respect of each of them, there is said to be a note.     I want you to look at page, at note 1 which appears at page 214.70, because this deals with what Mr Mashaba now says or is the basis on which Leasing has claims against the various debtors that are reflected in those pages I have referred you to, and if I could just quickly go through, I just want to ... he says on the 6 t h of December Oswald Mashaba purported to sign, purported to sign a CM100 statement of affairs and then in the second paragraph he says AM has been advanced by attorney Cameron that Oswald Mashaba has been advised by Mr Cameron a course to prepare a new statement in order to comply with the sections of 366 of the Company’s Act and he has engaged the previous auditors of leasing to perform a forensic audit and he says this is the outcome of the audit.     Okay.  Then can I ask you to go to page 214.108.      214.108 Chairperson.  So if you could keep your finger on page 214.63 while we are looking at this, because you will see that note 19 refers to its claim or its alleged claim against PRASA and you will see that at the top of page 214.64.      Alright.  Now he says at paragraph 3, and remember you have indicated the amounts that Leasing and Holdings have received from PRASA.  He has indicated the link between Leasing and Holding.  Now in paragraph 3    What is your reaction?  I mean it is not for you to, I am not asking you to comment but just looking at the flow of funds as you have outlined and as you say is more or less confirmed by the liquidators report on the same issue, what is your reaction to that?      But he goes further and he says PRASA must pay this before its claim against Swifambo can be determined.      Maybe the liquidator because he is the person who is looking after PRASA’s interests, will deal with that.      Then can I ask you to look at note 22, and keeping an eye on what 22 refers to, this refers to the claim of Mr Mabunda.     Sorry, ja.      And I am saying that is confirmed by the fact that at page 214.64 ...[intervenes]     He flags it as note 22.     Now what does he say about this claim?  Can you read that, Mr Mabunda’s claim please?      No, no, no that is page, it is 214.130.    Now when you were identifying the entities from which Mr Mabunda had received money, the Swifambo entity, it is quite clear that all that money came from Swifambo entity, is that correct?      And those entities were effectively under the control of Mr Mashaba.    Although the companies that made those, I am the managing director of the companies that made them?      Then can I ask you to look at note 25 which appears at 214.133.  This is the payments made to Mr Sibelo and other people and perhaps what I should ask you to look at, is page 214.135 which is the next page where he schedules these claims.  You see that?      I am just trying to present the context.    So if you could tell the Chairperson what he alleges this claim against these individuals is for?        No, no, no it is important that we know what it means.      In the context of why he says these payments were made, it is strictly speaking intimately connected with the award of the contract.  That is why I wanted you to read from paragraph 1.      If you could just stop there.  He says here that this was after the award of the tender, you remember that?  I mean you note that?    Now I do not need to go to this, but you will recall that in his affidavit replying affidavit in the Swifambo matter, Mr Molefe had said that Mr Mabunda had approached Mr Mashaba and asked him to be the front of the tender that was, that still had not been issued.  You recall that?      Yes, okay.  I just wanted to make the point that this is inconsistent with what he said to Mr Molefe.     That is his claim now in respect of all those amounts, because you will see that the amounts paid we know Nkosi Sabelo and Similex are all included in this total amount.      Just one thing I thought may be worth pointing out, and that he had agreed to pay 80 million rand, this is Mr Mashaba, but he was going to charge a handling fee.  If you look at paragraph 3.     And so the amount that was going to go to the ANC was 80 million rand.  His handling fee was going to be eight million rand.  Do you know where that eight million rand was going to come from?      Then can I ask you to please look at note 32 on page 214.149.  Now this here refers to if you go back, you do not need to but it refers to the payment made to the S group or Mr Mabunda by Swifambo, I mean by Vossloh.  It is the 75 million rand we were talking about.    What does he say about that?    So this money he now wants the liquidators to recover from Mabunda as he wanted the earlier amount that Swifambo had paid to Mr Mabunda.    But does that no reinforce the point you made much earlier that there did not seem to be any commercial rational for many of these funds.     Alright, and then the final one I want you to look at is note 33 at page 214.150.  Now this you will see are payments, if you look at page 214.65 this relates to payments made to the Siyaya group.    And what does he say about that?      The Siyaya too is under liquidation or has already been liquidated.     Well, he is talking about the insolvency.    So what is quite clear from these, the main payments that were made to Mr Mabunda and his company, either by Swifambo or by Vossloh, he is, Mr Mashaba is saying, must be recovered from Mr Mabunda.     And he is also saying that the money that was paid purportedly for the benefit of the ANC which did not receive the benefit according to him, must be claimed back from those whom he gave the money to, because he believes it was for the ANC.     And again, come back to your report.  As you were going through your report you said but it does not look like they did anything in respect of the contract that we see, the contract that PRASA or the locomotive contract, ja and in respect of what he says now these are, what is your, how do you feel about what you have said earlier?      Chairperson, I see it is one o’clock.  I, that is those are the issues I wanted to raise with Mr Sacks.  I do not know whether we, you have any issues that you want to raise with him.    Yes, yes, I am done.      Good afternoon Chair.     We are ready.     Mr Muller will be our next witness.     And the last witness for today.     Alright.  But you are one of the liquidators involved?     And in regard to both these entities, although you have co-liquidators, you have – what is the state of your knowledge in regard to the investigations where you are at the moment and the reports that have been prepared.     Now you prepared a report dated the 18 t h of February . It is     Chairperson, that report appears at Bundle 3.1, SS-4, PRASA reference 160 – starting at page 161 Chair.     It is starts at 161.  Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Now Mr Muller, you – have a look at the document that starts at page 150 – well, 161 of Bundle 3.  Is that the report you prepared?     And that report ends, the report itself ends at page 171.     And whose signature is that there which signs on behalf of the joint liquidators?     Now you can confirm that what is contained in this report is true and correct?     Now Mr Sacks, and you must be aware of it because you have been – you came in yesterday as well and you came in earlier today, not while he was testifying but you are aware.     He is a Forensic Investigator who did investigations into the affairs of Swifambo but that was before it was liquidated.  Are you aware of that?     Now can I ask you.  Did you see his report, the reports that he presented to the Commission?     But I mean, you are aware of the report?     Are you aware of the general conclusions that he talked...?     Now I raise that with you Mr Muller in this context.  Mr Sacks told the Chairperson that in 2017, he prepared that report.  He made a presentation to the Hawks on that report.  And he left the report with them on the understanding that they would come back and assist him to finalise the report.   I am just putting that, the context.  He says...  Sorry, just to indicate to the Chairperson verbally that you understand that ...[intervenes]     Now he says in addition, that from the time he presented his report in 2017 up to now, a period of maybe four years, the Hawks never came back to him.       That is his evidence, okay?  I am just placing that on record. Now as I understand it.  Mr Mashaba in a 10.6 – or in an affidavit that he submitted to the Commission, having been directed to do so in terms of 10.6 Directive, indicated that you had laid charges against him.  Is that correct?     Now when were those charges laid?     And could you just indicate to the     As I understand it, that report was your affidavit and annexed to that were a series of supporting documents confirming what – confirming why, in your view, he should be charged.     And who had prepared that Chairperson?  I mean, Mr Muller.     Now that you say was in May 2020.     About eight months ago.     May I ask you?  Have you heard anything from...  Oh, sorry.  When did you lay the charge?     Have you heard from them since?     But I am not understanding you.  You gave them an affidavit with supporting documents.     In support of why Mr Mashaba should be charged.     But as I – was it only Mr Mashaba or did you ask for other individuals as well?     It does not matter.  I am just...     But you... Now, you then say you had a meeting with them.  How did that meeting come about?     Who asked for that meeting?     Of the Hawks?     They wanted more information from you?     Did you give them that information?     And then you say there was a meeting in December.     What happened in December?     Okay.  And since then, what has happened?     And that affidavit, the Hawks assisted in compiling.     Has anybody from the National Prosecuting Authority contacted you in relation to your complaint or your complaints?     No, no, no.  Either they did or they did not.     But you cannot identify the person who was an overall control of the investigation from the Hawks in Pretoria?     Now you said that in December, they compiled a second affidavit which included matters that had been looked at by a forensic investigator that the liquidators have appointed.  Is that correct?     Now in regard to the commissioning of a forensic investigator.  How did that come about?     Now you have indicated to me and I am just placing it on record so we know what concerns you have.  That at present, and it has been ongoing for some time now.  There is ongoing litigation between the liquidators and Mr Mashaba and other persons invested in the Swifambo liquidation.     He is an auditor for, I think, Swifambo Rail.     Now as a result – and I understand there was going to be an inquiry today in relation to the Swifambo matter.     One – but one of the hearings was today.     One of the matters that were raised is that you – that liquidator should accuse them.     Oh, sorry the Commissioner.     Oh, sorry.  I am ...[intervenes]      But in separate applications, Mr Mashaba has also asked that you be – your firm be removed as the liquidator.     So you have indicated to me that, having regard to the ambit on matters that I should ask you questions, you would prefer that I stick mainly to the report.     That is just as though not to give fuel to either the civil litigation or give them fuel to fight you in regard to the civil litigation or in regard to challenging your authority and other matters relating to the liquidation itself.     Okay.  Now I am going to do that and I have given you and your counsel that assurance.  I want to concentrate mainly on the main findings you made in regard to who were the beneficiaries of the funds flowing from Swifambo.     And I will just tell you, and I have already indicated to you that what I found intriguing about this matter is.  When the liquidation application – and it was Swifambo which brought the application to liquidate itself about the Swifambo entities.  Is that correct?     Yes.  And Mr Mashaba on that occasion signed a CM 100 in regard to both Swifambo Rail and Swifambo Holdings.     You then submitted this report on the 18 t h of February 2020.     You have since received a new CM 0 in respect Swifambo Rail and a new CM 100 in respect of Swifambo Holdings.  Is that correct?     Now just to get one small matter out of the way.  We talk about Swifambo Holdings but it is now called Railpro Holdings.  Is that not...     So when the documents in the CM 0’s and so on, are referred to the entities, they – the matter in regard to what was Swifambo Holdings is now Railpro Holdings.  And the matter in regard to Swifambo Rail is still Swifambo Rail.     Now just to get another matter out of the way quite quickly.  If you look at page 16...  Oh, page 167 in the bundle in which your report is contained, the one on the right-hand side.  You will see...  Well ...[intervenes]      One, six, seven.  Yes, Chairperson.     As you please Chair.  Now if you look at page 167.  It is a continuation of what was started on page 166 which deals with the legal proceedings.  And then the second set of items you record there is the inquiry.  And you itemise the dates on which the inquiry took place.  What inquiry was that?     Now I see that, if you look here, there were several people called whose names are mentioned as people who received money from Swifambo.  One of them is Mr Mashaba.  The other is Mr Sabelo.  The other is Mr Mabunda.  And towards the bottom is T Makonzi Mashele. On the 24 t h, the second name on the 24 t h of February 2020.     When in regard to the level or lack of cooperation, will you just tell us what was Mr Mashaba’s attitude in regard to cooperating at the inquiry?     Well, everybody I suppose has an opportunity to make their own law Chairperson.  [laughs]  They recognise what they want.       We are smiling because that is exactly ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Now also, you point out that then – then Wheels Solution is under liquidation.     or has been liquidated.     Alright.  Then at 6.8, you say that you have brought an application to confirm jurisdiction against Ms Gomes.  This is Maria Gomes.  Would that be correct?     And what was the purpose -or what did you want jurisdiction in respect of her to be confirmed for?     Is that what the house is valued at?     Oh, I see.  So but your claim against her is for R 40 million?     Yes.  And you needed jurisdiction confirmed against her because she is a non-South African.  She is Peregrine’s in terms of law.     Alright.  So I have got out of the issues that in a sense of peripheral to the matters, I want to ask you about Mr Muller.  And if I can ask you to look at paragraph 5 on page 162 of the bundle?     Now you say from the information obtained a flow of funds can be summarised as follows, at paragraph 5.  Do you see that?     Now I just want to ask you.  Is that after the forensic investigator whom you appointed had done a forensic investigation of the flow of funds?     And when he did his investigation, did he confirm ...[intervenes]      ...to a large extent what was contained ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So I ask Mr Sacks, having – he having done his own flow of funds investigation and he says he came to more or less the same conclusion as you do in your report or you came to the same conclusion as he did.  And I just say this because his report is the earlier of all the reports.     Now in regard to the forensic investigator. Were you aware at the time you commissioned the forensic investigator that the Hawks had asked Mr Sacks to compile a report for them based on a criminal complaint laid against individuals connected with Swifambo.     And between the time you hired the forensic investigator and the time he produced his report, what was the time period?     And I do not want to know figures because it is not right to air in this public, you performing a public function.  Was it a report that cost a fair amount of money?     And at the time, you handed your affidavit to the Hawks and thereafter, they asked you to include what was contained in what the forensic investigator had found or to include aspects of that.  Did     Alright.  So those are all the preliminary matters...  Can I just ask you?  As far as now the monies – 5.1.1, you record that there are – it is the two entities that is Railpro Holdings and we know that is Swifambo Holdings.  And Swifambo Rail Leasing received different amounts of money.   More or less, when you looked at Railpro, that is Swifambo Holdings, how much did they receive if you just sort of add up those two figures?     And there is no need to emphasise this point and there is no need to ask you.  The first amount was received on the 5 t h of April 2013.     That was received by Holdings.     And the first amount received by Leasing was the 6 t h of December 2013.     You are looking at about eight months later.  Now can I just say to you, and I do not know if it makes a difference to you but the contract between Swifambo and PRASA said that all payments must be made through Leasing, not to Holding.  It did not say must not be made to Holdings but in terms of the contract all payments were to made to Swifambo Leasing.  Were you aware of that?    And so when you look at it from point of view of a liquidator and I know this time it will not make a difference but what – would that raise any concerns that a R3.5 billion contract requires payment to be made to entity A and the very first payment is made to entity B, it may be a related entity.  Will that raise concerns for you?    And what is the nature of those concerns?    I mean, you cannot draw a link between the contract and the payment.    Then you deal at 5.2.2 with the payments made by these two entities.    Now we have been through with Mr Sacks the payments made by the entities and who were the beneficiaries of those payments.  I do not want to go through all of them.  Can I just ask you, when you look at the first name that appears under the payments list as 5.2.2.1, who is that?    And what was the amount he was paid?    And this he was paid by Holdings?    And then there is a payment to Mr Mashaba.  How much is that?    And then there you say there are various entities controlled by Mr Mashaba.    Now the total of R146 375 880.16, does that include all the payments made by Holdings including those to Mr Landgrebe and Mr Mashaba?     Then on the next page, Holdings – you record that Holdings made a payment to Mr Makhensa Mabunda.  How much was that payment – how much was paid to him in that regard?    And then were four entities under the control of Mabunda, as you describe it, and the payment, I take it, the total reflects the payment to Mr Mabunda and companies under his control.    So Holding made payments of 63-odd million – or more than R63 million to Mr Mabunda and his entity.    Then the next one you deal with that I am interested in is Musa Capital.  Do you know where Musa Capital fits into?    Okay.  As I understood Mr Sacks’ evidence it was one of the directors of Swifambo – I am not sure it is Holdings – I think it from Swifambo Leasing who – her name is Cynthia Parish who was Musa Capital.    Yes, he is the present director, as I understand it.    Thereafter you deal with payments made under 5.2.8.  Will you tell the Chairperson what those are and who the recipients were?    And that R41 400 000 that you – that is your claim against Mrs Gomes.    I mean, that is the basis on which you said you were required to find jurisdiction.     And then at 5.2.9 there is an entity reflected there which received R500 000.  What is the name of that entity?    Have you investigated what that entity is?    And then there are other recipients of money from Holdings and they do not feature in anything that we have looked at or Mr Sacks thought was unusual, though he is not saying the payments were justified.     Right, thereafter at 5.2.3 you deal with payments made from Swifambo Rail Leasing.  So this is now Leasing.       We are going to identify the payments.  The first person you I identify there is Mr Mabunda and that would mean in his personal capacity, what amount would he have received?    Okay and then there were entities under his control which received monies, is that correct?    Now we have come across some of these companies but the one that I am interested in is the one that is listed last and that is 5.2.3.2.6 and that is Sterling Living.  Do you see that?    Now, Mr Muller, I just want to say that you have presented us with an update to your report, is that correct?    May I have leave to hand up – it is not a very – it just effectively says this is what happened since February last year in relation to this, it does not chance the picture but the reason it is important in regard to this question is reflected in this.    Perhaps – sorry, before I do anything with this, these notes, as you call them, were compiled by yourself, Mr Muller?    But I mean you take responsibility for them.    Now you confirm their correctness to the extent that you have been able to investigate and so on.    Chairperson, I am just wondering – because it is directly concerned with the report itself whether we should not include it as an annexure to the report at the end of the report.    Immediately and call it …[intervenes]    Yes.    As you please, yes.    And then it will be headed Notes on Matters Raised in the Report.    As you please, Chairperson.  And if you take the numbers, 171.1 to 5.    Now in regard to the issue of Sterling Livings, you refer to this matter on the last page of the notes, Mr Muller, and it is at note 3.  You do not have to read there but will you just tell the Chairperson why this is significant, that this amount was paid, what it was paid for and how you came to know that it is connected with Mr Mabunda?    The amount reflected here is R5 million.    Now correctly or not, Sterling Livings justify …[intervenes]    No, it is still page 5, Chairperson.    Yes, of the notes, yes.    That is where note 3 is dealing with Sterling Living.    171.1.    And this will be 171.5.    Yes.  So effectively for the record, 171.5.    So you were saying, Mr Muller, that you uncovered this payment quite by accident because you had made a claim against Mr Mabunda and then it emerged that this payment which had been made by Swifambo had been made in respect of kitchen cupboards to his house in Waterfall, Equestrian Estate in Midrand, is that correct?    Oh, sorry.    Sorry, Chairperson, if one goes back to the report itself.    It is at page 163 and it is a payment that is reflected as 5.2.3.2.6.    No, .2.6 Chairperson.  These are entities under control of …[intervenes]    .3.2.6.    At page 163.    163.    163, yes.    And then you will see it is 5.2.3 as the big number and it says Payment from Swifambo Leasing.    That is to Mr Mabunda.  Then in the second set of entities it is the last entity, Sterlings Living.    No, no.    That is the one we are talking.    Yes.    That is it.    Yes.  Now you then try to identify what this payment was for because it had been made by Mr Swifambo (sic), would that be correct?    And it is in pursuance of that inquiry that you found out what the R5 million payment to Sterling Livings was for.    And what did you uncover?    So I was a bit kind, Chairperson, when I said it was for the kitchen, it was just, as I understand it, for the cupboards.    That is what I thought.    So even more…    Now can I just ask you, in regard to – and it is Sterling Livings confirm that that is what Mr – well, that is what they had charged and had been paid for in respect of those cupboards.    Now in regard to that house, did you make any enquiries?  I know it is a trust but did you make any enquiries?    And have you been able to ascertain what the value of that house is or what the cost was?    But in whose name – okay, so it looks like the lease in the name of the Makhensa Family Trust but who is the owner of the property?     But what you do know is that the trust has a 99 year lease over that property.    Alright, now the total amount that were paid by Swifambo Leasing to Mr Mabunda and his entities is how much, Mr Muller?    Page 163.    Yes.    Then you deal with the payments that were made to entities controlled by Mr Mashaba, is that correct?     And there you list five entities.  What is the amount paid to them – that figure, Chairperson, it is right at the bottom of page 163.    And then on the following page, page 164, who is the beneficiary of the first amount reflected on that page?    And to what extent did it benefit?    And then you say these two sets of payments need to be investigated further and they amount to about R727 000.    Right.  Then you say payments made to AMCE.  Now what is AMCE?    So these were payments that that entity made to different people.    And let us look at the bigger figures there, who is the first major beneficiary?    And what is the amount of the benefit he received from AMCE?    Now I just want to look at – if I can ask you, and I am sorry to do this, Chairperson, but there is no other way to do it, to go back to page 162.  Now remember there is …[intervenes]    Yes.    Now at 5.2.2 you identified who had received monies from RailPro Holdings.  The first name in that list is Mr Landgrebe.    And the amount there is R30 million.    And then you have now told us that from AMCE he received 55-odd million.    Is that now a separate amount that is paid to him?    So he has received payments of about 85 million.    Yes.    I had not seen that and you are absolutely right.    I have not see it, Chairperson.    And you are quite right.  Alright, then we have the entities who received benefits from – oh sorry, entities under the control of Mr Mashaba who received benefits and what is the total amount of benefits that they received?    Then you have got Siyaya Rail and you say that is associated with Mr Mabunda.  These are still payments from AMCE?    And what is the amount of that benefit?    Okay and then at 5.2.4.6 is a person who receives a benefit who is – I mean, an entity that receives a benefit.    Then the next payment is to Hover Dynamics.    And you have put something in brackets, what is that?    A what?    And how much was that – what was paid for that?    And that was paid by – that was a payment made by AMCE?    Do you know if the helicopter was purchased or leased or…?     And what do Hover Dynamics do, do they sell helicopters?    And then there is listed at 5.2.4.8 a payment in respect of motor vehicles.  What is the amount paid in respect of motor vehicles by AMCE?    And then there is a payment made to Garcia Jewellers.  What is that payment?    And then you list a number of transactions that need to be investigated.    Then you list – you have two sets of figures – or two sets of entries relating to property and the first at 5.2.6 you say that these are properties acquired by Mr Mashaba and entities under his control and you make the point that these were acquired after the payment had been made from PRASA.  I take it to Swifambo.    Alright.  So you have listed under Zedacore Six (Propriety) Limited three properties, is that correct?    Now before I go on with that can I just ask you to look at the notes that you have now submitted because, as I understand it, all that is reflected on note 1 at page 171.1 is – sorry, note 1 which appears at 171.1 to 171.3, that you have now updated what has happened in respect of these properties, is that correct?    So there is no change in respect of the purchase of the properties, the identity of the properties, there is no change in them.    Sorry, yes, they were sold by whoever the purchaser was.    So in – and what is the link between Zedacore Six and Mr Mashaba?    Right and number 33 Sturdy(?) Mews?  That is the next set of – that the next entity that purchased the next three properties.    No, no, no, sorry, sorry.    I will, I will, I know it is – I have been through it so many times it is automatic for me, but I apologise.    165, number 33 Sturdy(?) Mews.  Have you go that, Mr Muller?    Now you say that is in business, what does that mean?    Oh.    And that company acquired three properties as well.    And you have indentified?    What is the total worth of the properties acquired by Mr Mashaba through these two companies?    Now 52 million rand in property is acquired by Mr Mashaba after the ...[indistinct] payments done by – after Swifambo received ...[indistinct].    Oh sorry.    82 Million.    What we will do as well, we’ll put a note in Chairperson.    That this is what the total is.    Yes.    Now I am a bit, well not including, I just want to make sure that I am not misunderstanding.  On page 165 of that’s your main report, SS4, right?  Mr Muller?      Page 165. You have been looking at it.      5.2.6 And 5.2.7.  Sorry, 5.2.6.  You have got two blocks, fixed property.    Now in note 1, you say it consists of an update.  Are there more properties in note 1 or under note 1 than there are at 5.2.6?    Okay, would you just quick – are you able to do it without taking up too much of time, which are the new properties on note 1 that are not reflected at 5.2.6?    Yes.  Yes Chairperson.    171.3.      Oh I see.  Okay.    But isn’t there an easier way of identifying them?  And I say this with respect to you Mr Muller, if you look at page 171.1 the notes, in the second block you identified the same three properties that you have identified in 5.2.6, in the first block at 5.2.6 at page 165.      Right, you’ve got the first three properties.      Now look at page 171.1.  There those are your notes.      Okay, will give you some notes then.    You’ll see in the first, in the second block on page 171.1 you list three properties.      Are they the same properties that are reflected in the first block on page, on page 165?    So then we know that that block corresponds with that block?    Okay.  If you then look at 33 Sterdy Mews, you have listed three properties there.    On page 171.2.      And that corresponds with the three properties listed in the second block on page 165.    Now that means the six properties that are reflected in 5.2.6 are in those two blocks, all the other property are not reflected.    Chairperson, I don’t know if I am just trying to show the …    The correspondence between the two.    I will do that Chair.    It’s just that …    Otherwise it’s going to be a time consuming exercise.    It really is …    You can just take out two blocks and say everything else is ...[indistinct].    Can I and I am just going by because I’ve read Mr Sack’s report, in fact I can say I studied Mr Sack’s.  The reason you didn’t include some of the properties as, you were not aware of the link between Mr Mashaba and some of the entities that acquired those.    Like for example we are now Neaty Properties which appears at 171.2.  The last property.      So, so I mean that’s, that’s the only reason that they are different.  You now see that there were other entities connected with Mr Mashaba and you want to then say that when you are looking at 5.2.6 which reflects the properties that he acquired after receiving payment, add the properties listed in note 1.    Alright, now in regard to Chairperson I will do that, I have it in my head and it’s meant to be an easy …    Then at 5. – although you call it 3.2.6 that’s, that’s error is it not?  No, it should be 5.2.    Yes.  We will correct that as well Chairperson.  Now in regard to Mr Mabunda in his own name after Swifambo received payment from PRASA he received, I mean he acquired certain property.  Is that correct?    Let’s start off with where you were before you compiled the notes.  He and entities in which he had an interest had, had acquired 10 properties. Is that correct?    Your report.    How many, which properties though are new?  I’m not looking at those that are sold.      Well just tell us who the – under whose name it was bought?    What page is that of the notes?    Oh, okay.  Alright.  And there are two properties there.      Okay.      That’s 1. – 171.3 Chair.    And when you look at the properties that Mr Mabunda acquired, forget those that were sold, but just the amounts that were paid, seemingly from what PRASA had paid to Swifambo.  Just the amount, the total amount in property acquisitions by Mr Mabunda.    Alright, that to a large extent deals with the Court’s report, except for paragraph 10 which appears at page 169 of the report itself Chairperson.     As the bundle in which the report is contained.  Page 169 Chairperson.      Yes, paragraph 10.    Mr Muller now as I understand it, Vossloh has been taken over by a German firm called Stadler.      Oh sorry, a Swiss firm I beg your pardon.    And in regard to – and they have taken over the whole of Vossloh?    And without revealing anything that you shouldn’t, what is the present State of the dealings between you as the liquidator of Swifambo, which owes those billions to PRASA, what is the state of the negotiations or the communications between you and Stadler?  Without revealing anything that can be used this time in the process ...[indistinct]?    But at the end of the day, PRASA if it wants to acquire, still acquire these locomotives, is going to have to pay.    But whatever else, it won’t be that PRASA will acquire 70 more locomotives without paying any more money.  That’s more or less what it had paid Vossloh.  In terms of its contract with Swifambo.    Which ...[indistinct] no, no.    Yes, ja, I think.    Yes.    Hold your cards to your chest.    No sure.    Now finally Mr Muller, you might remember I said to you that Mr Mashaba had filed new CM100s.      And that he did in July, about five months after you file your report to the stakeholder.    Now have, how long have you been a liquidator?    Are you, have you had a situation in these years, and I’m saying this because I’ve consulted with you, have you had a situation where a second CM100 is filed?    And can I just, just to show the, the unusual nature, the CM10 – the CM100 is actually an affidavit by the person in control of the entity to be liquidated.      On of?    On oath.    And so now what you’ve got is a new CM100 is filed in respect of each of these entities and if you had a look at the, the two sets of CM100s?    And how do they compare with one another?  Are they relatively reconcilable.  Or they are irreconcilable?      But, but anyway that’s what you are now faced with because that’s what you have been given.      I just want to deal with a – Mr Sacks dealt with most of these matters.  And I just want to look very quickly at some of the, the notes that we made.  And Chairperson I am aware that we dealt with these in some detail with Mr Sacks, but the fact of the matter is they were handed to Mr Muller as the liquidator.  And it would be important to confirm in fact that that is what he’d received.    As part of the CM100s.    Now can I ask you to look at the report again and that is the one at 161 of Bundle C1.  Sorry that starts at 161.  Okay.  We can leave out the notes now because we’ve exhausted the notes, is that correct?    Now can I just ask you to look at page 214.70.  .70.      Yes.      This is in regards to leasing.  There does not seem to be much in regard to …    Yes.    Oh.    You’re absolutely right Chair.    Yes.    No, absolutely.      This will then and we must make a conscious effort here Chairperson of saying the notes to the CM100.    No absolutely.    Or yes.    No, yes.  Yes.    No absolutely Chair.    So and Mr Muller, if we all can just be conscious of that, that it would be preferable for the purposes of the record to refer to page numbers.      Now at page 214.7O, Mr Mashaba which is a note to his CM100, Mr Mashaba explains why he is filing the thickened CM100 affidavit.      Yes.  And he says that the original document that he signed, the CM100 that he signed, or he purported to sign fails to completely and accurately reflect the financial information that the Company’s Act requires.  You’re a liquidator.  What does that strike you that you do not comply with what the Company’s Act requires you to do on oath?    Okay, and that is sharing.  Okay. Then he explains that Mr Cameron, his present attorney – I take it you’ve, you’ve had interactions with Mr Cameron?    Alright.  He says that based on advice he’d received from Mr Cameron they decided or he’s been advised to submit this new one.  He says something that    And then he makes a point that the claim of PRASA which had paid from 2,8 billion rand to Swifambo is not reflected as this would need to be quantified in an action which Mr Mashaba has been advised, needs to be instituted by PRASA against leasing, that’s his position.  And I’m not asking you to comment.  I am just saying that that is his ...[indistinct].    And you understand that that is his position?    And, and that’s why Chairperson if I    214.108.    Okay, now these are the claims that Mr Mashaba says Swifambo paid when in fact the obligation to pay for forwarding charges rested on PRASA.  You understand that.    These are the claims that are made by Sademzi.  He says they paid and the amount they paid was about 109 million rand so Sademzi.  You are aware of that?      Now I don’t want to make too much of this, I’ve raised it with your attorney.  But there is something odd about some of the amounts reflected here.  If I could just ask you to look at page 214.11.  That’s an invoice dated the 21 s t of November 2014.      Oh sorry.  214.111.      111.    So this is an invoice rendered by Sibenza on the 21 s t of November 2014 to Swifambo.  You see that Mr Muller?    Well let’s forget the fact that the contract said, and this is a fact.  The contract said that PRASA is responsible for forwarding costs.  These amounts on Mr Mashaba’s version and it seems to be reasonably correct.  Swifambo paid to Sibenza.  Okay.  And now you keep shaking your head.  I need an answer.    Now I just want you to look at this, the claim reflected on that invoice.  On the first line you will see it says, customs VAT of R7 925 489,32.  Now what – I understood VAT is payable on expenses you incur, for goods you buy.  Or am I wrong?    So we’ve now got a line, a line item of a claim for R8 000 000,00 but it would appear that Swifambo simply paid it against ...[indistinct].  Again I’m just, I don’t want you to comment, I’m just pointing it out to you.  And all I’d like you to say, that is what is recorded in the document.    Then if you look at the next one on page 213.1.2 you’ll see that a similar thing occurs where a VAT amount is reflected without any expenses being indicated.  The expenses for the charges and so on.  And you will see also that the VAT amount they claim, that is claimed at the bottom or the second last figure on that page, on page 214.1.1 reflects the VAT on the amounts claimed for the services rendered, plus this R320 000,00.  You see that?    Yes.    Yes.  And if you look I am just going to take one more example.  If you look at 214.1.1.4 you will see again customs VAT of R1 230 000,00 and that VAT is added to the VAT for the services.  You see that?    Chairperson I highlight that, because of the concerns that have been raised about an entity which has no obligation to pay, paying these amounts and it, it as you can see at least one of the amounts is a million rand.  I, I’ve looked at more of them, but I merely make the point to say that that is a matter that needs further investigation.  Certainly if the matter, if that’s claimed from PRASA, it is a matter that PRASA would need to look, because they are obviously saying now, we paid on behalf of PRASA, pay us back.      Then can I ask you to look at note 20 – oh sorry.  To page 214.130.  Now this is the claim that Mr Mabunda or one of his companies made for payment of a total of 28 million rand.  And Mr Mashaba records that Mr Mabunda did offer advice through various companies, but he was never employed by leasing and it is not understood why he received 28 million rand from Swifambo.  But that’s what’s recorded here.  That’s all I’m saying.  Do you see that?    But that’s something you can respond to, because the payments are made by Swifambo or Swifambo related companies. MR    But the interesting thing though is that Mr Mashaba appears to turn on Mr Mabunda and say, pay this money back.  But did your ...[indistinct], I can understand you have an arm’s length relationship with all the beneficiaries.      Mabunda has been a beneficiary because we’ve been through it of the two entities that received money from PRASA, that’s Rail and leasing.  No sorry, Holdings and leasing.  And now …    Mr Mashaba says, he shouldn’t have been paid anything.    Now I want you then to please look at page 214.1.3.  Now remember you said …    214.1.33 Chairperson.    You remember you said you had a claim against Mr Gomez for R41 400 000,00?    Now if you go back to page 133 he explains how that came about.  And he says that after the contract was awarded, Mr Mashaba and Mr Mabunda were approached by Ms Gomez and Attorney Sibelo.  And under pressure from mister, from Ms Gomez and Ms Sibelo, Mr Mashaba on behalf of leasing arranged to make a donation to the ANC in an amount equal to 88 million rand.  But I, I’m, I want to deal with what I regard as the punch line.  Now I want to make a donation of 88 million rand, but I will charge whoever it is a handling fee of R8 000 000,00.  That’s what he says at 3.4.    And then the amount that was paid, he says was R79 400 000,00.  Now in fairness to the ANC and to Mr Mashaba he then says that Mr Badelo testified at the 417 inquiry and said that these amounts were not distributed to the ANC.  You were at that inquiry.  Is that what happened?      And so he says the amount owing by these two individuals is not R41 400 000,00 but in fact 79,4 million.    Well I mean, that’s what’s recorded here and you will keep that in mind as Mr Mashaba saying that’s what Swifambo paid to these people.    Then finally, well perhaps not finally, but at page 214.149.  This is another claim from – oh sorry, this is the main one that I – but perhaps if I could ask you first to look at 214.150 which is the next page.  This is another payment that was made to Mr Mabunda or one of his companies, and it was for 7,2 million rand and Mr Mashaba says no value was obtained in respect, in respect of this payment. Swifambo wants the money back.    Okay, but now I want you to look at note 32.      Oh, sorry.  I am sorry Chairperson.  Page 214.149 it’s the one just before.  He says subsequent to leasing concluding a sub contract agreement with Vossloh, and without the knowledge of leasing and its consent Vossloh paid to Mr Mabunda or his companies, an amount of approximately 75 million rand.  It is Mr Mashaba, he continues in the CM100 as it is my contention that this amount should have been paid by Vossloh to leasing as some form of rebate and accordingly the leasing liquidators need to recover this amount from Mr Mabunda for his ...[indistinct].    Yes.  But suppose what he is trying to demonstrate is, the extent to which different people who were not entitled to benefit or produce nothing of value in respect of the contract, received such benefits and now the company is in liquidation, he wants those monies back.    Now those are all the aspects of the new CM100 relating to leasing that I want to raise with you now Mr Muller.    Chairperson I have raised all the matters that I wanted to raise with Mr Muller and I have deliberately, I did of course stray on the one occasion when you pointed out, but I did try to keep it within the confines of what Mr Muller would be ...[indistinct] Chair.    That’s the evidence we want to lead from Mr Muller.    That is the evidence that we intended leading this week.    And we’ve gone through all the witnesses that we eventually thought were necessary.    We’ve taken note of the matter that have been raised.  We may require perhaps a day or two more for PRASA.    Depending on, on what happens next.    It may be one more day.  But it won’t be more than that.      Those investigations.    Yes.    Indeed Chairperson.    But we just want to consider our position without giving any names at this stage.      If you will recall we had the Siyagena and the Swifambo contracts …    Before you.  We just need to consider really we’ve exhausted all the witnesses.    Yes.    As you please Chairperson.    And we are excused Chairperson, the PRASA team?    Thank you Chair.   INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES 
MR SACKS:   Good morning Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     Yes, that is...  Yes, Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     Chairperson, the payments linked to Mashaba and Mashaba linked entities is R 102 928 001,75.     Chairperson, the payments linked to Mashele is R 39 54 840,00.       That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.  These are just summaries that... upfront to assist the police in understanding collectively what money flowed.  However, as transfers refer, each transaction as is – including the bank statements is detailed in the rest of the report.     That is correct Chairperson.     Chairperson, it is standard procedure for these flow of funds analysis specifically in this type of place, is to investigate the timeframe when monies received and monies paid. And specifically as counsel refers in Table 6 under paragraph 14.3, I noted that, as was discussed yesterday, there was quite an extensive time-lapse between when Swifambo received the first payment from PRASA into the incorrect account, Swifambo Rail Holdings and when it made its first payment to Vossloh and it was 116-days later.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     Okay.  Chairperson, you are looking, I think, the first diagram, page 1.     That is titled    On the top left corner.     Chairperson, those guys requested me to explain this documents.  As you will – as you can see on the document, on the left-hand side that shows money flowing in from PRASA on 5 April 2013, R 460 million.     And that, as I – I do noted that it is paid into Swifambo Rail Holdings Standard Bank account and I note that this money, in terms of contract, should have been paid into Swifambo Rail Leasing.       Then as you see the outflows on the right-hand side.  I have summarised per the bank statements, if you were to go to the top, it includes the date, the recipient of the money and the amounts of the money.   And there is – on this document shows 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... 16 recipients of payments. And the last payment, the 17 t h and 30 t h of July 2013 is Vossloh for R 290 million.   So the point of this document was to explain that on 5 April 2013, PRASA paid R 460 million to Swifambo.  On the 30 t h of July, a 116-days later, Swifambo paid Vossloh R 290 million.   The balance, the difference of approximately R 170 million was in the main paid to the entities, the individuals which have been linked which we discussed yesterday. So for example, the first payment on 8 April 2013, AMCE which is AM Consulting Engineers, which is Mashaba’s company, received R 5 million. So as I do note on this document that within six days of receipt from PRASA, Swifambo paid R 102 million out of the business to Mashaba, Mabunda, Mashele, WKH Landgrebe in a trust which is Mashaba’s – linked to Mashaba, NOH which is linked to Mabunda, Nkosi Sabelo, Moosa Capital. So Chairperson, without too much detail, just for summarisation purposes, in the bottom left-hand corner, I deal with the totals that all these individuals or entities received. And the point of this document is trying to say is.  That before Swifambo – Vossloh may receive its first payment of R 290 million, a 116-days after PRASA had paid Swifambo, R 150 million was in fact disbursed to Mashaba who received R 30.5 million. Mashele, through an entity called Bond Wheels, received R 28.32 million.  Mabunda, through an entity called NOH, received R 23.68 million.  Parish, through an entity called Moosa Capital, received R 13.5 million.  WKH Landgrebe, who again were the auditors of many of these linked entities and Swifambo Rail Leasing auditors received R 16.5 million. Nels Hoosain received R 10.4 million and Nkosi Sabelo received R 28.5 million, which total at R 151.4 million.  These recipients received before Vossloh, is the first payment to Vossloh was made. And in context of – you will recall Chairperson, the profit that Swifambo was – the margin they should have made of R 180 million, just on the first payments alone for funds received from PRASA, greatly exceeded the profit that Swifambo was ought to have earned over the duration of the entire contracts.     Chairperson, the counsel uses the word creditors loosely.     I think the priorities ...[intervenes]      ...held by directors or influential people ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Yes, Chairperson.     Yes.     That is correct Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     Chairperson, the ultimate source is possibly themselves confirmed to the South African Reserve Bank, I stand to be corrected, they in fact received this money and using that confirmation from Vossloh themselves I was able to marry up the payments out of Swifambo bank accounts even though I was missing one or two pieces of information but because Vossloh had confirmed the amounts I knew that those amounts had indeed been paid.     Yes, Chairperson, I have confirmed as counsel said.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Sorry, Chairperson, stand to be corrected, actually National Treasury that they confirm the amounts to.  Excuse me, I just got confused between the two sometimes with the detail.     Yes, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.  As I stated in my report, initially as I stated in my report that 811 000 which we discussed yesterday, which these amounts that were flowing into Swifambo’s bank accounts prior to that PRASA received the receipts and as I stated in my report, these funds were ostensibly used to fund the setup costs of the Swifambo office.  I did state in my report that obviously these are subject to confirmation and will have to be investigated further.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, the description within Swifambo Rail Leasing bank account, which these tables include the bank statement, account details, received the money, the date and the description and amounts, the description says electronic banking payment FR Vossloh, rent and other payments.     Chairperson, we check with the bank statements as you read them.     The actual commercial rationale for the payment was subject to confirmation but on face value it appears that Vossloh was paying rent for Swifambo.     Sorry, counsel, 14.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Again, Chairperson, at face value it sounds odd, as to counsel’s words.     I have – Chairperson, in the course of the Werksmans’ investigation intelligence is obviously performed and when we were looking at – the team was looking at Vossloh as an entity and the contract itself we were looking at the Vossloh financial statements and I am assuming, counsel, that is what you are referring to and, if I may – which I found it quite revealing and it was reported at the time during the course of the Werksmans’ investigation as to how Vossloh themselves, the greater Vossloh Group, because Vossloh Espana, the locomotive manufacturer is a subsidiary of the Vossloh Group at the time.  I do understand that there has been a name change or transactional activity in that group to another entity, I am not familiar with those details but at the time when we were doing the investigation – and, if you would indulge me, I have briefed counsel what those financial statements actually said and if you allow me to I can read them into the record, which is quite revealing in terms of …[intervenes]     …the value that Vossloh placed on this contract and in light of the funds flowing to Vossloh and as my report will state, money flowing over and above these funds, these payments that we talk about, the R800 000, be it is a lot of money, there was significantly more funds, much more funds that flowed into South Africa from Vossloh not through Swifambo, which counsel will deal with, but if you bear with me, I will – these are what I call pertinent extracts from the public audited Vossloh AG financial report and …[intervenes]     This is for the financial period ending 31 December 2013 and they signed the contract with – Vossloh signed the contract with Swifambo in July 2013, so this is six months later.  I recall at the time when we were doing the Werksmans’ investigation we were not familiar with that contract between Swifambo and Vossloh, that contract was only revealed later in discovery in the Mashaba affidavit and we were trying to establish what the value was that Vossloh was earning, what was the price that they were earning.  We knew what PRASA was paying Swifambo and I will read the actual extracts from the financial statements with reference to Vossloh stock, per page 8 of the financial statements. “With the announcement in the beginning of October 13 of a major order from South Africa, Vossloh gained renewed interest of investors and the stock significantly recovered to the end of November to prices above 70 Euros.” So obviously the inference is the major order from South Africa has a positive impact on the share price – I am assuming stock price, in South Africa we refer to as share price, has a positive impact on the share price which     No, not, I do not think so, Chairperson.     And I will forward the Commission the financial statements for Vossloh AG as well, where these quotes come from.     Chairperson, the Werksmans’ investigation team, at the time we again we performed investigations,     Chairperson, again I think it is to the South African Reserve Bank.  It is a department within the Reserve Bank and they were obviously in a position to ascertain money flowing into South Africa as – or money flowing in and out goes through the Reserve Bank.     It is compliance – and foreign exchange compliance and enforcement, I would understand.     I confirm with counsel, Chairperson, on that view.  So, in summary, this report confirmed that an amount of R88 991 209.38 – 39 cents, excuse me, flowed into South Africa from Vossloh and my report includes extracts of this said report and if you indulge me, Chairperson, I can say that an entity with the name Vossloh Kiepe which I understand is an Austrian division of Vossloh AG made six payments to Siyaya Rail infrastructure solutions and technology between December 11 and September 2013 totalling R13.6 million.  The category for these payments is reflected as legal, accounting, management consulting and proceeds for management consulting and my report includes the details of these payments and, Chairperson, Vossloh Espana, which we understand is obviously the Spanish subsidiary which manufactured the locomotives, made six payments to an entity S Investments (Pty) Ltd between February 2014 and September 2015 totalling R75 328 121.57.  Category of these payments is reflected for proceeds for management consulting service and architectural engineering and other technical services and, as I state in     Chairperson, as we have explored, Mabunda – Mr Mabunda and his entities, linked entities, received significant funds from Swifambo.  Not only that, Mr Mabunda’s linked entities were significantly involved in the tender.  If you recall, Chairperson, one of the first items in the tender was to pick up the tender documents and someone from S Group collected the documents themselves and that was the start of the flow of Mabunda-linked entities through the whole – from inception of the tender to the awarding of the tender to ultimate outflow of funds and further to these flows from Vossloh into South Africa of R89 million.     Chairperson, the flow of funds analysis shows that Mabunda-linked entities received from Swifambo over the course of the time of analysis R54 651 981 and the entities include names such as Inawaste(?) the Siyaya Group entities and Sovo S Group.     That is correct, Chairperson.     As per the contract, yes, Chairperson. the entities include names such as Inawaste(?) the Siyaya Group entities and Sovo S Group.     Yes, Chairperson.     You are correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, it is really a question – I think the first thing that you can say is if PRASA secured the trains directly from Swifambo themselves, assuming Swifambo qualified to provide, they will have paid significantly R120 million less when is a significant amount.  It appears to me without knowing the information  and in fairness to Swifambo themselves, we have not asked them the question, we have not investigated did you charge a fair price to Swifambo, did you give them a discount to enable them to make a mark-up?  That obviously we would have to – those conversations would have to take place and that is why we were reporting – the Werksmans’ investigation team was reporting this very fact to go to Vossloh, just ask those questions to Vossloh.  It looks like based on how this contract – as we have seen how this contract evolved, it did not seem to be a concern on the PRASA said, PRASA management side, at the very least, what they were paying.  And seeing that once the contract price of an amount of R3.5 billion was fixed, that is the number, however many locomotives we get for R3.5 billion, initially it was 88, then the rand weakened, now we are getting 70.  It seems like PRASA was irrelevant, really, in a sense, on a per unit price.  It was just a contract price.  I think you ask a very good question and I would certainly think did PRASA pay more than the going rate for a locomotive?  I cannot – I was not privy to what the other tenderers bid for their locomotives and that is certainly something that would have to be looked at in context of the whole – the whole – the whole – I hope I answered your question.     So, in other words, Chairperson, it was not – they did not act in the best interests of PRASA, they just accepted the price that Vossloh was quoting, ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     No, it was Siyaya.     I think, Chairperson, it is fair to say that the majority of the R3.5 billion was going to end up in a foreign company.  R1.8 billion was paid to them for the delivery of 13 locomotives and I know during the Werksmans’ investigation, we were looking at that aspect in terms of how PRASA – the delivery of locomotives did not accord with the money that was being paid, it was almost like PRASA was paying upfront.  It was not a favourable contract to PRASA, they took on tremendous risk, performance risk.  I understand there were issues with the performance bond which I understand to be that if the supplier fails to deliver, how does PRASA recoup their money and – so the whole contract itself was not focused to PRASA’s best interest and  - so in terms of just 13 locomotives coming for R2.6 billion being paid of which the majority of it went to Vossloh, I think it just stands on its own in terms of well, PRASA was heavily exposed just on that basis alone in not getting what eventually – never mind that the locomotives were not suitable for the South African rail network, as it was dealt with in Popo Molefe’s – or the application judged by the SCA.     I think it is a very good question, Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     Yes Chairperson it was dealt with extensively in the Popo Molefe affidavits as well.      To put it bluntly Chairperson that is probably a fair summation by counsel.     Chairperson I think the obvious answer would be law enforcement themselves, hence I included this very important finding in my report, again if we look at the Genesis of this report this is just my preliminary findings, you know it was obviously intended to move forward from there, to say well this is what we have got thus far, here is the evidence we have received thus far, these are our findings, these are areas of focus and I would imagine that was these in-flows from a foreign company into South Africa to these individuals and entities which should have been or would have been a key focus of a law enforcement investigation.     At the very least yes, because that is where my – Chairperson where my report went to.     Yes Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     Yes, it’s just as counsel says, four bank accounts – the four bank accounts in these entities’ names yes.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson as I say my – it was a draft report these little errors were being picked up, on finalisation…[intervenes]. ADV VAS SONI     Counsel is correct there’s 10 payments.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, again, W.K.H. Landgrebe, the bank account in the name of W.K.H. Landgrebe received significant flow of funds from Swifambo in the amount of approximately R27.9million.     In the capacity as company secretary, yes Chairperson.     I think they were just the company secretary, again, the involvement of WKH Landgrebe was subject to further investigation but as stated they were the auditors.     And the flow of funds, yes Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     That’s correct.     Chairperson, off the top of my head, if I recall, I was just recording all these entities, who the Directors and who the auditors were but I can be – I do believe that van Wyk Auditors did crop up amongst the entities, they weren’t specifically beneficiaries of funds but I was just stating facts because in an investigation if further information is required, if I state who the auditors are as recorded on CIPC it would give the – I guess, the police at the very least or whoever else is involved in the investigation, areas of further examination.  If we need financial statements or we need queries, we can ask the auditors. So I was just stating this information, just to be factual within my report.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     From PRASA?     From PRASA Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     We must just remember, Chairperson, at the time I performed my investigation I wasn’t privy to documentation out of Swifambo, I was purely looking at bank statements and obviously…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes, Chairperson.     Did you get to know round about when Mr Sifiso Buthelezi seems to be a Director of Sibenza Forwarding or is that something you never got to know?    Chairperson, I don’t have that date in my report, I would have obtained this information from CIPC so that it would be readily available but I did note in my report that he was a previous Director at this point in time I didn’t…[intervenes].      Yes, Chairperson.     Chairperson, these were allegations made by Mamabolo, I cannot confirm if those allegations are true, however, it was included in my report because it certainly warranted…[intervenes].     Something further but you are correct in saying whereas this individual might not have been a Director he might have had an interest, an ownership interest in Sibenza.     That’s my understanding, yes, Chairperson.     That’s correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, these are bank accounts with the names I tried to address – in the investigation if I could identify who the company was behind, hence I included auditor and CIPC information but this is a name of a bank account.     Yes, Chairperson that’s correct.    Yes, Chairperson.      Yes, that’s correct, the payments from Vossloh, Chairperson.     I understand she was a member of the Board yes, that’s correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, the standard procedure in the Werksmans investigation the team – they forensically secure the documentation from the outside investigation and in this case there was about 1.4billion documents and within this – these documents, this email that counsel refers to was located and I’ll read the contents of this email…[intervenes].     That’s correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, the recipients of the email was an email address, Sifiso@makana.co.za and as noted on the email second recipient was Lucky Montana PRASA Corp.     Chairperson, this is – this email deals with her raising the serious concerns and if counsel indulges me I can read it into the record.     So, the subject is, urgent, the attachments to this email states Swifambo Rail docex and Mpumalanga docex and the email reads as follows, “Colleagues I know you are both in Cape Town, trying to rescue our organisation from being hijacked, I appreciate your efforts and can only hope the plot will be successfully arrested. Unfortunately I’m not a bearer of good news, I’ve just received intelligence information about Swifambo Rail Leasing, the company the PRASA approved R3billion worth of work over 15 years. With all these platforms not being safe I’d like to request that you allow me to dig a little deeper. Failure to follow this up will sink the organisation. Should the intelligence report prove true we need an immediate intervention as the Board, signed off my Dr Brigette Gasa, MD the Elilox Group Pty Ltd”.      Mr Molefe obtained this document through the Werksmans investigation, through the repository of the forensically secured documents, as I mentioned. I would imagine, to answer counsel’s question, if there was an attachment it could be, it would have to be confirmed, that this would also be – if this email was located in the forensic process then the attachments would also be.  I’m not familiar as I wasn’t part of that forensic process.     Chairperson, that date is 20 November 2012.     10h38am.    Chairperson, again an email was sent from Bridgette Gasa and it was sent to Chris Mbatha, PRASA Corp, copying Lindikhaya Zide and siphiso@makana.co.za the subject being follow up on the Swifambo Rail leasing.    Yes.  Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, it is the same email address.    That is it Chair.    Please that, I read that into the record Mr    That is correct Chairperson.    Yes. “It is imperative that PRASA as an organisation appoints adequately, capable entities to undertake the work under all of its programs, moreover in our contract are high in value and are linked to the strategy of creating new industrialists in the rail sector.  There are concerns have been raised around this particular entity and the SCIP is needing you to confirm that indeed a capacity check was properly done in relation to this contracts and that you have satisfied yourselves with the necessary checks and balances have been done.  Please proceed to provide me with the information I requested from you as time is of the essence and will be an anomaly to proceed to conclude contract negotiations in light of the seriousness of the matter we had raised or which we have not received a response from you on.  Kind regards, Dr Zanele Bridgette Gasa.”    Yes.    Yes.    She does.    She does.    Yes.    Chairperson, I think it goes without saying that I expected the investigation to continue for, it is, it is as simple as that.  Obtain information I required, be in a position to perform a second level of analysis required.   Ultimately what the objective of concluding, forming an opinion and advising law enforcement to had engage me on what my view, the report in itself speaks volumes as to what the findings were already.   And I guess the remaining information would just confirmed further and pointed to other areas that needed to be, to investigate, or criminal proceedings to, to proceed.    Chairperson, Advocate Soni my approach in performing the investigation?    Chairperson …    Chairperson I think the record, the reports or the information contained in the reports stands for its, on its own and that’s the investigation, I certainly should have proceeded.      That’s correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.     That’s, that’s correct Chairperson.    That’s correct Chairperson.    That’s correct Chairperson.    Chairperson you are correct.  I include as you correctly state, I included all that background information, but my actual mandate …    Was the flow of funds and that was …    I guess the – as I detailed, that was my detailed findings.    That’s correct.  That’s, that cannot ever be disputed.      Chairperson, I, I am aware of that what was contained in that Popo Molefe affidavit.    Chairperson I will attend to that.    Yes Chairperson I have.      Yes Chairperson.    Chairperson I am not familiar why Railpro Holding or I don’t know why it’s called Railpro Holdings.  I’ll answer that question directly.    Yes, and I, I have seen that same back account as Swifambo Holdings.    Yes, yes Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson on page 214.3.      I see that Chairperson.    That’s correct Chairperson.    No, I’m not familiar with it.  Okay I will say to me in my view it is just additional information that is being provided.     I see that Chairperson.    Okay.      I see that Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    214.63 yes, because debts due to the company, so it is assets.     Debtors.      Debtors.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    I see that Chairperson.    I see that Chairperson.    I see that Chairperson.    Chairperson, this is a claim regarding payments that Mashaba said that Swifambo paid to Sibenza.  Other than confirming the bank records of Swifambo in my analysis that Sibenza received 99 million rand.  Mashaba purports or claims to have provided supporting documentation for those payments. If you recall Chairperson, the contract between Swifambo and PRASA says the costs of shipping and falling is for the cost of PRASA.  So other than this paragraph 3 confirms that Swifambo made some payments to Sibenza that is claiming from PRASA.      Chairperson, based on what I see in my reports, these are Mashaba’s claims.  I do not know if credence could be given to his claims, based on his other claims contained in this document which I have read.  It is, I understand where counsel, what counsel is asking but it needs to be seen in context of the bigger picture.  I think simply put he is saying that, Mashaba is saying that well Swifambo made payments to Sibenza and those payments must be paid, Swifambo must be reimbursed by PRASA.  I am not sure on the legalities of whose claim supersedes whose, but that is how I read this document.     Ultimately Chairperson, that is a point that you so put as to what was the, for 13 locomotives a 100 million rand.  How much money was PRASA paying to bring one locomotive into South Africa.  Here is, which was not available to me at the time before my analysis, here is internal documentation from Swifambo that talks to these payments and this would be a starting point for an investigation to say here is Sabena’s purported tax invoices as provided by Mashaba in his affidavit.  That will be my first point of investigation.  Let us go analyse this documentation which myself, perhaps the liquidator has, which the liquidator would in the ordinary cause of assessing claims, this documentation would be investigated further.      On page 241.130?    Yes.     Yes.     Chairperson, what Mr Mashaba says about payments in the amount of 28.8 million rand that is reflected on the schedule on 214.64, sorry.      130.  So with reference to those payments, Swifambo made or Mr Mashaba claims that Swifambo made payments of 28.8 million rand to Mr Mabunda and in    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson, Mr Mashaba does not state, he just gives a total amount, whereas in my report I detailed which payments make up the amounts that I categorize as a Mashaba payment, linked payment or Mabunda linked payment.  In this instance Mr Mashaba just throws the number out.  To answer counsel’s question, [indistinct    Yes Chairperson.     I see that Chairperson.     Yes.      It, in summary ...[intervenes]     Chairperson, I will start at the back and work my way, I will work my way back.  So on page 214.134    Okay, sorry.  Excuse me counsel, so I will read    Yes, I see that Chairperson.    I recall that Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.  I will carry on    That is correct Chairperson.    Yes, I see that Chairperson.    The eight million rand came from PRASA, Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson, if I may read from this page, that    Chairperson, in my mind, this is Mashaba’s contention, his view but the audit confirms to me that Mabunda received the 75 million rand.  The commercial rational as Mashaba is talking over here, or I do not know.  Any conclusion can be drawn.      That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.     Read from page 214.150, note 33   I have been informed of that Chairperson.    Yes, yes sorry Chairperson.    That is what Mashaba is claiming Chairperson.     I agree with that contention Chairperson.     Chairperson, Mashaba confirms that all these amounts dispersed by Swifambo were of no benefit at the very least to Swifambo had no purpose.  He is even claiming that he will be paid back, even though he was the one I would imagine as the managing director, if not made the payment, approved the payment but in summary these payments have no commercial rational.      Thank you Chairperson.    Yes.  
SACKS: Chairperson, the amount is R 1 873 474 161,62.     Chairperson, the balance at 30 November 2015 was R 111 276 943.89.   Chairperson, CIPC doesn’t include shareholding that information is not readily available so that’s why it had to be performed per subpoena or an investigation.     I – Chairperson, I’m not absolutely familiar…[intervenes].   Chairperson, the liquidator ’s report corroborates the findings contained in my report with regards to the flow of funds.  As simple as that.   
ADV VAN SONI SC:   Chairperson to the best of my knowledge not because it is not a question that was pertinently asked for example to Ms Ngoye who would have known as the Head of Legal and Compliance, but it is a question that must expressly be asked to her so I can respond to that at the next sitting or certainly in an email to you Chairperson and then we can take it up but then you would know formally what the ...[indistinct]. 
MR VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson I see it is just after 11    As you please Chairperson. 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
MR MULLER:   [No audible reply]      Yes, in Swifambo Rail Leasing, we are three liquidators.  It is Aviwe Ndyamara, Professor Mandla Matlala and myself.  And in Railpro Holdings it is Mr Timco and Aviwe Ndyamara.     I have been appointed.  I have been handling the administration.     Yes.  Commissioner, I have been intimately involved with the day to day administration in both entities.     That is correct Mr Commissioner.     That is the report.     That is correct Chairperson.     Oh, that is my signature.       That is so.     H’m.     I am aware of that, yes.     No, I have not seen it.  It only came to my knowledge very recently.     I am aware of it, yes.     I am aware of the general...     Yes, I understand.     [microphone not switched on.]     That is correct Chairperson.     In May 2020.     ...background, it was a comprehensive report and all the figures were detailed in that report.     That is correct Chairperson.     I was assisted by senior counsel, Mr Jaap Cilliers who prepared the charge.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct.     It was the Hawks in Pretoria at their offices.     Yes, we had a follow-up.  After the charge was made, we had a follow-up meeting.  I cannot recall the date and then early December, I visited their offices again and where the – I had to sign an affidavit, containing all the evidence and all the information I gave them in May.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes-no, there were other individuals ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Chair, it was just a follow-up meeting to get more information.  I was assisted by my senior counsel, just to give them a more comprehensive background.     It was on the request of the Hawks.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, we did.     That is correct.     In December...  I think throughout they had consultations with the forensic investigator that we appointed which was not Mr Sacks.  And they compiled a comprehensive affidavit which I then signed mid-December.     I have not heard from them since.     Uhm ...[intervenes]      That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.  The last affidavit I signed was in December.     No, it is only one affidavit, yes.     Yes.     Yes, they used all the information that was given to us to...     Not, as far as I can recall, no.     No, they did not.     And then the affidavit I signed was with Captain Simon(?).     The person I communicated with was mostly with Colonel Trollip.     Trollip.     That was ...[intervenes]      The communication we had was with him.     No, I cannot.     That is correct.     We had to - in our investigation we found that as a liquidator you are only have, you know, limited resources and you have access to documentation but to have that, somebody had to go through it in detail.  Also create the flow of funds for us to have a condensed version on which we can make decisions going forward.     That is correct. ADV VAS SONI     That is correct.     That is correct.     Inquiries has been ongoing in the – we have had various, several inquiries in this matter.     There was a hearing this morning, yes.     No, it was asked that the Commissioner in terms of Section ...[intervenes]      Act...  Ja ...[intervenes]      ...before the Commission can refuse it. [Parties intervening each other – unclear.]     Ja.  I am appointed in my personal capacity but he has asked us for the removal of...     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     It was a voluntarily liquidation by way of a resolution.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is an inquiry in terms of Section 41.  It is a secret inquiry in terms of Section 417 and 418 of the Companies Act into the affairs of Swifambo Rail Leasing and Railpro.     That is correct Chairperson.     We did not receive no cooperation from Mr Mashaba at all.  He appeared once.  The second time, he came with senior counsel and insisted on a Shangaan translator.  And then the third time he came was with his current attorney where he state that he did not recognise the proceedings and he did not recognise – you know, he was not prepared to...     That is correct.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct, ja.     To actually was – she is a debtor of Swifambo for money she received and we confirmed that the jurisdiction to attach her house. ADV VAS SONI     That is correct.     No, I do not know what the house is valued.  I think it is in the region of R 12 million.     That is correct.     That is how I understand it.     [No audible reply]      Yes, I see.     I think this was – the flow of funds, the basic flow of funds was done by our legal team and myself.     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      The figures as contained in the report ...[intervenes]      ...has been confirmed, yes.     That is correct.     I was not aware of it at all.       It must close on a year or going for a year.     It cost a lot of money because all the detail.  We would have saved a lot of time if we had known about the Sacks report.  That would have been a very quick basis for what we were after.       No, Chair I was not told at all.       That is just over R 900 million.     That is correct.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct.     I was aware of that, yes. Vossloh      Yes, that will raise concerns.     The entity that was paid was not a party to the contract, so yes, yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     It is Mr Landgrebe, he is the auditor of both these companies.     R30 554 000.     That is correct, that is how I…     1,68 million.     That is correct.     Those are all the payments as per point 5.2.2, that would include Mr Landgrebe, Mashaba, Right Wave Aim Investments.  Yes, that would include.     22,664 million.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Really, I have not been able to establish that, Chair.     As far as I – yes, it was Mrs Cynthia Parish and a Mr Jameson.     It think they are both American citizens.     Those were payments made to Similex, which is Mrs Gomes’ company and they were paid to Nkosi Sebela Incorporated, 31 million, and to Noels Hussain, .4 million.     That is correct.

It’s quite clear.    Or …    What I did, I didn’t totalled that up.  I just totalled that up now on those two companies.      But if you take all the companies that fall under the control of Mr Mashaba, the total properties bought after the is 92,4 million.    I just no.  I just added it up just before we started here.     Because there were no totals.    It’s not on there.  No it’s not on there.    I’ll provide you with that.      Yes.    I’ve got that.    That’s correct.    That’s correct Chair.
