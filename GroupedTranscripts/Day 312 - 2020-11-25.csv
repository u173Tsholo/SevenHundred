CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Chaskalson, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.  It seems we are continuing for the rest of the week with evidence relating to EOH.    Yes okay thank you.    You may be seated Mr Powell.    Flow of Funds Bundle 1 – right and it appears at page?    71.      Yes.    Oh yes so it ends at 374 and then at 375 is another report?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.      You just have to raise your voice Mr Powell.    Otherwise I cannot hear.  Ja.    Okay.    Mr Chaskalson do you want to do the formalities first?    Yes.    Yes no that is fine.  But let us just confirm.  Mr Powell look t page 75 is that your signature at the top there?    And you deposed to this affidavit before a Commissioner of Oaths?    You confirm that the affidavit starting at page 71 is your affidavit and its contents are to the best of your knowledge and belief true and correct?    Okay.  We – Mr Chaskalson you would like me to admit it as Exhibit?    BB2.    If the annexures are part of the affidavit – are annexures to the affidavit then we do not have to admit them separately.      But if they are separate then we have to admit them separately.    Okay.    Then we will just – so it will be BB2 – BB2 only or BB2 point something?    Okay.  Okay the affidavit of Mr Steven David Powell starting at page 71 together with its annexures is admitted as Exhibit BB2.1.  Ja.    Mr Chaskalson you might wish just to give a spelling – spelling of some of the surnames for – to – for the convenience of the transcribers.  Ja at least now that there are some of – as they get mentioned.    So just to clarify Mr Powell.  So the FNB account number that appears on the extreme left that is whose account? MR    Okay alright.    Thank you.    Okay.  Page 700?    Yes okay.    The question is whether you…    Are aware…    Of what position.  Oh you need to check.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Thank you.    Maybe before that can I just check Mr Powell whether as you understand the position NG are initials or what is it?  I just see that the N is capital letter but the g is small letter.  Normally one would write initials in capital letters.  Do you know or you do not know?    Oh okay alright.    Yes.    Yes and Sintwa is S for Sugar –i-n-t-w-a and there is JM in brackets after the surname.    Yes okay.    Yes.    yes.    Ja it would be – ja it would be.    Yes thank you.    Okay I am sorry.  Just repeat – you say the payments which are reflected in this table seemed to happen immediately after what?    yes.    Yes.  So – so first Mr Mackay would received deposits into his account.    And then these payments would happen?    That seemed to be the patters.  Okay alright.    Okay.    So the table at 722 reflects a transfer or transfers from whose account?  From Mr Mackay’s personal account?    Oh okay to the accounts of the different people.    Okay.    Yes.  And it comes from the same source?    Yes okay.  Okay.  In other words I guess what you are saying is one were to sit down and look at the different tables that you have indicated one will – and look at dates one could see a deposit going into Mr Mackay’s personal account coming from – and then immediately or soon thereafter transfer into the account in one or other exposed, politically exposed person.     Okay alright.     Well, Mr Chaskalson, I am sorry.  I just want to mention that in the context of another work stream, a witness who gave evidence here, I think Mr Sodi.  He said that his then business partner, Mr Mpambani, said that he wanted to unlock business opportunities in the Provincial Government of the Free State for their joint venture. So was this some kind of unlocking business opportunities?     ...position did it entail?     Yes.     Okay alright ...[intervenes]      Okay alright. [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Mr Chaskalson, I am sorry I interrupted you.     Ja, it is at the top.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Where does that ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Yes. MR     Oh, yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson.  As you direct him to specific topics, if you can just mention the page?     Ja, page ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     [laughs]     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay.     Yes, okay.  No, that is fine     Yes, okay.     That is on the next page, is that right?     Okay thank you.     Oh, okay.     Yes, that is at page 161.     Ja, okay.     And the reference to – I mean, SAP Services Business Unit.     Of EOH Mathombo.     H’m.     This has got nothing to do with the South African Police?     Okay.     Yes, okay.  Alright.     Thank you.  476.  Yes?     Hang on one second.     476.  I have got the Addendum A.   [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     ...service provider is black.     Under payment arrangements, it is not blank.     [laughs]     [laughs]     Yes, you wanted to make – you wanted to say something Mr Powell.     Agreements.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.       [laughs]  Ja, no, no.  It is not blank/black(?).   Well, I am sorry Mr Chaskalson.  Interestingly, what is blank also is rates, requirements, position and rates  Am I right?     Yes.     Okay.     I am sorry.  Is it page 186?     Alright.  Thank you.     Yes.     Yes.     Which name came first?  Was it TSS or was it ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Is that how it is known now?     Oh, it used to be ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay that is what I wanted to know.     Okay.     Yes.  So early payments that previously made here reflected somewhere as having come from TSS to whoever, would be the same source as the payments that may now reflect as coming from EOH Africa?     No?     Oh, okay.  Okay, okay.     Ja.     Oh, okay, okay.     Does it talk about deliverables?     Yes.     Is there a definition of the VOIP VPN services or if not do you know what that refers to?     What is it?     Okay.     Oh, okay.     Yes and VPN, Mr Chaskalson, VPN services?     Oh, okay, alright, thank you.     Is that at page 87?     Yes.  No, that is fine, ja.  Okay.     Okay.       And CCMA, does it refer to the CCMA that we all know or is it something else.     Okay.     So there is a column for VOIP and a column for VPN services.     And VOP is – CCMA was billed…     180 000 and then TSS fees I assume from that was 117 000.     And then fees for Molelwane was 63 000 coming from the amount billed to the CCMA.     And then under VPN services, it is R220 000 billed to the CCMA and then TSS fees are 150 000 from that and Molelwane fees 70 000.     And monthly Molelwane fees is 133 000.     Yes, yes, yes.     So it looks like – does it look like – well, certainly in terms of VPN services it looks like the fees are split between TSS and Molelwane.     And I do not know if the same applies to VOIP, I am not sure.     Yes, okay, alright.     Of course, what you said was true at that time.     Yes but subsequently you found more.     Okay.     Yes.  Just one second, Mr Powell, just to go back.  There is Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd and there is Molelwane Consulting, is that correct?   And Molelwane Consulting is a subsidiary of Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd or not?     It is a separate entity.     But it could be a separate entity but still being a subsidiary, you are not sure.     But the directorship, is it the same, do you know?     Yes.     Yes.     On which one?     Consulting.     Yes, okay, alright.  And in regard to Molelwane Consulting he was the sole director, the last time you checked?     Yes.     Okay, okay.  And Florence Makhubo was one name we saw.     Did that name relate to Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd?     And she remains the sole director.     Okay.     Yes, yes, of 47 I thought?     Okay, no, thank you, I just wanted to re-orientate myself.  So we are now dealing with – at page 398 with Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd.  Okay, thank you.   Oh.  But he had resigned from Molelwane Holdings in 2011, if I recall correctly.     Consulting, yes, yes.     Would this be the convenient time, Mr Chaskalson?     Yes.  We will take the tea adjournment, it is now about eighteen minutes past eleven, we will resume at twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     I guess – well, maybe with electronic transfers there is no problem effecting a transfer of money from say TSS Management Services to Molelwane Consulting when the invoice does not come from Molelwane Consulting but comes from Molelwane Holdings but I would have thought that in the old way of doing things if there was a cheque written Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd the bank would not put that cheque into the account of Molelwane Consulting.       Yes.     Yes, yes, yes, okay, alright. ADV CHASKALSON     That is now from TSS management side.     Yes but from the bank’s side they would not be able to see anything like that.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, alright.      I am looking for the invoice number.     Yes.     Ja.     I am sorry, on the – we are at page 398, is that right?     I see where it says tax invoice.     Ja?     Oh yes, okay, thank you.     Yes, that is 30 November 2014.     Ja, okay.     Do you know what LAN and WAN services are?     Yes.     Okay.  Well, I see that the invoice does not reflect when these services were provided.  I take it was the same with the other invoice, just provided what services were provided but not exactly when.     Yes.  Okay, alright.     Okay.     One second?  The document starts at page 198, is that right?     But Mr Chaskalson wants us to look at page 200, hey?     Oh.     Well, I see on the extreme right column there are – there is a reference to 2012 but there is also 13 and 2011.     Or could it be different years?     Sorry, did you say at page 195?     Yes, at the bottom.     Oh, yes.     Ja, okay.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     I have.  I do not know how many Molelwane there are but I have picked up the one I think that he is talking about, the amount is 1,350, level 4 and not applicable, not applicable and then at the end TSS.     That reflects that TSS paid R1,350 million to Molelwane Consulting CC, is that right?     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Maybe just – I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, just for the sake of completeness, is the date when that payment was effected reflected on page 200 or is the amount of 1,350 million the total of various payments over a certain period?     Yes, okay, alright.     Yes, okay, okay.     Oh yes, I see that, thank you.  Just that they made a bit blacker there, I think it would have been much better if it was the same as the actual page.  Okay, okay, alright.     Yes.     Yes.  No, thank you.     Well, you know, this concept of sole source seems to be abused quite a lot from the evidence I have heard over the past two and half years and one of the questions I have asked is, if you believe that a particular entity is the only source that provides a certain product or a certain service, why is that justification for not inviting others who may or may not exist to tender because if that entity is the only one that provides that product or service, it will be the only one that will respond to the invitation.  But if there are others, they will also respond, if you are mistaken in thinking that that entity is the only one.   So, as a government entity, you suffer nothing by opening up the whole thing to open tender.  Where there is no emergency, why do you not advertise for the whole world and if there is only one entity that responds because it is the only one, that is fine.  So I am yet to – that somebody will explain to me why the fact that you are a sole source for a certain product or service should justify not inviting whoever.     Just in case you are mistaken to think that is the only source.     So – ja, okay, alright.  Mr Chaskalson.     I am sorry, I think I did not hear the page.     Oh, I am there.  So okay, alright.  Okay.     Yes.     Is that just for accommodation or is more than accommodation?     Yes. MR     Yes.     Maybe just for convenience you can start – read it from the beginning again, the email at 606.     I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Powell …[intervenes]     Oh, yes.  So the forwarding is from Patrick Makhubedu to Rene Jonker but the actual email which is in the middle is from Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makhubedu, is that right?     Oh, okay so I think start with the email.     And then once we know who it was from and who it was to then we can go to who the addressee forwarded it to.     Ja, okay.     Yes, just read the email first, ja.     No, no what I meant read it again.     Regards Geoff Makhubo, ANC Regional Treasury?     Yes, okay. ADV CHASKALSON     Sorry just to complete the – it is something you dealt with but I like it in proper sequence.         So Mr Geoff Makhubo sends an email to Mr Patrick Makhubedu…[intervene]     …requesting assistance for the launch of the youth league for the ANC greater Johannesburg and when Mr Makhubedu receives it he forwards it to Rene Jonker, is that right?      Okay then continue then.       Yes and that is not a small amount that is just over a half a million rand.       Yes.      At page 607 that is the document we are looking at, is it not?     Yes.      Yes.        Okay.       Yes, okay.       I am sorry you said it is Mr Ebrahim Laher is copied just for the convenience of the transcribers the surname there is L-a-h-e-r.       Ja, okay.      Okay.       I am sorry Mr Powell I think read each item and its figure at the same time so that one knows.                Ja.     You may read them because, ja I think it might be quicker.       Yes.        One second Mr Chaskalson, Mr Powell I do not know whether you had a chance of adding up all these amounts to see…[intervene]     Oh there it is okay they provide it ja, okay.       Oh okay.                Thank you.      That is 6…[intervene]     Ja.      Yes.       Just one second, I just note the – I do not know whether it is the informal nature of the salutation, Dear Patrick, it is the bank writing to him maybe it is a client that has a close relationship with whoever is writing from Standard Bank or maybe this is, I would have expected Dear Mr Makhubedu but maybe that is old fashioned.          Okay, alright yes thank you.  Then you said I should go to page?     Yes.      The figures on this page are not as clear as one would have liked them to be just start afresh, go back to the first figure you mentioned then let me try identify it.         Oh, ja.      Ja, you can read it.      Before we proceed Mr Chaskalson you referred earlier onto there being three total amounts on this page.  I can see two but I cannot see the one which you said was for February 2014, I did not see anything written total whereas the other two you have got total and you have got main total.  So I do not know if I am missing anything.             Oh yes now I see it, ja okay thank you.        That is under August 2014, is that right?      Yes, Okay.      Ja, I just want to refresh my memory this reflects payments from Mfundi Mobile Networks to the people mentioned here, is that correct?      Oh the first two that is sales and ja those two sales that is payment to Mfundi.         And then the balance would be payments from Mfundi or by Mfundi.       Okay no thank you.        Is that is the one just immediately below the one you have just read of cost of sales ANC?    But at the time of these payments Mr Makhubo was still a member of Molelwane Consulting CC, is that right?    Oh okay.  In Molelwane Consulting for a certain period the members were Mr Geoff Makhubo and Florence Makhubo is that right?    Both Makhubo’s.  But in – at some stage in 19.   Mr Geoff Makhubo resigned from Molelwane Consulting CC.    But in 2014 which you are dealing with they were both still members of the CC?    Okay.  Am I right to say Consulting – Molelwane Consulting was a CC?    Yes okay alright.    It was not processed.    Yes.    Yes.    yes.    Yes.  Yes okay.    Is that the bundle?    Bundle 3.    Okay.     Okay.  You might just take the page out and then you can put it back.  Yes thank you.    Do we know which year 22 August – which year – do we know?    Yes.    Okay alright.    Okay.  Yes okay.    One – that first one of 22 August you did mention the amount eh R80 000.00?    Okay.      What is the page number?    Thank you.    I think you may have two millions there.    R106 185 395.36.    Ja.    Yes, ja.     That total that you have just read Mr Powell would – is that the total given of the quotation for the job that they wanted to do?    Ja okay alright.  Yes page 778 is that right?    Yes I do.    Just hang on one second.  The proposal was dated what?    Oh 16 and this is the invoice dated 26 June?  Is that right 2014?    Ja okay alright.    Just to make sure I understand.  Since the total of the total appearing on this invoice is the same as I understand it as the total of the quotation or of the proposal.    This suggests that the work would have been completed because you – one would expect that you put in your invoice after you have done the work.    Would that be your expectation as well?    Yes.    Okay no I just wanted to make sure I am following.  Yes okay Mr Chaskalson I think you – I interrupted you.    Page 376?    Yes okay.    Hang on one second.  So if you look at the reference of 8387 the first item on your table at page 376 that would be a contract that expired in 2012 or thereabout?    But the invoice that we looked at two/three minutes ago which had the same reference 8387 was in June 14?    And it purported to be an invoice for – or connected or arising from work connected with the proposal made in April 2014?    Okay alright.    The page that you would like us to go to is in another bundle?    Oh.    Okay and what was the page number?    Okay alright.  Yes I have got it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay we will take the lunch adjournment – adjournment now and then we will resume at two.    We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.       That is 616?     Okay.     Do you have any understanding whether the R 2 million is payment made on the 13t h of December as reflected or whether it is R 2 million is a total of a number of payments made over a certain period of time?     H’m.     Was is it not the unsolicited proposal?     Ja.     Yes.     Did you say 626?     626.  Okay.     He likes Cape Town too much.     [laughs]  Ja, it comes from The City of Johannesburg.       Before we get there, and maybe the document you are referring us to, Mr Chaskalson will enlighten me.  This figure, is it connected in any way with the proposal or something else that we have dealt with before or not really?     Oh, Mr Powell.  Okay.  But if you cannot remember that is fine.  I just thought the figures seems ...[intervenes]      ...figure I had seen before.     Yes, yes.     Oh.     It might not be.  Ja, okay.     Yes, okay alright.     [laughs]     Yes. MR     To say...[intervenes]      Do a letter.  Sign a letter along these lines on your letterheads.       H’m     Now the other letters that you referred to a few minutes ago, there were three of them, I think.   Relate to Mr Makhubo sent to Mr Makhubedu.  Who were sent to Mr Makhubedu in his capacity as Johannesburg original Treasurer ...[intervenes]        ...of the ANC, Johannesburg to sign on the letterheads of the ANC.  This appears to be different.  It cannot be a point to sign in that capacity.     Yes.  So the contemplation is that whoever must sign the letter appearing at page 784, would be either Mr Makhubo if he was part of The City of Johannesburg at time, or some official in The City of Johannesburg.  Is that correct?     Yes, yes.  Okay alright.     I think you said MEC but I think ...[intervenes]      Ja, MMC.  Ja.     Now...  So, in effect, Mr Makhubedu works on the basis that The City of Johannesburg is going to –     That is in May...  Well, he may have back-dated it.  It may be September 2014.  This is after a series of payments that he seems to have been involved in.     And then donating to the ANC and so on.  And having those dealings with Mr Makhubedu.  Is that right?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     H’m, h’m.  Yes, okay.  Mr Chaskalson.     Yes?     Yes, okay alright.     Molelwane Consulting.  Yes.     Okay, okay.     I see there is no full stop at the end of the last sentence on page 622.     I do not know whether that means it is cut off or that means they stopped, they did not put in the full stop.   “The Regional Executive Committee will appreciate contribution of at least 2,5 million to ensure a successful conference.” That is my last line.     Yes.     And then of course in the following page that is where it says the banking details and so on.     What is that?     Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yes.  No, that is fine, I have taken note of it.  It does look like the ANC was quite active in seeking donations during these particular months.     Ja, from EOH, ja.  Thank you.     I am sorry, I am 296, is that where you are too?     The dates that I – oh, okay, I see 20 September, ja.     Okay.   Okay, ja, beneficiary Malolwane Consulting and then the branch and the account number and the reference, the reference is TSSMS Genven.     Yes.     It is 20 September.     Is 20 September 2014 the date of the transaction?     Ja, okay.     So before that just so that I understand this document at page 296, it says Transaction Report, it is produced by who?  And it is a report of what?     On TSS?     Okay.     Oh, okay.  And the items mentioned at the bottom there below rejection reason, legend, are those …[intervenes]     Oh, that is not relevant.     Oh, what is relevant is what appears before that namely the transaction of R570 000?     Which reflects – so it would be – it would reflect a payment by TSS Managed Services to Malolwane Consulting on the 20 September 2014.     Into that account number and that branch.     Okay, alright.     Yes.  What is your – in those instances where you say, as you do, in regard to this payment that you, that is you and your team, tried to establish what work had been done and you did not find any evidence.     How would you rate that you made a mistake, there is evidence, depending on the thoroughness of your investigation.  How would you...?     Yes.     Yes.     And the former employee said they did not do any work.     Ja.  Yes.     Oh, okay, okay.  But your team, your investigation team, would it have taken statements from various persons who were interviewed to say what do you know about this?     And would that be statements that are stored somewhere?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  But you feel reasonably confident that where you say you could not find any evidence of work chances are good that no work was done.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  Thank you.  Mr Chaskalson?     Just one second Mr Chaskalson.  So the long and short of a number of these transactions, Mr Powell, is that there were many occasions when EOH or other entity under EOH would pay a lot of money to Malolwane Consulting or Malolwane Holdings for no work that has been done as far as your investigation has gone.     Yes.     Okay.     Maybe, Mr Chaskalson it would be convenient to put in a divider or something just that will indicate where one finds each one of the three reports so that it is easier to go to it much more quicker.     Oh, okay.     Okay, okay.  No, that is fine.     Okay.       Ja, okay.     I am busy looking for June 2014 or 2016.  Oh, here it is, ja.     Yes.     Okay.     Where at page 91 do I find – oh, there it is, the reference to 404 million.  Okay, I found that now.      Okay, are we still on that page?     Yes, okay.     480.     Okay.     Ja, I think let us have that bundle at hand.     Okay.  Ja, just give me the whole bundle.  He might not refer to it now.  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  But at this stage you just want me to go to 480?     Of bundle 1, ja.     Yes, okay.     Yes, that is N-y-i-k-o, I think it’s Nyiko.     Mutileni, M-u-t-i-l-e-n-i.  Yes.     So, I am sorry, Nyiko Mutileni is an EOH person, nè?     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Yes.       This is Mr Ebrahim Laher.     Writing to whom?  Writing to Asher Bohbot or…?     Yes, okay, alright.     Okay.     Okay, alright, thank.     Yes.     Yes. MR     Tumelo Kganane.   Acting Group Head Information, Communications, Technology Information Management.  That is somebody from the City of Johannesburg.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I can see that.     I’m sorry, there is that email that says, “Hi Pat, please call him and let you and I meet him, from Ashley”, Are you now referring to, below that?     Okay, what is below that is not legible at all on my copy.     But if I read it…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes, okay.     I’m sorry Mr Chaskalson, I just want to understand that last sentence, is that we need a number urgently that can be allocated for goodwill, then smile, to the organisation.  That number is supposed to be what, money?     As I understand it.     Yes.     Yes, okay, alright.  Yes Mr Chaskalson?     Yes, 646.     Yes, don’t speak too far away from the mic, Mr Powell.     Yes, at page 646. MR     Yes.     Yes, that’s the account of Molelwane Consulting CC?   And the description, P Makhubedu…[intervenes].     Does that mean it comes from Mfundi to Makhubedu?     Okay.     341?     Yes.     Okay, that’s alright.     So, the first attachment is the one at 345?     Okay.     Hang on Mr Powell, you referred to the date of December 2016, but I only see 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2017 on page 346, am I on the right page, is 346 the right page?     It says profit and loss report.    Then it says, below that, Mfundi Mobile Networks Pty Ltd, and then it says, date range 1 March 16 to 28 February 2017.      Oh, okay, now – I thought he was mentioning a particular date and I was looking for it so – okay, so you’re talking about the column under December?     Oh okay.    Oh okay, alright, not that’s fine.      Mr Chaskalson, let me try and just follow, I’ve just made a note just above the…[indistinct 19.51] to say that’s all 2016, is that correct?     Okay, alright and he said sales.  My first reference to sales is “Sales COJ SAP support”, is that correct?     Yes.     Right, okay.     You remain at page 346?     And it is 488 of money flows Bundles 1?     On what page, 651?     I’m sorry just hang on one second Mr Powell.     You’re saying the bank statement at page 651?     Did you say what is the date, I see 16 April 2016 to 17 May, that’s the date you are talking about?     Okay, alright.     So, it’s like there’s a pattern, when the account is very low then there’s a top-up?     Okay.     Okay firstly at 346 that’s a bank statement.     For Molelwane Consulting CC.     I’m at Bundle 3.     Oh, okay.     Bundle 1 and what page?     Okay, yes, I’ve got it.     Yes, okay, yes.     Yes.     The last column is?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Is it R50 000 I thought it was R400 000?     Oh, okay, I think – no I was drawing a line and I’m not using a ruler so – ja okay so it’s that R50 000.    Hm.    What was your question Mr Chaskalson?   For Molelwane [speaking over one another].    Okay alright.  And he – the answer is none as far as you …    Yes.    Can I ask this question?  In the course of your investigation did you establish whether Molelwane Holdings Pty Limited during the times when it sent invoices but those – the money – the payment went into Molelwane Consulting?  Did you establish whether Molelwane Holdings Pty Limited did have a bank account?    It would be interesting to …    To find out whether Molelwane Holdings Pty Limited did have a bank account.    But money was not put into that account.    Or whether it did not have a bank account.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay.    yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  No that is fine.    Yes.    Yes thank you.    The reference to elections there in 2016 must have been a reference to the local government elections?    2016 okay.    What page again Mr Chaskalson?    Okay.  Still on Bundle 1?    That is quite a large sum going into Molalwane Consulting particularly if there is no work that was done.  Yes Mr Chaskalson.    Yes, yes I have.    Yes.    Of course was Peter or somebody said I do not ask questions?    Yes.    Hm.  Yes.  Mr Chaskalson.     Is it 267 or 367?    Yes.    Hm.      I am sorry Mr Chaskalson.  You say this document at page 849 represents payments into Mr Makhubo’s personal account, is that right?    Ja.    Ja.    Oh okay.  I – either Holdings or Consulting CC? ADV CHASKALSON    Yes.    Oh CC not Holdings.    Oh okay alright.  Yes thank you.    Sorry the one you have just dealt with did you say 31 May 2016?    Okay.  Is it that amount of R50 000.00?    Yes.    That is R200 000.00?    Okay alright.    Ja.    Ja.  Yes.    You said page 269 of Bundle 3?  Are you at 269?    Oh then we go to 270?    Okay.  And what transaction – what date?    Yes. ADV CHASKALSON    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.    504 on Bundle 1.    Okay.     Thank you.     What is the page number again?     Okay.     One second.  Let me get there.     Yes?     Hang on.       Are you at 571?     What page are you on?     521?     Oh, okay.     Yes, yes.       I was making a note on the previous reference.  Okay, I am sorry.  I am going to have to ask you to start afresh.     On that page, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  H’m.  Is it usual for a municipality or a government department to ask for donations as far as you know, Mr Powell?     Yes.  It is certainly not something that ...[intervenes]      H’m.     And it just seems strange that any private company should spend half a million of its money on taking a local government officials or any government officials on a trip somewhere.       Yes.     H’m.     Oh, not municipal officials?     Yes, yes.     Ja.       But for one.     Oh, okay.  No, I thought it was The City of Johannesburg officials.  Okay, no ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     Okay ...[intervenes]      H’m.  Okay.     Okay, thank you.  Mr Chaskalson     Mr Chaskalson, we are at quarter past four.  Let us talk about the way forward.  We may need to take a short adjournment.  I can still continue.  But I just want to have an idea, just talk about how much is left.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Well, from my point of view, depending on what your situation is and Mr Powell’s availability and his counsel.  I can go on.  I can still go on for some time.     Ja.     Ja, maybe we could go on up to – about six o’clock or just before six o’clock and see how far we are.     And at that stage, if, for example, all that is left is an hour, it may well be it is an hour or so.  It may well be that we could look at seeing whether if Mr Powell is available tomorrow.  We could start an hour earlier or we slot him in at some other time.  But I have flexibility on my side in terms of going on.       Yes.     Yes.  Mr Powell, how is your situation about continuing for some time?     You have no problem.  And your counsel, no problem?       Yes.     Yes.  Okay.  Maybe, let us take a short break now and then resume.  We are at – what – seventeen minutes past.  If you are going to need to rearrange flights, you might need, about what, 10 to 15-minutes?     Five minutes is fine.  Okay let us take a ten minutes’ break.  We will resume just before half-past.     Okay.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     So this is a different amount to the one you have dealt with at 525.     Oh, same amount.  Oh, okay.     I am sorry, I am sorry, at 525, on my page 525, the amount that is right at the bottom appears to be 4 560 000.     And then – oh, okay, at page 527 it is the same amount, hey?     It is a separate transaction but the amount on each transaction is the same.     Oh, okay.     Okay.     Yes.     Okay.       Is that total 9,120 total when you add up 4 point something and…?     Those two amounts?     4.560.     Oh, okay, alright.     Okay.     Okay.     Did you mention a page to which we must go, Mr Chaskalson?     344, okay.     Anybody’s initials?  If you do not know it is fine.      Anyway, I wanted to ask the question.  Is the reference to recon in this email a reference to a reconciliation of the amounts?     Okay.     And that request, where there was the figure of 50 million, did I understand it correctly to be a request for them to make whatever contribution they could make so that it did not necessarily – it was not a request that they must pay the whole amount of 50 million?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     The impression I got and maybe there was no basis for it was that maybe it was the kind of document that the ANC may have sent to different companies and then each company would just see what it could contribute.     Yes, yes.  Okay, thank you.     So is the position that EOH would have received and express request from the ANC on the ANC’s letterheads about that 50 million?     But there would be no record of EOH response to that request directly.     But there would be money that was given to Mfundi and then what one would see later is the ANC would send invoices to Mfundi and so on.     Okay.     Just before we proceed, you remember we have been seeing this sales and cost of sales, in the context of Mfundi Mobile and the ANC, cost of sales would mean what on your understanding?     Yes.     Yes, so Mfundi did not sell anything to the ANC and...     And the ANC did not sell anything to Mfundi or...     Yes, okay.  And when I see cost of sales below that where it says less management fees and so on, I must understand that as far as you are concerned there were no sales.     Okay, alright.  Mr Chaskalson?     Maybe, Mr Chaskalson, I am sorry to interrupt you.  Just to put it bluntly, is your understanding that where they say sales they were just concealing the true nature of the arrangements and the transactions?     Yes, yes, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  Mr Chaskalson?     So that would be – they would reflect this as sales between EOH and Mfundi, not between Mfundi and the ANC, is that right?     And then when Mfundi then pays to the ANC it would reflect that as what?     As cost of sales too.     Ja, okay.     So the 2.4 million is there where it says less management fees and taxes, that is their cut?     Ja, okay, alright.     2016 is it?     Ja.     This is an email from Geoff Makhubo to Mr Patrick Makhubedu. MR     And it relates to a certain invoice 21326 from Black & White T Shirts and then the attachments are then given there.     Oh, okay.     345?     Okay.  Yes.     I am sorry, I have lost the page where we have got that list.     Oh, I am sorry, I took it out and ja, okay, I have got it, yes.     Yes.     I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, I am making a note on my page 345 where to find the …[intervenes]     So ja, I have made that note but the earlier one for Black & White do you remember what page?     691.  Okay, thank you.  Yes?     I see that the email address for Jola D Matonga is Gauteng.co.za.     Yes, at not at Johannesburg City or you don’t know?     Ja, okay, alright.     Yes, okay.     Five nine zero, nine seven six?     Sorry Mr Powell I think your voice has gone down a little bit, it is late in the day.     Yes.     And this is what page now?     Okay, alright.     Thank you Mr Chaskalson.   I am sorry, is that at 344 or ...[intervenes]      Oh, that’s the sheet that I took out.     Okay, ja you said we look at Taj and what is the amount?     Yes, I can see that.      Okay when you refer to the table you refer to the table at what page?     At 65?     685.        Oh yes, I can see  that.  Thank you.     Yes no one does get the picture.     Yes.     Do I need to go to volume 1?     Ja, it is legible.      Maybe somebody should assist the witness.     I was saying Mr Chaskalson the challenge here is that I have is to see which figure relates to which entity, I don’t know whether – with bigger spaces between them it would be and maybe with lines in between.     Yes.     Ja no that’s fine because I think if you were to ask me I would give you all the wrong numbers.     I am sorry but the invoice at page 800 is an invoice sent by Flywell Travel to Mfundi Mobile Networks and it purports to relate to the travelling of Makhubo Geoffrey as reflected therein, that is what it reflects is that right?     Okay, alright.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     How much was your estimate of how much more time would be necessary to finish his evidence?     Yes, well what I was thinking is the more limited time is needed for him to finish the better it is to accommodate him on another date, we are left with an hour it is easier than if it is four hours, if it is two hours it is easier than if it is three hours, but I am quite happy to stop here so your estimate in terms of what you wish to happen to achieve is that if we stop here we probably need about three hours that we must find somewhere.     Yes, yes.     No that is fine, I think then we should stop now then we will look at when we can slot him in to do the balance of the – to deal with the balance of the matters, that you have in mind you should deal with.      Ja, ja.  Okay Mr Powell we will stop here and obviously we will ask you to come back some other time so that you can deal with the other matters that Mr Chaskalson has in mind you should deal with.     And then tomorrow Mr Chaskalson we have one witness that is Ramosebudi?     Yes and what is your estimate of how much time we need for him?     A day should be fine?     Okay alright, no that is fine, I was asking because I think I have agreed with Mr Kennedy that we can have – I can have an evening session with one of his witnesses who will take about two hours but I said to him his witness might need to be here by four o’clock but maybe we will start at five all depending, so and I was thinking whether there may be a need for us to start at nine rather than ten for purposes of your witness but if you think if we start at ten we should be able to be done by four or five ...[intervenes]      Okay, no that is fine.   So we are going to then adjourn for the day.  I thank you very much, we adjourn. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Good morning Chairperson.  Chairperson our witness today is Steven David Powell who is the forensic investigator at ENS Africa and who has conducted investigations at EOH.    Chair today’s evidence will relate to EOH.  Tomorrow’s evidence will be the evidence of Mr Ramosebudi which concerns ACSA, SAA and Transnet and Friday’s evidence will be from the Executive Mayor Mr Makubo about matters in this municipality.    Chair for housekeeping purposes the affidavit of Mr Powell is in Flow of Funds Bundle 1 page 71.      71 Chair.    And attached to that affidavit are three reports with bundles of supporting documents that Mr Powell has – or Mr Powell and his team have produced.   The first report is at page 1 – Volume – Bundle 1 page 82.      And it together with annexures runs all the way to page 374 of Bundle 1 where the second report appears at page 375.      Indeed Chair.    And the – that report runs until the end of Volume – Bundle 1.    And the third report commences at page 3 of Bundle 2.    For most of this morning’s testimony Chair we will be concerned with Bundle 1.    Mr Powell can I ask you first just to confirm under oath that the three reports that I have described to the Chairperson were prepared by your team.  The first one at page 82 of Bundle 1 and that was submitted to the commission if I remember correctly on the 11 August.    The second at page 375 of Bundle 1 and it is if I remember correctly it was submitted on 9 September of this year    And the third at Bundle 2 page 3 which was submitted at – in – was it November the 11 t h this year?    Mr Powell your affidavit appears at page 71 of the first bundle.  If I might take you to that affidavit now?    And in paragraphs 1 to 9 you describe who you are – can you briefly tell the Chairperson?    I beg your pardon Chair.    I have done it again.  Can we admit the affidavit of Mr Powell together with the supporting reports as Annexure BB2?    BB2 Chair.    And I am in your hands Chair as to whether …    They …    They are referred to in the affidavit.    And they are part of the affidavit.    Let us make it BB2.1 in case there is a need for an additional document to be put to Mr Powell in the course of his testimony.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Powell can you briefly describe to the Chair your qualifications and your place at present employment?    Certainly.  Chair I hold the degrees BProc, LLB attained from the University of Cape Town and I was admitted as an Advocate at the Cape Bar in 1991.  For the past sixteen years I have been an executive in the law firm ENS Africa and a role that I play as an executive at ENS Africa is I head up the forensic services division.   I am the Managing Director of ENS Forensics PTY Limited a subsidiary of ENS Africa.  I started my career Chair as a Prosecutor in the Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town and I moved to Regional Court and I ended my career as a Prosecutor in the office of the then Attorney General.  I spent eight years as a Prosecutor.   After that I moved to the Auditing firm Deloitte Chair and I headed the forensic services of Deloitte in the Western Cape for six years and I was a partner at Deloitte and for the last sixteen years I have been at ENS Africa.  Thank you Chair.    Thank you Mr Powell.  Now your evidence today is going to concern matters relating to EOH. Some of the background to your involvement at – with EOH has been dealt with by Mr van Coller who testified on Monday.  But can you very briefly turn to paragraph 14 of your affidavit on Bundle 1 page 72 and very briefly just describe to the Chair how you became involved in EOH and what the nature of your investigation there was?    Thank you Mr Powell.  Before we get to the Johannesburg – or the issues relating to the City of Johannesburg I just want to take you to paragraph 27 of your affidavit page 74 Bundle 1 where you speak about a Mr Jehan Mackay.  Can you tell the Chair who Mr Mackay was or is?    I will do that Chair.  Jehan Mackay as I understand if J-e-h-a-n first name and the surname is M-a-c-k-a-y.  At paragraph 28 you talk about suspicious payments from an FNB account belonging to Mr Mackay.  Can I ask you first how did you discover those payments?    Can you take the Chair through that table of payments in paragraph 29?    But before you leave that – that reference Chair if I can for convenience sake direct you to the relevant pages in the bundle if you can annotate the table where the relevant bank statements are.  That first entry is to be found at page 700 of Bundle 1.    Indeed.    But Mr Powell were you able to identify who the recipient of this payment was?    And can you tell the Chair this is a payment in 2015.  What was Mr Kodwa’s position in 2015 – are you aware of that?    Mr Chair I have that here.    Chair I think it is a matter of public record Mr Kodwa was not in government in 2015.    But he was a spokesperson for the ANC.    The second – the second reference?  And Chair the bundle reference for the second reference for the statement is page 704.    The third reference which Chair is at page 708 of the bundle in its original statement.    Chair I wonder if it might be convenient for me to give you Chair.    All of the references.    So that we do not interrupt.    So the first – the first is 700 – page 700.  The second is 704.  The third is 708.  The fourth is 713.  The fifth is 713 as well as is the sixth.  Seventh and I am now at 3 November is 717.  The eighth also – 5 November is 717.  The ninth at 26 November is 717.  The tenth at 28 November is 717.  Then 4 December is 722.  18 December is 722.  2 February is 727.  27 January is 737 and 29 June 731.    Mr Powell you were – you just finished the third entry I think the 12 September entry.    Mr Powell when you looked at the bank statements of Mr Mackay did you notice any patterns relating to the periods around the time in which these payments were made on the statements themselves?    And can you…    And can you tell the Chair who TSS are?    And from whom was it acquired?    And just to give the Chair an example of this phenomenon that you are describing can I ask you to turn to Bundle 1 – sorry Bundle 1 page 722.    And on Bundle – on page 722 are two of the transactions that you have already described to the Chair for December there is a payment of R40 000.00 referenced NG Kodwa / 12.   And on 18 December there is a payment of R100 000.00 referenced Mr Siyabulela Sintwa. Can you look at 8 December?    And just tell the Chair what you see there?     Mr Powell, we are now going to move to matters relating to the City of Johannesburg.  And before we get into particular tenders.  I would like you to take the Chair briefly through a description of the who players, we are going to be seen, are.  And if I can ask you to go to your first report at telephone numbers 1, page 84 where you start doing that.     At 4.1, you describe TSS Managed Services but you have already explained to TSSR to the Chair.  At 4.2, you deal with Mr Patrick Makhubedu.  Can you explain to the Chair who Mr Makhubedu is?     Now you have spoken about his position being Business Development Executive in the Public Sector.  Can you explain to the Chair what Business Development embraces?       We will get to that in detail in due course.  Let us continue through the list of individuals who we will be describing.     Not at all Chair.  At paragraph 51, you refer to Mr Makhubo and his relationship with Mr Makhubedu that you have been able to see from the outside.   Can you tell the Chairperson what you know about Mr Makhubo and what his commercial relationships with Mr Makhubedu are ...[intervenes]      If I can then take you over the page to page 86.  You have a table of entities that will feature or that you described.  You touched on Zylek.  But can you say something about Molelwane Consulting?     Can you just give the Chair the date of that report because it may become significant later?     Sorry, before you move to Mr Makhubo.  Can you just record the dates that CIPC reflects his resignations having taken place?     I am interested, primarily in Mr Makhubo.  Can I just ask you if you know who the current active members listed as Florence Matlekale Makhubo.  Do you know Florence Matlekale Makhubo is?     Thank you.  Can you talk briefly about Molelwane Holdings next?       Alright.     I am afraid Mr Powell being a sort of trained Forensic Investigator is ahead of me here.  I was not planning on going to the CIPC documents.     So I do not have the references.  He does.     I am just referring to the table on page 86.     But I am sure he will give the references to you Chair.     And Chair, we will see later – or maybe when Mr Makhubo comes, that November 2011 is when Mr Makhubo entered government.     If we can move then to Mfundi Mobile Networks.  You have said a little about Mfundi but ...[intervenes]      ...there is certainly a lot more to say.     Can you give the Chair the reference again?      And do you know anything else about Mr Duma?  If I might refer you back to page 86 of your first report?     While we are talking about the relationship between Mfundi Mobile and EOH  Can you take you to a contract that appears at page 466 of the bundle?  466.     Which describes itself as a teaming agreement.     And this is a document which have furnished or your team furnished to the Commission.  Can you tell the Chairperson what this document is?     If I can ask you to go to the definition of deliverables in that agreement, page 467?     So, I understand, these are going to be the services provided by Mfundi to EOH.  Is that correct?     Can I then ask you to go to Addendum A so that we can see what the services are?     It is at page 476, Chair.     Ja, if I understand Mfundi, it is blank.     Chair, I need to withdraw the remark that I just made.  The payment arrangements are not black.       Mr Powell, if I can take you back to that table on page 86.     That is correct.     Yes, yes.     If we go back to the table on – to 186.  We are not going to be deal with acts of – in your testimony.  So I ask you to go to Present Perfect Investec – Investments.  And tell the Chair what you have learnt about this entity.     Bundle 1, page 86 Chair.     I beg your pardon, Mr Powell.  In fact, we are not going to deal with Present Perfect Investments today either.  So if you can go down to Prime Molecular Technologies.       Sorry, Mr Powell.  If I can just interrupt there  It is a Makhubo because I do not want us to potentially confusing – I do not want the record which potentially confuses ...[intervenes]      And then lastly, Mr Powell.  EOH Africa (Pty) Ltd.     Mr Powell.       Sorry, Mr Powell.  Before you take the Chair to the details in the bundle.  If you can just briefly describe what EOH Africa is and what it used to be.     And it was acquired by EOH when it was TSS, the TS Group when it was TSS Managed Services?  Is that correct?     If I can now ask you, Mr Powell to go to page 87 of the bundle which is where, in your first report, you talk about the contract that you have discovered between Molelwane Holdings and TSSMS.       Can I just ask you to identify it for the Chair and go to page 184?       If you might take the Chair to page 189.     There is a preamble to the contract that located within the context of a specific contract of - if I can take you back to 184.     So these business advisory business development advisory services and change management services according to the contract are going to be provided in the context where TSSMS is providing voice over IP and virtual private network of services to the CCMA.  Is that how you understand it?     And, Chair, IP is internet protocol.     So it is like telephony over the internet.     Virtual private networks.     Then if you go back to your report at page 87 you refer to a payment schedule which you found.  Can I take you to page – that reference is in paragraph 66.4 and maybe if you can just explain to the Chair the relevance of this payment schedule from TSSMS to Molelwane from the …[intervenes]     87, Chair.  I must apologise, Chair, today’s testimony is going involved bouncing backwards and forwards from documents to reports to annexures.     And if you go to 6.4 on page 87 you described this payment schedule.     So now at paragraph 7.1 you refer to an invoice that I will take you to in a minute.     And this was your first report to the Commission, you said we found to date only one Molelwane invoice.      Thank you.     Can I take you to page 398 of bundle 1?     No, Chair, the CIPC records reflect that Florence Matlakhala Makhubo is now the sole director.      Sole member because it is a CC.  She was previously a member with Mr Makhubo according to the CIPC up until 2019.     Correct.     Mr Powell, can I take you to the date of that invoice?     Now on that date would Mr Makhubo have been a director of Molelwane Holdings?  Molelwane Holdings, not Molelwane Consulting.     That is correct, Chair, but he was still a member of Molelwane Consulting.      Correct.     Thank you, Chair.     Mr Powell, when we broke you were looking at the invoice on page 398 and you had mentioned to the Chair that the invoice is in the name of Molelwane Holdings but the bank details at the bottom are Molelwane Consulting’s bank details.     Indeed, Chair.     It would be much – in the age of cheques it would have been much more difficult to...     There is another Molelwane invoice that you were able to find, that was the one that – the first one that you presented to the Commission together with this report.  Can I take you to page 194?     Before we get to 194, sorry, one last point about this invoice.  Can you just note the invoice number because we will be comparing it when we see the next invoice.     And then if we can go to the second invoice you have been able to find on page 194.     And I think while numbers and dates are fresh in our mind can you just direct the Chair to the date and number of this invoice?     And any other comments about this invoice?     I think the abbreviation, Chair, Local Area Network and Wide Area Network.  I think that is what the abbreviation is, they are network-related services.     We are going to come back to both invoices in due course, Chair, when we put them in a chronology of events relating to Johannesburg.     In your report you have dealt with these invoices at page 87 and then you go on to deal with payments to Molelwane in paragraph 8 over the page, bundle 1 page 88.  Again my preference is to deal with the payment when we can see them in a chronology relating to tenders in the City of Jo’burg but there is one set of payments that we will not be getting to in that chronology and I would like to just ask you to flag it here for the Chair.  On page 89 of bundle 1 you talk about steps that you have taken to track down historical payments with reference to the BEE reports furnished by EOH companies and you referred to a 2012 schedule of BBBEE service providers and amounts paid to them.  Can I take you to page 200 of the bundle – sorry and what you state there is that that schedule reflects that Molelwane was paid 1.35 million in the course of 2012.  Can I ask would that be calendar year 12 or financial year 2012?     Okay.  Can I then take you to page 200 of the bundle?    And can you describe – this is a page of broader document that one sees going back from 0.  Can you describe to the Chair what that document is?       In what year?     And can you just direct the Chair to where you see that?      Maybe if I can take you to the start of the email string under which that document is furnished.     And that is on page 195.     It would of course be anomaly because there are some dates in 2013.     But whether it is 2012 or 2013  is not going to be relevant for our purposes.     I do want us to flag the entry for Molelwane on page 200.     Can I clarify the anomaly that turns out not to be an anomaly in relation to the dates and if you go to page 198, is the date where we are seeing 13 dates is explained by the heading to that column.     And then can you direct the Chair on page 200 to the line dealing with payments to Molelwane?     Chair, it is a very long list, I am not sure if you picked up the Molelwane entry.     Thank you, Chair, thank you, Mr Powell.     We are almost ready to get to Johannesburg. In fact we are ready to get to Johannesburg but before we get to the two specific contracts …[intervenes]     Chair, if you go – the column heading is on page 198.     And that column is described as total spend for the measurement period.     If we move now to the City of Jo’burg, in your second report at page 376 of bundle 1 you provide a table that gives an overview of the various contracts that EOH Group of companies had with the City of Jo’burg.     Can I ask that – you speak of the value of the award, is that the appointment value or the total amount that was paid during the course of the contract?     Indeed and did you find cases where the amount ultimately paid exceeded the amount on award?     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Powell, are you finished with that table or is there anything else you would like to highlight?     Thank you, Mr Powell.  At this point we are going to go into one very detailed chronology concerning procurement in Jo’burg in 2014 and for my starting point I would like you to go to page 761 of the bundle.     Can you describe that document to the Chair?     Sorry, you said City of Cape Town.     Are you aware whether it was prepared in the context of a competitive bidding process or not?     Then if we can fast forward a little bit to 6 August 2014.  The date on that previous document you pointed out was 16 April and can I take you to page 606?     Can I interrupt you at that point?  Can I ask you to take the Chair to page 605?      Then if you go back – I maybe interrupted you too soon, I am afraid, Mr Powell, but if you can go back to 606 and take the Chair through the rest of the email.     Chair, I might be of assistance, if it is at the top of the page once sees the forwarding to Rene Jonker.     But can I ask you just to take the Chair through the body of the email that was forwarded to Mr...[intervenes]      Certainly Chair.     Correct.     Then following the same sequence if we can start towards the bottom of page 602 at     I do not think we need to quote the ANC bank account certainly not.      But we get the general idea.  Can you follow that stream; can you take the Chair through what happens when that goes to Patrick Makhubedu.      Can I then take you to page 607.      Can I ask you to take the Chair to the beneficiary name.       Correct Chair.     Thank you in fact when you read that description you omitted a detail there which cross refers to the invoice.  I appreciate that your printed copy may not be as clear as my electronic copy Chair if I might read the detail.     It says    And Chair you will recall that the invoice that was attached to Mr Makhubo’s, the quotation that was attached to Mr Makhubo’s letter of 6 August came from Randburg Towers.     Can I then asked you to go to page 609 and 610 and to take the Chair chronologically through what you see there?      Can I just interrupt at the point, who was the executive director of EOH Mthombo at the time?     I think Mr Bohbat, in fairness to Mr Bohbat I understand that he was the chief executive of the entire EOH group I think EOH Mthombo…[intervene]       Was Jehan Mackay indeed and everyone sees in the address Jehan Mackay.     And can you tell the Chair who Mr Laher is?     And then can you go back to the letter.      That is the ANC Youth League.      Chair I do not know if you would want me to read those items into the record?     So it is where the    Can I then take you to the following page 611.     No, no it is the right proof of payment.      For the Sandton Convention?     Can you refresh the Chairs memory as to who Prime Molecular are?     That is correct and the details Chair are to be found in that table at page 86.      If we then go over the page to 613.       And what we see at 613 is an email string that runs to 615.  Can you take the Chair through what one sees on page 613 to 615?       I think this is a case where it does not matter either way works.       I think the customers are able to set how he or she gets greeted for the confirmation.      And you refer to Mfundi, can you remind the Chair who Mfundi are?     Then if I can ask you to go to page 337 and maybe start at 336.      Can you just refresh the Chairs memory as to who Reno Barry is?     Then if you go over the page at 337, can you identify this document for the Chair?     Can I be more specific than that there was an excel spreadsheet attached to the previous email, is this that spreadsheet?     Now if one goes to the top left there will be a description of income coming into Mfundi.  Can you explain to the Chair what you see there?        There are in fact three totals going across, three total columns the one at the end of February 2014.  I presume that that is because Mfundi has a financial year that ends in February, would that be a fair assumption?      Then there is a second total which is second from the right which totals everything after February and then there is a main total that totals both of them, is that correct?      Can you – I do not know if your copy is legible Chair we may apologise for the quality of these documents we may need to have better quality documents produced but on your copies of the document is the description in the first column legible, which describes what this revenue relates to?      Chair at the risk of assuming the witness’s role I have a clear electronic copy, can I read those?     The first line item says    Yes, Chair the copy may well, your copy may well be illegible but after February 2014 after that, there is a total cost, yes.      Now so we have dealt with the revenue that comes into Mfundi from sales on monthly EOH invoice and EOH special invoice underneath that we see a whole list of line items that are described as cost of sales.  I would like to take you first to the first line item which is cost of sales P Makhubedu.       No I think you slipped a line.      That is correct, Chair.      That is it, below the break Chair the first two line items are payments into Mfundi then there is a gap and then there are cost of sales which are payments made by Mfundi.     Indeed Chair.      Indeed and all of the payments to Mfundi are described in relation to either EOH invoice, monthly EOH invoice or EOH special invoice.      We dealt with the first line item before we were looking at the spreadsheet we were dealing with a payment made by Mfundi to the ANC in August 2014 on the 22 n d of August 2014.  Can I take you down the list of the cost of sales to six from the last cost of sale and can you tell the Chair what you see there?     And the line item description in relation to it?     Okay if you can read the full line item description because I think it is important.       So the payment by Mfundi to ANC is treated as a cost of sales by Mfundi?     Indeed, then I want to take you to the next cost of sale to Mfundi can you identify that for the Chair.     And can you just remind the Chair whom are the members of Malolwane Consulting?    If I might – if I might correct you.    With Geoff Makhubo.    And as reflected on CIPC.    Until 2011 – until 2019?    Chair I do want to put it on record because Mr Makhubo has not testified yet but Mr Makhubo’s own version is that he had intended – he had attempted to resign in 2011 but his resignation was not processed.    Was not processed.    We will canvass that with him.    When he comes to testify.    But he has publicly stated that he withdrew from both Molelwane’s in 2011.    May I just the round the loop and get a specific date for that R80 000.00 payment to Molelwane Consulting can I ask – Chair can I ask you and Mr Powell to go to Flow of Funds Volume 3 page 612?    Bundle 3.    Bundle 3.    And Chair that page 612 is the only page I am going to be referring to from the bundle so you just need the page not the whole bundle for now.    612.    And there can I ask you to look at the very first – sorry – this Chair is a bank statement for Molelwane Consulting CC that the commission has obtained from First National Bank.  Can I ask you to go to the very first entry on 612?    On the previous – I apologise Chair I should have given you 511 with it.    It is the bank statement from 16 August 2014 to 17 September 2014.    While we are looking at the statement can I ask you to go down to 1 September?    And we have just been looking at the Mfundi Management Accounts.  Can you draw a connection for me there?    Indeed.  From Mfundi to EOH in respect of August 2014.  If we go back to Bundle 1 we are now going forward to 27 August and can I ask you to go to page 760?      Can you describe to the Chair what you see there?    And you go to the next page it is a document we started off this chronology with.  Can you describe it to the Chair?    So you earlier refer to this document as an unsolicited proposal that was sent to the City in April on 16 April 2014.  Can we just go back to that previous email so that we are clear on the date on which it is now forwarded from Mr Makhubedu to Mr Makhubo?    I do not need to tell take you through the entire document but can I ask you to go to page 776 where the price attached to this proposal appears?    776 Chair.    Then Mr Powell can we move forward to the 29 August and can I ask you to go to page 778?    Chair I – I just want to check that you have page 778.1.    If you can just describe to the Chair what you see there?    16 April Chair.    That is correct Chair.    So in respect – there is an invoice for the full amount of the proposal.  The customer reference number is 8387.  Can I take you back to that table you were going through with the Chair on page 336?    First the reference number the customer reference was 8387 that refers to a contract which you describe in your table at page 376.      That is correct Chair.  It is fact the first item on that table.    So what was the contract with reference number 8387?    That was the award value?    So both of the relevant contracts ought to have expired in 2012?    Can I then take you ...[intervenes]    Then Mr Powell can we go forward to 1 September and page 779.    Can we then go back to our bank statement for Molelwane in August/September 2014 which is at page 612?    Volume 3 – Volume 3 – Bundle 3 of page 612.    It is that one page that we – that I referred you to.    Earlier Chair.    612 sorry.    And Chair you will recall that we had identified the R80 000.00 payment to Molelwane on 22 August and also that R100 000.00 payment on 1 September.    With – both with references Patrick Makhubedu.  You have just quoted the email that required immediate clearance. Can you point the Chair to what the balance of Molelwane was before the R100 000.00 was paid in?    And while we are on this issue can you do the same exercise for the payment on the 22 August of R80 000.00?    Yes we are not going to come back to Volume 3 certainly not before lunch.      Chair I was hoping that we might be able to complete the 2014 chronology but there is little prospect that we will do that before lunch so if this is a convenient time to take the adjournment I would ask that we do so?    Thank you Chair.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Now the chronology, we have just finished on 1 September.  Can I then, Mr Powell, take you to page 616?     Can you describe it to the Chair, the document that you see there?     616.  Chair, indeed.     And then, can you take the Chair to the attachments themselves?       So can I just clarify here?  We have Patrick Makhubedu sending unsigned letters to Geoff Makhubo for him or somebody else in the ANC to sign to confirm donations.  Is that correct?     And can you just emphasise the amount of the donation in that first unsigned letter or recorded in the first unsigned letter?     Can I just stop you there?  Can you recall what else happened on 16 April 2014?     And the last letter?     Then can I ask you to go down to 626?     Yes, that is correct Chair.     And can you then take the Chair to the attachments ...[intervenes]      ...on pages 627 to 629?     Sorry.  Regional.       The date on that email was 11 September.  Can I now take you to a document at page 782?     [laughs]  Mr Powell, we are going to get you used to be in Johannesburg.       Ja.  [laughs]     Yes  [laughs]     Can I then take you to page 339, which is a document three days later, 15 September?     Mr Powell, can you answer that question?     To be precise there.  The unsolicited proposal with that was R106million.     And this is R109million.  So they are not quite ...[intervenes]      339.     And then once again – because I do not keep track of all of these entities.  Prime Molecular is which entity? MR     Can I then take you to another document dated 15 September?  It appears at page 783.     Sorry, can I just...  The attachment is dated 22 May 2014.     The email was sent?     And maybe you can read that email.     That attachment.     Mr Powell, are you aware what position within The City Mr Makhubedu occupied in 2014?     That is how I understand his statement to the Commission Chair.     Chair, I would just like to clarify.  It is not personal bank accounts to Mr Makhubo.       It is Molelwane Consulting.     Ja.     Can I ask you then to go to page 785?  And if you can describe the email that you see there.  There is a – it starts with something that is forwarded from Patrick Makhubedu to himself. We do not need to ...[intervenes]      ...concern ourselves with that.  But the forwarded email, the trials below.     Describe to the Chair what you see there and how you understand it.     So can you translate this email for the Chair?  What is actually is asked of Patrick here?     Are there any other Geoff’s other than Mr Makhubo who you are aware of in the course of your investigation or you have become aware of in the course of your investigation of EOH’s relationship with The City?     Can I then take you to page 787?     Then on 789, you – just turn the page.     And do I understand that the attachment is that request from the Tshwane, ANC 300... for R 300 000,00?     Can I then take you to page 621?     Can you turn the page?     Can I stop you there?     Is this the document that was attached to the email that was ...[intervenes]      Sorry, I think – I am hoping the Chair ’s copy is not cut off because I think yours is …[intervenes]     Because there is an important paragraph at the bottom of page 622.     That is the last.  I just did not understand – I did not hear Mr Powell read that last sentence.     Yes.     Can I ask, I do not want it to be published but can I ask that we take a note of that cell number because it is going to become relevant later on.  Chair, will you just write it down somewhere because it will become later on.     The cell number on page 623.     Can we then go back to a document that we have seen previously, it is on page 296.  I am not sure we have actually seen this one previously.  Oh, we have not, sorry.  I skipped over it when we were doing payments.     Can you just look at the date as well, Mr Powell?     Mr Powell, can you tell the Chair what work, if any, you found that Malolwane did in return for this payment?     And just to – another detail on this document, if you go back to 295, back a page.     Can you just describe that email?       And just the narrative on the email?     Then the last document in this 14 chronology is at page 625.     And then if you can go to – from  September to 2 October at page 625.     And then if you can just go up to page 624 you will see an email which attaches that proof of payment.     Thank you, Mr Powell.  We are going to move on to a completely new topic now.  We have completed our 2014 chronology.  Is there anything beyond that which you have said already that you would want to say to the Chair in relation to that 24 chronology from August to October that we have been looking at?     Thank you, Mr Powell.  Our next chronology deals with a tender in 2016 and for the purposes of this chronology, I want us to start on your second report at page 91 where you describe the A647 tender of 2016.  Can you go to page 91?     I will certainly do that, Chair.  The problem in relation to this tender is that it straddles both reports.     And so there is no one simple place where – and for the most part I will be referring to documents between about pages 450 and 530 where the original underlying documents are.     But I do have to refer to some stuff attached to the original report as well.     But we will have your file organised so that the three separate reports can at least be partitioned.     So in paragraph 91 you describe this tender, A647.  Can you explain to the Chair what this tender was about and what its period was?     So our chronology starts on 2 November.  Can I take you to page 480?      480.     Thank you.      Chair, we are now going to go through a chronology of the emails and the like.     And so we are going to page 480.     And, Chair, in relation to this chronology I will be referring also to four of five documents in flow of funds bundle 3.     So it may be useful to have that bundle to hand.     Chair, this time it is more than one document.  It is five across the file so I think we should give you the whole file.     Of bundle 1.     But I just would like you to have that other file to hand because we are going to get there in due course.     Can I then ask you to go to page 453?     Sorry, I have actually glossed     Can we then pick up what is going on inside EOH by going to page 453?  We may in fact have to go down a little bit.     Maybe the correct place to start is the last of that chain of emails on 453, 7 November 2015 at 9.39.     Which will spill onto 454.     If I can possibly assist.  This is one long email chain between Mr Bohbot and Mr Laher.     And we see the two parties right up at the top at 453, Chair.     Then if we can go – we have seen that chain from 7 November, 13 November – sorry, sorry, 483.  If you go down to 483.     And once again can I ask you to start at the bottom of this email thread?     so that we can go through it chronologically in time.       That is Mpho Kotane, M-p-h-o K-o-t-a-n-e.     Can I take you then for that document to 485?     Maybe – because we are going to run out of quite a lot of time, if you can just give a general description of what this document is.     Yes, and then if you can just go back to the top of this thread at page 483, what does Nyiko Mutileni do with this?     Then if I can take us forward a week, almost a week, and ask you to go to page 483 – sorry 456.     And if you could describe the email at the top of the page, I’m not needing you to describe the whole thread, just the…[intervenes].     Then if we can go to page 487.      Thank you Mr Powell.  Can I ask you to go to page 487, and here, unfortunately we have a copy that is very poor in the printed versions but I think that you may have the text from the electronic version separately. I’m interested to begin with – there’s a thread     You’ll see at a certain point, lines start going down the left-hand side of your page.     So, there’s the first line, it says, “hi Pate”, there’s the second…[intervenes].     And then there’s, just above the     Below that indeed.     Okay, Chair we will get an enhanced copy made available…[intervenes].     Can I read out what the section that I’m interested in emphasising?     It says, on 1 December 2015 at     Going back to the text of the email, “Trevor has apparently assured them!  I have asked Ashley to contact KPMG as per Pat’s conversation with Jeff. HDS want to pull out according to…[indistinct 5.51].  Pat…[indistinct 5.52] hasn’t heard from EMC, nothing from Ascentia, Regards Ebrahim Lehar”. The passages, I would emphasise Chair, are, update on the consortia talks for the bid, so they’re talking about putting together a consortium. “I have asked Ashley to contact KPMG, as per Pats’ conversation with Jeff”. Then can I take you up the page to the legible email at the top of the page from Jehan Mackay on 2 December 15?    It’s a colon in brackets, so what does that symbolise?     So, can I just ask you to comment on that last sentence, what is Jehan Mackay saying to EBS and Pat?     We may disagree, Mr Powell.     We’ll come to see which organisation gets the benefit later.     The closing date of the bid…[intervenes].     Then if -  you’ll recall that – I don’t need to take you back there because you’ve already mentioned this but I want to just locate this point in the chronology at page 91 when you were describing the tender you mentioned that the closing date was 14 December.  So, in the chronology we can just record 14 December as closing date for the bids.  The next point in the chronology that I would like to refer you to is in, flow of funds, Bundle 3 at page 646.     Sorry, I forgot I’m supposed to be asking questions here.  Can you go to an entry on 1 February?     And can you just look at the balance in Molelwane was before this transfer from Mfundi into Molelwane?     Chair, maybe if I can take Mr Powell to another document which will answer your question.     If you go to page 344 of the – Bundle 1 not Bundle 3, we can leave Bundle 3 for now, we’ll come back to it a little later …[indistinct 13.32].     344, Chair.    And Chair, I’m afraid I played a card too soon because I’m going to show you a very interesting document which I was hoping to defer to much later.  I’d ask you not to – we will come back to it and unpick it in great detail.      But I just want to refer to something in that regard, 344, have you got that document?     Can you describe that document to the Chairperson and then I’ll take you to the attachments?     I don’t want you to go through the whole of this document yet, because it’s a long document and we need to get there in due course but what I do – if you can go to the document at 346 which is – first can you confirm whether this is – if you go 345 there’s one document, 346, are those the attachments to that email?     And you’ll recall earlier that we took the Chairperson to some Management accounts of Mfundi Mobile in 2014 that looked in a similar – that had a similar format.  Can I ask you to look at the document at 346 and describe to the Chair, what this document is?     It says, “Profit and loss report”.    It is the right page Chair, I think the document has got a potentially misleading title, it may be that you say it in a running Management Report spreadsheet, running accounts that go beyond 16 because the heading of the document itself, describes – no, no, no I take that back Chair…[intervenes].     Indeed Chair.     That’s correct Chair,  and if you look at the columns, you’ll see they end in December, they don’t run through to January and February.  So, they’re monthly columns…[intervenes].     Not yet Chair.     He was just describing the name of the document that’s attached to the…[intervenes].     Now Mr Powell, I’m not sure if the copy that you have to hand has the – has a left-hand side margin or if it cuts off, the descriptions on the left-hand side?     Yes, well let’s – before we get to travel company, if I can just read the narrations on the left-hand side into the record, starting off under sales, the first     Well then, I’m afraid, I may have to read these narrations verbatim…[intervenes].     That is correct, Chair.     That’s correct, SAP support special, this is a special sale that Mfundi pulled off.     In July what did they get for their special sale relating to the COJ SAP support?     So, R16million was reflected as a – well an amount due to Mfundi in respect of its special sale and then – we’ll come back to this document in detail and I hope by that stage to have a better copy put in front of you but for now I’m interested in some of the costs of sales, well just one for now and the – I think that I – I’m not making the point that I’d hoped to make, we’ll have to come back to this document later, after all of that diversion and sort of raising expectations my point falls flat, so let’s move on, I apologise.     We were on 1 s t of February when Mfundi was paid – when Mfundi paid Molelwane R200 000, can I take us to the 3 r d of February on page 488, I apologise for that lengthy diversion.     No, 488, Chair, 488.     That’s correct Chair, I’m interested in the part of the email string that appears at the bottom of the page, the email headed, from Ebrahim Lehar, the last email on the page from Ebrahim Lehar dated Wednesday 3 February 2016.  Mr Powell can you address that email for the Chair?     That is Ash and I, who is that?     And who is Dada?     Okay well let’s not go further down this email because the critical point, for our purposes today is actions, “I will meet with Geoff”.    Can we go down the chronology again and go back into volume 3 – Bundle 3 and go to page 652.      Now, if I can take you to page 346 and 347 which is the Mfundi Mobile cost of sales and if you can start on page 346 just to get the month heading because on 347 where I’ll take you the headings don’t appear, I want to make the point that the second column is April.     No, Chair, that’s the document we were looking at a minute or so ago, if we go back up to 344, I think it will be – yes 344, there’s the email from Reno Barry to Patrick Makhubedu attaching the last ANC recon and his management report.     Chair, I’m sorry we should be back in Bundle 1.     Sorry Chair.     344 is the covering email again.     And so that was the Barry to Makhubedu email with the ANC recon and the management report and the management report itself, which talks about the special COJ SAP support for R16million and the costs of sales, that’s the document from 346.     And on 346, Chair, I’d just ask you to note that the second column is April, month April.     And the last column is total.     Total.     So, if we go down to 347 and we see the second line item.     That line item is Molelwane Consulting.     Unfortunately, in the April column there’s an amount but it’s illegible but if we go across to the total, we can see what that amount is, because it’s the only amount on that line, so the total which is the far column on the right…[intervenes].     No, R400 000 is just below it, that’s the third line item.     And we’ve just seen - referred to a payment from – a payment with reference Patrick Makhubedu on 22 April of R50 000.00 what do we infer from this set of accounts?  Who made that payment?    Then we go to page 194 which is a document we have seen before.  Can you start with the date of this document?    For present purposes the point I want to make is that on 30 April 2016 a Molelwane invoice – well is sent to TSS Managed Services.  Have you been able to identify the services in respect of which Molelwane was invoicing?    What services has Mr Powell been able to identify as having been provided?    In respect of this invoice.    Chair that certainly something the commission can establish.    Relatively easy.    The next stage in the chronology after 30 April is to be found at pages 495 to 497.  And again this is an email string but maybe we can start at 495 and if you can read up the string and tell the Chair what is here?    No you are on the right page if you can go down the string.    So – because it goes to from Nyiko Mutileni.    And just for the record if I can spell that out.    Nboniseni and Nemaangani – Nemaangani.    And can I take you to the next page with is 427.      First can you confirm is this the document that had the request for the sponsorship?    497 yes.    I think Nyiko is an abbreviation of Tinyiko.    So the invitation comes on 26 February the request to EOH to Mr Mutileni is dated 3 March and that gets forwarded by Mr Mutileni to Mr Laher on 17 May and…    And 17 May is where we are in the – in our overall chronology of the A647 bid.  Can we then go onto page 501?  And at the top of the page what – well that is – there is a string.  I am interested in the email dated 19 May that is the third email in the string.    501.      So we will get to the …    Indeed Chair.    We will get to the request in a minute – the attached request for donations.  I just want to orient ourselves again to the tender that we are talking about A647 has it been awarded yet?    It is pending.  Can – let us go to that letter itself and that starts at page 499.    You said R50 000.    I just want to check that I have the right reference here.  Can I then ask you to go to – sorry that was 19 May.  If we go back to 25 May – sorry if we go back to 194.  No, no, no not 194 sorry.      193.    Still on Bundle 1 Chair.     And if we go over the page we see the invoice that we have now seen several times before which is the Molalwane invoice for R500 000.00?    Then can we…    Can we go to page 194.1 and Chair I just want to make sure that you have 194.1.    Thank you Chair.    Can you describe to the Chair what 194.1 is?    Can you just remind the Chair what ED is?    If we then go to page 503 our last exchange was on 26 May – this Godlington win exchange about paying the invoice.  On the same day something else happens.  If we go to page 503.      If we go to 503 what do we see?    And at this stage has the tender been awarded yet?    Can we then go to Bundle 3 page 267?      Bundle 3 page 267.  Bundle 3.  And if you can just describe to the Chair the document there?    Can I – can I just ask you to describe to the Chair how – to report to the Chair how this account is described because there are two Molelwane accounts and we are going to be going.    To another one shortly.    And then if you can go over the page at page 268 there is an entry on the 30 May.    So that is on the 30 May can I staying in the same bundle but going to page 849.    And 849 is a table that the commission has extracted of transactions between Molelwane Consulting accounts and the two colons on the left hand side are the two different Molelwane accounts.  The salary account and the current accounts and these are transactions out of either of those accounts into the account of Mr Makhubo’s – Mr Makhubo’s personal account.  It is the commission’s document. Can I ask you to go down to 31 May 16.    The – indeed.    So the transaction amount – the second column from the right.    Is the amount that is paid into Mr Makhubo’s account from one of the two Molelwane accounts.    But CC’s accounts.    But the CC has two bank accounts.    If we go to 31 May.    That is the commission’s narration I should add.  And underneath that?    Indeed that is what I am inferring.  It is an issue we will take up further with Mr Makhubo when he comes on Friday.  If I might just take you back to Bundle 3 at page 270 you will see how those two transactions are reflected in the books – in the account of Molelwane.  So if we start at 269 we have the statement from 30 May to 30 June.  And if one looks at 31 May the first line item – the first two line items are – just have the description transfer and are both for R50 000.00.    Oh so 269 is the cover page for the bank account.    Indeed.      31 May.  And Chair you will recall there were two transactions on the commission’s spread sheet one for R50 000.00, one for R200.  One of the first two transactions on 31 May with the simple description Transfer would be the R50 000.00.    With no further description.  Then on 31 May we see the R200 000.00 with the – sorry a bit lower down – below the Geoff Pardy reference we see transfer R200 000.00.    Can we then go to page 504?  Sorry 504 in Bundle 1 not in Bundle 3.  We in Bundle 3 we need to go back to Bundle 1.      Indeed.      So we – our chronology has taken us to 31 May thus far.  Can you describe to the Chair that you see on page 504?    Two days later.     If you total those numbers, what do you see the total value of the award for EOH?     Then...[intervenes]      Sorry.  The date of this letter.  So the decision was apparently taken on the 2 n d but EOH is notified?     Then, can I take you to page 507?     507, Chair.     Or maybe we should start on...  Well, 507 is the sequence.       Where the sequence begins.     What do you see on 507?     If we then go up a line, we will see an invoice on page 506.  Can you describe that to the Chair?     And then on page five...  Can you go to page 521?     521, Chair.  Sorry.     Maybe you can pause for the Chair to get there and just...     Can I maybe make that a bit more specific?  If one goes back to that invitation letter for Ms Towers’ project of taking people to New York at page 498.  There is a list of no names in that invitation letter.     So if I can...  Chair, if I can ask you to go to 498?     And there you will see that the – this appears to be the same project.  There is a very substantial overlap in the list of names.     Chair, in fairness but to Ms Tower.     This looks like a charity that she sponsors.  So the people who would go, they have a local government, officials are there, chaperons, as it were.     But it looks like, these are school children who are being sent on a trip under Ms Towers’ charity.     No, not...  There is a municipal official who will be looking after them while they are there.     But he or she will be as a chaperone.     So it is ...[intervenes]      Indeed.  It is not – the group is primarily children.     There may be one or two.       There is certainly one official.  There may be two.     Who are going to look after the children.     That would be the primary beneficiaries of the children.     Can we then go to page 525?     My sense Chair is that, we probably got about half an hour, maybe 40-minutes left on The City of Johannesburg.     There are then two other contracts unrelated to the City of Joburg and in fact, they are quite severable in terms of their treatment.     Unless you want us to try to push it.  Well, we – realistically, I think we would require at least two and a half to three hours to get through those other two contracts.     It may be more convenient to finish Johannesburg today.     And then to look for another slot, if there is another slot available at any stage to...     Chair, I am certainly able to go on myself.  Can I suggest that we attempt to go on.     We maybe take stock after we have finished the first of the second of those two contracts when we will have a clearer sense of...     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Then I think we should at least try to look to complete.     Thank you, Chair.     Mr Powell, I am going to take you back – you do not need to go there but you will recall that we took you to an email of 2 December at page 487 where Jehan Mackay told Ebrahim Laher and – or Ebs and     Sorry, can I just pause there?  Would that be Pat and Ebs?     And what does he forward?     Can you read what the invoice – I mean, we may have to generate better copies of these invoices but are you able to read what the invoice says?     Yes.  And you will recall earlier we have seen some management reports that talk about the COJ SAP support special.     And also refer to sales.  Can we go down the page because that is one invoice that you have seen.  If we go down to page 527, what do you see on 527?     And then …[intervenes]     Chair, it is the same amount but it is a different email.     And if we can go to the third amount then.     And then if we can – and the amount is 4 million plus VAT to give 4 560.     Can we go then to page 529?      Yes, yes, in fact go to 530, you should have a more legible copy.     That is correct, Chair.     There were two for 4 million plus VAT equals 4 560 and a third for 8 million plus Vat, 9 120.     And the overall total…     16 million ex Vat.     And now need to go to see how that 16 million on SAP – sorry, sale SAP support special was explained by Mr Barry or accounted for by Mr Barry and then for that purpose we have got to go back to page 344 where we skirted around a little bit thus far.     344.     And at the risk of repetition, I would like you to take the Chair through this covering email on 344 quite carefully because now we are going to get into it in considerable detail.     So the recon that we are going to look at in a minute has the file name Mfundi GM ANC updated.  Can you speculate as to what GM might stand for?  I will leave it for argument.     Indeed, Chair.     Can you take the Chair to page 345?     And under sales what do we see?     Sorry, so can you link that to documents that we have been discussing with the Chair?  Where does that 16 million reflect in terms of invoices that we have seen thus far?     Which were invoiced by Mfundi.     Can I just stop you there, Mr Powell?  The answer you just gave the Chair would have obviously carried considerable weight if the 16 million was explicitly donated to the ANC but in this case that is not what happened.     Can you take the Chair through these costs of sales?     Well, maybe we should just take a few examples to illustrate some of these costs of sales that are reflected on the spreadsheet.  So can I ask you, if you go to the – well, let us before we get to the invoices that came to Mfundi, let us look at the first …[intervenes]     And sorry, just to come back there.  You will recall that when we looked at those invoices that were invoiced to EOH, they were described as sales, COJ SAP support special.     So when they issue an invoice to EOH they call it sales COJ SAP support special, so that 16 million is a sale to EOH for the support of the SAP contract at COJ.     The cost that they must incur to make the sale of 16 million to EOH.     But before we get to the cost of sales, there is an item that is worth looking at with some – looking at closely because this is not just about, you know, washing EOH’s donations to the ANC because the first item – can you just tell the Chair what the first item says and how you understand it?     And are …[intervenes]     They may have to pay some tax, I do not know – but it is their cut plus tax.     So let us see how this cost of sales worked.  I do not want to take through all 20 odd of them but let us look at an example or two.  If you go to the third line item it says cost of sales, Black & White, 677 160.  Can I ask you go to page 691 and can you take the Chair through that document?     Well, we do not have to speculate too much there because there is actually a covering invoice – oh sorry, a covering email.  Can I take you to page 689?     And let us look at another example.  Chair, it may be convenient for you to take out page 95 which has- not page 95, page 344 which has that table so that you can have it on one side and we can then …[intervenes]     345, indeed, Chair.     Let us go down to another large item, there is a payment of 1 425 000 to Nahana Holdings, N-a-h-a-n-a.     The list is on page 345.     So if one goes about six or seven down one sees Nahana Holdings, 1.425 million.     Mr Powell, can you take the Chair to page 680?     680.   And what do you see at 680?       And that of course corresponds to the line on the cost of sales.    Now can I ask you to go up to page 679 to see how this ends up being paid by Mfundi Mobile?     680.     That Black & White was 691.     That is certainly what – well, it went from Di Data to Geoff Makhubo and Obakeng Chikane.  What went from Di Data, went from an individual at Di Data, what went was the invoice.     And eventually it was forwarded from Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makhubedu and later appeared as a cost of sale to Mfundi.  The next item I would refer to is – the next big item which is an amount of 994 964 to Shereno Printers at 668.  It is page 668 is where the story of those payments is going to be told and can you – let us start with the covering email on 668 and the trail that it shows.     Chair the title is GPDGDED which presumably refers to the Department, I think Provincial Government Department, maybe Economic Development.     Can you take the Chair to 669 and 670.      Can I just ask Chair can I ask you and Mr Powell just to write that number down, 590 976.      Correct Chair, and then Mr Powell if you can go to 670.        And then if you were to add those numbers up I wouldn’t ask you to do that but I will tell you that the answer is R994 963,30 and they have rounded it up to 994 964 which you will find on the table at page 345, so next to Sherena Printers these two invoices reflect as 994 964.      And the last example that I would like to take you to is the item called Black Brain, an amount of 1 736 000, can I ask you to go to page 683 for that, so Black Brain is 683, and if you can take the Chair to what you see on page 683?     Before you leave that page with the table you will see a number of other ...[intervenes]      And if I can take you to a different rendition of that email or to the same email but in a different place with a table underneath it, page 685, do you see the 22 July email from Geoff Makhubo – sorry – the it’s the Patrick Makubedu email saying so we must pay only 1736 in response to Black Brain is 1763 we paid them one million, otherwise all fine.       There was a table to which Mr Makhubo was responding.     And so we dealt with Black Brain which on the table reflects as R2 736 000, but we understand now that one was already paid.     The other items on the table we dealt with Sherena Printers already.     Taj, can I ask you to go back to page 344.     And you will see a line item for Taj which reflects total payments to Taj of – can you just give the Chair the amount?       Now these amounts when you add them they come to an amount slightly less but they may not have been the only amounts paid to Taj.  Can you look at Paper Push.      And can you look back at your table?       Now we haven’t reconciled everyone of these against the underlying invoices, I don’t even know if those are to be found on EOH, but we have described the process.     The picture is amplified a little bit in those management accounts that came with the same – under cover of the same email from Mr Barry, so if I can now ask Chair if you can go to page 346, which is the management accounts.     And there Chair we have seen this document before, we noted that the revenue is at R16million from EOH SAP’s report special which is a sale made by Mfundi and the cost of sales.   Can I – if we go through again keeping that reconciliation loose can I ask Mr Powell can you find, have you got a copy that has the left column legible or not?   Maybe, it might be best to get volume 1 from behind you and just go to page 346 of volume 1.     Chair you, I think your document of 346 is a legible document but Mr Powell’s may not be.     Mr Powell has his volume, page 346.  Can you start by looking for the cost of sales in respect of Black and White?      And if you move across what is the cost of that sale?     And that of course reconciles with the number on the reconciliation and in which month is that sale reflected in?     It is the July column, the column headings on the left hand side of the column and the numbers on the right hand side of the column.  If you go over the page to 347.       We see Nahana Holdings that we have already looked at.       And the cost of sale there?     And I can tell you that that is also in the July column although it is not on your ...[intervenes]      And Taj Printers that we were looking at?     Paper Push Printers?       Chair what we will do is we will go back to the original spreadsheet which I presume Mr Powell will have.     I want us to focus on that R89 330.     Can I ask you to go to page 693.         Can I ask that you write down that invoice reference, HOF153043? And then can you go to page 800.       Can I stop you there, do you know, can you identify those airports for the Chairperson?     And the amount?     Under cost of sales?     Can – just to complete this loop can we go to 694, and what do you see there?     Thank you Mr Powell.  That concludes our run through the chronology of the 2016 contract, we have now reached the end of our Johannesburg section of your evidence.   Is there anything further in relation to the EOH Johannesburg, City of Johannesburg relationship that you would want to address to the Chairperson?      Can I – Chair I think at this point we need to discuss the way forward, because we have now finished with Johannesburg.    Chair because we are going onto a completely new set of relationships with a different cast of characters my sense is that we are probably looking at at least three hours if I measure against how it went with Johannesburg and the conception it may make sense to end at this point and then we can take a decision on whether and if so when Mr Powell returns.  I must say Chair that there is a – there are a whole series of other investigations relating to EOH, we are just dealing with City of Johannesburg and one in the NPA and one in the SAPS.   If this is going to become a focus for the Commission then it is many, many times.  If it is not going to become a focus for the Commission then breaking now makes as much as sense as breaking later.     I think it would three to four hours Chair, I think we could probably do it in three, the problem is that there will be something of a start up costs because we have to talk about a new set of relationships and a new set of intermediaries.    Who will appear in both of the next two investigations and it may make sense to try and do them together so that one remembers who the parties are.     Thank you Chair.     That is correct chair.     Chair I think we will use the day tomorrow, I have had some – well I don’t want – I would expect to use the day tomorrow.     A day should be fine, we won’t need more than a day.     I am confident that we will. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    Thank you.    All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     All rise. 
MR POWELL:  Steven David Powell.    No do not.    I do.    So help me God.    Thank you Mr Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct that was just recently Mr Chair.    Certainly Chair.    I do confirm.    Certainly.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Certainly.  Mr Chair we had been providing services to EOH prior to February 2019 when drama emerged with Microsoft and we had been providing Governance Compliance support and some ad-hoc investigative work.   But in February 2019 when Microsoft served a notice of cancellation of the appointment of EOH as a reseller of Microsoft products it caused a significant concern to the business and I was mandated by Mr van Coller to do a comprehensive investigation. Prior to that we did not have access to the EOH server; we could not just look at emails; data of everyone and – in the business but we received an unfettered mandate to get to the bottom of what had happened and we were asked specifically to focus on the Microsoft contract at the Department of Defence and just before that Mr van Coller had mandated us to look into concerns that had come to his attention at the Department of Water and Sanitation and we then conducted an extensive investigation where we had unfettered access to the mailbox server of EOH and we then conducted a multitude of interviews with personnel to try get the bottom of what had happened. We also conducted an extensive data review reviewing information on the system related to the Department of Defence and very soon after initiating that investigation we confirmed that there had been irregularities in respect of the Microsoft contract and Mr van Coller asked us to look at all the significant public sector contracts to make sure that similar issues did not exist in other contracts as well. And during the course of our investigation we did flag concerns that we had which I will elaborate on further in my evidence Chair that the issue related to the City of Johannesburg.  We identified a range of concerns and irregularities and we were then contacted by the commission to ask if we will share some of the details and we were asked to look at certain persons that were of interest to the commission which includes the current Executive Mayor Mr Geoff Makhubo as well as a gentleman by the name of Patrick Makhubedu and then entities by the name of Molelwane Consulting and Molelwane Holdings and another entity by the name of Zylek. I do want to emphasise and perhaps it is opportune just to mention there are some limitations in the work that we have done Chair because EOH is a company of companies at various stages the business had more than 275 subsidiaries in it.  They did not at all times have a centralised accounting system.  They have a system called the Infor System.   We have been able to analyse information on the Infor System from 2013 to 2018.  Most of the irregularities that we have identified occurred in a small time frame Chair and that time frame was 2014 to 2017.   And it is quite interesting Chair that when the media starting zooming in on irregularities at EOH the mischief – the misconduct seemed to curtail.  So the media definitely had a positive influence and it coincided when the analysis in the media focussed on the Gupta’s and that seemed to curb the illicit activities that were going on at the group. Chair I mentioned the limitations because we also – I do want to emphasise that some of the entities that we have investigated such as Zylek, Geoffrey Makhubo were not part of our initial investigation but when the commission asked us because we have access to the EOH data and server we were able to extract a lot of information and I think that information is helpful to the commission and that will be part of my testimony today.   But I do want to highlight that we have not had access to Mr Makhubo’s data per se.  We have got what communications he had with EOH people on the EOH system and we have got details of payments made to Molelwane and to Mr Makhubo from what we could gather from the EOH server. We can see our analysis that Mr Makhubo has gmail addresses and we may not have access to all of the information.  So I just wanted Chair to be aware that there were limits to what we did and we have gone out of our way to assist the commission by doing an extensive data review to identify correspondence, payments etcetera linked to the individuals that were of interest to the commission.  Thank you Mr Chair.    Certainly Chair.  Mr Mackay was the head of the public sector vertical team at EOH and he was also the Managing Director of a company called TSS MS.  Mr Chair I will in my testimony refer extensively to Mr Mackay and you will see that he features in quite a few emails and documents that we will draw the commission’s attention to. He is one of the key role players in the irregularities that I will be highlighting today.    Certainly.  Chair we had full access to the mine cost server and attached to email correspondence that we analysed the bank statements for a window period of Mr Mackay were on the server and we analysed those statements and we identified payments to a number of politically exposed persons and we have shared that with the commission.    Certainly Chair.  The table in paragraph 29 is an analysis.  This is an extrapolation of an analysis that we conducted on Mr Mackay’s FNB bank statement and Chair you will see that it starts on the 26 May 2013.    Thank you.    The table sets out payments that we identified and extrapolated from his bank statements starting on 26 May 2015 until 29 June 2017.  And this was from his personal bank account and it kicks off on 26 May with the payment in the amount of R80 000.00 and this was made to an FNB account with a reference NG and the NG is repeated Chair I do not know why the NG is repeated but it is as it was stated on the reference NG NG Kodwa.  And then on 13 July 2015.    Correct Chair it appears to be Mr Zizi Kodwa who I understand is the Deputy Minister of Intelligence in the current government.    Ja.    Ja.    Correct Mr Chair I do confirm we had – when we did our intelligence checks we did identify he was spokesman for the ANC.     Chair the second reference is on 13 July 15.  There was a payment of R45 00.00 also referenced to NG NG Kodwa.    I do not know Mr Chair.    It is odd and you will see when we deal with number 3.    There is SG Sintwa and I understand that Mr Sintwa at the time is described in the media a personal assistant to Jacob Zuma and we know that he was an advisor to Mr Zuma and there was a payment of R50 000.00 on that date of 12 September 2015 also from Mr Mackay’s personal bank account and Chair you will see that the initials seem to be repeated.  There it is Mr Siyabulela Sintwa.    Correct Chair I assume the JM is Jehan Mackay.    Correct Chair.  The next entry is 7 October 15.  There was a payment of R21 600.00 to the FNB account of Mr Sintwa.   The next date is 19 October there was a payment of R20 000.00 to the FNB account of Mr Sintwa. And on 29 October 2015 there was another payment of R50 000.00 to Mr Zizi Kodwa – NG Kodwa. Again on 3 November 2015 there was a payment of another R50 000.00 to Mr Kodwa. And on 5 November 2015 there was a payment of R50 000.00 to Mr Sintwa. On 26 November 2015 there was a payment of R30 000.00.  It is referenced as FNB and it has the number OB000000282 April Streetwise [Zizi] and that appears to also be a payment to Mr Kodwa Chair. On 28 November 2015 there was a payment of R50 000.00 to Mr Kodwa again. And on 4 December there was a payment of R40 000.00 to Mr Kodwa. And on 18 December 2015 there was a payment of R100 000.00 to Mr Siyabulela Sintwa. On 2 February 2016 there was a payment of R30 000.00 to Mr Zizi Kodwa. On 27 January 2017 there was a payment of R50 000.00 to Mr Sintwa. And the last entry Chair is 29 June 2017 there was a payment of R500 000.00 to the FNB bank account of Mr Nkabinde and this is referenced {JM} and it is referenced as loan.  So half a million is the last entry. Chair we identified that at the time Mr Nkabinde appears to be Mr Reggie Nkabinde and he was the Treasurer of the ANC Youth League – ANCYL.  Thank you Chair.    Correct Mr Chair.  Very often the payments seemed to follow a deposit of a similar amount or a larger amount just prior to the transfer to the individuals that I have listed and many of those were referenced as transfers from TSS Tactical Software Solutions.    They were deposits into Mr Mackay’s bank account – electronic transfers to his account Chair.    And most of these seemed to come from an entity named TSS.    Correct.    Correct Chair but that seemed to be the pattern.    Ja.  TSS was a company and I refer to Mr Mackay as the Managing Director of TSS MS Chair.  This was a company that was acquired by EOH Group in 2011.   So it was part of the EOH stable.    It was acquired from Danny and Jehan Mackay.  Danny is Jehan’s father Chair.    Certainly Chair.      Certainly.      Chair it reflects an FNB QB transfer and the reference – the description column refers to transfer TSS JM.  And then there is a figure of half a million that comes in Mr Chair.    Correct – that is correct.    Ja.    And Chair the pattern referred to is that generally when these payments are made to the politically    Correct.  They seem to – to often come from TSS Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Just let me check.       Certainly, Chair.  Mr Makhubedu is a former employee of EHO.  We understand that he was employed at the TSS Group from 1 December 2007, initially in Business Development and then later as a General Manager, Sales. After EOH required TSSMS, Makhubedu’s employment was transferred to EOH on 1 March 2014.  Makhubedu was employed at EOH as Business Development Executive in the Public Sector, working closely with Jehan MacKay.  Makhubedu resigned from EOH with immediate effect on 11 March 2019.  And Mr Chair, what is quite interesting is, we had invited him to a discussion.   We wanted to interview him and that interview was supposed to take place at eight o’clock on the Monday morning and he resigned on the weekend and back dated his resignation to the Friday.  And he refused to engage with us at all.     Business Development is Marketing.  It is finding opportunities and expanding on existing contracts.  And we saw that Mr Makhubedu was integral to a number of relationships at the City of Johannesburg and he seemed to win a lot of businesses for EOH at the City of Johannesburg. Chair, I will elaborate on some of the methods that were used to win business which was not quite savoury.     Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      I see the Business Development as exactly that.  Unlocking opportunities ...[intervenes]      ...at the City of Johannesburg.     ...diverse(?) identities(?)     Certainly Chair.  Makhubedu and Makhubo are linked to a number of entities.  Some of these entities financially transacted with one another, including Molelwane, Mr Makhubedu’s consulting business. There was a gentleman by the name of Reno Neil Barry who was integral in a number of these financial transactions. Chair, it is also important to identify Mr Barry because he will feature in one of the business partners that seems to have been used extensively for concealed and illicit payments, which I will elaborate on further, later in my testimony. Barry is the former Group Financial Manager at Tactical Software Systems (Pty) Ltd.  So he also worked for what is known as TSS. Barry provided accounting services from time to time to various of these linked entities, including Zylek.  Zylek is a entity which reflects Patrick Makhubedu as a key-principle Chair. Molelwane, an entity by the name of Mfundi Mobile and then Prime Molecular and Grass Farms.  Email evidence that we were able to analyse, indicates that Barry made a number of payments, including to Molelwane at the instructions of Patrick Makhubedu. The emails that we will elaborate on further in my evidence Chair, also suggest that Barry assisted Makhubedu, Makhubo and Makhubo’s wife in their personal tax matters.  He was the accounts and preparing their tax affairs.     Certainly.  Chair, if I may, I am going to take you from the table to the documents because when we do these investigations, we use the Sub-C documentation as a Windeed and Sub-C documents.   The first one is Molelwane Consulting CC.  Chair, you will find that in Bundle 1 at 163.  So I think what I will do is, I will go to 163 and then...  Sorry.  And it is the FOF-163, Chair. You will see that this is a Windeed company report.  It reflects Molelwane Consulting, status in business.     Right at the top.     Yes.  The dated requested was 2020, July 7t h.       And the info comes from the CIPC, Chair.  And it reflects Molelwane Consulting as in business and its registration date was 1997.   Chair, so I think what Mr Chaskalson was alluding to is, this was a recent cheque that was done.     So it was July of this year.     And it reflects the members as Makhubo, Matlekale(?) Florence.  And then it has got a number of inactive – as an active director.  And I cites an ID number of 7408010558082.  And she is described as an active member.  The inactive members are Lynette Ruth Fox and it is status is resigned.  And then Makhubo Moloantoa Geoffrey, status resigned.  Makhubo Tebogo(?) Clive.     Ja, I shall turn to the date reference.  Resignation date for Mr Makhubo, Chair is 4 October 2019.       Apologies Chair.  Is that is on the next page, page 164.  You will see that it refers to the members and it provides more detail on each of the members.     And you will see, the second last one is Geoffrey Makhubo.     Status resigned.     Appointment date, 1998, 16 September.  Resignation date, 4 October 2019.     So it is last year that he resigned Chair.     Chair, we are not a hundred percent certain but it looks her mother.  It is – if I look at the ID, it is a 47.  And if you look at Geoff Makhubo it is a 68.       Certainly.  Chair, and I think we will do the same on this one, being ...[intervenes]      Exactly right, Chair.  I have marked on the table.     And I want to take you, Chair to 167 of the bundle.  Chair, you will see that this was also – the cheque was requested this year in July, 09/07/2020 which coincides with the time when the Commission asked us to have a look at this.  And it reflects the company, Molelwane Holdings as status, annual return final deregistration. So it looks like the company is in the process of being deregistered.  It reflects an active director as Asher Bohbot, King Aluthe(?) Thokoane, ID number 8012315407087 as an active director. The two further names on this document.  The first one, I think, is irrelevant Chair because Christiaan Gouws is an individual whose business is selling companies off the shelves.  So here, he will appear in a multitude companies.  So I do not think there is anything relevant to that.   But it does reflect Geoffrey Moloantoa Makhubo as a resigned director.  And if we turn the page Chair, as we did on the last one, we get a more detailed breakdown and it reflects that his profession was Chief Executive Officer and the resignation date on this one is 7 November 2011.     Correct, Chair.     Certainly.     Yes.  Mfundi Mobile, the directors are listed as Mongezi Duma(?) and Reno Neil Barry.       I am going to do the same as I did previously and I am going to take you to page 160 of the bundle.  One, six, zero.  And this cheque was also requested in July of this year and it reflects the company name as Mfundi Mobile Networks, status in business.   The company was registered in 2012 Char.  Registration date, 10 October 2012.  The directors and other summary reflects Barry Reno Neil or...  ja.  Reno Neil Barry is his name Chair.  ID number 7409165060084 as the director and it is an active status Chair. And then there is an inactive director reflected as Duma(?) Mongezi Imbros(?), and it reflects that he is a resigned director.  And we turn the age Chair, we will see that Mongezi Duma resigned on 23 June 2017.     Correct.     Yes, certainly.  Mr Duma was employed at Tactical Software Systems as a Group Financial Analyst, Chair and you will find that on page 86 in the table.   And Mfundi is quite important to my testimony Chair because we have identified that EOH paid Mfundi Mobile more than R 54 million excluding VAT for purported work on Public Sector projects where we could find no evidence that any work was done.       Yes.     Certainly.       Certainly.  Chair, just before we go into this document, I just want to highlight to the Commission that we had already, before the Commission asked us, identified irregularities within Mfundi Mobile and we had issued Mr Van Coller to depose here an affidavit and we issued a Section 34 report to the DPCI reporting irregularities regarding Mfundi Mobile.   The document that Mr Chaskalson has referred me to, is the appointment of, as an independent service provider and it is an agreement between the SAP Services, Business Unit of EOH Mathombo(?) (Pty) Ltd.  And the SAP is the software OEM, Chair, the Original Equipment Manufacturer.   This entity’s primary business was the support around SAP Services.  And the contract is with Mfundi Mobile Networks represented by Mr Duma in his capacity as a director.  And this is what we commonly found and I think Mr Chaskalson referred to it as a teaming agreement.       Ja.     Jip.  Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, if I may ...[intervenes]      Nothing to do with the South African Police.     Chair, that is why I mentioned this is SAP which is an only distributor of software to many municipalities across the country.     Chair, at paragraph 1.1.8, the contract refers     That is correct.     Yes.     Chair, you will see that the project and deliverables of the service provider is blank.  Nothing is stipulated.     [No audible reply]      This refers to the Addendum A, Chair ...[intervenes]      It is blank.  So Chair, what we found is that business ...[intervenes]      Correct.     Ja.     This is not uncommon Mr Chair.  We have found a number of service providers that were used where we cannot find any evidence that they have done work.  And when we looked at the ...[intervenes]      ...deliverables in the agreements, it is either blank or it is nebulous consulting services ...[intervenes]      ...as broad as can be.     And we cannot find the actual work that was done Chair.     Present Perfect Investments, Chair.     Thank you, Mr Chair.  I was about to point out to Mr Chaskalson that both of us did not have the reference to that one.  So I am glad he has.  Prime Molecular Technologies Africa (Pty) Ltd.   Chair, you will find that – the Windeed SIPC documents at 177 of the bundle.       Chair, this report was also requested in July after the Commission approached us and we ran this check.  We identified that Prime Molecular Technologies Africa is reflected as in business.   It was registered on the 13t h of August 2009 and it reflects as an active director, Patrick Makhubo with his ID number of 740801558082.     Patrick Makhubo. ADV CHASKALSON     Oh, my apologies.  Did I say Makhubo?  It is Mr Makhubedu, Chair.  So Patrick Makhubedu is reflected as an active director and Ryno(sic) Neil Barry is reflected as a resigned director. And if we turn the page to 178, we will see that Ryno(sic) Barry was appointed in 2009 on the 13t h and it appears to have resigned on the same date, Chair, 13 August 2009. So the active principle is Patrick Makhubedu. [Please note that speaker refers to Reno Neil Barry as well as Ryno Neil Barry.]     Certainly.  Mr Chair, for this one, I am going to take Chair to 120 of the bundle.       This report was also requested in July.     Yes?     EOH Africa used to be TSSMS Chair.  There was a name change.  So it is as EOH Africa.  Sorry, Mr Chaskalson.  I am just going back to the bundle.  So the former name of this entity was TSS Managed Services and they are relevant to this – to my evidence today Chair because they have also made payments to Molelwane and I will testify further about that at a later stage in my evidence.     The first one is TSS Managed Services.  So TSSMS.       No, it is known as EOH Africa.     It used to be TSS.     Thanks, Chair.     Correct.     It might be another TSS entity.     So this one is most definitely previously TSSMS, now EOH Africa.     The reference to TSS on most deposits is...     That is correct, Chair.  We were actually unable to find the contract between Molelwane and EOH or any entity related to EOH but what we did find is, there was a Molelwane contract which was in a form of an unsigned teaming agreement between TSSMS and Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd.   We do not know if this was ever signed.  We have never seen a signed copy and we have attached a copy of this.  It has an effective date of 1 October...[intervenes]      Certainly.  Mr Chair, this is the teaming agreement that I referred to, the unsigned teaming agreement and you will see that this reflects an agreement date of 1 October 2009 between TSS Managed Services (Pty) Ltd with Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd referred to as Molelwane.   And if we just page through the document, you will see that it is indeed unsigned, Mr Chair.     189, Chair and 188 and 187 reflects that it is unsigned and then if we go to 189, you will see the services     Correct.  Under the recitals, Chair, it     That is correct.  Thank you, Chair.     The VOIP is voice over IP, Chair.     Voice over IP.     Virtual private networks.     Chair, if I can elaborate on what Mr Chaskalson has said, we have literally run through millions and millions of emails and thousands of documents and the bundles before you are a more than a thousand pages but this is small snippet of the volume of documents that we have analysed.  Thank you, Chair.     Correct.  It appears that the TSSMS client is the CCMA and the schedule reflects what TSSMS would pay Molelwane Holdings for its services.     It is the CCMA that we all know, the Council for Mediation, Chair.     It reflects CCMA build 180 000.  TSS fees R117 000, Molelwane fees R63 000 and that is for voice over IP, Chair.  And then you will see for the virtual networks there is CCMA build 220 000, TSS fees, 150 000, Molelwane fees 70 000 and the monthly Molelwane fees are reflected as R133 000.  So it is quite a significant portion of that total bill, it is almost a third, roughly a third, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     180 000.     That is what it looks like, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Ja.  Now, Chair, the 73 and 63 seem to total and it seems to be a monthly payment there.     And then the payment schedule goes on as follows. One-stop consulting, market Positioning and advisory Services, there is a fee stipulated here of 600 000 and then the monthly advisory services, 63 000 and it states that all of this will be honoured subject to TSSMS achieving its revenue targets and payment from the customer.     Correct, Chair.     It seems to be split as well, Chair.     Yes.     Correct, Chair, I do need to change that because we were still looking and when we made the first submission it was to be in time for the Commission’s request, we continued searching and we found an additional payment which I will elaborate on shortly.     Correct, Chair.     Correct.     Chair, this appears to be the Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd invoice and it is addressed to TSS Managed Services (Pty) Ltd for attention Mr Patrick – or sorry, it says Mr P Makhubedu and it reflects …[intervenes]     Correct.     It is reflected as a separate entity, Chair.     Correct.     We do not know.     Correct.  Yes, Chair, we went through the CIPC documents.     And you will remember on Holdings Mr Makhubo resigned, if I recall correctly before 2011.     But on the other one he was still an active director until 2019.     The Molelwane …[intervenes]     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.       And that is the lady with the ID number starting 48.     Yes, correct, Chair.     Certainly, the date of the invoice, Chair, is 30 November 2014.     So he had resigned earlier but, Chair, I think you need to keep your wits about you because what we are going to analyse in the next couple of minutes is even though the invoice reflects Molelwane Holdings, the bank account actually belongs to Molelwane Consulting.     That is correct, Chair.  So Chair, you correctly pointed out the date of resignation from Holdings was 2011 and the resignation date from Consulting for Geoff Makhubo was much later, 2019, and this is an anomaly on the invoice because it purports to come from holdings but the bank details belong to Consulting and I understand further that the Vat details also belong to Consulting, Chair.     Correct, Chair, the Vat registration number also belongs to Consulting, as I pointed out, Chair.  Chair, if I may also just add, you know, any finance official that was processing this invoice should have put up a break and said stop, there is a problem with the invoice because it reflects – it purports to come from the Holdings company but this is Consulting, they should have queried it, but it was processed.     Correct.     You are quite correct, Chair.     And I think one of the ingredients for the vast amount of fraud in the country is because the banks only look at the number and not necessarily the accountholder.     But many of the banks do offer a service where you pay extra and you can validate the name of the beneficiary to the account number.     Certainly, Chair.     Certainly, Chair, the invoice number on this invoice is 021 and I think it is important just to tie the date 30 November 2014 to the number.     It is on the right hand column under tax invoice, Chair.     You will see a little bubble.     It is in there.     Correct.     Just below that.     Right at the bottom in that block, Chair, it says invoice number 021.     Chair and then I have also directed Chair to the date.     30 November 2014.     That is correct, Chair.     Certainly, Chair.  The first thing to point out is the date is 30 April 2016 almost two years later and if you look in the bubble below tax invoice, Chair, you will see invoice number 22.  So it seems to be a sequence and that indicates no transactions between.     Chair, it is the same scenario as the prior invoice, the invoice emanates from Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd, it is directed to TSS Managed Services (Pty) Ltd.  It talks about services rendered as per agreement, LAN and WAN services.  The amount charged is 500 570 with VAT and again a similar characteristic to the last invoice it is the bank account details of that of Molelwane Consulting and it is a First National Bank account and it has the same anomaly that we recognise don the first invoice.     Chair, I can confirm that as well from my side.  Thank you, Mr Chaskalson.     Ja, there is no date, Chair.     That appears to be the calendar year.     Certainly.     This appears to be an EOH Group BBBEE supplier list.     Correct.     So this seems to be a schedule of all the BEE payments, BEE suppliers, Chair.     The 2012.     Sorry, Mr Chaskalson, my copy is cut off.     Ja, I do see the 2012 reference.     Ja.  There is reference to 2012 and 2013, Chair, in the far right column.     Yes, that will help.     Correct, Chair, that does reflect that attached is what I found on the drive from 2012 so it does appear to apply to the 2012 year.     Correct.     Ja.     Correct.  Chair, if I can direct you to on page 195 the attachment is described as EOH Group BE 12.  PP suppliers list, certificates, final, 11 October ’12.  So I think that does help clarify the timing and then, Chair …[intervenes]     Page 195.     At the top where it reflects the subject, it refers to EOH Group BBBEE supplier list.     And then the attachment refers to EOH Group BE 2012, PP suppliers list and the document appears to be dated a final spreadsheet 11 October ’12.     Oh, absolutely, correct, Chair.  Mr Chaskalson has referred Chair to that top column on the right hand said, it says certificate expiry date.  Chair, I think that is what the confusion was.  So the date seems to be 2012 and some of the certificates referred to in the schedule expired in 2013.     Chair, just below the middle of that page you will see on the left hand side it refers to solutions and then two lines below solutions there is a gap in the middle of the page.  Two lines below that it refers to Molelwane Consulting CC 1 350 000 and then it refers to EME level 4 and it refers to – there is a reference on the right to TSS.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.     It appears to be various payments for the period, Chair.     Chair, I think what makes the process difficult is we have been able to determine links, relationships, quantify payments from various sources, so it is not a simple matter of going straight to the accounting system and this schedule just is – corroborates the information that we found.     So it does make it difficult to piece it together, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.  There are a number of contracts referred to on the table at paragraph 3 of page 376 and if I can run through them quickly, Chair.  The first one was a tender referred to as COJ 8387 and that was for ICT LAM and 1 services.  The entity was TSSMS.  The value of the ward was R38.4 million.  The date, the period was December 2010 to November 2012 and then extended.     This is the tender award value.     We did, Chair, there were a number of instances where the amount actually paid went beyond what was awarded.  The other anomaly, which I think it is important just to understand, Chair, is that when we issued an interim report on what we had found, EOH published the interim report on their website and they were very transparent in communicating that they had problems and they went into great lengths and I know Mr van Coller has testified but the board were very, very anxious to undo all the wrongdoing to make sure that the removed the perpetrators, that they were no longer employed at EOH and that they were reported, prosecuted and that the company fulfilled all of its reporting obligations.  And when we issued that report we found a multitude of tender abuses so what transpired – and I think this is just useful context before we go into the different tenders, Chair, is that the guys would collude with the government officials at the departments to irregularly extend an existing tender.   National Treasury puts limits on how far one can extend so if the value of the tender goes up by more than % the entity should retender.  If the extension is for a completely different separate project it should retender but it looks like the small group of people who worked in that public sector vertical team under Jehan Mackay managed to bypass tender on multiple occasions.  So we have got multiple extensions of contracts which should have gone to tender and then there is a swear word in procurement, Chair, and that swear word is sole sourcing because very often entities will motivate why they are the only party that can provide the service but the reality is, all the competitors can provide a similar service.  But without competition the price can escalate exponentially and those are the types of things that happened on the various tenders.  And then the other types of things that happened is the EOH people would collude, that public sector vertical small group of people would collude with the officials and they would get an inside track on tenders before they even advertised.  So they would get advance notice, they would get more information than competitors and they would be placed in an advantaged position. And when we go through the evidence you will see that these types of scenarios play out on multiple occasions and then when things go wrong for this group of people and it looks like they are not getting their way with the public entity then they would use politically exposed persons to exert influence on the decision-makers to make sure that it goes their way. So they would get advance notice of what is supposed to be confidential Bid Adjudication Committees and they would know that they are about to lose something and they would then contact very well-known politically exposed persons, which I will refer to later in my evidence, Chair, and that person will then intervene and suddenly the anomaly or the decision to go out to tender will be changed or we find correspondence when, for example, City of Jo’burg advertised something for tender that they had promised to EOH, there is consternation with this group of people. But I am just pre-empting to just give you some context for what is about to follow, Chair.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     There are number of other tenders, Chair, and it is useful just to get an understanding of the volume of tenders at the COJ that we are talking about.   So the next one was COJ 8387 and that was ICT security and that was – the EOH entity was Mthombo and it was awarded for 26 million in December 2010 to 2012 and then extended. The next one was COJ A472 for SAP support.  EOH entity was Mthombo, 250 million.  This was also 2012 to February 2016 and then extended and then the next …[intervenes]     Sorry, this is page 376, Chair, 376.     Chair, this is just a short table setting out all of the different tenders at the City of Johannesburg.     So I have just referred to COJ A472 for SAP support, Mthombo 250 million.  2012 to 2016 and then extended.  And then we do not have a tender number but SAP software, Mthombo was awarded for 97 million in November/December 2015 and then COJ A639 or ICT outsource, we do not have an award.  And then COJ A647, SAP upgrade was awarded to Mthombo.  The award value for 404 million and the date was June 2016 to June 2019.  There was a delayed start with this tender.  Chair, we will elaborate on wrongdoing that happened around some of these particular dates and tenders.     Thank you, Chair.     Certainly.  This is a proposal for the upgrading of the City of Johannesburg network and infrastructure, it is dated 16 April 2014 and it was prepared for the City of Cape Town by EOH.     I am sorry, City of Johannesburg.  My home city, Chair, apologies.     Chair, we understand that this was an unsolicited proposal.     Certainly.  Chair, this page 606 refers to an email from Geoff Makhubo dated 6 August 2014 and it is sent to Patrick Makhubedu and it seems to forward prior     Certainly, Chair.  605, Chair, appears to be the conference quotation that is referred to in the request that I just read on email and it comes from Randburg Towers and it has a day conference package that is elaborated upon in the document and the date of the document is 24 July 2014 and the amount is R582 100.     There is a whole range, it is conferencing, it is dinners, tower rooms, admin.     Certainly, so 6 August this email was just forwarded by Patrick Makhubedu to Rene Jonker.  Rene Jonker was one of the divisional finance directors within the EOH Group and there is no …[intervenes]      That is correct Chair.     Yes.     Certainly Chair.     So this was forwarded to Rene Jonker in finance, with no narration, just sent from an iPad.     Chair but this, who what I read earlier so ...[intervenes]      Certainly, sorry Chair.   The email comes     Correct.     Correct Chair.     Certainly this is from Geoff Makhubo and interesting Chair it is also Geoffmakhubo@gmail.com date 6 August 2014 to Patrickmakube du05@gmail.com and he copies another Gmail address for Patrick Makhubedu.      Certainly.      So Patrick receives this on 6 August 2014     Certainly Chair page 607 is what we refer to as a POP, P-O-P Chair it is the proof of payment and if you look at the earlier invoice from the venue you will see the amount was R582 100,00 and that is the value of the POP.  So this is clearly the payment for the accommodation for the conference.     That is correct Chair.      Certainly Chair if you look at the document.     That is description    Correct.      And then one further detail Chair is the authoriser number two is Jehan Mackay.     Certainly.  This Chair is a letter from the African National Congress greater Johannesburg Region, office of the Regional Treasurer it is addressed to the executive director EOH Mthombo and it is copied to Mr Ebrahim Laher and it is dated 8 August 2014.        The executive director of EOH Mthombo at the time was a gentleman by the name of Asha Bohbat, B-o-h-b-a-t Mr Chair.      EOH Mthombo was Jehan Mackay.      Correct Chair.      Yes, Mr Laher was the director of the SAP business of EOH.     Certainly.  This letter the header is    Certainly Chair.      “Monthly admin expenses 50 000,00, stipends for employees 140 000,00, ANCYL regional conference venue cost 400 000,00.        Correct    Certainly.  So the     “November the monthly administration expenses are stipulated as 50 000,00, stipends for employees 140 000,00 total R190 000,00.     Yes, Chair that grand total is just over R6 000 000,00, R6 000 180,00.     The next page, page 611 Chair is an email from Patrick Makhubedu dated 20 August 2014 sent to Geoff Makhubo at a Gmail address and it is forwarded with     Okay, amount R20 527,30.      For the Sandton Convention Centre, correct.      Prime Molecular if I remember correctly Chair was one of Patrick Makhubedu’s entities.       Certainly Chair.      Do you want me to start at the top and work down Mr Chaskalson or do you want me to refer to the document that is forwarded, I think the email forwarded?      Chair the top of the page refers to…[intervene]     613.      It is forwarded by Patrick Makhubedu on 22      “Dear Patrick, a payment has been made to your account to view the details of the payment please open the attached PDF.” And then it is just the admin around that from the bank and then if we can turn the page Chair to page 615.     Correct Chair it might just be an electronic payment confirmation with a polite greeting, we do not know.       615, Chair.     And this one is from Standard Bank and     Yes, Mfundi was the entity with I highlighted Reno Neil Barry as the key protagonist Chair.      Certainly Chair at page 336 we have an     Yes, certainly Chair Reno Barry is the principle of that entity called Mfundi Mobile but the email is from Reno to Patrick Makhubedu the date is 10 September     Certainly Chair this appears to be management accounts for Mfundi and…[intervene]     Ja, correct.  So this says the annexure referred to management report 10 September 2014, Chair.      Certainly there is a reflection of monthly EOH invoice Chair and there is amounts in the columns on the right of that 406 000,00, 406 000,00 repeated for October, November, December, January, February and there is a total of R2million and…[intervene]     Chair the top figure on the left under October 2013, October 13 it reflects 406 000,00 and it is the narration my page is slightly cut off Chair.     But if you take the 406 000,00 and that number is repeated for October, November, December, January, February and the total reflected is R2 000 030,00.      That appears to be the case Chair.      Correct.      It is slightly cut of Chair but I can make out sales.      Certainly Chair the special invoice if you run across to the right you will see the figure under June 14 of R1.2million and if you take that across it gets put into to the total and you see the R1.2million again and then it goes into the main total on the right.      Correct Chair the first line item is cost of sales P Makhubedu and it has a figure of 1,140 000.      R1.2million apologies Chair it is just this copy is not that great.      And it continues into the total and then into the main total that same figure Chair.  So and that number coincides with the special invoice number which was also R1.2million, just above that Chair.      Correct.      Certainly Chair I see a payment reflected under August 2014 of 70 000,00.      ANC.      Okay    That is correct Chair.      The next narration is    Correct Chair. That appears in the August 14 column and that is taken through to the total and the main total column as well.    Certainly that is Florence Makhubedu and Geoff Makhubo was a member active until 2019.    Correct – sorry Chair the consulting was the Holdings was Florence.  Mr Makhubo was her partner.    Yes. ADV CHASKALSON    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes both Makhubo’s.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    What is the page reference?    Okay.  Right have it before me Mr Chair.    Certainly.  Chair it is dated 22 August.  It is a magtape credit.  Description Patrick Makhubedu and the amount is R80 000.00.    Correct Chair.    Certainly.  On 1 September there is another magtape credit Chair and it is – description is Patrick Makhubedu R100 000.00.    R80 000.00 yes Chair.    Correct Chair there R80 000.00 was reflected as a cost of sales.    Certainly.    Yes.  This is an email from Patrick Makhubedu sent on Wednesday August 2017/2014 Chair to geoffmakhubo@gmail.com and he copied himself with another email address patrickmakhubedu05@gmail.com and it is – it attaches EOH COJ Networking Solutions Version 3 doc and it is forwarded with the narration EOH COJ Networking Solution Version 3.    Correct.  It is the proposal for the upgrading of the City of Johannesburg Network and Security Infrastructure Chair and the date of this – this is prepared for City of Johannesburg and the date is 2014/04.16 – the 16 April.    Certainly this – the date of this is 27 August 14.    Certainly.      776.    Chair at page 776 there is a table Solution Pricing and Assumptions and the total price it goes into the different components – the total price is R106 185 395.36.    106 million yes.    Yes.     395 thanks Chair.    Correct.    Certainly.      Ja this is the proposal total Chair.    This is an email from Patrick Makhubedu and it is dated Friday 29 August 2014 to Geoff Makhubedu – Makhubo sorry.  To Geoff Makhubo and the subject is just the 5191721pdf and that is also the name of the attachment.  And if you turn the page it is TSS Managed Services.    This is a tax invoice made out to the City of Johannesburg project name COJ Network and Security Upgrade and project – there is a project number in it. The customer number, order number etcetera and it refers to customer reference 8387.  Description upgrading of network and security infrastructure and the total is the total we just looked at previously the exact amount of the proposal R106 185 395.36 Chair.    Correct.    Certainly.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That would be the expectation Chair.     I am not sure that is the reality.    8387 was an ICT Lan and Wan project and the entity was TSSMS and the value was R38.4 million.      Yes and there is also the same – there is also a COJA387 for ICT Security Mthombo and that value was R26 million also 2010to 2012 and then extended.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  Ja.    14.  Correct Chair.    Correct.    Certainly.  Page 779 Chair is an email from Patrick Makhubedu to Reno Barry sent on 1 September 2014 and the narration is  “Hi, please pay R100 000.00 into the Molelwane Consulting from Mfundi and make immediate clearance.  Thanks Patrick.”    Certainly.      Certainly Chair.  It looks like that account was almost empty.  The balance was R597.45 when the R100 000.00 came in and that pushed it to R100 000.00 just under R600.  So the account was almost depleted.    Certainly Chair when the R80 000.00 came in the balance was also R600.00.  In that case it was R621.45.  So R600.0 the account was virtually depleted when it got the R80 000.00 credit.  Mr Chaskalson can I put away this bundle?  Is that the last?     [No audible reply]      Yes.  Mr Chair, this is an email from Patrick Makhubedu sent to Geoff Makhubo at Gmail and the subject is donations letters.  It is dated 9 September 2014.  And there were a number of attachments; Donation Letter ANC, EOH Managed Services, Donation 01/2014 doc, Donation Letter ANC / EOH Managed Services Donation doc, Donation Letter ANC TSS Managed Services, Fund Raising Gala 2014.     The following page on 617, has a series and it follows.  Chair, there are a number of documents attached and this is addressed to Patrick Makhubedu at EOH     That is exactly what it is Chair.     Certainly, Chair.  The first one is R 2 million and...[intervenes]      Chair, I think what the email suggests is that there were three different EOH entities and this R 2 million was the amount that came from EOH Managed Services (Pty) Ltd.     If we turn a page to the next document Chair at 618, you will see it is a similar letter authored – sent to Patrick Makhubedu.  It is a draft for Patrick Makhubedu that he has emailed to Geoff Makhubo, asking him to sign. And this one refers to on behalf of the African National Congress.  We would like to acknowledge and thank EOH Managed Services (Pty) Ltd for the donation of R 3 million on 16 April 2014.  And it has got a similar confirmation on the use of the funds.     I think we referred earlier to that event, that there was a request ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry.  That is correct.   [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     The unsolicited proposal was dated exactly this, Chair.     That is correct.     Thank you, Chair.  The last letter is a similar letter. This one is again sent for attention by Patrick Makhubedu for his own attention.  TSS Managed Services.     This is a letter from Patrick Makhubedu to René Jonker.  René Jonker was a Financial Manager at TSS at the time – you will recall Chair, we referred to her earlier.  And it is dated 11 September 2014.  And it is forwarded     Certainly.     627 to 629 is the very same draft letters that was sent by Patrick Makhubedu to Mr Makhubo.  This – they are now placed on an ANC letterhead Chair for the African National Congress Greater Johannesburg Region, Office of the National(sic) Treasurer.     Regional.  Sorry.  Regional Treasurer.  And it is attention Mr Patrick Makhubedu, EOH Managed Services, dated 19 June 2014 and it is exactly the letter that was sent by Mr Makhubedu to Geoff Makhubo and it signed by Geoff Makhubo with his title as Regional Treasurer and his cell number below. And then a similar letter is attached at 628.  And this again on the African National Congress, greater Johannesburg, Office of the Regional Treasurer’s letterhead and it is addressed to Mr Makhubedu, dated 19 June 2014. And this one is to thank EOH Managed Services (Pty) Ltd for the donation of R 3 million on 16 April 2014 with a similar narration on utilisation of the funds. And then the last one is the third in the series that was originally emailed by Mr Makhubedu to Mr Makhubo and this one is again on the African National Congress’s letterhead as stated before, dated 19 June. “Dear Mr Makhubo.  Re donation acceptance.”     Chair, the document at page 782 is a, what appears to be a purchase order from The City of Johannesburg.  And it is addressed to TSS Managed Services (Pty) Ltd. And the reference is to – it comes from Supply Chain Management of City of Cape Town.  It is a framework order.       Did I say Cape Town?     I am so sorry.     Mr Chair, I have sorted out a lot of drama in The City of Cape Town too.     Certainly.  So the terms of payment, COJ paid immediately without deduction and it refers to the item and the material, active unit. And then there is a series of numbers that refers to ICT Infrastructure Network WAM/LAN.  And the amount is R 96 265 770,63, and the total figure with that comes to R 109 737 278,52.  And it is signed by the buyer at The City of Johannesburg.     It seems similar ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     It seems similar to the unsolicited proposal figure.     Correct, Chair.     That is why I said it seems similar Chair because it is a very close to that number but it is not the exact number.     Ja.  Mr Chaskalson, which page?     339.  Mr Chair, this document at 339, there is a Nedbank payment confirmation and it is dated 15 September 2014 and it is from account details, Prime Molecular cheque account and then the statement on that account is – the narration or the description is Molelwane Consulting.   Then the beneficiary statement description is P Makhubedu.  And it goes to an account number of Molelwane and that number is reflected on the document in the amount of R 70 000,00 and payment date is reflected as 15 September 2014.     Mr Chair, it would be nice to be as proficient as Mr Chaskalson, having it all electronically.     You and I have to page through the binders.     To say ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     And that is why this whole thing is very, very irregular.  And it is dated 22 May 2014.     Correct.     The email was sent on the September 15t h, 14 Chair.  Sorry.  The email is September.  It is Updating the Award, Chair.       Yes.     Certainly.  So this goes to TSS Managed     Correct.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.  This looks like this is for me him to sign in his capacity as – at The City of Johannesburg.     That is my understanding Chair.  You have summed it up perfectly.     He was previously a councillor and then he was MMC for Finance at The City of Johannesburg, Chair.  And I think held the latter position in the 2014.     MMC.     Correct, Chair.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.       And that is why the dates and the timing is so important.     Chair, I do a lot of support to companies on Anti-corruption Compliance and we advise our clients that during any bid adjudication and even if it is an unsolicited bid, you should not be making any donations.  You should not provide anything of value.  But what we have seen is almost a pattern of regular solicitation of donations coupled to the award of these tenders.  It is almost as if the tenders are being granted in exchange for financial benefit to the party.     Chair, and if I may?     Is that, and to the individual, because as Mr Chaskalson has taken us through, you also see simultaneous injections into personal bank accounts of Mr Makhubo at the same time.     It is Molelwane.     Yes.     Correct.     Chair, this is an email from Ebrahim Laher and I mentioned Ebrahim Laher was the Head of the SAP Division at EOH and it is sent to Patrick Makhubedu, dated 18 September 2014.   It copies various other employees, like, Ashley de Klerk, Kenton(?) Seta(?), Stephen Nokinthorn(?) at EOH.   And the subject header is forward     So what it appears to be Chair is that, SAP, the OEM, can provide services directly.  They do not have to go through a reseller like EOH.  And EOH were becoming uncomfortable because it looks like SAP were encroaching on their territory.   And it appears that that is what they wanted to discuss with Geoff to try and influence, to try and stop this happening.  It would appear Chair.     Mr Chair, we have not come across another Geoff.  The correspondence on COJ is predominantly Patrick Makhubedu, Geoff Makhubo and various others, Ebrahim Laher, et cetera, but certainly no other Geoff.     Certainly, Chair.  Page 787 is a document on the African National Congress’s letterhead, Tshwane Region and it seems to emanate from the Office of the Regional Secretary.      On 789, we have an attachment that was forwarded by Patrick Makhubedu to René Jonker and Jehan     Correct Chair.  It appears to be.     Certainly.  Chair, at 621, there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu, dated 20 September 2014.  And it is addressed to Jehan MacKay at EOH, Ebrahim Laher at EOH.   And it forwards the financial assistance request and     Certainly, Chair.  The next page, page 622 attaches a letter on an African National Congress, Greater Johannesburg Region letterhead.       Yes.     That is correct.  This appears to be the attachment to the email I just read Chair.  And this document comes from the Office of the Regional Treasurer, Greater Johannesburg Region, ANC.  And it is addressed to Mr Patrick Makhubedu.   And it refers to the Executive EOH Mathombo and it is also CC to Mr Ebrahim Laher, dated 19 September 2014.  Request for financial assistance.   “Dear Patrick Makhubedu.  We would like to thank you for the support your organisation has given to the ANC in the past. The ANC in the Greater Johannesburg Region will be going to its conference from the 16t h to 19t h October 2014 at Cedar Park in Woodmead. We are expecting 500 delegates from branches, the leagues, the alliance, representatives of business and the religious sector. The congress will discuss and take resolutions on issues like governance elections, the economic transformation and social transformation. The conference requires resources to execute.  We, therefore, humbly request a donation to cover, amongst others, the following expenses; the conference venue and the accommodation, 2 million.  Conference package and paraphernalia, 1.2 million.  Transport and registration 600 000, printing documents and shirts, 250 000, other 250 000, total 4 300 000.” Chair, and then what follows on the next page at 623 is the …[intervenes]     Oh, sorry.     Chair, I think it might be cut off but I got one line, if I may read it and then …[intervenes]     Ja.     Chair, I am slightly cut off further than you are so thank you, that is the last line.     Correct and then it ends with    Certainly from EOH.     Chair, the document at page 296 is headed Transactions Report and it reflects company TSS Managed Services and in the middle of the page it has a line referring to beneficiary, Malolwane Consulting.     Absolutely.  Apology, Mr Chaskalson, the date is 20 September 2014 and if we look at the …[intervenes]     Yes, it is a transactions report, Chair.  And then …[intervenes]     Correct.     And just below the date, Chair, is a double line with beneficiary branch account reference, etcetera, and the beneficiary is reflected as Malolwane Consulting.  The branch number is reflected, there is an account number and the reference is TSSMS and then Genven, G-e-n-v-e-n and the amount …[intervenes]     Correct, Chair.  And the amount is R570 000.     And it is got an action date …[intervenes]     20 September 2014.     It appears to be, Chair.     It is a report of the company on financial transactions, payments, Chair.  And this is a …[intervenes]     TSSMS, Chair.     And it is a supplied as a proof of a payment to Malolwane referring to the preceding email.      I do not think it is relevant, Chair.     Because this has been processed.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct.     The evidence leader has just asked me whether I am aware of any work that was done for this payment and I am not, Chair.  We tried to establish if there was services rendered and we are not aware.     Chair, we have gone to …[intervenes]     Chair, it is not impossible that there may be something that was done that we are not aware of.     So our process is we go to the employees who were involved in the project at the time and we asked them did you work with this entity, did you come across this entity?  Did they feature in the project at all?  And the answer was no.  The work that was done on this specific project was done by a former EOH employee.     That is why I am confident, Chair, that …[intervenes]     The former employees.  The current employees have concerned that they did not do work.     And they have indicated that the actual work was done by an EOH employee.     Ja.     Chair, there are statements for some portions where we had lodged criminal cases.     And for others we have just gathered the information.     And for some of these items like the request from the Commission we have responded as quickly as we could to get the information across.     Correct, Chair.  Chair and the other reason for my confidence is that this is a common practice that we came across at EOH.     With partners on projects and I have referred, Chair, previously to these nebulous terms on teaming agreements that sometimes are blank or they refer to broad services.     On many of the projects.  We have had a similar phenomenon where people are paid but they have not provided any services.     Chair, if I can just conclude that thought it comes at great cost to EOH because they tender for a project or they do the work on a project, they pay away to these business partners and in some instances they do not even recover the money from the client or the work and they just lose money as a result but the ED partners, like in this case, Malolwane, are paid and they get their money.     Certainly.     Certainly.  Chair, 295 is an email from a Natalie Buchner at EOH sent to Rene Jonker on 6 October     “Please find attached proof of payment for  Malolwane in the amount of 570 000 paid on 19 September 2014.  Thank you and regards, Natalie Buchner, Accounts Payable Manager TSS Managed Services.”     Correct, Chair.     That is correct.     Chair, we will elaborate shortly but the same scenario happens with Mfundi and we will go into that detail shortly.     Certainly, Chair, at 625 we have a Nedbank proof of payment.  It is head Authorised Payment Batch     That is correct, Chair.  At 624 there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu to Geoff Makhubo dated 2 October 2014 and it forwards POP ANC.  The POP refers to the proof of payment we have just read, Chair, and it is a JPEG picture attachment, ANC Greater Johannesburg account, 2 October ’14 and that is sent by Patrick Makhubedu after he receives the same proof of payment from Rene Jonker at TSSMS dated 2 October 2014 and this is sent to Patrick Makhubedu.  So he just forwards the proof of payment, once it has been made, off to Geoff Makhubo.     I think my observation, Chair, as Chair pointed out, there was a lot of donation requests that coincided with the award and we have pointed out the anomalies in Makhubedu drafting the award to himself.  It is just unheard of, Chair, it is just wrong.     Certainly.     Certainly.  Chair, the COJ SAP upgrade tender for 2016 is referred to as the COJ tender A647 for SAP upgrade/implementation.  This was advertised in November 2015 with a closing date of 14 December 2015.  COJ awarded this tender to EOH Mthombo on 8 June 2016 for a price of just over 404 million including Vat.  Chair, again, the date will become crucial and I emphasise 8 June 16 and if the 14 donations appeared large …[intervenes]     Chair, if the previous donations that I explained and elaborated on looked large, they are about to be dwarfed by some significant developments that we will now go into detail on.     Just before you do, Chair, we are now at the heart of what EOH had discovered after they appointed us, after what we initially found on the investigation and we reported to the Hawks, to the DPCI.     Thank you.  Mr Chaskalson?     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair, at page 480 of the bundle we have an email from a Nyikomutileni@EOH.co.za.      Nyiko.     Correct, Chair.  Thank you and it is addressed to Jehan Mackay sent on 2 November 2015 and it forwards City of Johannesburg outsourced IT services     Certainly.     Correct.  He is forwarding to his bosses because the City is now advertising the tender.     Chair and we are about to go into how upset EOH were that this was being advertised.     Correct.     Chair, I have previously testified that we have only come across Geoff Makhubo who engages with Patrick Makhubedu.     And it appears, I am assuming and I think correctly so, Chair, that this “notify Mr Makhubedu because of Geoff’s influence” because it is clear Mr Makhubedu has a very good relationship with Geoff Makhubo.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct.  Chair, on 7 November, this is at the bottom of that page 453, Ebrahim Laher wrote an     Ebrahim Laher.     It is not very clear but it is clear Mr Bohbot replies, so I assume it has to Mr Bohbot.     Correct.  Mr Chaskalson is quite correct, Chair.     He goes on to say that – on the next page at 454. “Also it seems that certain camps want to reduce the scope of this contract radically even though they do not have the skills to run the system or the billing department.  This could create a billing crisis again unless the plan is to somehow obtain our skills in another way poaching/another partner.”     Certainly.  Chair, I am on 483.     Certainly.     It starts at the bottom, Chair, with a note     Mpho Kotane.     Certainly, Chair.  The document attached appears to be a letter from City of Johannesburg addressed to this Nyiko Mutileni and it is addressed to EOH Technology and Outsourcing and it is dated 23     Ja.  Basically it is asking for sponsorships of a whole lot of goodies, technical, laptops, smart phones, gift vouchers, power banks, memory sticks, etcetera, as part of a promotion prize, competition prices.  It ends after a description of all the items on the next page, Chair, at     Kganane.     Yes Chair his email underneath describes himself as someone from the City, it is Thumelakje@joburg.org.za.     And the letter is from City of Johannesburg of course.     At the top we see that Nyiko Mutileni sends this to Jehan Mackay and he copies Jaze Gordon, at the time Jaze Gordon was Jehan Mackay’s personal assistant, and it is dated 13 November 2015, request for donation and promotional items attaching the document, the letter     Certainly.     This document at 456, Chair, is an email from Ebrahim Laher to Asher Bohbot dated 20 November 15 and the subject is, City of Johannesburg A649 Support, “Hi Asher, the CAJ Support tender has come out we have our work cut out and meeting with Parks’ people tomorrow afternoon”, At the time, Chair, Parks Tau was the Executive Mayor, that email goes on to say, “Have spoken to Pat and Jehan and will manage that angle separately”,  And, Chair, I’m presuming the Pat refers to Patrick Makhubedu who seems to have been integral to City of Johannesburg, “Am hopeful we will know more after tomorrow and then there’s a line below that, good intel on COJ from Sal today at SAP UK, Regards Ebrahim Laher”.     Chair, if I may just bring the connection, the earlier emails that we looked at the, EOH Team referred to a technical and a political strategy and I suspect that this, spoken to Pat and Jehan and will manage that angle separately, refers to a political strategy, thank you.     No, I’m not certain Mr Chaskalson.     Certainly, Chair, and I may just add, I can confirm what Mr Chaskalson has read because I have seen the original, unfortunately my copy, like yours is unclear, but I do confirm the content of that email.  The next one that Mr Chaskalson referred to is Jehan Mackay, Ray COJ upgrade consortium, 2 December 2015 he writes to Ashley de Klerk and he copies Patrick Makhubedu, Ebrahim Laher, Neyeko Mutheleni as well as Kurton Seta [7.00 ?], these     It’s usually a smiley face Chair and the EBS that’s referred, that appears to be a reference to Ebrahim Laher and abbreviation of his name and the Pat appears to be Patrick Makhubedu who he is in the stream, thanks Jehan and then…[intervenes].     Mr Chair, they’re going to give benefits to the City of Joburg.     Sorry, they’re going to give benefits – they’re going to provide goodwill to the organisation so it’s to build in some allowance.     Yes, Mr Chair, that was a Freudian slip, I think Chair knows which organisation I was referring to.     It’s money yes…[intervenes].     We need to build in a goodwill figure, Mr Chair, so if I draw the link between the dots it appears to be, we will need to make a donation to the ANC.     And when we look at what transpires, it would appear that what I just suggested is correct.     Chair if you just go back to 645, you’ll see that this document is part of a bank statement and it’s Molelwane Consulting CC [11.29?] FNB, business cheque account and their number and then Mr Chaskalson is referring me to page 646, Chair and on 646, if we have a look at the document…[intervenes].     Apologies, Chair, I’ve got too many files in front of me, thank you.     1 February, Mr Chair, there’s a magtape credit, Patrick Makhubedu Mfundi R200 000.     Chair, I’ve mentioned before, we’ve seen a pattern, this time the balance was R63.19.  So, there was almost nothing in that account.     Correct, Chair.     P Makhubedu Mfundi.     I’ve got it Chair.     Certainly,  this document on 344, Chair, is an email from Reno Barry and the email address is renob@renobarryconsulting.co.za and it is dated 6 January 17 to Patrick Makhubedu, subject, “Mfundi ANC recon”, and it has an attachment, “Mfundi GM, ANC, updated 13 August 2016 spreadsheet and Mfundi Management Report,     Correct, Chair, so there’s a first attachment and Mr Chaskalson is going to the second attachment to that email.     Correct, and we’ll come back to that one later, Chair.     Chair, just apologies, my copy is, again, cut off slightly so there’s – Mfundi Management Report dated December 16 and this seems to be the Management Report, there’s a narration at the top, that’s cut off, Mr Chaskalson so if you don’t mind, can I ask that you read that in and then I will continue?     Profit and loss, I’ve only got the loss report…[intervenes].     It’s got half of the wording, so I know there’s a narration for a travel company.     Half of the narration.     Mr Chair, this seems to refer to R16million.     Absolutely, so this is an email from Ebrahim Lehar, and it’s dated Wednesday 3 February 2016 and it’s addressed to Ashley de Klerk, Kirton[?] Sita [?], Steven Lurkenthorn[?] and various other EOH employees and it’s headed – subject header is, “status of stuff” and it     Asher Bohbot Chair, the Chief Executive Officer of EOH at the time.     Chair, it escapes me at the moment.     Correct.     Chair, just before I go into 652, I’ll just identify, this is the second page of a bank statement for Molelwane Consulting and it’s a Gold business account with the account number and …[intervenes].     Correct and the statement date is 17 May 16 and Mr Chaskalson is going to take me to the 25 t h of April…[intervenes].     Thank you.     Yes.     Correct Chair.     And on page 652 we look at 25 April you’ll see that there is a magtape credit, description, P Makhubedu and the amount is R50 000 and if I may pre-empt Mr Chaskalson’s next question, Chair, the balance preceding this deposit, was R617.77, so the account was almost depleted and it got this deposit from Patrick Makhubedu.     Exactly, Chair, that’s what it clearly looks like.     Yes, that is correct. ADV CHASKALSON     So, we’ve got to go to…[intervenes].          That is the R50 000 that we’ve just referred to Chair.    It appears in the Mfundi documents so clearly it looks like Mfundi made the payment Chair.    Certainly.  Chair this document is dated 30 April 2016 and it is a Molelwane Holdings Pty Limited Tax Invoice addressed to TSS Managed Services Pty Limited and attention Patrick Makhubedu – Mr P Makhubedu and it – the description there is Professional Services Lan and Wan services rendered as per agreement.  Lan and Wan Services R500 000.00 and I think Chair noted that there is no date of when the services were rendered previously.   And the value at the bottom with VAT is R570 000.00 and the reference again is to Molelwane Consulting bank account.  So it is that anomaly I drew Chair’s attention to where the invoice says Holdings but the account is consulting.    No Chair I have – I have answered this previously we could not find the services being provided.    Correct Chair.    And if I can add I mentioned previously we spoke to people who worked on the project.  We also did extensive email reviews and normally when it is an on-going  project there is exchanges of progress – nothing of the sort Chair.    No Chair we have not gone that far.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair if I may say you know we were not investigating Molelwane.    But when the commission asked us to see if there is any documents.    We found a lot of documents as Chair can see.    Certainly.  Chair at 495 we have an email from Ebrahim Laher dated Saturday 9 March 2019 – sorry this cannot be the right page.    Oh sorry.    Ja.  So we have got 17 May 2016 Nyiko Mutileni writes to Ebrahim Laher at EOH.  The subject header Request for Sponsorship and he seems to forward this request and the request below is from Nboniseni Nemaangani at City of Johannesburg.    Thank you Mr Chaskalson.  This document is then forwarded to Ebrahim Laher and it appears …    Yes.    497?    Correct.  This appears to be the request for sponsorship and it refers to a request for sponsorship New York trip.  It is addressed to – it looks like a Mr Tinyiko Mutileni.  I do not know if that is another name of the Nyiko Mutileni that we referred to.    Thank you.   And it is basically a request for sponsorship trip New York trip and  “Please receive our request for sponsorship in pursuance of the trip to City of New York.  The trip is from 1 to June 16.  Delegates will be able to attend student exhibition, be part of the celebration of completion of the global partners junior 15/2016 curriculum which is focussed on arts in cities around the world.”    Correct.    Just one second.      The second email in the string is an email from Geoff Makhubo sent to Asher Bohbot copying Patrick Makhubedu and Jehan Mackay as well as Ebrahim Laher and it is dated 19 May 2016 and its subject is Request for Donation. “Dear Mr Bohbot please find request letter for a donation.  As you are probably aware we have twelve weeks to elections and the costs are escalating.  We request a response of the earliest convenience.  We hope that our request will meet your favourable consideration. Regards Geoff Makhubo Regional Treasurer ANC Greater Johannesburg Region.” And that same cell number for Mr Makhubo that Chair recorded earlier.    Correct Chair.    No it is pending.    Chair at page 499 we find an African National Congress letter Greater Johannesburg Region Office of the Regional Treasurer directed to Mr Asher Bohbot Group Chief Executive Officer at EHO Mthombo Pty Limited copying Jehan Mackay, Ebrahim Lehar, Patrick Makhubedu dated 19 May 2016.  Request for Financial Assistance. “Dear Mr Bohbot we would like to thank you for the continued support that your company has been giving to the African National Congress in the past.  The support ensured that our activities become successful.  The ANC in Greater Johannesburg Region is preparing for the 2016 elections.  As part of the process the region is finalising the process of nominating its candidates therefore the election campaign will be full steam starting with the local manifesto launch and unveiling of our Mayoral candidate. As discussed with your colleagues in previous meetings these activities require resources to execute and the elections budget is R50 million.  The Regional Executive Committee humbly requests and will appreciate contribution and transfers as per timelines below.”   And then there is a table Chair.  The table reflects date of transfer and the amount and it reflects 18 May 2016 R5 million.  30 May 2016 R5 million.  15 June 2016 R10 million.  30 June 2016 R10 million.  22 July 2016 R10 million.  1 August 2016 R4million.  15 August 2016 R3 million.  30 August 2016 R3 million.  The total is the R50 000.00 and then it provides the…    Ag R50 million as we said earlier Chair.  Apologies.   “And then what follows are the account details and the statement that these are important activities in the calendar of the ANC and our mandate renewal by the electorate. Your support is highly appreciated and we thank you in advance for your commitment and contribution towards strengthening democracy. Yours in Democracy signed Geoff Makhubo Regional Treasurer with the cell number.”    Chair 193 there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu dated 25 May 2016 sent to Rene Jonker.  Rene Jonker Chair will recall is the Finance person at EOH and it attaches invoice 22 April 2016 pdf.  And the narration is very short. “Hi please pay this asap.”    That is correct Chair.    Yes if we start at the bottom of the page it looks like this was a purchase order -  a purchase approval that was sent to – on 26 May 2016 to Rob Godlington.  Rob Godlington was one of the Executives at EOH and he received this purchase order approval request and it spoke about the R570 000.00 amount and it referred to Mololwane Consulting and it was requested by Wesley Van Rheede and the date was 26 May.  He then writes Rob Godlington writes to Peter Wynne at EOH regarding the purchase order    Ja.  Chair that is the abbreviation for Enterprise Development. So it usually involved empowerment spend to develop small SME’s.    Thank you.    I would not have thought Molelwane would have qualified Chair but so let me continue. “ED for City of Joburg it was budgeted for in the financial year 16 numbers.  I asked Rene for a schedule at the time of ED payments budgeted when we compile the budgets then if the amount is in the budget I do not ask any further questions.”    If I may say Chair the enquiry as to the purchase order what is this all about seems to have been very superficial because if management had dug into this that should have raised red flags.    That is also disturbing Chair.    It is people looking the other way.    At 503 Chair we have got an email from Geoff Makhubo sent to Patrick Makhubedu copying in Ibrahim Laher and Jehan Mackay and the subject is Progress on    Not yet.      Certainly Chair the document before us on page 267 of Bundle 3 is a Molelwane Consulting CC account.    Yes.    Certainly.  This one is described as Molelwane Consulting CC and it has a CK registration 1997 salary account as the header Chair.  And then it refers to a gold business account.    Certainly Chair on 30 May there is an electronic magtape credit – apologies – TSS MS Pty Limited and it is the 570 that we referred to earlier Chair.  And if I follow and pre-empt Mr Chaskalson’s next question.    The balance in that account was R268.00  just before this large cash inflow of R570 000.00.    849.  Chair.    31 May 2016 there it reflects a transfer – internet transfer R50 000.00 and it – the narration is Payment to Mr Makhubo’s FNB account.    There is another transfer of …    31 May 2016.    Correct Chair and the one that I am referring to is immediately below that.    Is R200 000.00.    Ja.    I think what Mr Chaskalson seems to be pointing out Mr Chair is that the monies go to Molelwane Consulting.    And then find its way to Mr Makhubo’s personal account.    Certainly.  Chair the letter on page 504 is the – a letter from the City of Johannesburg.  It is a registered letter sent to EOH Mthombo attention Ebrahim Laher. “Dear Sir/Madam.  And it refers to Proposal number A647 request for proposal for the appointment of service provider for the SAP implementation/upgrade for period of three years.  Kindly be advised that your offer in respect of an appointment of services provided for the SAP implementation/upgrade has been approved by the Executive Adjudication Committee at its meeting held on 2 June 2016.” So Mr Chaskalson referred Chair to the fact that the last communication was end of May.  Just over a week later we now have the award…    Two days later apologies.  We now have the award Chair and then there is – reflects that this award is effective for a three-year period, commencing from the letter of acceptance and it refers to Service 1, SAP Implementation, R 297 895 680,00. Service     A fraction over R 404 million, Chair.     On 8 June 2016.     Ja.     Correct.     Chair, this is a purchase order.  It is EOH SAP Services.  That is their division run by Mr Laher.  And it looks like EOH Infrastructure Technologies is delivering to EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd, Bedfordview.   And it then goes into details on – dated 27 June 2015 and goes into detail regarding the provision of various computer periphery, hardware, software. And the value of all of that Chair comes to R 204 095,00.     Certainly, Chair.  There is an invoice on page 506, EOH Mathombo.  The invoice date is 30 June 2016.  And if we look at the invoice, it refers to – it is generated by EOH Infrastructure Technologies and it is addressed to EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd.   But Chair, if you look at the column on the right, you will see that the delivery address is Masa House, 12 New Street, Dundee Square, Marshalltown.       Yes.  Chair, on page 521, there we have another purchase order.  This one is directed to Serendipity Tours in Waterfall Centre, Midrand and ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     And the delivery address is reflected as delivered to EOH Mathombo and the company that is addressing it, is EOH SAP Services, Mr Laher’s business.  And if we look at this, it refers to purchase numbers, dates, categories. The date is 29 June 2016.  And if we look at the description, it looks like this is a tour of some sorts.  So it is a proforma invoice, 11 May 2016, COJ Team.   And then there is a list of names and some of those names featured on some of the documents we saw previously.  So it is Nboniseni Nemaangani.  I see it is on the list and various others.  There are 18 names.  And what this entails ...[intervenes]      Yes?     [No audible reply]      21, Chair.     Apologies, Chair.     Not at all Chair.       Certainly.  This is a purchase order and it comes from EOH SAP Services, EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd.  It is addressed to Serendipity Tours who are based in Midrand and it is has got a delivery address to EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd but what is referred to in the description below Chair is, there is a list of names of COJ Team and it refers to a proforma invoice dated 11 May 2016.  And if you look at the narration, it talks about a list of 18 names and that is referred to as the COJ Team.  And then, flights on Emirates.  Return airport hotel and private transfers.  Six nights accommodation at 3 Star Hampton in Manhattan Time Square, 5 to 11 June 2016, and seven standard twin-room sharing, three standard single rooms with breakfast, approximate airport taxes included. So this seems to be a delegation going to New York that EOH is paying for around the time that they awarded this tender which, as I indicated earlier, from just good business practice, it is really bad Chair.       Correct.     It is pretty abnormal Chair, particularly while a bid pending with that particular service provider.  It is just seems totally unacceptable.     Chair, for any listed company in South Africa, most of those organisations would have a compliance team. And if we look at the EOH of today, Mr Van Coller is putting the Compliance Team and a whole lot of policies and controls.     At that time, there was one compliance officer for the EOH Group and it was a massive group at that time.  And I am not criticising the compliance officer but whenever did anything, they did not even advised the Compliance Team and there was no scrutiny that would have suggested that it would be prudent not to do this kind of activity pending or after an award.     If you remember the previous documents, it did speak about this being a sponsored initiative by the Executive Mayor’s Office.  So there is still the annexed to The City of Johannesburg and it is still coming from the service provider who is busy bidding for work of City of Johannesburg.  So I still maintain my view that it is highly inappropriate.     No problem, Chair.     Ja, five minutes is fine.     Yes.  Chair, on 525 in the middle of the page there is a forwarded message from Patrick Makhubedu dated Tuesday July 19th, 2016, and it is sent to Ebrahim Laher.     That is correct, Chair, those I did identify the two who were in that string previously.     Copy invoice, Chair, and I must apologise, the copy is very, very faint, so...     To be from Mfundi Mobile Networks (Pty) Ltd, Chair, and it is addressed to EOH Mthombo (Pty) Ltd     Exactly right, Chair.    Very similar scenario, Chair, in the middle of the page there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu dated July 19, 2016 and it is addressed to Ebrahim Laher     It is the second amount of 4 million, Chair.     Ja.     Correct., it is another transaction of the exact same amount.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     Chair, just bear in mind the 16 million that was approved earlier.     Because it is going to tie up to that figure.     Certainly, Chair.  And again we have a similar pattern.  Just above the middle of the page there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu dated Tuesday the 19 July 2016 and it is sent to Ebrahim Laher and the narration     Yes, exactly right, Chair, on the following page there is a more legible total and you will see it ends with Patrick Makhubedu and his cell number.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     16 million ex Vat.     Certainly.  You now have more context to the schedules that are attached to this email.  So if we just revisit the email, Chair will remember that this was from Reno Barry and Reno Barry you will remember was the person that was very active on Mfundi Mobile.  It is dated 6 January 2017 and it is sent to Patrick Makhubedu and the subject was Mfundi ANC Recon and then it attached the two documents.  We have referred to the one document which was an extract from a Mfundi management report and the second item is GM ANC updated – or sorry, the first time GM ANC updated 13 August 2016 and just to     No, I was just thinking of the irony, it could have been JM and I would have understood, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Page 345 is this reconciliation, it is headed Mfundi Mobile expenses, ANC GM.     We see sales, COJ SAP support special, 16 million and the total for sales 16 million and then we have …[intervenes]     We have just looked at the 4 million, 4 million, 8 million from Patrick Makhubedu, Chair, so this seems to tie up to that and you will remember that it also ties back to a letter of request for 50 million.  It would appear that EOH paid 16, not the 50 that was requested and they paid it in the broken up tranches of 4 million, 4 million and 8 million.     Which were invoiced by Mfundi, indeed.     Chair, you are quite correct.     But having said that, they did give a monthly budget that they needed to receive.     And that did come to the 50 million on the request.     So that was part of it but if you read the preceding page it is exactly what Chair is suggesting.     This is the amount they need.     Chair, I concur, those were my thoughts exactly.     Chair, if I may just pause on this because, you know, the making of political donations is not per se irregular but when you make it to one political party and you do it at a time when a bid or a tender is being adjudicated it becomes problematic.  So any compliance team worth its salt would have blocked this, they would have told the company you cannot go there but unfortunately, at the time they did not have a robust compliance programme in place and they did not have the wherewithal to stop it and I think almost by design the old EOH did not create the controls because it would have inhibited this kind of behaviour.  Thank you, Chair.     Mr Chair, Mr Chaskalson is quite right and that is the second part of what I did what to convey to Chair is that this was a concealed donation, they did not outright go and make a payment to the ANC, they paid Mfundi and the document we are about to take Chair through is a recon from Mfundi.  What the ANC then did is they supplied all of their election campaign expenses, printing, advertising and all the different aspects, expenses that go with preparing for an election, the ANC would submit invoices to Mfundi and Mfundi would deduct it from the 16 million balance and Chair will recall that Reno Barry had indicated that there was just a couple of hundred thousand left over and we are about to go through this list of items, Chair.     Correct.     Correct, ja.     Exactly right, Chair.  That is what happened.     Certainly.  Chair, there is a column on this reconciliation called cost of sales …[intervenes]     Chair, Mfundi has not done any work for EOH.     Other than manage these donations.     No, Chair.     No, all that has happened is they have been a front for receiving the political donation and they disbursed payments for expenses for the ANC.     Correct.     Correct, Chair, it is a misnomer, a misrepresentation.       And in fact, Chair, it doubles into an accounting irregularity on the EOH side because they are concealing the donation in their books and records.     This should have been recorded as a donation and it should have gone to, you know, the party, that is what they chose to do.     But instead it was hidden in the books and records in this fashion.     Ja.     Ja, correct.     Correct, Chair.     Well, they put it in as cost of sales.     Chair, there is the cost of sales less management fees and taxes, 2.4 million.  So Mfundi has taken a commission for its role in what looks like almost laundering funds.     That looks like it Chair.     Chair, but if I may, the other interesting thing about this document is that it reflects that both Mfundi and the EOH people that were involved in this, they have linked the donation to the ANC to the COJ tender because they are putting in as cost of sales.     Chair, at 691 we have Black & White T Shirts (Pty) Ltd issuing an invoice that is date 27 July 2017 and there is an invoice number.     2016, 27 July 2016.     It is invoiced to Jolidee Matongo and if we look at the description it says S & P polyester yellow tee-shirt printed – and it looks like abbreviation for full colour front plus one colour back, 20 000 at R29.70, total amount 594 000 and with VAT that figure comes to on the invoice R677 160 and if we go back to our document at 345 there is the figure.  So you can see this looks like tee-shirt printing as part of the election campaign, Chair.     Chair, at 689 we have got an email from Geoff Makhubo dated 27 July 2016 to Patrick Makhubedu     Chair and it looks like the supplier wanted a 50% deposit before they incurred the cost.     So if you look at the preceding request from Jolidee Matongo, it is asking for 50% payment by today.      Certainly.     Got it, ja.     Chair, at 680 we have an invoice from Nahana Holdings (Pty) Ltd and the customer is reflected as Greater Johannesburg Region, ANC, contact Geoff Makhubo and the Johannesburg with what appears to be Mr Makhubo’s cell number again, it is dated 20 July 2016 and there is an invoice number of NNCJ004 and then the description, it says Greater Johannesburg Region, ANC#Real Stuff, second tranche invoice and then it has got #Real Stuff Social Media Strategy, establish content structure for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, contracting of influential ambassadors, senior social media strategists, analytics and monitoring reports, scheduling and strategy planning, PR and branding and there are various other items, there is content development and real stuff on ground activations and there is a figure of 1 250 000 and a grand total with VAT is 1 425 000, Chair.     Correct.     And if we look at 679, Chair, at the bottom, a Sibusisogumede@nahana.biz emails the attached invoice that we have just looked at for 1 250 000, it gets sent to Andy Dikoba at Di Data and copied to Sifiso Zulu and then this gets forwarded and then - on 22 July 2016 and it goes to Obakeng Ansel Chikane and also to Geoff Makhubo and that gets forwarded from Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makhubedu on 22 July 2016.  The underlying email seemed to refer to Dimension Data but it looks like this was paid by Mfundi, not by Data.     Correct.     Certainly.  So at the bottom of 668 Chair there is an email from Jola D Matonga, this name we referred to earlier, she sends this email through on 13 July 16 to Geoff Makhuba and she sends it to a Gmail as well as a City of Johannesburg address, and copies a person by the name of Bruce Serella and the subject header is     Correct Chair it looks like she is a government official.      No, I think COJ has a different address, this could be a government department Chair.     Certainly 669 and 670 are invoices from Sherena Printers invoiced to the African National Congress and the invoice contains the detail, order number is just referred to as Jola D Matonga and it refers to 40 500 A1 posters re order Jo’burg only 135 [one thirty five] different kinds of A1 posters, 300 of each printed in full colour, an amount of R518 400 with VAT the total amount there is R590 976.     670 is the second invoice form the same source, Sherena Printers CC and it has the same order number as Jola D ...[intervenes]      Sorry thanks Chair, I have gone closer to the mic Chair.     This is also addressed to the African National Congress.     670.     And it refers to 135 000, description is A5 leaflets, Joburg only, 135 awards, 135 different kind of A5 leaflets being 1 000 of each printed in full colour and an amount on the right as R345 375 and the VAT inclusive number is R403 987,50.     Chair on 683 we have an email from Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makubedu and it refers to business request, or bus request for PR Councillors and the narration is just yes and it is sent from my IPhone and that follows a question from Patrick Makubedu just saying so we must only pay R1 736 000 with Patrick Makubedu’s name and cell number just below that and that seem to have referred to the preceding email on 22 July 2016 which was sent by Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makubedu and it had a figure, it contained a table which referred to various suppliers, Black Brain appears on the table near the bottom of the page at the top Chair and it has an invoice number BBANC280616 and an amount of R2,736 000 and what Mr Makubedu seems to be asking is so we must pay only 17 – R1 736 000 the Black Brain number and the answer was yes.       Yes I see there’s another email referenced on 22 July 2016 when Geoff Makhubo wrote to Patrick Makubedu, he wrote Black Brain and I think it’s just a typo in R1 736 000 and in brackets it says “[we had paid them R1million from the ANC account] otherwise all is fine”.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes.     Certainly.     Certainly Taj Printers R331 592 Chair.    This is at 345, it is the reconciliation.     And that document there is just two lines below the middle the reference to Taj Printers Chair.     The amount for Taj is R331 592 Chair.     Certainly Paper Push Printers is reflected on the reconciliation as R185 820 Chair, and there’s another amount just slightly higher up, just above the middle of the reconciliation there’s Paper Push Printers R64 980.     And going back to the table we have got Paper Push 18 July 16, R64 980.     Sorry Chair, this is page 685.     Six eight five.     Chair and if you look at that number the 64980 is the number of the schedule for Paper Push Printers, the higher reference, just above the middle of the page.     Volume 1?     Yes certainly, I see Black and White about seven lines down.     Just one second.   677 160.     It is reflected in July, sorry the numbers are slightly out of sync.     Certainly.     Yes.     R1 425 000 Chair.    Yes I can see that Chair.       Certainly, Taj Printers is also in the same column Chair so it looks like also July an amount of R331 592.      Paper Push Chair we have got also in that July column, R64 980 which was that number in the table that we just looked at on one of the invoices.     Chair I am using a page as my ruler otherwise it becomes very difficult.     Chair for Flywell Travel we have a figure of R89 000 – there’s two – sorry let me just make sure – there are two columns, the one is R207 025 and the second figure is R89 330.      Certainly.     Chair at 693 there’s an email from a Depika Bana and it is sent to Patrick Makubedu’s gmail address and there is a Ayaaz Ahmed cc’d and it refers to subject invoice HOF and then a number of 0153043 and it refers to Excel Flywell Travels Pretoria Pty Limited and the narration     The very last page in the bundle Chair, There’s an invoice at page 800 from Flywell, Excel Flywell Travel Pretoria Pty Limited and it is addressed to Mfundi Mobile Networks, it refers – it is described as a computer generated tax invoice and it refers to air tickets and the passenger name on the detail is – it refers to a ticket number Makhubo Malotoa Geoffrey Mr and it appears to be J & B Grubog JFK Johannesburg and ...[intervenes]      Chair we just did this check a couple of weeks ago and we confirmed that this is a trip from Johannesburg to São Paulo in Brazil, followed by a connecting flight to Bogota in Columbia and a return from Bogota via JFK to Johannesburg South Africa.     The amount is R80 000 for the ticket totals R80 350 and the number including VAT is R89 330 and that is the number that we just looked at on the schedule Chair related to the second expense for Flywell Travel.     Yes.     Correct.     Chair and again the anomaly with this is it is reflected by Mfundi as a cost of sales on the SAP support for COJ and again the timing is really bad Chair.     Certainly Chair at 694 we have a Standard Bank payment receipt, beneficiary name Flywell Travel an then the account number, it is with ABSA Bank and it is an ABSA electronic settlement, beneficiary reference LO8227, your reference Flywell and the amount is R89 330 so this was clearly paid and this is the proof of payment Chair.     Chair if I may I would like to point out that EOH have actually lost money even though it appears to have been tainted by corruption with the concealed donations the City of Johannesburg hasn’t paid for these services and EOH have paid away to all the third parties, including Mfundi and so EOH is actually suffering the new EOH with new management is actually struggling in not recovering this money and they are currently bleeding in terms of the project and I think that is something Mr Van Coller  highlighted, so I think what it says Chair is that if people were crooked they were not very efficient crooks.     Certainly Chair. 
POWELL: Correct Mr Chair that account we ascertained belongs to Jehan Mackay.   And it is has an ID number of 6802085374083.   Decor, twin accommodation, single accommodation.  So it seems to be a conference with accommodation and all of the necessary for the conference.   On 602, on 6 August 14 at   That is the entity which reflects Patrick Makhubedu as the principle Chair.   Chair, this is an email from Patrick Makhubedu sent to Geoff Makhubo on 15 September 2014 and the subject is COJ Upgrade Award docex.  Attachments, COJ Upgrade Award doc.  And then it has got an HTT 00001 reference.   And attached to that on the very next page is a draft letter coming from Mr Makhubedu and it is addressed, this draft is addressed to TSS Managed Services.   So what we must remember is.  Mr Makhubedu is sending this to Mr Makhubo.   “SAP upgrade programme, change management lead.” And then there seems to be a document attached.   Mr Chaskalson, do you want me to…[intervenes].   Correct, Chair, and it looks like …[intervenes] 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
COUNSEL:   No problem with me at all.  I just want to make sure that Mr Powell ...[intervenes]      He may just need a bit of time to rearrange flights, et cetera.  But we will do that.   
ADV CHASKALSON CC:   And we will reprint it with columns, with cells with borders to one can see the lines.     There is one – we have already talked about the cost of sales to Molelwani Consulting for R50 000, there is another line item that I want to identify to you, that is the cost of sales on page 346 for Flywell Travel.
