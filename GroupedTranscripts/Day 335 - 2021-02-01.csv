CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Freund, good morning everybody.    Are you able to hear me quite clearly? ADV FREUND    Oh okay.  Okay hopefully it will improve as we go along.  I just want to announce that this week the evidence leader Mr Alec Freund SC who is going to be leading evidence relating to Parliamentary oversight is not physically here in the venue.  We have not done this before it has been witnesses who have been away from the venues sometimes and appear via video link but the situation in which we are forces us to explore various ways and I have allowed that he appears virtually and we hope that this situation where both the evidence leader and the witness are not physically before me is going to be smooth but there may be some technical glitches but we hope that they will not be too much.  Thank you Mr Freund with that introduction I now give you the floor.    I am sorry …    I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Freund I do not know whether there is some unusual delay when I speak before you hear; if there is the technicians should try and do what needs to be done to improve that.  For certain reasons I suggest that we swear in your first witness and then you do your brief opening address.  Is that fine?    Is that so.    Is that so.  Maybe – well maybe in that event I should allow you to do your brief opening address because for that you – you will just be the only one speaking because I can hear you quite well I think.  Then thereafter and before – thereafter we might just swear in the witness and then take an adjournment to allow the technicians to attend to the problem.  So I think let us start with your opening address instead of the other way around.    Yes.     Thank you Mr Freund for your opening address.  Yes, I think what we should do is, call your first witness, Mr Godi and let him get sworn in.  And then we will take the adjournment after that.       Yes.     Yes.     Good morning Mr Godi.     Can you hear me?     Can you hear me well?  335     Not so well?  Okay what we ...[intervenes]      What we are going to do is have the oath or affirmation administered to you and after that has been done we will take an adjournment so that the technicians can attend to what needs to be done to make sure everybody can hear me well.  You understand that?     Okay.  Registrar, please administer the oath to Mr Godi or affirmation.  He will tell you which one he prefers.  Come and stand...  Oh, you do not have the... You need that for the...  Oh, that is the mobile one.  Then come and stand where he can see you as well.       Thank you Mr Godi.  We are going to take an adjournment now and I do not know how long it is going to be.  It depends on the technicians but I am given an indication that it might be ten minutes.  Technicians, it is technically possible for me to see both the witness and the evidence leader in different screens?     Okay alright.  If it is technically possible, technologically possible, I will prefer to see both as the evidence leader asks questions and the witness answers questions, rather than having a situation where the leader, the evidence leader will ask a question and then he will disappear and the witness will come up.  If possible.   But if that is going to take quite some time to do, then we can continue in the meantime and then at some stage then we can change.  But if it is not technologically possible it is fine.  We will make do with what we have.  We are going to have the ten minutes’ adjournment.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Mr Freund, I understand that some improvement has been made but it does not solve the  335 problem completely, is that correct?     Okay.  No, that is fine, let us proceed then.     Yes, so just for the record we will be using bundle 1 certainly during Mr Godi’s evidence.  I do not know whether that is the bundle we will use for the rest of the day but if there is a change you will announce.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Before we proceed …[intervenes]     I am sorry, Mr Freund?  I am sorry, Mr Freund.       Mr Godi, I must thank you for availing yourself to come and assist the Commission by giving evidence.  I just – I normally say that at the beginning so I thought I would say that to Mr Godi.     I am sorry, Mr Freund?     I just want to ask Mr Godi a question about his comment that he has just made.  Mr Godi, the point you have made that SCOPA largely operated as a committee and as a team irrespective of the different political parties from which its members came and you have said that that set SCOPA apart from other committees.  What do you think was responsible for that, namely for the committee or SCOPA to operate as a team irrespective of which political parties its members came from and doing so for the public good, which it seems implied in your evidence, was not the case with other parliamentary committees.     So I guess that was …[intervenes]     I guess that what you are saying is you, as the Chairperson, made it your mission to try and achieve that spirit in the team and that commitment in the team.     Okay, thank you, Mr Freund, you can proceed.     I am sorry, Mr Freund, Mr Godi are you quite confident that out of all those years, during which you served as Chairperson of SCOPA and I think you said 18 years.  Effectively, the position is that the financial statements, or reports relating to SOE’s or certain important SOE’s or all of them and government departments, wherever there had been reports that were not acceptable the previous year, the following year  335 SCOPA would raise the same issues again and they would just not be - the response would not be one that would be the right response from either the Ministers or the accounting officer ’s.  So in other words, are you quite confident that as a matter of fact, even if it is not all the entities, but those important SOE’s and then maybe certain government departments, problems that had emerged in the previous year, would be raised in the following year to say, what have you done about this?  And it would be year in, year out and most of the time, the problems would not be addressed that SCOPA had raised, including problems that were pointed out in the AG’s reports about such government departments and SOE’s, actually do you say that is likely to be the position?     Well, I am sure Mr Freund d will deal with this later but I want to ask this question now.  With the frustrations that I assume SKOPA must have felt over the years arising from raising issues with the executive year in year out and the issues not being addressed either at all for a number of years, or not being addressed adequately.  Did it every occur to SCOPA that it should consider saying to the National Assembly, the accounting officers, the DG’s, or chief executive officers of these Boards, and the Boards themselves are not addressing serious problems involving taxpayer ’s money for a number of years and the Ministers concerned do not seem to take any action against the chief executive officers Board.  This should be raised with the President whoever the President was to say this is unacceptable.  This is how long it has taken. Instead of improving maybe the situation is deteriorating.  This is taxpayers and to then see what the President whoever the President was, would do and if he did not do anything I would like to find out whether you  335 as SCOPA or maybe you yourself, because maybe you did not discuss this would not feel that that should form grounds for the National Assembly to lose confidence in the President if under his administration, such things affecting taxpayers money were not addressed and he was not doing anything about it or was not prepared to take necessary actions.     Ja, yes, continue.     No, I understand, I understand but from what you are saying, part of what you are saying is that in the end, a lot of things in parliament that may be necessary to be done cannot be done or will not be done if the majority party does not support those things, so in the end, very often you come down to that.     Yes, thank you, Mr Freund.     I am sorry again, Mr Freund to interrupt you.  We did not take the tea break at quarter past 11 because we had had some, we had wasted, we had lost some time.  It is 12 o'clock I think we should take it now 15 minutes.     Because it is 12 o'clock at quarter past 12 we will resume.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    We…    Are you going back to his affidavit now?    Sorry Mr – Sorry Mr Freund you say page 13?    The black numbers?  335    The black numbers.    Okay.     Just before you proceed Mr Freund.  Can I ask another question to Mr Godi relating to something in his affidavit?     This phenomenon Mr Godi...  This phenomenon you are talking about of all ANC members of SCOPA not being retained.  Is that something that happened at the end of one particular term of Parliament for five years or is something that happened – something similar had happened during other terms as far as you know or is it something that you do not know?     Yes.     H’m, h’m.  Okay thank you.  You may proceed Mr Freund.     I am sorry.  What is that reference Mr Freund again?     I have got it.  Thank you Mr Freund.     But Mr Godi, you might not be able to say anything about this but this is really shocking.  I mean, even in regard to PRASA.  I have heard a lot of evidence about allegations of corruption at PRASA.   But even in regard to PRASA who have a situation where in the 2013/2014 financial year irregular expenditure is 0.1 billion.  And in the following year it goes up quite substantially about half a billion irregular expenditure. I mean, the following year, financial year 2015/2016 you have R 15.3 billion irregular expenditure.  How – the previous year it was bad enough being half a billion but it was not even one billion.   The following financial year it is R 15 billion.  As if that is not enough.  The following financial year is R 20.3 billion.  And of course, 2017/2018 it is R 24,2 billion.   I mean, what kind of thing is that?  I mean, where are the people who were supposed to make sure that these rules are complied with?   As you say, irregular expenditure does not necessarily mean it is corruption but when it is at this level and happening the way this table seems to show, there would be great suspicion that a substantial part of it is corruption as far as I am concerned. But how it is possible?  Where is the relevant  335 Minister if the CEO is not doing his job, if the board is not doing its job?  Where is the President who should be getting reports about the state of affairs of SOE’s who should be told about this situation at PRASA? Where are the politicians?  What are they doing?  And then of course, we go back to Parliament.  Parliament gets told about this.  SCOPA does what he can.   The National Assembly becomes aware of this, year in and year out but National Assembly can see that the people at PRASA are not taking any note of disapproval from SCOPA about this level of expenditure every year.  Actually, it looks like each time as SCOPA say something they say we are going to show SCOPA.  They are not going to deter us. The following financial year it is worse.  How does one explain this?  It is as if there is no government.  It is as if there is no leadership.  It is as if government does not care about taxpayers’ money that – how taxpayer’s monies are used at PRASA.  It is shocking! And I guess it just confirms what you said earlier on that as SCOPA you would raise issues and the issues were the same every year and they had not been sorted out and you would tell the National Assembly in your reports and nothing would happen.  That is what it says, I guess.     Ja.     No, I am done.  I am just shocked.  I am just really shocked.  Yes, you may proceed Mr Freund.     You said 863?     So as far as you know.  I am sorry Mr Freund.  So as far as you know the Auditor-General and in particular Mr Makweto used to address Cabinet at certain points to point out to them the challenges that his office was finding with regard to various departments and SOE’s.  Is that what you are saying?     Yes.  So I did not hear you.  You said at the end of the financial year or what?     Oh, at the end of the ...[intervenes]  MR     Yes.  I am sorry.     Go ahead.     Which means that whoever was a member of Cabinet at any particular time when Mr Makweto or the Auditor-General would have briefed Cabinet can be expected to have had a picture of what the challenges are in regard to these types of issues that were of concern to the Auditor-General. And if they wanted to know more they would have known how to find the reports of the AG to get to know more about what was happening.  Would that be correct?     H’m.  335     Yes.  No, no.  That is important.  That what you are saying says two things.  One, in regard to each portfolio each minister would have had this interaction with the AG or at least the report relating to - the AG’s report relating to his or her department. But apart from knowing about the situation in his or her department.  When the briefing is made by the AG to the whole – to the Cabinet, they would get to know what the position is in other departments and other SOE’s. And therefore, they would have a good picture of what the situation is.  That is what you are saying.     And that raises the question that if that is factually true, the question that would arise is.  To the extent that this Commission might find that certain things were brought to their attention that they should have done something about it and nothing was done about those things.  There may be no reason why they should not all be held liable because then they were told.   You do not have to comment on that but I am just thinking aloud that the implications of this, if this is factually  335 true, would raise those questions that they knew what the picture was.     Yes?  Yes, Mr Godi?     Yes?     Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  Mr Freund.     Okay Mr Freund.     Mr Freund?     I think we have gone past one o’clock.  We both did not keep an eye on the watch.  Let us take the lunch break.  It is now about thirty minutes past one.  We will resume at quarter past two.  We adjourn.  335     Okay, Mr Freund, we may proceed.     One second, Mr Freund, I have no pen here, I think I left my pen somewhere.  Yes, you may proceed, Mr Freund.     Once again, Mr Freund, I am sorry again I am interrupting you.  One second?  Okay, you may proceed, Mr Freund.     Hang on, Mr Freund.  It is not usual that  335 we have so many paragraphs in one affidavit, so when you said 254 I thought that is 25.4 so I first went there.     Yes, okay, I am there.  Thank you.     Yes.     I am sorry again, Mr Freund.  So, Mr Godi, in that first sentence of paragraph 262 the only part you take issue with is that the reports were never debated in the house otherwise you have no problem with the rest of that sentence and maybe with the whole paragraph.  335     Yes.     Yes.  Well, I understand the point you make but I wonder whether Mr Makwetu may not have been trying to say the content of the reports called for serious debates but this is a situation where – well, he says there were never debates but you say there were debates but they might not have – the time might not have been adequate, whether he might not have simply meaning to say reports that revealed the kinds of things that these reports were revealing to the National Assembly should have opened the eyes of member of the National Assembly and if they were really serious, if they were really concerned about the revelations in the reports there should really have been serious debates.  I am just wondering whether he might not be meaning to say that it might not  335 be so that the difference between the two of you might be very slight.  You are not sure?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes, yes.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Freund, continue?  335     Mr Godi, do you have, having spent – I don’t know if you said 13 years in Parliament and in SCOPA do you do you – yes in SCOPA or some of those years in SCOPA, one of the points you have made is that there was simply no action to enforce the recommendations that SCOPA made and that will be the same with any recommendation, I would imagine, coming from any Committee and try and address these challenges in Government Departments and in SOE’s, of course, here we are talking, in particular about PRASA.  Do you have any views as to what action you think could have been taken but was not taken?     Well, of course, some of us have read your affidavit, I heard of your testifying but a lot of people who are listening to your evidence and who are keen to know what action could have been taken, they might not have read this. Would you like to lie to articulate what action you think could have been taken but wasn’t taken?  I mean, obviously, you align yourself with what is in the model, so articulating what the model – what action the model contemplates could be taken by Parliament, but which were not taken – actions that were not taken.     Well, okay, thank you very much Mr Godi for coming to assist the Commission we appreciate that you took your time to be able to share what your experiences in Parliament and SCOPA with the Commission, thank you very much.  Should  we need you to assist us if there’s verification that we need, we’ll ask you again but hopefully we won’t bother you, thank you very much, you are now excused.     Yes, Mr Freund.     I think, if she’s ready she can just – you can just call her, she can come in, we continue.     Or if you need me to adjourn for a few minutes, shall I adjourn for a few minutes?     Do you know – do you think we should adjourn for a few minutes for her to come in?     Okay let’s take a short break, just to make sure she comes in and then I’ll be told when everything is ready, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon Ms Mazzone.    Thank you for availing yourself to help the commission we appreciate it very much.    Thank you.  Registrar please administer the oath or affirmation?    Do you have any objections to making the prescribed oath?    Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  I understood you Mr Mazzone to be saying you will take the oath.  Did I misunderstand you but I see she is switching to an affirmation?    An affirmation is available.  An affirmation is available.  Okay then we use the affirmation ja.    Start afresh ja.    Thank you very much.  I suspect that I am not pronouncing your surname correctly from what I heard you when you were giving your name.  I always want to try my best to pronounce people’s names and surnames correctly.  I was saying Mazzone but I seem to have heard  335 you say Mazzone or something like that.  Do you want to just give me the correct pronunciation?    Okay, okay thank you, thank you.  Mr Freund you may proceed.    Mr Freund let me interrupt.  Mr Freund I think.    I think if I am not mistaken we did not admit Mr Godi’s affidavit as an Exhibit it may have escaped both our minds.  I think this one we will just have to remember to do that.  But I think because he confirmed everything with his we can do – we can admit Mr Godi’s one later on once we are done with Ms Mazzone.    Okay alright.      Yes you may proceed.    I saw that.  I saw that when I read the  335 affidavit I said could not be correct.      Yes so what – what is the correct year?    Okay thank you.      Mr Freund…    Mr Freund I am sorry I do not want to  335 forget this.  What we normally do when there are corrections being made that are made in an affidavit is to follow up with a supplementary affidavit of the witness.    Just making those corrections then it is convenient.  So – so if it could be done ja.    And…    I am sorry Mr Freund.  Also Ms Mazzone when he refers to a page he will not repeat PO-02- he will just go to the actual page number which is the last 2 or 3 or 1.  Okay.    Okay alright.    I am sorry Mr Freund what – I am sorry Mr Freund what page did you say the article is?    133?    163?    Okay.  Okay I have got it.     Ja.     What page number?     18.5?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I have to go the Reference Bundle.  What page in the Reference Bundle?     85.  Okay.     I am sorry.       I am sorry Mr Freund.  I thought you said page 85 in the Reference Bundle.  Is that correct?     On page ...[intervenes] ‘     Well, what they should do.  We should not have – the numbering, the pagination should be sequential by which I mean there should be only one page by – only one page 8 in the whole bundle and...   So if you say page so and so, I should just be able to rely on the page numbers to get to the right page.       Without talking about the different sections.  But I am not on the reference.  I was at the legal framework section.  I am now on the reference section and I am at 85, ja.  If they could attend to that, your team and make sure that we have sequential numbers from page 1 in the bundle up to the last page.  335     Yes.  No, what they have done is what I said sometime back it should not be done.  What they have done is there, it looks like they have one pagination for one section of the bundle namely legal framework that starts from – I do not know if it starts from page 1.     Or from whatever page and it goes up to I think page 4075.  And then they went into the reference section and started from page 1 instead of continuing saying 86 and so on.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, if they keep them in separate files they do not have to change the numbering.  It is just that of course you might have to – if they do that later – you might have to place on record so that the – whoever reads the  335 transcript knows that initially these sections were in one bundle but they were ultimately separated.       Ja.  Okay but I found the page on the reference section, page 85.     Okay.     Ja, you may read it.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no, no, that is fine, actually I did not look at the time.  At four o’clock we normally talk about the way forward. I can still sit longer and I am quite happy to do that.  What is your estimate of how long we are still with Ms Mazzone?  Of course if we finish with her and we can still go on, we can take the next witness but I just want an idea.     Yes, an hour?     Oh.     Yes.  No, no, that is fine, that is fine.  Ms Mazzone, are you available for us to continue with your evidence for another hour?  Maybe one and a half hours, maybe two hours?     Yes.  No, thank you.  Okay, I suggest we take a short adjournment and then continue.  We are at twenty one minutes past four, let us take a short adjournment and resume at twenty five to five.  We adjourn.     Okay, let us continue.     Yes, I have got it.     You said page 209 of …[intervenes]     Oh 219.     Ja, okay.   Okay, that is the letter dated 6 April 2016.     Bundle which is called?     Oh, okay, alright.  That is the reference bundle.  Okay.     The legal framework and reference bundle.     Ja.     Yes.     Just for the record I think we must say, Mr Freund, that whereas in the other bundles we follow black numbers.  In this one there are no black numbers, it is just the red – only the red numbers, the page numbers.     Ja.     Did you say 138 or 133?     Oh, okay.  I have got it, thank you.     Ms Mazzone – I am sorry, Mr Freund, I understand that you say that when this issue that started between yourself and the chair of the committee was that in the committee did not receive majority support, did not receive support from the majority party in the committee and you say you understood this attitude on their part because they did not have the appetite for pursing these issues but what I would like to say, if you are able to, is what reasons did they give for not supporting this proposal that you put forward?  That is now the ANC members of the committee.  335    Now you – I am sorry, Mr Freund.  Ms  335 Mazzone, Mr Freund earlier summarised your evidence and said it appeared that what you were saying is that from about March 2016 to sometime in 2017, I am not sure if it is March also in 2017, but quite some time, you were saying that the committee was not – or the majority of the committee was not supporting your proposal for a public inquiry.  My question is whether, apart from the meeting of the committee that you have just told me about where the majority of the majority party in the committee did not support the proposal, whether there were other occasions between March 2016 and sometime in 2017 that you are talking about when you revived this proposal in the committee and each time it did not – it was not supported by the majority party?     Well, it would help if your situation permitted you to identify other occasions or meetings of the Portfolio Committee other than the meeting that you have told me about where you raise this issue again and again and you are able to say what the response was but it seems that the response is quite clear from your evidence but if you are able to do that, it would be helpful but if you are unable, that is fine.     Yes.     I am sure I have got the timeline but I think – so if what I am looking for is in the timeline then you do not have to prepare anything, I can look at it but if it is not – it is information that we do not have then I would be happy to get a supplementary affidavit from you just saying here are other occasions when I raised this issue, it is a meeting of such and such a date and if there are minutes then you refer to the minutes but if there are no minutes but you know that you did raise the issue and what the date was or the occasion was, that would be helpful.     Yes.     Yes.     And that is – is that February 2017 or 16?   Okay. By that time the Public Protector ’s report State of Capture was out, is it not?     Yes, okay.     Yes.  335     No, no, that – yes, that is fine and I was particularly interested on the proposal for an inquiry but if that document is a document that has been submitted and it has the information, the sequence and what was done particularly in relation to the proposal for an inquiry, then it is fine.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Okay.  No, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Okay, Mr Freund, you may continue.     Yes.     Okay, alright.     Mr Freund I don’t know whether, and it is quite important that Ms Mazzone says all ANC members present voted against the motion because in terms of timeframe we are talking here in September 2016.     Apart from other things three years earlier there was the Waterkloof landing of the Gupta aircraft which really caused a huge outcry throughout the country, that that is something that everybody knew had happened and anyone who might not before that had seen red flags would be expected to have seen red flags.  We have a situation where in March 2016, September may be what – six months after March, yes, six months earlier, namely March Mr Jonas had come out publicly and said what had happened in the meeting that he had with the –  335 with one of the Gupta brothers as well as Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Fana Hlongwane and I think if I recall correctly Ms Vytjie Mentoor had also come out soon after Mr Jonas with her allegations and I suspect that by now also if I am not mistaken Mr Fikile Mbalula’s allegations of having been told by Mr Ajay Gupta that he was going to be appointed as Minister before Mr Zuma told him officially would have been known, would have been in the public domain and this September 2016 is about a month or a few weeks before the Public Protector issues her State of Capture report, so there had been a lot of articles and matters and allegations that have been aired in the public domain, but if Ms Mazzone’s evidence is correct all members of the ANC despite all of that, that was in the public domain vote against this proposal. So in terms of timeframe and what was known publically it is quite important, but let me ask Ms Mazzone in terms of what the ANC said in opposition to this motion why they said they did not support the motion of an inquiry, what did they say as far as you remember, just the gist of the arguments they put forward?     I assumed that before the voting took place there would have been a debate, but are you saying that there was no debate?     Yes, okay.     Yes, yes     Yes I see that, there is a draft resolution.     Oh so whatever was said in Parliament before and after the vote I would find here, is that correct?     Okay no that is fine.  I am sure there is a footage of the jubilation, Mr Freund I would like to see that footage, I would like to see who was so jubilant at the defeat of this motion.     Ja, if you can find it, we will show it here in public.     You may proceed.     Okay I am sorry, I was listening to you more than looking at the page, what is the page you were looking at?     Yes, oh I was at the right page, on Bundle 2?     Ja.     No I think I must be – my page 260 and I am looking at the black numbers, are you ...[intervenes]      360?     Oh, I was at 260.   Okay, okay.  Oh the  335 voting was not secret?     Yes, okay so I nevertheless would like to see the footage of the jubilation.     Yes.  Yes I have got it here.     Yes.     I am still fine I think.     How much do we have to go in terms of time?     Yes, let’s continue and try and see if we can’t finish, let’s continue.     Ja.     [laughing]     But a Minister is obliged the questions that members of Parliament put to them, isn’t it?     But this is not like you don’t like the answers, this is not an answer to the question.   You should be able to go back and say whether go back to the Minister or somebody to whom a complaint must be made, whether it is the President or the Deputy President, leader of Government, business or whatever, and say I put a question to the Minister, he has not answered the question, because this is not an answer to the question that was put.  Are you not able to do that or have you reached a point where you think it is not going to help, it means they don’t want to answer and no matter whatever you do is not going to help?     But of course the leader of Government business to the extent that he or she may do something about it will only be able to do something if it is brought to their attention that here is a minister who is not showing respect for Parliament.   Do MP’s so to speak report this to the Leader of Government Business.     But as far as you know one of the people who complains about a Minister not answering questions or not answering – not answering questions even if they are evasive, one of the people to whom complaints can be made or to whom a report can be made about such a minister is the leader of government business?     Yes.  Okay, alright, thank you.  Yes Mr Freund.    Mr Freund it looks like there is something that has gone wrong with Mr Mazzone’s screen.  I do not know whether you got frozen.     Oh you could hear everything?    Oh okay no that is fine.  Then you – you can – I do not know if Mr Freund you had finished your question or I interrupted you before you could finish.    Ja.    Hang on again Mr Freund I think that is going to be problematic on the transcript.  As you were speaking you know some words did not come through and I think it is because of technical problems so I am thinking that they will not transcribe your full question properly whereas it is important.  Somebody is talking to – it should  335 be fine now?  Okay.  I will ask you to repeat it – your question.    Yes.    One second Mr Freund.  Although the question…    Hang on – one second Mr Freund.  Although when you repeated the questions there were some problems but I – I get the impression that when Ms Mazzone responded everything was fine and I think the way she responded captures in a way what your question was about the fundamental shift or turning point.  So I think I am being  335 told that now it seems that it is fine.  So let us continue.    Yes I have got it.    As this was…    I am sorry Mr Freund.  As this was going on the Public Protector’s Report on the state of capture had been out in the public domain for quite a number of months,  335 is that correct?    Yes.  Okay alright thank you.  Please continue Mr Freund.     Mr Freund, one second.  Registrar.  Thank you Mr Freund.  You may proceed.     Thank you Ms Mazzone.  Just one or two questions.  It is clear that one of the problems with regard to members of Parliament performing their oversight functions the way they should in some cases is that there are parties can instruct them effectively not to do their oversight functions or perform their oversight functions properly. I think you gave evidence Ms Mazzone about the study groups which you said the majority party in Parliament has where positions are taken as to what stance the members of the majority party in a particular committee should take on certain issues which ends up affecting the performance of their oversight functions. What do you think is the solution to that problem Ms Mazzone?     Well, I understand that there is a view that leaders of political parties, the party bosses, in number of parties represented in Parliament might not like the idea that members of Parliament must be able to perform their oversight functions the way they see fit or that members of Parliament must be free not to comply with any instructions from their parties that says for example if there is a vote of no confidence, members of the party must vote this way. There seems to be that view that party bosses, not just the majority party, but other parties as well where they govern even if it a municipality or a province that they do not like the idea that members can vote as they see fit or according to their conscience. They seem to like the idea that, at least in regard to certain matters or maybe the majority of matters or all matters... [Background noise interruption - cell phone interruption]     Is that your phone Ms Mazzone?     I do not know whose phone that is.  Okay that should not happen again.  Ms Mazzone, the point I was making is that there seems to be the view that party bosses across many if not all political parties including those who are represented in Parliament like the idea that they can instruct members of Parliament who are members of their party how to vote. They do not like the idea that they should not be able to instruct members of their party or in Parliament on how to vote.  What do you know about this if anything?     Yes.     Thank you very much.  Mr Freund, I take it there is nothing arising out of that?     Yes.  Thank you very much Ms Mazzone for coming to assist the Commission.  We appreciate that very much.  And if we need you to come back and help with anything, we will ask you to come back but we will try and not ask you to come back unless there is really a serious need.     Thank you very much.  Okay we are going to adjourn the proceedings for the day.  Mr Freund, we are supposed to talk about what time we start tomorrow.  We start at ten or would you suggest half-past nine?     We did not get to one witness that you had planned for today.  Is that right?     Oh.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes. And the ...[intervenes]      Ja, we will not be able to sit on Wednesday and tomorrow we will have to adjourn a little earlier than usual but we could start earlier than ten.  But in terms of your witnesses.  I think the one witness you suspect might take about two hours?     No, no.  That is fine.     Okay.  No, let us start at half-past nine tomorrow, tomorrow morning.  Okay.     And your witnesses for tomorrow, do you  335 want to announce them for the benefit of the public?     Yes.     Okay.   Ja-no, that is fine. The others ...[intervenes]      Ja, you could announce them in the morning when we start who the others will be.  Okay alright.  We are going to adjourn now and tomorrow we start at half-past nine.  We adjourn.  
ADV FREUND SC:  Good morning Chair.    Thank you very much Chair.  Chair with your leave I propose to start with a fairly brief introductory address just to indicate where I anticipate this evidence will be taking us.    335    And as you have just indicated the topics for the present….    Chair I am struggling to hear you.  I have relatively poor audio and relatively poor visuals from the venue of the hearing.    I have a much clearer connection with the witnesses.    Yes.  Thank you Chair and Chair I  335 would request that if at any particular time you really are not hearing me you would indicate that.  But I will assume that as we proceed you can hear what I am saying.    Okay.  I propose to start with a brief reference to the Terms of Reference of the Commission because the Terms of Reference mandate the commission not only to investigate allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs of state but the Terms of Reference also require the commission to submit recommendations to the President. So if in due course it should be found by the commission that there was any form of state capture or that there was any significant level of corruption in the public sector or organs of state then it will be necessary in order for the commission to make recommendations which may be of value to consider certain related issues. And those are firstly whether our National Institutions designed to address or to protect the country or to prevent such conduct failed to do what they should have done to prevent or to address those sorts of problems. And secondly if so how and why that came about? And thirdly whether anything can be recommended which if adopted may contribute to avoiding or to reducing  335 similar failure in the future. Now Parliament is one such National Institution.  The Constitution imposes on Parliament not only a right but also a duty; a constitutional duty to exercise oversight over the executive and a constitutional duty to hold the executive accountable. Now there are various provisions in the constitution relevant to that.  I am just going to mention two of them. One is Section 42(3) of the Constitution which says that the National Assembly must and I quote “scrutinise and oversee executive action.”  And as the hearings on Parliamentary oversight proceed one is always going to have to have at the back of ones’ mind what does that mean a duty to scrutinise and oversee? But more so and more directly in point of Section     As you please.     Mr Godi, it may be while I come on screen and take off your mute.     Thank you.  Mr Godi, can you hear me?     Thank you.  So I will leave it to the Commission’s officials to swear you in.     It is correct, Chair, but I must say I did manage to hear what you just said so I think the improvement for us to proceed.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the evidence of Mr Godi is EXHIBIT ZZ2, to be found in bundle 1 at page 1 and following.     Yes, I must just indicate to you, Chair, in advance that halfway through or two thirds of the way through the evidence of Mr Godi I will be referring him to the affidavit of Mr Kimi Makwetu, the late Mr Makwetu and that will be in bundle 4, but I will announce that when I reach that point.     Thank you.  Mr Godi, is it correct that you deposed to an affidavit for the Commission of which you should have a hard copy available to you and is it correct that your signature appears at page 120 at the end of that affidavit?  335     And have you had an opportunity in preparation for giving your evidence today to read through that affidavit and are you comfortable that it is correct as far as you are aware?     Mr Godi, can I refer you now …[intervenes]     Yes?     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Godi, I would like to start off just by giving a little bit of your personal background so that we understand on what basis you are in a position to give the evidence that you do.  Could you turn please to paragraph 4 of your affidavit?     Page 104.  And is it correct, as we see  335 there, that you came to parliament as an MP in February 04.     Right and at that time you were a – you were the then Deputy President of the Pan African Congress, is that correct?     Yes.  Now you did, however, as I understand it, as you say in paragraph 4.6 in September 07, leave the PAC and become the founding President of the African People’s Convention, is that correct?     Now  - and you remained a member of parliament all the way through until May of 2019, is that correct?     Now from a fairly early stage of your period of service as a member of parliament, is it correct  335 that you served as Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, otherwise known as SCOPA?     And you remained as Chair of SCOPA from November 2005 until May 2019, is that correct?     Yes, so effectively over more than the fourth and fifth parliaments.     Right.  Now I would like to focus next on the functions of SCOPA and you deal with that in paragraph 6.1 of your affidavit where you refer to Rule 245 of the Rules of the National Assembly, as they currently stand, the ninth edition, is that correct?     There was a similar provision that preceded that.  335     So …[intervenes]     Alright, I take your point but now let us just start at the beginning, let us just understand the core and basic functions of SCOPA.  The rule says, as we read     Right, what you are drawing attention to is that in your period and when the ninth edition of the rules took effect, (iv) was added which also requires SCOPA to consider any reports reviewing expenditure of public funds by any executive organ of state and constitutional institution or other public body.  That was in due course added to your official mandate.     I then want to draw attention to sub     And then to paraphrase (d) you also have to perform the same source of functions as other portfolio committees, you have tasks and duties concerning parliamentary financial oversight and supervision of executive organs of state.  I think that rule speaks for itself, am I right?     Yes.      Alright, so you are drawing attention to the very specific issue of parliament’s own financing.     Which, you are correct, that is not really the subject matter of concern to the particular inquiry or involving the Commission.     And then sub rule 2 says this    Thank you.  Now what I would like to do against that background is to summarise at the outset some of your core views and contentions as they are set out at an early stage in your affidavit and I would like to  335 refer you firstly, please, to paragraph 5.3 of your affidavit.   Now perhaps rather than me reading it into the record, could I invite you to read it into the record because this is something that you stress in your affidavit you want to emphasise at the outset.     That is correct.     Alright, if I hear you clearly, we will in due course come back to that issue when we have considered some of the more substantive material that you have put to the Commission.  I would also like you please to read into the record  335 paragraph 5.4 because that is another point you say at the outside you wish to emphasise.     Please.     Thank you.  I think in fairness to you we should indicate that there is a footnote to that where you say in footnote 1 that you think SCOPA largely managed to achieve the ideal of being nonpartisan, is that correct?     Thank you.  I want to refer you now to paragraph 6.2 and paragraph 6.2, if I can paraphrase it in my own words…[intervenes]     Yes?     Thank you, may I proceed?     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Godi, arising from that I just want to draw attention to paragraph 4.4 of your affidavit in which you state that during your tenure in the National Assembly you served on the portfolio committees on Social Development, Labour, Education, Health and Trade and Industry.  In other words, you did have experience on other portfolio committees, is that correct?     And is it your evidence that the lack of partisanship in SCOPA was quite different from your experience in the other committees, to which I have just referred or to other committees in general?     Thank you.  Now I would like to take you – I just want to refer you and this is still really introducing your views, which we are going to come to substantiate in more detail later, but in paragraph 6.2 I  335 think it is fair to say that the essence of your view is that you believe that in both the fourth and fifth parliaments SCOPA did discharge its assigned functions.  That is your view, is it?     And I think it will be fair to say on a reading of your affidavit that you believe that your committee did all that could be reasonably be expected of it.  That is your view, is it?     Right, thank you.  Now given that background that you say that you believe that SCOPA did discharge its obligations, that makes all the more significant what you say in paragraph 6.3.  You say in     And we will come back to that.  The second point you emphasise about the same period, it is     Right, I am going to come back to that issue but I am still trying, in advance, to summarise some of your key views.     The third point you make in paragraph 6.3 about another feature during the same period that you say SCOPA was doing its work properly was you say the following.   “Parliament failed to track and monitor compliance by the executive of corrective action proposed in parliament’s own adopted reports.” That is another feature that you emphasise in your affidavit, is that correct?     And I will be coming back to that in some detail.  And then fourthly you say, during the same     Alright and again we will come back to that.  Now what I would like to turn to now but only in summary and overview is what is addressed in paragraphs 6.5 through to 6.18 of your affidavit and just to focus very briefly and very generally on the way in which SCOPA went about its job.  I think you have already emphasised – just bear with me – let us start at paragraph 6.5.  It is correct, is it not, that every year SCOPA is required to consider something of the order of 200 to 250 audit reports.     In other words, you have a vast scope  335 of material to deal with which emerges from the terms of reference of your committee that we have already looked at.     What you do is you examine and then prioritise and then select where to focus on in particular, is that correct?    Right.   Now before we look at that system the point you make in paragraph 6.7 is that all this documentation that routinely came to your committee     And so would you explain in paragraph 6.8, is that your committee identified certain focus areas of particular concern, and I'm referring now to the fifth parliament 2014 to 2019.  And right up at the top of those is compliance with supply chain management is prescripts.  Is that correct?      And you say in paragraph 6.8, you also     Now, we are going to come back to that issue over and over again, it seems to me.  If I can just continue with the theme of just trying to give some understanding of how your committee went about its work.      Thank you.  Now, I just want to refer you briefly to paragraph 6.10.  I am not going to take you to the annexure but the annexure that is referred there, Annexure TG1 is a document that lists voluminous hearings held, voluminous resolutions adopted and voluminous oversight reports and that is just in respect to the period 15 to 2018.  Is that correct?  I am just trying to draw attention to the volume of the work and the volume …[intervene]     And then you deal in your affidavit with we have already touched on this on the question of creating a collegial spirit, so I will not go back to that.  I  335 would like to focus on paragraph 6.15.   Now, there, you explained that before your tenure as Chair of SCOPA, it had not been the committee's practice to require Ministers to attend SCOPA hearings to account to SCOPA but that you took a different view. Perhaps if you could just summarise very briefly the view you took and how that then played itself out?      Right, thank you.  Now I would like to take you to paragraph 6.19 in following of the affidavit. We have already referred to this issue in summary, but I now  335 want to refer to it a little more detail.  It is the section of your affidavit under the heading the persistence of financial mismanagement, despite SCOPA’s efforts.  And as a convenient reference point, you have attached to your affidavit, what we call the SCOPA legacy report for the fifth parliament.   Now there we will be referred to other legacy reports in these hearings but to very briefly and crudely summarise, is it correct that at the end of each five-year term of parliament, each committee including SCOPA would do a report on the five-year period, what it had learned, what it prioritised and what it recommended should be prioritised by the next incoming committee.  Is that a fair summary?      Alright.  Now, I am not going to take you to the report itself but I would like to take you to the extract from the report that is quoted in paragraph 6.20 because this is, as I understand it, a report issued by SCOPA under your Chairmanship as it were at the termination of your period as Chair of SCOPA.  In other words, fairly recently, just before the last elections, and if I may say so it sounds somewhat like a cry from the heart.  It sounds to me like this is you trying to summarise and that is long before this Commission was interested in this  335 topic, your views on this issue.  So I would ask you, please, to take us through what we read in paragraph 6.20 because this seems to summarise what you reported in your legacy report, which summarises your experience.     Thank you and I just want to highlight one part of that passage that you did not refer to it is     Alright, if I can move you on then to paragraph 6.12, which follows similar patterns.     Yes, thank you Chair, I will come back to that.  I would just prefer just to lay a little bit more of a foundation before I come back to it.  And I was at paragraph 6.21 of the affidavit and we were looking at the legacy report at the end of the fifth parliament and what we see in paragraph 6.21 is that the legacies of fortress refer to a number of them…[intervene]     Sure.     Thank you, Chair.  335 INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Thank you Chair.  Mr Godi can you hear me clearly?    Thank you.  Mr Godi I was about to take you to paragraph 6.21 and this is just summarising a summary.  Your Legacy Report summarises the views you held and reported at the end of the 5 t h Parliament and this paragraph summarises what you said there.  It talks about a disregard of applicable legislation including for example the PFMA and the Treasury Regulations by officials and senior management. It talks about a lack of consequence management for officials responsible for non-compliance with legislation and it talks about SCOPA recommendations not being implemented.  Is that a fair summary of what you said in your Legacy Report?    What I would like you is just to illustrate that by reference to some examples.  So if we could go to paragraph 6.22 and you will see there there is a reference to Annexure TG3.  That annexure Chair is in Bundle 1 starting at page 156.  That is the PO1 number on the top left and Mr Godi if you could have a look at that – at that annexure and I  335 am going to take you to a particular page in it shortly but just so that we can get our bearings if you go to page – Bundle 1 page 157 you will see what it is that the document is.    You will see I presume that it is headed Report on the Committee on Public Accounts on its oversight visit to the South African Airways Group; SAA and Transnet    Now for the moment I am going to leave aside SAA and I am going to look at Transnet and you start dealing with Transnet at page 166 on portion 5, is that correct?    And in that section I am only going to focus on one paragraph in your conclusion.  And your conclusion is at page 167.  In fact first look at two paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs.   “The committee further recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on the implementation of all the above recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days of adoption of this report by the House.”  335 And then the paragraph to which I was intending to pay particular attention. “The committee was generally disappointed by the extent to which the Accounting Authority and Management seemed not to have addressed the financial management weaknesses identified in the Audit Report especially as some of these matters had been raised in the Audit Report of previous years.” Now did that report reflect what you found in this particular oversight exercise?    And was this untypical – was this unusual?    Alright thank you.  And in paragraph 6.23 and I am not going to take you through the detail of that but there you address a similar point in respect of the SABC.  Oversight visits non-compliance, failure to correct previous  335 non-compliance, further repetition of similar non-compliance.  Is that a fair summary?    So to highlight and illustrate the same point can I take you to paragraph 6.23.6.    This is in Mr Godi’s affidavit at page 114 in Bundle 1 and paragraph 6.23.6.  So in paragraph 6.23 you deal in some detail which I am not going to lead now with various engagements with the SABC but ultimately what you do is you furnish a further report that is referred to in paragraph 6.23.5 which is SCOPA’s report on SABC’s  335 18/2109 financial statements and Chair just for your reference although I am not going to take you there that is in Bundle 1 page 204.  All I want to refer you to is the extract that we see in 6.23.6 where Mr Godi you say in your    Thank you.  Now I want to move on to the portion of your affidavit that starts at page 13 under the heading Absence of Effective Mechanisms to ensure the real…    Sorry it is page 115 in the – in Bundle 1.    It is – sorry I 00   Sorry page 13.    But at page 35 Bundle 1.  And I will repeat the heading Absence of Effective Mechanisms to ensure real accountability.  So you refer there quite understandably and correctly to the doctrine of the separation of powers but I do not really want to get engaged in a long legal debate with you now.  And you say in    And what you also tell the Chair is that as a matter of usual experience the SCOPA reports would be adopted by the National Assembly as approved by Parliament? MR    That is the issue I am going to come to if you just give me a minute or two.  So I would like to take you    And what you say in paragraph 6.30 is that generally the office of the Speaker would issue requests to Ministers in accordance with SCOPA reports, is that correct?    Well if I may say so, so far so good.  It looks we have like a system that is functioning.  But you    Alright now you deal with the obvious consequence of that with – in paragraph 6.32.  You say    That is my next question.  What happened if anything?  Did it happen?  Did it come about?  Is it in place to this day?    Now you are talking about an approach you made to the Chair of Chairs in the time that you were Chair of SCOPA but I would like to refer you to paragraph 6.37 of your affidavit.  That refers to a document which the Chair will be hearing quite a bit about in the course of these hearings known as the oversight and accountability model adopted by Parliament in 2009.  Are you familiar with that document Mr Godi?    And Chair just for your – for your benefit but I am not going to take you there now that is to be found in the Reference Bundle at 1-48 and following.  Now the evidence from various witnesses will be that this was the product of the consideration by structures of Parliament as to how they should – how they should deal with the question of oversight and accountability.   And you will see in this 2009 document paragraph    Alright thank you.  Now I want to draw attention to another recommendation in the OVAC model if I can refer you to page – to paragraph 6.40 – 40 of your affidavit it is Bundle 1 page 118.  Again it is not necessary to go to the document because we have quoted the relevant    Thank you.  Now I want to move on to a slightly different issue.  You referred at an earlier stage in overview to your view about the importance when we under – when we analyse Parliamentary oversight. But we have regard to the political realities.  And I would like to take you to paragraph 6.35 of your affidavit it is Bundle 1 page 117.    35 – 35.    And perhaps if you could just talk to this issue and elaborate on your views in relation to the implications of – of a Parliament that is dominated by one strong party and the relevance of politics to this oversight question we are talking about?    I would like to turn to a related issue and that is the consequence to individual members of Parliament if they do stand up and insist on exercising appropriate oversight could you comment on that with reference to yourself, to members of your own SCOPA committee and any other committees of which you have any knowledge?    Mr Godi I want to just deal with one last aspect in your affidavit before I turn to the – the draft affidavit of Mr Makwetu.  At the end of your affidavit you deal with the recent statutory amendments to the Public Audit Act and I think the committee – the commission has already heard evidence that the member legislation gives the Auditor General’s office certain additional powers.  If you could maybe just comment on your views on that legislation?     Mr Godi, I would like to change that completely now.  I want to refer to the unsigned draft  335 affidavit of Mr Makweto which is to be found in Bundle 4 on page 847 onwards.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Thank you Judge.  Mr Godi, back to the draft affidavit of Mr Makweto which starts at page 847 of Bundle 4.     Alright.  Now I would like to ask you just a general question.  Having read this long detailed, and if I may so depressing affidavit, what is your view in general terms about the contents of that affidavit?     Would it be fair to say that you had a  335 reasonable regular and a reasonable close relationship with Mr Makweto?  You were familiar with his views and you had regular discussions.     And having read this affidavit, I think you have more than once, could you tell the Chair whether what you read in this affidavit is consistent with what he would be saying in your dealings with him?     Yes, if I can just clarify.  You made  335 mention of Transnet.  I was wondering whether you are intending to refer to PRASA.     Now can you please turn to page 871 in Bundle 4?     871, Bundle 4.  PO-04871.  And in particular to paragraph 61.     61.  Sixty-one.     You have it?  Chair, do you have it?     Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Godi, if we look at the table in paragraph 61.  It really is summarising a lot of what appears on the rest of this affidavit.  And it is talking about irregular expenditure within PRASA and the developments on an annual basis. So if we look at the right hand column, you will see that what he deals with initially, he deals with five annual periods, 13/2014, 14/2015, 15/2016, 16/2017, 17/2018.  Now we look at the right.  He says on the 13/2014 year, the irregular expenditure is 0.01 billion.   In the next annual period it is a little over half a  335 billion.  Over the next annual billion it is more than 15 billion.  In the next annual period it is more than 20 billion.  And in the next annual period it is more than 24 billion. Now what is your comment on those facts?     Now I want to...  I am sorry Judge.     Thank you Judge.  I want, through you Mr Godi, just briefly to get a sense of what this affidavit of Mr Makweto’s does because it lays a foundation for some further questions that I want to ask you. Can I ask you please to go to paragraph 43?  It is at page 863 of Bundle 4.       863, paragraph 40.  335     Now you ...[intervenes]      ...as somebody who has read this affidavit, you will know that this is just a foundation for the rest of this affidavit.  What Mr Makweto is showing in his affidavit, in his draft affidavit, is basically the procedures that he goes – well, his office goes through.     And then ...[intervenes]      Yes, thank you.  Can I just follow you up on that and I do not know if you know this or not Mr Godi but if you, you could help us.  The Auditor-General is governed by legislation which describes the duties of the Auditor-General.   And to put it very crudely and briefly.  The Auditor-General is required to audit a whole slew of public entities, entity by entity.  And the Auditor-General’s comments become part of the reports that are required by law to be submitted to Parliament and are submitted to Parliament.  Do you agree with me so far?     Yes.  But now I want to take that a little step further.  As I understand it but I might be wrong and if you are able to correct me I would be grateful.  Now I understand it, there is also a statutory duty on the Auditor-General to produce a single combined annual report.  And that too, not only – that too, amongst others, is submitted to Parliament.  Is that correct?     So when we talk about whether or not a specific matter is raised in Cabinet meetings which I certainly have no knowledge one way or the other.  What we should know is this.  That government as a whole and therefore all Cabinet Ministers have access annually to the Auditor-General’s annual report which gives annually an overview of the sorts of issues we have been talking about.  Can you confirm that?     Now ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Thank you. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Godi, I want to just pick up and issue that we touched on and that is the question of the various reports that come from the auditor general.  Now in the main, if I understand your affidavit correctly, your committee would receive as part of the departmental report or entity report that comes to you annually a portion containing financial statements and containing the auditor general’s comments, is that correct?     And in addition to that, I have been instructed over the lunch break that the auditor general produces what is called a general report.  So, for example, I have in front of me the cover sheet of the general report of the auditor general on audit outcomes for the financial year 2003 to 2004 and I understand that a similar general report was issues annually.  Does that type of report also find its way to you?     That is all I wanted to clarify and what I have been instructed is that that particular report, I may have given the impression that it is a compulsory – that it is compulsory under legislation.  What I have been led to understand is that it does happen as a matter of practice every year, it is permitted but not compulsory under Section 5(3) of the Public Audit Act but going back to the years of Mr Fakie, as auditor general since then every year a report of that nature has been generated and you would be familiar with those sorts of reports.     So those reports, leave aside anything else that might or might not be sent to cabinet, those reports give a broad general oversight of what you might call the state of public finances and the state of irregular expenditure.     Thank you, very much.  What I would like to do now, Mr Godi, is to take you back to Mr Makwetu’s draft affidavit, paragraphs 8, 9 and 10.  That is in bundle 4 at page 851.     Now you will know, Mr Godi, having read this affidavit, that this is the very introductory part of     Yes.  No, instability is clearly a problem but of course it is not state capture or corruption or not necessarily, in any event.  So I want to move beyond that point to the general observation that impunity settled in at all levels.  Now that might be overstating it but what is your view on impunity as a phenomenon that did or did not become entrenched, not only in PRASA but in other comparable SOEs and departments?  335     Thank you, Chair.  You will see, Mr Godi, that what Mr Makwetu then refers to is the ineffectiveness of the parliamentary oversight and I do not think that that is any different to the view you have expressed that no matter what attention you paid, the net result was not effective.  I think you would agree with him on that, is that correct?     Right.  Now what he then deals with in  335 a lot of detail and I am not going to deal with it in any detail at all, is the year by year engagements on PRASA but what you will have noted when you read this affidavit is that he makes the point that every year the auditor general was represented in hearings of the Transport Portfolio Committee which would have considered, amongst things,     Alright.  And what I would like you then to look at is what he says about SCOPA oversight which he deals with from paragraph 254 and following in his affidavit and just for the convenience of the Chair, paragraphs that are relevant are 254 through to 266 but in the interest of time I am not going to deal with all of those, I am going to just focus on a schedule(?) of those.  Firstly, paragraph 254, he makes the following point.     No, I am terribly sorry but I am referring to page 960 in volume 4.     And it was 254 and following that I was referring to.     And I am going to start by referring to     Now leaving out some paragraphs I want to take you then to the paragraph 262 at page 963.     This is something that you have  335 already touched on in your evidence and I think there is a slight difference of view between yourself and Mr Makwetu.      Alright, thank you, I just wanted to clarify that.  Now if I can take you …[intervenes]     Yes, thank you.  Just following on from that, I understand the points you have made, Mr Godi, and I do not have an issue with them, but I would like to pose the problem a different way.  Do you think that the National Assembly, having had sight of not having adopted report shows adequate concern to ensure that the problems addressed in those reports were resolved?     I understand.  Now if I can refer you to paragraph 264, which is at page 964, you will see that     And did you feel that he was rightly concerned and about the right issues and he was trying to have the right things done to sort them out?     Yes, thank you.  Can I ask as a point of clarification whether you were also familiar at that time with the report of the Public Protector issued in 2015, the Derailed Report about PRASA and alleged irregularities within PRASA?     And did you form an impression about the adequacy or otherwise of the stance being adopted by  335 Mr Popo Molefe to these issues? 24.44     Right, thank you.  Now against that background if we can go to the paragraph that I had intended to refer you to which was paragraph 264 at page 964 and the auditor general’s team having sat in on several SCOPA engagements with PRASA, the auditor general  makes the point elsewhere in his affidavit that they were essentially there as observers more than as participants in those particular hearings but he then goes on to say what     Right but now let us look at the next     Alright, I understand.  And I want to refer you finally to – in paragraph 268.  Well, that and a couple of further paragraphs.  Paragraph 268 at page 965.  This is an issue that was touched in your earlier discussions between yourself and the Chair where Mr     And then after dealing with some statistics about the accumulative extent of irregular expenditure, it refers in the fifth last line to a very large  335     And then finally, I just want to draw to your attention, that another odd issue on which you seem to be in complete agreement with Mr Makwetu, is on the problem of tracking measurements, tracking implements.  So, he says in paragraph 270 at page 966, halfway through the paragraph, “Speakers Office, during the fifth Parliament plan to implement a resolutions tracking mechanism.  The mechanism was intended to facilitate regular follow-up on resolutions thereby holding the Executive accountable.  This tacking mechanism was not implemented, and Parliament missed an opportunity to effect consequences and result”. I think, we know from your evidence already, that’s a view you agree with, am I right?      Thank you Mr Godi, I have no further questions.     Thank you Mr Godi.     Chair?     Now, I do have, available, Ms Natasha Mazzone as soon as you wish to commence your evidence.     I think she may be following so…[intervenes].     I beg your pardon?    I am, entirely in your hands, we can  335 continue immediately, or we can take a short break, if you prefer.    Thank you Judge.  Ms Mazzone your affidavit and the record is Exhibit ZZ5 in Bundle 2 starting at page 005.  You have a hard copy of that affidavit available I understand, is that correct?   Yes I …    That was a 00   May I then proceed.    Thank you.  Ms Mazzone if you look at  335 the end of your affidavit it is at page 1 and 2 page 54 if I have it correctly.  There is a signature there; is that your signature?    And have you had an opportunity to reread this affidavit and are you comfortable to confirm what it says is correct?    Right and with those corrections you are now – you confirm the rest?    So I would like to just start with a little of your personal background.  I am looking at page 6 in Bundle 2 at paragraph 4 and you make the point in paragraph 4.4 that you were elected as a member of Parliament representing the DA in 2009, that is correct is it?    And you say in 4.7 that in February 2012 you were appointed as Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, you became a member of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, that is correct is it?    Oh okay.      And then you make clear in paragraph 4…    Yes.    As you please Judge.  Ms Mazzone if I take back we were at paragraph 4 and you make the point in paragraph 4.8 that with effect from early 2017 you were informally appointed by the then leader of the DA Mr Maimane as Chief Spokesperson for the DA on alleged state capture and then on 22 September 2018 this position was announced formerly, is that correct?    In other words you came to assume prime spokesman’s status on the – on the issue of alleged state capture?    You were also as we have already covered a member of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises which perhaps you could just describe very briefly the primary entities of any known relevance to the commission that would have fallen within the – the responsibility of that Portfolio Committee?    And Eskom thank you.  And I think my understanding that at a later stage South African Airways was shifted across to a different department as a consequence of its financial difficulties.    Now in preparation for your evidence you deposed to in affidavit and in preparation for your affidavit you furnished to the commission quite a lot of information including if I can take you to paragraph 5.1 a so called timeline document.   That document is lengthy document literally referring to hundreds of incidents and occasions, is that correct?    And instead of trying to deal with the myriad of detail there what has happened in this affidavit is a selective focus on some of what you regard as the more important and more relevant aspects to illustrate the evidence you want to give.  Is that correct?    And that is really the point you make in paragraph 5.3 of your affidavit.  In paragraph 5.4 you really give a heads up on where are you going with your affidavit and with your evidence and I think it might be convenient if I just deal with that now so that – so that the Chair and anybody who is following these proceedings gets some idea    Right.  Now that paragraph 13.1 refers to a statement that you issued on the 8 March 2016 and it is Annexure NN28 to your affidavit and if you just give me a moment to get the right file?  I believe that should be at page 185 but I just want to check that.  Yes at page 185 could you please go to page 185 the Annexure to your affidavit which is dated the 8 March 2016?      Let me make clear.  I am about the black numbering top left of the pages.  So there is a series which goes PO and then…    Which means Volume 2 and then PO 02185 and when I refer to page numbers I am always going  335 to be referring to that sequence of page numbers.    You have that page now?    And just so that you understand what is going on PO is Parliamentary Oversight; the 02 is Volume 2 so we are in Volume 2 all the time in your evidence and I will be referring to pages in Volume 2.    Now do you now have the page to which I am referring with a – an article or a press statement in your name dated the 8 March 2016?    And is it correct that you issued this as a statement which in due course became published?    And you did so in your capacity that you  335 have just told the Chair about as Deputy Chair of the DA Federal Counsel and as Shadow Minister for Public Enterprises.    I am going to just read into the record what you say in the first two paragraphs of that document.     Now you deal there with the question of support by state owned enterprises for the New Age Publication and you summarise in the beginning of paragraph 6.1 about how the DA have consistently opposed in Parliament the abuse of SOE funds to subsidise the Gupta’s New Age Newspaper and associated events and you deal with that in the whole of the rest of paragraph 6.  Now it is fair to summarise to say that there was no – that ultimately there was clear admission about the extent of this funding but there was a dispute as to whether there was anything inappropriate about that.  The DA taking the view there was something inappropriate about it and the ANC taking the view there is nothing inappropriate about it.  Is that a fair summary and if not could you qualify it?    Alright and moving on then in paragraph 7 you deal in some length that even that in summary with some tension that developed over the role played by Ms Dudu Myeni in the affairs of SAA and certain issues that were raised in Parliament by you and other members accurate?     Then if I can take you to paragraph 8 you deal with the issue of Transnet and you draw attention to a couple of newspaper reports and may I say that these are extracts which there would be more if one went into your detailed timeline presentation.  But here you have taken a few examples and let us start at paragraph 8.2 where you refer to a document NN12.  NN12 if I am not mistaken you should find at page 130 in the black numbering on the left hand and the actual body of the newspaper report you will find at page 132.      So what we are looking at now is what  335 has been published in the Mail and Guardian early of July 14.  This is quite some time before the motion that you put in 2016.    And the newspaper asserts that under the headline Transnet Tender Bosses R50 billion Double    And was it a matter of general public attention in political circles to the best of your knowledge?    Alright.  Now there is an area of overlap between your testimony and the testimony of the witness who is going to come after you and that is one Ms Rantho but just for the convenience of the Chair I could give a further reference to this same article being referred to.  In Ms Rantho’s affidavit at – at page 539 in Bundle 2.  Now I know that going back to where we were at page 12 in Bundle 2 your affidavit.    You highlight in paragraph 8.3 another press report.  It is the press report which is Annexure NN13 and the relevant portion you will find at page 137.  335    And you summarise it I am not sure that it is necessary to go to the article itself.  You summarise it    Right.  Then we deal in paragraph 9 in a lot more detail with issues at Eskom.  And in the interest of time I am trying to avoid reading too much of this into the record but you deal in paragraph 9.1 with certain concerns that have been expressed over the turnover in leadership and something about which evidence has already been led before this commission.  In – in 9.2 you refer to concerns about certain coal contracts by Eskom – awarded by Eskom  335 to Gupta related companies and you refer to certain questions you had put in Parliament in relation to that.  Incidentally there is a theme that runs through your affidavit that you are critical about the incompleteness and candour of the answers that you got to questions such as this, is that correct?    And then if we can jump to 9.6 – paragraph 9.6 in your affidavit you refer to a further press statement that you issued on the 13 t h September 2015 NN20 and I think you will find the relevant part of that at page 163.  That should be helpful actually look at just the first part of that affidavit – of that article.      Bundle 2 page 163.    163.    163 yes – 163.    Thank you.  Now we can all see there Ms Mazzone that it under the headline What the Gupta’s up to at Eskom.  It is apparently written by you and issued by you    Right and if we can just clarify the roles then being played by Mr Cyril Ramaphosa.  You have  335 referred to him – he was at the time firstly Deputy President of the country, is that correct?    In that capacity he had been – he had been allocated certain responsibilities in what you call the War Room on Energy.  So he had some political leadership role in relation to that.     Yes.  And I just – you beat me to it.  I was going to take you to this issue of Leader of Government Business.  But could you maybe just very briefly describe. When you talk about Leader of Government Business, you mean government business in Parliament.  335     Okay.  Describe that role entails.     Right.  Thank you.  Now I want to move on to paragraph 9.7 of your affidavit.  Where you refer to what you call there yet another evasive reply from Minister Brown.  This time about the value of the coal supply contract between Eskom and Tegeta.  And you refer to Annexure MM-21 which you will find at page 166.     Now you will see if you read that that     Thank you.  And then the second     Alright.  Thank you.  You can then go to paragraph 9.9 of your affidavit.  It refers to another statement issued by you in 23.  And that we find at page 172.   Again, in the interest of time.  I do not propose to read much of this into the record.  But really the heading tells the story that in something issued by you.       Moving on to Denel.  You deal in paragraph or under the heading - Chairman, actually paragraph 11 - with another article.  We are dealing with VR Laser alleged to be a Gupta linked entity.   And a contract that you say apparently having – without having complied with the requirements of Section 54 of the PFMA.  That is the Public Finance Management Act.  And this was another matter in controversy at that time.  Is that correct?     Now I want to move to paragraph 12 because thus far I have largely been focussing on particular SOE’s.  Now paragraph 12 starts to look at is particular allegations raised about the Gupta family and their influence.     And there would be no need to repeat it.  Then if I could pick it up in paragraph 12.4.   “The issues during 2015 to 2016 referred to above relating to Eskom, Transnet, Denel and the New Age, amongst others, to believe you say by many by the beginning of 2016 that it was necessary to the allegation of influence by the Gupta’s over government and SOE decisions should be properly investigated.” And you elaborate further as we go into this affidavit.  You talk in 12.5 of what Mr Julius Malema apparently told Parliament about a Minister with close  335 relations to the Gupta family and that members of the family knew about Cabinet appointments before Ministers.  This is something raised in Parliament itself if I understand you correctly.  Is that right?     Then in your 12.6 you refer to apparent concern within the ANC itself about the issues, a reporting about a meeting involving, amongst others, Mr Mantashe, President Zuma and Mr AJ Gupta.  And apparently a discussion, according to these reports, about their influence over ANC leaders. Perhaps you could just comment?  If we can just stop there because we are now at February 2016.  And try to remind us, what was, as it were, the state of the nation apropos of allegations and denials about the question of undue influence by the Gupta’s by that time.     Alright.  If I can just stop you there.  I want to put to you something that appears in the affidavit of a witness yet to come.  This is not from your affidavit but I'm trying to set the scene.   And I want to put - I am going to read to you what this witness says and then I am going to ask what you recall and so maybe you can confirm this.      Carrying on.  This witness refers to an  335     Then she refers to allegations during a radio interview.  That in 2010 according to her, she had been offered Barbara Hogan’s job as Minister of Public Enterprises by the Gupta’s.  If she cooperated with them in assisting Jet Airways to replace SAA on Mumbai route, do you remember that as well?      And then Barbara Hogan’s allegation also in March of 2016 back they were and she has being quoted “definitely sinister forces” operating behind her back when she was Minister of Public Enterprises until October 2010.  And there is reference to several news articles here.  And that she too had faced pressure  335 regarding Jet Airways.  Do you remember that being in the public domain?      Alright.  So I attempted to try and seek the scene at the time that you now start to procure a hearing by the portfolio committee on public enterprises.  Now remember we started that paragraph 13.1 and we looked at your statement.   So if we move from that point I would like to follow the content of your paragraph 13 of your affidavit.  Now you saying paragraph 13.1 and 13.2 that as indicated in the press statement that we have already read of the 8 t h  of March, you wrote to the chairperson of the PCPE Mr Koko and you asked for the Gupta brothers to be summonsed to Parliament and what appeared to be undue influence that they enjoy of the then President Zuma, the government and its officials.  But you say in 13.2 you have tried but have unable to actually find that particular letter.  Is that correct?     Not to turn on that because as we will see shortly there are further letters that then follow.  And you refer in your paragraph 13.3 to some of those allegations.   And you refer in your paragraph 13.4 as you have  335 already mentioned to me the press reports on the Jona’s meetings with the Gupta’s, the alleged meeting.  And I want to now focus on paragraph 13.5.   You say you addressed the letter to Ms Letsatsi Duba on the 14 t h of March 2016 and that is MM-30 and that we would find I believe at page 192.  If you can go to that page, please.     For the purposes of the record.  It might help if you can just read into the record your letter of the 14 t h of March 2016 to Ms Letsatsi Duba.     Thank you.  You read there in your first bullet to your previous letter.  That is the letter I take it, referred to in paragraph 13.1 of your affidavit, the letter you are unable to find?     Now if we look at your paragraph 13.6  335 which takes us to a reference of page 194.  We need not go there but the papers show that you again urge the chair of the PCPE to see to your request to summon the Gupta’s.  And according to your affidavit, you have as yet received no response.  Is that correct?     You then refer in 13.7 to what Mr Jonas publicly confirmed.  And then in 13.8 you refer to a statement, another statement that you issued about growing evidence.   Now Ms Mazzone, that particular statement was not referred to as an annexure to your affidavit and it is therefore not in the file with your material.   But is it correct that in preparation for these hearings, I asked you to furnish to me and you did furnish to me and to the Commission a copy of that particular statement.       And I do not know if you have this Ms Mazzone but the Chair should have and you may have.  In the Reference Bundle it refers where the sixth unnumbered bundle.  It is part of that sixth bundle and     The page number is 85 in the Reference Bundle.     In the Reference Bundle.     Not in bundle 1 to 5.     It is the separate Reference Bundle.     85, eighty-five.     And then Ms Mazzone, do you have a copy of the document?     Alright.  So in that document you say     ...but also ...[intervenes]      That is correct.  Judge, if I can just ...[intervenes]      ...in this bundle, there is a section called legal and a section called reference.  It is not in the legal section which is about the rules.  This in the section called reference.  Ja.  It may be that it has not been inserted in your file.  I have not thought of that.     Yes, indeed.     Certainly Chair.  My understanding that should be the case already.  This should follow 184.  I am hoping that that is in fact the situation but I will ask that it be checked.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.  No, I understand.  That is indeed what happened.  I think the intention was that it was going to be in a separate file.     And they thought put it in one bundle.     But ...[intervenes]      Yes, I understand.  Thank you.     Thank you Chair.  And Chair, I think I have already read the first paragraph.  May I propose to read it into the record again.       Then the balance of the document refers to a number of allegations that have been made.  In fact, allegations to which we have already referred this afternoon in the immediate preceding two or three weeks.   And the prayer statement, once again, for the Gupta’s to be summoned and for certain Ministers to be summoned to answer questions as to the correctness or otherwise of the allegations about which we have been referring.  Is that correct?     And you spell some of that out.  I am not going to repeat it.  On page 21 of your affidavit, paragraphs 13.8.1 through to 13.8.6 you spell out all the allegations that you say justify the need for this type of inquiry to take place at that time.  Is that correct?     I am going to take you now to     Now just to dispose to that particular issue.  You deal in the very next paragraph at 13.11 out of date sequence of what became of that investigation.  It was announced publicly on the 31 s t of May 2016 by the ANC that it had abandoned the exercise.   So it was no longer pursuing the inquiry process or the investigation process referred to in the preceding article.   Now in paragraph 13.12 you deal with yet another letter to Ms Letsatsi Duba.     And that is the letter at – that is the letter Annexure MM-33 and that is at page 199 in the bundle.  And really what you do there – it is perhaps not necessary to turn to it – but you refer to previous correspondence, you refer to the arguments you previously     And I take it you have as then as at that time not received a response?     In 13 of your affidavit you referred to other articles or another article making further allegations.  And in 13.14 another article making further allegations.  All to do with the Gupta family and alleged influence.  And you refer in paragraph 15 to a further press statement that you issued on the 24 t h of March, Annexure MM-35 which you will find at page 208.  This one perhaps...  Sorry.     209?  Yes.  If I can just get my ducks here in a row if I may.  Yes, that is 36.  Alright.  And what you are doing yet again is really following the same course of conduct we have already seen.  The letters and the statements trying to push for this inquiry on the basis we have already discussed.  Is that correct?     Thank you very much.  Now I would like to turn to paragraph 13.16 of your affidavit which refers to an article NM36 which is to be found at page 212.  You might have a look at that?  Now perhaps you could sketch the background to what led to this article appear in the press because it is the first time in which the name of Mr Jackson Mthembu is going to be raised in the evidence before this Commission on these issues.     Can I interrupt you there, Ms Mazzone, sorry to do this to you because you refer, when you want an ad hoc committee, I think that needs a little explanation.  So the rules of parliament provide for a  335 number of portfolio committees but they also provide for the possibility can choose to appoint an ad hoc committee.  We will see in due course, for example, that such a committee was appointed in respect of the SABC and when you were referring a moment ago to if you want the appointment of an ad hoc committee, were you referring to an ad hoc committee of that type?     And then what the report then refers to – if I can take you to page 212.  The article – or the article      “…the ridiculous claims in the media that the ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu had agreed to the DA’s opportunistic proposals to parliament to institute an investigation into the alleged state capture by the Gupta family are imaginary and baseless, said the DA in the statement attributed to the office of the party’s chief whip.” That of course is the office then of Mr Jackson Mthembu, is that correct?     And then if we go later into that particular article we find in the third last paragraph of the     But what appears to be the case, from what I read here, is that as of March 2016 he was not supportive of that, would that also be correct?     Alright, thank you.  Now I want to take you now to your affidavit, paragraph 13.19.     The first annexure NM37 which I believe we will find at page 218.  Well, letter is 219.  I think it will helpful if you turn to that please.  Just before I take you further on this, if I can just observe to the Chair that I am conscious that we are now well past the normal four o’clock adjournment time and I am happy to go as late as the Chair finds convenient.      So I just look to Chair, as to how long you want to go.     Chair, we still have a substantial road  335 to travel with Ms Mazzone, so …[intervenes]     I do not believe that we will get to another witness.     In terms of how long, it is a guess but certainly no less than an hour.     Thank you, Judge. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mazzone, I would like to take you to paragraph 13.19 of your affidavit  335 at page 25.     In that paragraph you refer to the response you finally receive from Ms Letsatsi-Dube.     And that response we find in the bundle 2 at page 209.     I am just waiting for the Chair to have an opportunity.     Thank you.     219.     Two hundred and nineteen.     That is correct, thank you.  Ms Mazzone, the letter will speak for itself but to summarise it, she is saying to you that on legal advice the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises has no legal authority to conduct the inquiry that you have asked that committee to conduct, is that correct?     And what she is arguing or saying that she has been advised is that rule 138 requires a house resolution to initiate an investigation.  In other words, a motion from the National Assembly I presume she is suggesting.  Now your subsequent correspondence shows that you took issue with that, you disagree with that and I think it would be helpful that we look at the actual rules themselves briefly and this would be the first time that they will be referred to in this hearing, so I would like to – I would like you please to go to the bundle which is called Legal.     Legal, it is the bit that preceded reference, that is the bit where earlier you said the numbering was not sequential afterwards.      It is the reference …[intervenes]     Yes.     And you will see, Chair, certainly in my copy, I do not know in your copy, in my copy they are very  335 clearly separated between legal framework and reference and the legal framework comes first and it is that part that I am talking about and Chair, just for your convenience, the legal framework, if I can just take you, Chair, to the index page, is that it contains the 8 t h edition and the 9 t h edition of the rules of the National Assembly.  There is nothing else in the legal framework bundle.     And just for us to get our bearings, I would ask Ms Mazzone and Chair that you just go to page 172 of that bundle.     Only the...     And of course what I am referring to, Chair, for the record, is PO-Legal-172.  Do you have the page Ms Mazzone?     And you will see that that is the rules of the National Assembly 9 t h edition and the only point I want to draw attention to at the moment is the date, the 26 May 2016.  In other words, these were rules that were  335 subsequently adopted.  You were engaging with Ms Letsatsi-Dube in March of 2016.  So these rules had not yet come into force and the preceding set of rules were in force, am I right?     Now the preceding set of rules are the rules of the National Assembly that start at page 1 of this same bundle and I want to draw your attention firstly to rule 138, which is at page 73 of that bundle.     Sorry, page 73, rule 138.     Thank you.  Now this is the rule that lays down the general powers of the committee of parliament and the portfolio committee on Public Enterprises was, as I understand, a committee of parliament, is that correct?     What rule 138, as it then stood, said     Now if I can refer you to the same bundle, page 98.      Rule 201.  These are the – this is part of part 9 which deal with portfolio committees in general which are a particular kind of committee whereas the other rules we were looking at were general for all committees.      So against that background I want to deal just very briefly with your paragraph 13.20 because you respond to her in correspondence – we do not need to go to the actual letter you sent – but you made very clear that your view was that rules 138 and 201 read with Section 56 of the Constitution which says in terms that a committee – that parliament must summon – empower the committee to summon members of the Gupta family to give evidence without any requirement of a resolution of the National Assembly and to elaborate it further.  So you were in dispute with her as to whether there was a good legal reason not to have such an inquiry.     Now, be that as it may, your affidavit indicates that you got nowhere.     This issue became ventilated not just between yourself and the chair of the committee but inside the committee itself, the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises you deal with that in paragraphs 13.22 through to 13.25 and in short I am going to summarise and ask you to confirm whether I have got it right or not.  In short, the ANC majority did not favour that there should be an inquiry of the type that you sought and therefore, it did not happen.     And you say in paragraph 13.25    Let us move on to …[intervenes]     Could I just ask you to elaborate on what you mean by a study group because that is not obvious to people who are not familiar with the workings of parliament.     Do you have any knowledge or insight into whether issues that come before portfolio committees and particularly the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprise are first debated within the ANC’s study group and whether decisions taken in the study group have any effect on the decisions of the portfolio committee itself?     So now …[intervenes]     [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Sorry, if I could maybe just interrupt briefly.     I do mean to lead you chronologically some developments, maybe it would be helpful to come back to this question after we have dealt with those because there are other [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Thank you, Chair.  Now in order to keep chronological sequence, I am going to go slightly out of sequence in the affidavit.  I would like to take you to paragraphs 15.4 and 15.5 of your affidavit, page 31.     And that deals with the Public Enterprises budget vote, which I presume takes place in the main chamber of the National Assembly, a plenary session.     Sorry, I was not so much concerned of  335 where it happens physically, it is that it is not a meeting of the subcommittee.      Right.  And in this paragraph you refer – we have the Hansard quotes – you refer to what you said in that debate and let us start with that.  If I could take you to page 374 in bundle 2.     Black numbers on the top left.     Now am I correct that this is your intervention on the 18 May 2016 as appears in Hansard on the Public Enterprises vote?     Yes, the foot of 374 and I am not going to read all of it, but it is very short, it is 374 and 375 and the first two lines of 376.     Now you are now speaking before the National Assembly not before the committee and you say – and you are then the spokesperson for the principal opposition party.  335     On the very top of the budget vote.     And reads    And I want to just focus on the response to that for the ANC which we find at page 377.  You will see towards the bottom of 377 there’s a reference to Ms D Z Rantho, who will be the next witness to testify and after introducing, making a couple of introductory remarks really the substance of her response is what we find at page 378, and read it as you may you are not going to find any references to the Guptas, you are not going to find any references to your assertion that Parliament should investigate.  What you will find is that there has been a turnaround of Eskom, Transnet, S A Express, Denel, SAFCOR and Alexkor under Minister Brown which is bearing fruits, we can mention numerous successes and    Okay, now if we jump ahead at a later stage would it be fair to say that you and she worked very closely and she was very supportive of the PCPE inquiring into problem of the State identities?      Thank you, we will come back to that, but I am just trying to get things in the correct timeline.  So you have told me here about your unsuccessful attempts to persuade the PCPE to conduct an inquiry to summon the Guptas and others.     We have now looked at what happened in the budget, right.  I now want to take you back to 14.3 of your affidavit, because we are now passing another story.     And Judge ...[indistinct – distorted] that in the opening portion I said there is going to be three chapters, the first chapter the unsuccessful attempt to  335 establish a PCPE inquiry, second chapter an unsuccessful attempt to establish an ad hoc committee and then third chapter was going to be the PCPE inquiry but it follows, so we are really now just finished the first chapter.  We are going to start the second chapter but the second chapter is exceedingly brief, it will take us not five minutes.     Now what happens here is that you refer in these paragraphs to how you had tried other mechanisms to try and get an inquiry of this type to happen and eventually you and the DA resorted to a different     All ANC members present voting against the motion.  So the ANC stood firmly against not only your first attempt, but also your second attempt to persuade a structure of Parliament to investigate these  335 allegations.  Is that a fair comment?     Yes thank you, and we do have that, we certainly have the beginning of that in the record, at page 379, we have available the rest but we didn’t annex  it.     Indeed.     If I can perhaps interject at this stage Judge, just to refer the witness to the document you are asking for.  335     In the bundle at page 327 through to page 361.     327 finishing 361.     I will certainly do my best.     Thank you.  You will see just for the record that the debate precedes the actual draft resolution, when the draft resolution is put at page 357 and it is immediately after the draft resolution is put that after a couple of minor quibbles about matters of formality one  335 sees at page 360 the record of the division of the House, and one sees at 360 to 361 precisely who voted aye, the 3 who voted aye, which is in support of the motion and the 169 names are the people who voted no, so Chair I think you there have your answer as to who were the people who voted not.     The critical page is page 360.     Of Bundle 2 yes.     You will see from the left – you will see a whole of names there, on the left you will see the ayes, and there are 103 names printed there and on the right you will see the no’s, and you will see there’s 169 names printed there.     360.     We are at three hundred and sixty.     Yes indeed, and Chair just while you are where you are, if you go back just two or three pages, back to 357 that is what you actually find the text of the motion that was put.    But you will be aware that that is being quoted from in paragraph 24.6.     Chair I have unlimited energy and I think Ms Mazzone has unlimited energy ...[intervenes]      What I propose is that we still have some way to go.     I would think an hour.     I will do my best.     Now Ms Mazzone I just want to refer  335 briefly to something you touched on already, it is the question of evasive answers to questions in Parliament, because of course the capacity to ask questions both written and for oral answer in the House is one of the important instruments of oversight and accountability.  We have referred already in paragraph 9.7 of your affidavit to the Tegeta contract details that you asked for and were refused on grounds of confidentiality.   I now want to take you to paragraph 15.7 of your affidavit.       There you deal with the question you put to Minister Lynne Brown on the 20 t h of May 2016 about whether she or her Deputy Minister had met with the Guptas or their associates or attended any meetings at the Guptas Saxonwold estate and the answer she gave, or let     Any comment on that?     Yes, just following that same theme, if I can refer you to paragraph 16 of your affidavit, I want to deal with this very briefly because I think the facts here are all a matter of record and public knowledge, but you asked a question of Minister Brown about monies paid to Trillian Capital Partners, we see that in paragraph 16.1 and it eventually became a matter of common cause that the  335 answer given had not been correct, the matter was referred to the Public Protector and the Public Protector found that Minister Brown had inadvertently misled Parliament in the reply she gave to you on that occasion, is that correct?     Then if we can follow the same thing in paragraph 17 to 40 of your affidavit.        You say there on the 24 t h of April 2017 I submitted a Parliamentary question about the procurement process, pursuant to which Eskom had awarded a R7billion contract for the supply of coal by Tegeta to Komati Power Station.   My question received no reply at all and then you say this is by no means uncommon and you refer to the rule that requires that a written question is supposed to be responded to, was required by the rules to be responded to within ten days, and you say that at your request your staff investigated as it were what  happened to a whole number of questions and it says at the foot page 40 that as of 11 September  the VA National Caucus had submitted close to 1500 questions for the 2020 calendar year, of which 345 were still answered, 263 having passed the ten day period set out in rule 145[5] and then you draw attention to a particular provision of the rules, Rule 146[3] which  335 requires the Speaker to endorse unanswered questions as such and to inform the leader of government business, parliament or – to inform the leader of government business and then you say Parliament and/or the leader of government business routinely fails to take steps to enforce accountability by Ministers in this regard. Do you stand by all of that?     So for example the question that you asked in 17.14 did you ever receive an answer?     Right I want to move on to a different issue, this is really the events leading up to the PCPE’s Eskom inquiry and you start to deal with that from paragraph 17.18 of your affidavit and following, and I am going to in the interest of time just try to very briefly summarise what it is all about.    You refer to what became – what you referred to as the Molefe fiasco, this is Mr Brian Molefe who had been as I recall Chief Executive I think of Eskom in what you call the disastrous state of Eskom and you point out that on the 17 t h of May 2017 the Acting Chairperson of the PCPE, Ms Rantho, agreed to a request from the DA that Minister Brown and Eskom be called to the committee to account for this.  Now as I read the material, the written material at  335 my disposal, this seems to be a turnaround moment, that Ms Rantho is now acting as the Chair, the former Chair no longer serving as Chair, if I am not mistaken perhaps having been promoted, and Ms Rantho as an Acting Chair starts to exercise his authority as Acting Chair somewhat differently to your previous experience, would that be a fair summary?     And so you have at this meeting in May a discussion about the problems, you have another meeting on the 22 n d of May and then on the 23 r d of May and I am now on paragraph 18.1 there is an urgent meeting convened of your committee, held at the Townhouse Hotel and I just want to pause and understand where we were politically by then, because we note in paragraph 18.2 that Mr Pravin Gordhan is by that stage a member of  your portfolio committee, is that right?     I think if I am not mistaken this must have been very early if not his first participation in this committee, would that be approximately right?    And when you were referring to the political context I presume what you had in mind was the anticipated ANC National Congress in December of 2017 at Nasrec at which they would amongst other things elect a new President of the African National Congress?    Is that (no sound) – now what you then disclose in this affidavit and I know factual controversy about this is that end of May 2017 clearly a crucial turnaround  335 moment – way I see you are freezing on my screen – can you help me?    Well I – let me just repeat it just to avoid any misunderstandings.    That what I am putting to you for your comment is that this meeting of the Portfolio Committee of Public Enterprises on the 23 May was a fundamental turning point in the – in the question of your committee’s attempts to put allegations …    Chair I will – I will of course repeat it but I would request respectfully that if we have a further problem    What I am putting to you Ms Mazzone is this.  That it seems that the meeting of the May 2017 was a fundamentally important turning point in relation to the question of that committee’s willingness to enquire into, to probe into and to try to relation to state capture allegations.  Do you agree with that?    And this claim…    Yes thank you very much.  Now as it happens this is only a few days it seems to me for referred to in paragraph 18.7 of your affidavit.  When there is a trove of leaked emails that became available the so called Gupta Leaks and I want to now understand the impact that made as the – as we go along.  Now the – you issued a statement I am not going to take you to it now; you refer to it in paragraph 18.7 where you responded to that.  And you describe in your affidavit how you sought the consent and assistance of the so called Chair of Chairs – the House Chairperson of Committees Mr Cedric Frolick for the inquiry that the PCPE intended to embark upon and that he was agreeable at least in prin... – first in principle and in due course by providing resource assistance for that inquiry, is that correct?    Now what I want to next refer you to and it is another very important turning point in the history that we are trying to place before the commission is the set of letters that Mr Frolick issued on or about the 15 t h June 2017 and you refer to that in paragraph 18.9 of your affidavit.  And you refer there to Annexure NM62 and that annexure I would ask the Chair to turn to and I am just going to check my page references but I want to start at page 490 – page 490.    335    Do you have it Ms Mazzone?    Now that is a letter I am going to read into the record from Mr Frolick to Ms Rantho the acting Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises. “Dear Ms Rantho allegations of state capture in organs of state.”    Now can I take you to paragraph 18.17 of your affidavit?     And there you really summarise what you have just told the Chair.  But in the second sentence you    Alright and just for the record if you could indicate what their Ministries were at that time?    And then did he not have some relationship with Home Affairs?    Home Affairs was later?    Thank you.  Now what you say is that you produced these big packs of Gupta leak material organised by Ministry and Minister and those were presented  335 to Parliament and – but I see that what you say in paragraph 18.17 is that that actually took place on the 22n d of June 17.  So it seems to be a few days or a week or so after the letter we just looked at dated the 15t h June.  Can you – do you – are you with me?    But nonetheless if we read the very content of the letter of the 15 t h of June it seems Mr Frolick will no doubt testify in due course and confirm whether this is correct or not but it seems that he probably had in mind the slew of articles that emerged out of the so called Gupta Leaks when he wrote this letter to Ms Rantho requesting an investigation by her committee.      Right now what I want to do is I want to go back to this set of letters of the 15t h June.  We have already looked at the terms of the letter to Ms Rantho then the acting Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public  335 Enterprises.  If you go back one page to page 489 you will find a very similar letter also of the same date to Ms Mashele Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee of Home Affairs at the time and it is very much – very similar except that the detail of the first paragraph is different.  Some of these allegations informed the – involved the former Minister of Home Affairs in the granting of citizenship to non-South Africans that is the particular issue that Mr Frolick has asked the Chairperson of the Home Affairs Portfolio Committee to have investigated.  And similarly if you go back a further page to page 488 also on the 15t h of June you find a virtually identical letter except again that the second sentence of the first paragraph is changed appropriately.  This is written to Ms Magadzi the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport and she is asked – or she is informed that some of these allegations involve members of the board of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa PRASA and somebody please investigate that in your committee.  So we have three but only three letters dated the 15t h of June to these three particular Chairs of Portfolio Committees.    But what I also want to refer you to and to refer the Chair to is the letter that appears at page 486 which is – oh sorry that is also to Ms Magadzi sorry I am referring you to the wrong letter.  Mineral Resources let me  335 just get – if I can take you to page 480 – 485.  This is a little bit later.  This is the 23rd August and it refers to earlier correspondence and I do not have at the moment possession of any letter dated the 15t h of June to Ms Luzipo Chairperson Portfolio Committee of Mineral Resources but my strong suspicion is that there was also a similar letter of the 15 t h of June to her and what this letter shows is that in any event it is quite clear that a similar request had been made of her in relation to the serious allegations in the public domain about state capture and the alleged role of certain members of the executive and the letter is referring to the legal basis upon which this was indeed permissible.  So what we seem to know from the documents at face value is that two things happened at around about the same time.      Right.  And to – to deal with that fairly briefly amongst – what had happened already and served to some extent as a model for what you were trying to achieve was the SABC’s ad-hoc inquiry into the Board of the SABC which I think ran from November 2016 if I am not mistaken until around about March or so 2017.  You have a recollection of that?    And that had been served by an evidence leader one Advocate Vanaro if I understand correctly, is that correct?    And if one reads the documents that are  335 already before the commission in the affidavits one can see that your committee requested Mr Frolick to approve that Mr Vanaro should be released and made available to assist your committee in you committee’s proposed inquiry.  Is that correct?    Was – he was made available, he did assist your committee and he advised your committee, is all of that correct?    And in fact if we read your affidavit we see that Mr Vanaro suggested and your committee agreed that – that the scope of its investigation should be broadened.  And I just want to just stand for a – pause for a moment and look at that issue.  If one reads the papers what one sees is that the issue that triggered the turnaround decision in late May meeting at the hotel that you referred to it was prompted initially very much by the saga pertained to Mr Brian Molefe which had caused very considerable public outrage.  Am I correct it was the first catalyst?    And there was a sense within the committee – well if we are going to look at Mr Molefe we should look more broadly at Eskom and so pretty quickly there was support for broadening from Molefe in particular to  335 Eskom in general.  Is that correct?    And then what happens as things move along is a decision that actually we must go beyond Eskom.  We must look at Transnet and we must look at Denel in particular in addition to Eskom.    Yes and so in principle the decision was taken to proceed not only to inquire into these allegations in relation to Mr Molefe and Eskom but Eskom generally, Transnet generally, Denel generally and that was what you had intended to do?    What then happened…    But – but we try to get the timeline there.  That had happened as I understand it by November of 2016.  The turnaround that you have described took place in late May and early June of 2017. In other words there is still a long period from the date of the issuing of the Public Protector state of capture report and the decision by at least portions of the ANC to support the type of inquiries and investigations to which you are referring, would you agree?    Yes and related to that document of course was the – was the requirement by the Public Protector that a Commission of Inquiry – a judicial Commission of Inquiry should be appointed to further investigate the very issues that were the subject matter of the state of capture report.  335    And there was a great deal of toing and froing and disputes and litigation and the like about whether that was going to happen and if so on what terms and when and so forth and that had been material that would be very familiar to this commission.    Now in your affidavit at paragraph 18.10     Thank you.  Then you say in your affidavit in paragraphs 18.12 and 18.13 that it seems to you that Mr Frolick eventually threw in his lot with the group who opposed President Zuma.   And you say Mr Jackson Mthembu, the then chief whip, also joined this grouping. And you say as demonstrated by the fact that he from time to time expressed his support to members of the PCPE regard to this inquiry and did what he could to ensure that they have access to the necessary resources.   Now let us just go back to Mr Frolick.  Apropos Mr Frolick, is there anything more than just conjecture on your part about his factional position?     Before you go on.  Let us just start with that.  The that was sought was sought because there was a foreign attack by, amongst other as I understand it, Minister Lynne Brown to the right of the committee to do this at all.  And so the committees sought legal advice and an opinion was obtained in due course from the very eminent council, Mr Wayne Trinco SC.  Is that correct?     And his advice in short is that you were entitled to do what you were doing.     Let us move onto what you have to say about Mr Jackson Mthembu.  I think you were about to tell his that you found him to be very supportive of the work of this Portfolio Committee.     We can now turn to paragraph 18.21 of your affidavit.     Where you pay tribute to the ANC on your Portfolio Committee and you say that on several occasions they emphasised to you and to other opposition members that they saw themselves as what was referred to as a Kamikaze mission likely to be destructive of their careers.  Perhaps you could just elaborate on that.     And since we have eluded earlier to the fact that at a certain time Ms Rantho did not publicly expressed support for your point of view.  Could you perhaps just talk about the role that she played on this particular inquiry in this process?     And it seems implicit in your evidence ...[intervenes]      Thank you Chair.  It seems implicit in what you said already that a great deal can turn on the character and disposal of the chair of the Portfolio Committee.  Could you just elaborate a little further on the importance of a chair.     Thank you.  Now I just want to conclude by giving you a brief opportunity to talk to the final observations you make in your affidavit.  These are really general Cummings and proposals which you may about things you think should be considered as potential  335 recommendations of the Commission which you have adopted might assist in improving things.  If you would just like to talk briefly to the points you have made here.     If I can just interrupt.  I think you miss read.  I think it says no opposition chairs committee.  Is that correct?      Thank you Ms Mazzone.  I have no further questions.     No, thank you Chair.     I am entirely free either way.       Well, yes.  But then I was always concerned that we would not.     And her evidence will be considerable  335 quicker than the evidence that we have heard today.     Chair, I mean, certainly 09    As you wish.     I understand we are going to be losing a day which means that we would have to consider lengthening the ...[intervenes]      Judge, I have difficulty in answering your questions right now.  I need to think about it.     But if we want to adjourn.  My suggestion is we adjourn early we should start early and whatever time you think is a convenient starting time.     Good.     Give me a moment.  I do not have this list immediately to hand.     But I am certainly hoping to start with Ms Rantho.     Reference has been made.     I can clarity with the secretariat the names of the others who I anticipate ...[intervenes]  
MR GODI:   [No audible reply]      Ja, I can hear you better now.     Good morning.     [No audible reply]      Not so well.     [Indistinct]      [No audible reply]      That is correct.     That is correct, I am satisfied that the affidavit does not need any adjustment or corrections, it is fine as it is.     Ja.     That is correct, Chair, and this is thanks to the former President of the PAC, Bishop Stanley Mogoba, who wanted to give me a two months preview before the 2004 elections in April so that I can acclimatise myself at parliament.     Ja, that is very correct and may I add that I am appearing before you here as a proud and grateful product of the PAC.     It is very correct, one of the most traumatic moments for me politically.     That is correct.     Ja, that is correct, I think as my affidavit indicates, I became Chairperson in November 2005 and I do think, Chair, that it might be important just to give a little background, that since 1994, the tradition has been  that Public Accounts Committee is chaired by somebody who is not from the majority party.  So I came in as part of that tradition, taking over from someone who was from the New National Party and the IFP before and all that stuff.     That is correct, stating (indistinct – recording distorted) ja.     Correct.     Ja, that is correct.     Correct.     Except that in this edition, 6.1.1(iv) it is something that we initiated, added to the rules which was not there at the time when I became Chairperson in 2005.     Correct.  335     Correct.     Correct.     Except that insofar it affects – it concerns parliament, this was not amended but parliament has taken away that responsibility from SCOPA and established a  335 body that is supposed to look at - review the finances of parliament.  We only did it once.     But – ja.     Ja, sure.     Sure.     That is correct.     That is paragraph 5.3.      “What I feel I should emphasise at the outset is that in my view the extent to which parliament is able to exercise its active oversight over the executive is and has always been fundamentally a political question determined by political forces and proper application over principle, over separation of powers.  Parliament and its committees can solicit information an explanation and can make recommendations but the extent to which such recommendations are the status quo(?), depends in practice on the integrity and political sensitivity of members of the executive.”     May I read it?     Right, 5.4    That is very correct and I am sure it is touched upon somewhere and I think it is an important factor to emphasise because that is what sets SCOPA apart from the other committees, the extent to which we could, as a team, irrespective of whether one came from the DA, the IFP, the EFF, the ANC, we all operated as a unit, we treated each  335 other as comrades, only serving the public good.  It is that which actually sets us apart from all the other committees.     Chair, when I became Chairperson of SCOPA I found a committee that was driven by divisions, coming from the arms deal where they committed it  and I set out deliberately and cautiously to inculcate that spirit and approach and unfortunate that members were respondents because we said look, if we are going to grandstand and  335 fight amongst ourselves, it is the thieves who are going to benefit, it is public money that is going to be looted  and we somehow managed it.   I must say it was not easy, it was continuous work to manage the different personalities.  It would from time to time emerge that members of a particular party would come with a particular perspective but by and large we managed to find our rhythm.  I think in the fourth parliament, that is where we laid the foundation.  In the fifth parliament I think – I think that was our best year where we had actually cemented that collegial relationship where whether that person is from the DA or the EFF or IFP, we worked as a team and the political parties somehow gave members of SCOPA some part of leeway on to build.     Chair, very, very much so, it was a cautious and deliberate effort.  In the fifth parliament I was well fortunate to have a committee whip like comrade Nyami Booi..  We spent a lot of lunchtime together as way of building between myself and him, a working relationship  335 that then assisted in cementing work amongst ourselves.  I had a lot of one-on-one with members of the DA, with the member of the IFP, with the member from the EFF to really work on this collegiality because that was the only way we could do the kind of work that we did.     Correct.     Absolutely, absolutely.     Correct, correct, we certainly did and I think the records are there to prove that we were the one committee that really took its job seriously.     Ja, I just want to add that the last sentence in the paragraph talks to the media coverage that we got which was reflective of the fact that we were actually doing our work and I must say that we must thank the media, the journalists in Cape Town, media houses, the radio stations because we made a conscious decision.  If you look at one of our strategic objectives it was to make sure that the public knows and understand the work of SCOPA and we could only use the media, that is why in SCOPA we refused to have closed hearings.   Whenever we had a hearing, whatever sensitivities officials say in there, we insisted it must be open so that the media could be there and could then take the message from the committee to the public.  335     I think that is an important contradiction to be kept in mind as we move along because we did our work very, very well but the outcomes of that work was reflected in a negative direction from the reports of the auditor general year in and year out.     Chair, if I may, just to say what I meant here is that when you know what the problems are, because the auditor general reports to you year in and year out, when you sometimes make decisions on what you think needs to be done to correct the situation and then do not follow through, do not implement those decisions, then for me it is that there is a lack of political will. And, if I could, there are three very important cases, which if they were done, maybe we would not be sitting here and, if we did, it would be under completely different circumstances or conditions.   Firstly, 2014 the executive took a decision that all supply chain management personnel throughout government, throughout state must be vetted so that the more than R500 billion procurement budget, we should be assured that it is in the hands of people whose financial integrity has been tested.  But that was not implemented and when we called the State Security Agency they said well, we do not have regulations, the regulations that we have make it optional and so when they tried to vet the employees at SABC, at SAPS, at Transnet, at SAA, they all refused and the whole thing stopped.   So you are saying if vetting had been done on your SMS(?) personnel, maybe we could identified and weeded out dubious characters.  335 The second case relates to what was called an anti-corruption task team established in 2010 which was an inter-ministerial task team chaired by former Minister Jeff Radebe, which was supposed through the DGs to spearhead government’s fight against corruption. Now seeing the rise in levels of corruption, we called that team and what we found was a very disorganised and dysfunctional structure which if it was focused, should have been the government’s spearhead  in fighting corruption.  What we had on the cases that had been resolved where – I think there out of 42 cases, about 40 were all resolved through [indistinct] 25.05 again, a person who has misused or caused the loss of millions of rands, 50 million, 60, 100 million, got five years suspended sentence and a fine of R20 000 or R30 000 and that can hardly be a course of action that cost the corrupt to pause and, you know, stand back. And lastly, if I may, it relates to a decision by government to modernise its systems, modernise its systems and be sure that there is one system in government for financial management and human resource management and this was the integrated financial management system.  But you see, Chair, the system was conceptualised around 2005/2006, but it had no business case  and until today the business case was only done in  335 what was it, 2020 for a project that started that long and in between there have been so much mismanagement, starting and starting the process, there has been a forensic investigation that cost about R4.7 million and no action has been taken against officials who misused the system. So if government had managed that system well, probably we would not be sitting here and, if we did, it would be under very different conditions.  So, for me, that is what I call the lack of political will, that either do nothing or you take correct decisions but then you do not implement it properly.     Sure.     Very much so, Chair.  I think if this did not  335 happen, we, the parliamentary track, would not be here.  Probably the Speaker ’s office would be the only one coming here and saying look, this is what we did to track these things but it did not happen.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct.     Well, as you indicated in the preceding paragraph is you have 200 reports of 220 reports, with the amount of time available for us, as a committee, you certainly cannot have hearings on everything so we had to prioritise and it was not against work on how we prioritise, there was a system, there was a process.     But look Chair our approach in SCOPA was that we want accountability for every cent of public money, but when you have unauthorised expenditure, irregular  335 expenditure, fruitless and wasteful expenditure being counted in bills surely for anyone who seeks to serve the public good, that should be worry some.      That is very correct because there above that we spoke to in the preceding paragraph, are a product of non-compliance from non-compliance, everything else goes.      Chair if you - if one looks at our resolutions, you hardly find a resolution where we are not calling for action to be taken against officials who have not complied with legislation.  Because how then do you get things right, if there are no consequences?   I am talking here about the accounting officer in the first instance but also the executive authority, that is the Ministers because they get all these reports and if you find that there is persistent non-compliance, surely it should be interested in what action is taken.   And as has been the bane of the public sector that the people who do not comply, and action is not taken against them, or who resigned from this department and then they just go to the next department as if nothing has happened, or move to a municipality or to provincial departments and that I believe that sense of impunity, is what emboldened the looters to continue as if they have a democratic right to be corrupt.       Yes it is right, that said that our prioritisation had to you know, be based on something and we felt that where you have the largest budgets and where you have the high levels of financial mismanagement, that should be of interest and may I say if you link that up with the line above 6.8.8 deviations and expansions.  I must say that this is - we discovered this to be another form or another area of non-compliance to circumvent going through the tendering process departments will always do deviations that is deviating from normal processes, or expansions.  That is if you get a tender for R20million and they say no, because you are doing a good job can we add another job for R5million just like that and this has become the favourite routes through which departments avoid compliance and Chair I bet you, if you were to say, let us look into additions and expansions, you would see a frighteningly high amounts that are involved.  And this process is given a veneer of legality by National Treasury because it is the one that must obtain it but our own experience and search has been that the processes at National Treasury were not fool proof and we  335 actually and we actually want to believe Transnet and say to National Treasury and we just opposite of all the requests that is being approved, project approved any of them because it just do not make sense why they had to be done.  So I am just saying that it is an area which is not really sufficient like regular expenditure but it is one area of high, very high and disturbing instances of non-compliance and we had requested National Treasury to report to us on a quarterly basis on deviations and expansions and the billions involved per quarter were quite staggering.     Yes, it is very correct.     Well, our view was that when departments or entities come the Ministers under whom they fall should also come because the issues and the challenges that are there should be of interest to them and in cases of assistance Ministers who themselves actually explained to us, what is it that they are doing to address the challenges that we are discussing.   And in a number of occasions Chair, we found that a Minister has actually been misled by his officials and Ministers would say but when we discussing the very enthusiastic, the very relevant but to SCOPA your stammering and stuttering because they were telling the Minister what they thought he would like to hear, but before us it was not the case.  Oh yes there we said Ministers we said they should attend, yes.      That is a correct summary, yes.     Ja, well Chair the 6.20 the quote from the Chairperson’s quote that is my statements as the Chairperson, which looks back and say, what were the problems.  As you can see there the first thing that I talk to is the fact that the exponential increase in irregular fruitless and wasteful expenditure was not a reflection on the effectiveness of the committee, effectiveness in terms of doing our work as assigned by the rules of parliament.  But that is the level of responsiveness to the recommendations of parliament from the executive was at the heart of it all.  The lack of political and administrative will to do what is right for the country to stop the looting of public funds and I also in the second paragraph, just indicate that we had called out the malfeasance in a number of entities and I have picked up those that were very frequent, or those that we considered has been right there on top, but to no avail.  I am sure you would have seen maybe some of the annexures in the literature of solutions on the SABC or something like that.   335 And I believe that the relationship between parliament and the executive does need to be looked at as a practical necessity, but also a legal necessity.  How is it that the judiciary for instance say the sentence this style of pertinence and the executive and the executives respond by locking you up in prison for that period?  But parliament says, we recommend that do A, B, C, D to comply with the law and there is tardiness or there is no recourse if that is not dealt with then oversight would actually become a ritual.  I understand that the constitution says we must over see it, it must hold to account but I asked towards the end, at the bottom.  What is the enforcement mechanism of holding to account, hold them to account here we call them, we tell them this is all when they agreed and say go and correct it as we will and then we adopt.  What is the enforcement mechanism in the absence of responsiveness?  I think that is a legal and a political question that needs to be answered.      Well, like I indicated at the beginning, I was there for 13 and a half years, and finally we got these reports from the Auditor General and they all made for, you know, depressing reading.  There was always hearings where we highlighted but the persistence was there and actually the worsening of the situation was there.  So there was no other conclusion to come up to than to take, well, the political leadership does not seem to have a way to address this problem, the administrative leadership, that is Boards of entities and the DG’s and the entities or executive management.  We are just not doing that which is expected in terms of the law.     Chair I am saying it very emphatically so because we – SCOPA maybe 99% of our times we rely on the reports of the Auditor General and those reports were submitted to parliament and signed on by the Minister and the accounting officers as correct.  Indeed, like you have put it yes you may find that this year Department of Health has improved to find that agriculture has gone down but you will have others like your Correctional Services colleagues – the only other time Correctional Services had an unqualified audit was when  335 we had seven audits[?] and sued them in one financial year.  But even that unqualified audit, it was merely the fact that they just wanted different things not that it was clean, there was still a huge, huge problem.  So yes, we have not been moving forward in terms of controls and accountability.     Thank you, Chair.  Well, if one looks at SCOPA’s resolutions, which the National Assembly adopted, we always indicated that these are not new issues, these are persistent issues.    In the Speaker ’s office the office that is responsible for oversight, it is the House Chair for committees what we call the Chair of Chairs.  I have committed ...[indistinct – distorted] Obed Mabella and I would in our frequent engagements highlight the fact that we have these challenges and they were also aware because the Auditor General also found in parliament.  So the problem and the persistence of the problems, were not a hidden factor to the leadership of parliament through our reports that we gave and every time we made a request for meetings, you need to explain what the meeting were about and it is always dictated, this is what we want to do, this is how we want it and it will then have to go to the Chief Whip for approval.   335 So the key officers in parliament are very much aware of the things that we are taking on.  And I must say that towards the end of our tenure, I do remember there was a time when our committee with Jan Booi actually met the then President, President Zuma and getting a copy of the fax we got from the Auditor General, a document from the Auditor General he also shared it with the then Deputy President, the current President Cyril Ramaphosa.  He shared it with the Chief Whip of the ANC the late Jackson Mthembu, who I must say never put roadblocks on our work, always supported us to say look these are the things that we are dealing with.  I think also Minister Dlodlo in her capacity as something in the ANC.  So, yes, but in terms of a formal resolution that says this is what we need to do, we did not to that, we were also alive to the dynamics that I started with for such a motion to succeed…[intervene]     Ja, I was saying that for such a multi-stage firstly, and within SCOPA it will need the support of the ANC, because all colleagues from cooperative committee is the majority.  Then from there the cooperative committee must agree to, to program it and then in the House, the ANC must oppose it.  So sometimes you look at the political dynamics and you already understand the limits of  335 what can or cannot be done.     Absolutely.    Ja.    Ja, no that is very correct Chair.    Correct.    The – yes, yes, yes.    That is correct Chair.    Not at all.  That is why I said earlier when the Chair asked me a question I said our reports usually would actually raise the fact that the problems that we are addressing were not new issues but they were persistent issues.  So it was – it was not unusual to have this kind of sentence or to encounter this kind of situation.    That is correct.  Not that we had extensive meetings with the SABC including on-site visits to actually our oversight visits would now always arise from the hearings.  So if there would be a hearing and there are particular issues that we are concerned about we then say no I have to do an oversight visit to visit your place.  And when we are there we would then meet with the different sections within say SABC.  We would like say want to meet with the internal auditors.  We would want to meet with this section or that section without management being there so that they can speak freely and all the people that the Auditor General would have reported on when you speak to the workers they will actually confirm all those things and even more.    Correct.    Yes that is correct Chair.  We as a committee – we are a committee of Parliament whatever work we do we do it on behalf of Parliament so we then need report to Parliament and it is Parliament that must then adopt the reports.  And I must say that I do not remember any report of SCOPA having been rejected by the House.  All the reports to the House were always debated.  They were always debated.  We requested and we were granted the fact that all  335 of our reports would be – yes we did not have enough time because sometimes we – we would submit three, four reports at the same time but the time we had will be thirty minutes, forty minutes and surely that was not enough but at least there were debates on some of the reports that we submitted.    Yes it is.    That is correct Chair and every time the Speaker wrote to a Minister I would be copied so I would know that the adopted resolution has been communicated to the relevant Minister.    Well Chair may I say that in as much as I have ever said that whenever the Speaker rules to relevant Minister forwarding the House resolutions I was copied.  I have never received or I was never copied of any letter of follow up from the Speaker’s office on any of those resolutions that were passed indicating that the – the resolutions that were forwarded to the Ministers and the time frames to that are being – are being pursued.  So we would go to the House debate the resolutions, adopt them and I will be copied the letters from the Speaker to the relevant Ministers and that is where it ended.    Well Chair I can confirm that this is factually correct that members of SCOPA were quite frustrated with this – dealing with the same things almost year in and year out.  I must say that I – I had a very good working relationship with the Comrade Cedric Frolick and he had an open door policy with me that any time I needed any assistance I could knock on his door.  And so it was easy for me to go and raise this issue about the fact that the committee is unhappy and I must say that he appeared    Well it – it did not happen and it remained a sore point to the committee and there was no indication of what  335 transpired.  By the time I left Parliament in May 2019 there    Correct.    Well Chair it has not been implemented and I – I must say my understanding was that between 1994 and 2004 the focus was on dismantling the apartheid legislative architecture and trying to align it with a new constitution.  Not that we are done with that I think there are still lots of    Chair the – that synonym of the Speaker maybe  335 members of Parliament it is not a new.  On any occasions when members of Parliament they impede Cabinet Ministers    6 can you repeat 6?    Oh okay.  335    Well Chair the – what I mean here is that the political dynamics within the party that has the majority in the House would certainly determine how Parliamentary work is done.  Because like I said at the end of the day oversight    Well Chair I am not in Parliament because the IEC said you know this country is not a vote for me or did not see value in me.  That is okay.  But I think political parties that displaced seriousness to the question of oversight and especially the fight against corruption.  And I    Well Chair I – just two comments for me.  Firstly  335 this Act gives someone or a body outside the executive or the Accounting Officers and Authorities a responsibility to do their work.  Essentially the AG must now chase after the thieves – after the thieving Ministers and officials because they cannot help themselves.  It is impassive.  So they need someone outside themselves to do it.  I have personally in as much as we supported the Act because at the end of the day we needed to have something but in principle I have stood and proposed to this Act and I have said so in public and I repeat so that it is – there is a shame – it is shameful that Ministers and their Accounting Officers and Authorities cannot deal with corruption and must now delegate this responsibility to a constitutional structure and that Parliament connived in that process.  It is a poor reflection on us because if our people are now going to rely on a constitutional bodies on matters that should be handled by elected officials then what is the relevance of Parliament?  What is the relevance of elected officials?  I – I think that this is a very, very wrong legislation to the extent that it actually acknowledges that our system is unresponsive and therefore we give up being able to deal with the ...[indistinct]     Can I just have a minute?  Can I just change my files?     Well, in the previous terms – what happened was that -  I think since I came to SCOPA, the only person who had been retained in the committee was Comrade     But all other members had not been retained and did not come back to Parliament.  It was only Comrade     Yes, I have access to the bundle and I had time to go through it and consider the contents thereof.     Well, Chair I fully identify with the contents because the things that Mr Makweto had said here are issues that are of public knowledge because they are extracted from the annual reports or the ...[indistinct]     Well, look that is correct.  Remember, SCOPA is the one committee that uses the report of the Auditor-General more than any other committee.  But also, beyond this and besides our official work, you know, Mr Makweto’s     Ja, that is why I said the views – firstly the evidence that he has presented in terms of narrating what transpired at Transnet, it is a matter of public record.  His interpretation of those facts are from what I have read they are really consistent with what I would think should be his     Oh, PRASA.  Sorry, PRASA.  Yes, PRASA.       One?     Yes, yes.  I have it.       Chair, I think one of the reports in this – one of the castings in his general reports was focussed on the irregular expenditure.  And what we notice.  Not just for PRASA but overall on an annual basis there was an increase in irregular expenditure.    And what this tells you is that the compliance – the rules and regulations, they were not being followed.  And it tells you that there is a progressive deterioration in financial controls and operational controls.  And that is at the heart of it all because as much as Chair, we say that irregular expenditure does not mean that there was corruption. But what it means is that the rules that have been put in place and the process that has been put in place have not been followed.  And we always argued that those rules are not for deliberation.  They are there to be followed. And whatever reason is there for not following the rules.  And also taking into account that the people who are supposed to implement these rules are not just common idiots picked up in the street.  These are professionals who are actually specialist in financial management. So if you find instances where there is no  335 compliance.  Surely, it is a red flag.  It is a warning sign.       Chair, if I may.  I am sure we would ...[indistinct]     Yes.     I am there.     Ja.     I have it.     I want to confirm but it is correct and I think the – that process was intensified under – was set under     Chair, what I am saying is that at the end of the     That is the end of the auditing process.  335     And ...[intervenes]      I am saying at the end of the auditing process when the annual reports have been submitted to Parliament and he has drafted a general report.  The general report summarises his views of the audit cycle.  This audit cycle, these are the key things that have emerged.  He will then share most overviews with the Cabinet.     Chair, in the first instance.  Each Cabinet member would have had this briefing with the AG on his or her own portfolio.     So when they go to Cabinet, then they have a bigger picture to say no portfolio is performing in this context, is performing like this.  But the broader context within the performance is evaluated is this.       Correct.  Correct Chair.     Chair.     Chair, I just want to say at least what is confirmed in the draft affidavit of Mr Makweto.       Is that the Minister in relation to his or her portfolio does get the briefing.  Then make sure that the Cabinet agreed and its own cycle.     Ja-no, that is correct.  When you read out the     That is correct.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.  No, that it is correct, I kind of thought we were talking to that, you understand, the end of the audit cycle the auditor general would then write a general report, yes.  335     Correct, correct.     Absolutely, ja.     Ja.  Ja, I have it.  335     Ja, no, very true, I think paragraph 8 talks to the problem of instability in the leadership of PRASA which I am not sure we will go into later but it is a very important comment.  Not only for PRASA but throughout the various entities and departments and it was one of the most frustrating things for us as a committee that you would meet with an accounting officer today who would promise that I will sort things out and a year and half down the line that person is no long there, you have a new person who is starting from scratch, you can hardly build a culture of compliance instituting where there is instability of [indistinct – dropping voice]     Impunity or sense of impunity was in a large measure one of the fundamental reasons why noncompliance persisted and actually worsened because those are there to be observed or to be enforced.  In instances where they are not observed there should be enforcement and in the absence of enforcement then it will merely replicate itself.  I must overemphasise the fact that the inability to take action, stern action against the wrong, merely exacerbated the problem and what Mr Makwetu here indicated with PRASA I can safely say is a general problem throughout the public service. ADV FREUND     Ja, so I will so agree.     Yes, that is correct.     I take this as objective statement, what had happened.     Yes.     No, I must reconfirm that that statement is actually incorrect, being [indistinct – dropping voice] and secondly, the difference in parliamentary resolutions is whether the resolution was noted or adopted.  If it is adopted, whether debated or not, the procedure is the same, it must be processed by the Speaker to the minister concerned but if it is noted, it just goes into the records of parliament and it is not taken forward.    335 Now we – remember I said we, in our strategic objectives we said we want the public to know and understand the work of the committee and one of the ways of course was the media but the other one was having debates in the house.   We worked on this because initially we kind of – we find that members of parliament will go and do the usual thing where they can stand and we had to agree as the committee that please, let us not then stand because then you are taking the focus away from the issues to the policies(?).  Like I said, you have five reports and you have – members are given two minutes each or so to come and debate.  Clearly that is not enough.  That is not enough time but I must say that we were better off than other committees because like I said, all our reports were debated.  I will be given five minutes to introduce the reports then the other members would come in but clearly was not enough time.     No, I will leave that paragraph, like I say that the next part which speaks to suggest that if a report was not debated and was only adopted it is of the level than if it was debated.  I said no, whether it was debated or it was merely adopted, processing would be the same.  The only difference is it is noted.  If it is noted, it is merely for parliamentary reports, it is not taken outside parliament.  So whether debated or not debated, as long as it was adopted.     It was subjected to the same process.     I think I (indistinct – recording distorted) what you have said.     That due to - times were short.     But if you look at the last part of his sentence, it seeks to suggest that if reports (indistinct – recording distorted) it can then lead to appropriate (indistinct – recording distorted) implying that if it was not debated then you do not have the mechanisms of follow-ups.     But I do think, like I said, that the issue of the need to take serious cognisance of the issues raised, were things that we will always discuss and things that (indistinct – recording distorted)  no sense about it.       So it may as well be that maybe the construction could have been done better or differently.     But the concerns that you making, no, those are concerns that we had from time to time.     Well, you know when we started, reports would go to the house, they would be adopted but then what?  And I think that is where we are following short and I think Mr Makwetu if actually reconfirming that, Chair, as the position.  In the absence of follow-ups there is no other demonstration that the concerns raised by committees are taken seriously and I think that is what we were missing and that is what is missing and I think here we are basically saying the same thing as Mr Makwetu.     Well, Chair, I can only confirm what Mr Molefe said to the Chair when he appeared that he – and I confirm that he did, he wrote a letter addressed to the Speaker but copied to the Portfolio Committee and SCOPA.  I do not know how the other two offices acted but we, as SCOPA, we viewed the letter seriously and we actually called the PRASA board and management to appear before us.  I am sure in Mr Makwetu’s bundle it does appear, it is in one of the annexures.  The (indistinct – recording distorted) of the two meetings were heard.  We met them, it was 2015 and we said no, let us meet in 2016 and indeed in 2016 we met.  So we, as SCOPA were responsive to the cries or the complaints that we heard, even though they were not addressed to us but to the higher office but we felt duty bound that we needed to react.     Well, I mean, the issues that he had raised were issues that were arising from what we knew from the reports of the auditor general about controls, financial controls, governance and all that.  There could have been other issues that fell outside our scope but because we  335 knew from the general reports of the HD that PRASA was not in a good state so we were not hesitant therefore to call them, yes.  In relation to the issues that were at hand, yes, he showed concern and if you look at the minutes of our engagement with them you will realise that indeed the attitude of the discussions was focused on the very issues that Mr Makwetu is raising here in his affidavit.     Ja, correct, we were aware of that report because it was – we were also aware of the investigation that National Treasury was doing, we were also aware that there were, you know, criminal cases that were opened with the Hawks.  I, in my capacity as Chairperson, did have a one-on-one with Mr Molefe because I wanted to understand for myself fully and properly what the concerns were, what the issues were, what their frustrations were especially with the Hawks in terms of their investigations.  So yes, we were of the totality of the challenges and reports pertaining to PRASA.     Well, the – yes from the reports that he shared with us, yes, we accepted that he was adequately concerned.  The only concern I expressed to him was on the investigations done by Werksmans because it seems to be open-ended and when you look at the expenditure thus far incurred, it was too high and we were not yet in a situation where we could say this is the end [indistinct] 25.22 and he then invited me to go to Werksmans’ offices and meet in Sandton.  I went to sit and listen to those lawyers explain what they are doing, what they are trying to do, the scope, but still I insisted that we need to have a timeframes, we cannot have open-ended investigations especially when they involved costs, money that PRASA does not have in (indistinct – recording distorted)     Well, that was the standard operating norm for our SCOPA hearings, whether with PRASA or any other.  Our members were robust and we read, we paid attention to detail, much more than the officials themselves.     Well, I cannot confirm whether indeed the resolution was done or not.  If I had received this draft affidavit a month or so I think I could have verified with my staff, we have very good recordkeeping systems.  Except to say, if you look at the minutes of our 2015 hearing you will realise that actually we stopped the hearing at midpoint because we realised that we were not making progress. The board was saying they are new, management was new and so we could not get  335 accountability.  That is why we said let us stop this hearing, we will meet you in 2016.  So what I would have needed to check was whether after the 2016 hearing was there a resolution passed.  At this point I cannot confirm or dispute what is it.     Ja, I do.     Except that it is important to indicate that the work Parliament ...[indistinct – distorted] at the end of the day the person who must hit the nail on the head, it is the Board, it is management.    I can give an example with the integrated ...[indistinct – distorted] management system at ...[indistinct] Station.  When we were meeting ...[indistinct] we called out the wrong parties of putting an accountant in charge of a Systems Development Process when the head of State Development is there, but I can tell you, now as we’re talking…[indistinct – distorted] they’ve appointed a strategic planner in charge of Assistance Development and yet Assistance Developer is there. So, sometimes Parliament can say, do this, this is the right thing to do but then officials go and do their own thing and what can you say, we have to agree that despite all the good work and  335 the practicing was done the room has not moved.     Well, I’m actually glad that Mr Makwetu has put this …[indistinct 2.05] I said, I spoke to Comrade Frolick in the fourth Parliament.  Now Mr Makwetu says, in the …[indistinct 2.14] there was a repeat of such commitment which was not fulfilled.  So, what you see, Chair, when I spoke about the lack of …[indistinct 2.25 – audio distorted] is that you have an Executive that is unresponsive, but you also have the leadership of Parliament, through the Speakers Office that is equally – at  335 a theoretical level about issues and not implementing its own decisions and resolution.   So, if you have that gridlock, from the Executive to Parliament then those of us who are busy with …[indistinct 2.52 - distorted] on the ground …[indistinct – distorted] members, what chance was there for us to bring about the desired changes, almost zero?      No Chair, I think in my submission being quoted from the …[indistinct 4.34] contradicting model, I don’t think there can be anything besides that model because it – I fully remember the spirit during the  335 …[indistinct 4.47]  of that model, there was really this belief from commitment and desire to up oversight of Parliament, but it was not implemented. My view would be, let’s implement that oversight and accountability model and then in the course of practice, then we’ll be able to see where the deficiencies are but without having touched on those critical provisions of that model, I don’t think that it will be prudent to look for something else outside that.     Thank you very much, Chair.  The history here, Chair, is that, on an annual basis the Auditor General give us his support and he and SCOPA will look at the report, pick up what is right and what is wrong, call the Departments to account before us and at the end, write a resolution to the House …[indistinct 6.30] and say, in our engagement with Department X these are the problems that  335 we encountered as in these are our recommendations in terms of what we think, needs to be done, to correct the situation.  Once it is adopted by the House, it is now the House speaking, no longer SCOPA.  Now the problem that we had, was that once the Speaker has forwarded the resolutions, that was the end of it. Many such Departments would just get those recommendations and not do anything.  So, what was missing and what needs to be in place, it’s a mechanism and a process to track House resolutions and what we did in SCOPA, which I think was excellent, was always to put timeframes.  So, you know, if a report is adopted today on the 1 s t of February and you say, within 60 days, then it means by the end of March you want to get a response.  Now, it means the Speaker ’s office must have the capacity and the mechanism to check on the due dates and be able to follow up with the various Departments that the due dates are in place, that was not there but now, even it was there, if the Departments don’t reason what is it that should happen.  The Speaker should be able to, in the House, indicate that Minister so and so is frustrating us, Mr so and so is unresponsive as a way that will say to Parliament and also to the public, Minister so and so is not doing his or her work.  So, especially there was a lack of a follow up process or mechanism which rendered the hard work, the hard work that we did to  335 …[indistinct 8.22].     Thank you.

NELSON THEMBA GODI:  (d.s.s) 
TECHNICIANS:   [No audible reply]  
GODI: Ja I mean look there was always this understanding that whatever SCOPA brings the House would not have issues because the assumption is that the committee does a very thorough job and no-one would want to stand up and say you know we do not think there stance against corruption is wrong we must defend this.  So it was almost a given that our reporting be adopted but that adoption what did it mean and what effect and impact it had beyond adoption?   Remember Chair, the financial year ...[intervenes]  
MS MAZZONE:  Good afternoon Judge Zondo.    Thank you very much for allowing me.    I have no objection to taking the prescribed oath however I am a Buddhist but the oath is binding on my conscience.    I would prefer an affirmation Judge Zondo if that is possible.    Natasha Wendy Bonita Mazzone.    I do not.    I truly affirm.    Judge Zondo thank you very much that is very kind of you Mazzone is absolutely fine.  Thank you.    I do indeed.    That is my signature.    Thank you Advocate Freund I have had an opportunity to read it.  Advocate upon my last reading of it last night I did pick up two typos which if I may I would like to bring to the commission’s attention. The first type is under point 19 which is the Democratic Alliance view on improving    No.    It is 1998 Judge Zondo.    I do.    That is correct.    That is in fact correct and the date strangely enough was today the 1 February.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Although there are many public entities in  335 our country and many state owned entities the Department of Public Enterprises at that particular time looked after the entities of Denel, Transnet, Alexkor, Safcol, South African Airways, South African Express Airways and Eskom.    That is right it went under the administration of Treasury because of the continual bailouts that were being made to the airline.    That is correct.    That is correct.  335    Yes.  I have it before me.    I am on page is it the ZZ5 NWAM 185?    Alright.    Right.    I have that in front of me.    Thank you Judge I will remember that thank you.    Great.    I do indeed.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.    No that is absolutely a fair summary.  It became very obvious to us that the New Age Newspaper was receiving special deals based on nothing more than the association with the ANC and the obvious close relations between the Gupta family and at the time Jacob Zuma and the DA had on numerous occasions asked questions regarding funding of New Age businesses because these newspapers often have businesses that result in a huge  335 amount of funding.  And we even asked questions about why the New Age Newspaper was the newspaper distributed on SA Air – SAA airlines for example and bought en masse of all government offices and why that particular newspaper.  So it was very public knowledge that the New Age was getting precedence over other newspapers.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    It did come to my attention it did indeed.    To the best of my knowledge it was but further to that it was also a matter that was discussed and aired during a meeting of the Public Enterprises Committee and it was one of the issues that we would air regularly was the procurement processes of Transnet’s railway infrastructure and who was involved, who the directors of these companies were and the amount of money that were being paid and whether or not any conflict of interests were being declared.    Yes.    Hm.    You are absolutely correct.    It is correct yes.    That – that is correct and it also went on to deal with the fact that then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa who was leader of government business was also in charge of the War Room that was in charge of the Energy crisis.  So it was incumbent upon me to request of him to provide Parliament with a full explanation of how this particular occurrence happened under his watch and whether he was in fact informed of the deal while he was in charge of the War Room and what role he had played in the – the fact that this matter – this money had exchanged hands so what I then did and I explain it in my statement is I wrote a letter to then Deputy President Ramaphosa asking him for further particulars.    That is correct he was the Deputy President of the country.  He was…    Yes.  Well maybe to take one step back Advocate in terms of the rules of Parliament we appoint a leader of government business and it is normally the Deputy President but it does not have to be.  The rules make an allowance for it to be anyone that Parliament chooses however it is practice in the Parliament of South Africa that the Deputy President becomes the leader of government business.  So Deputy President Ramaphosa was the leader, he was also the Head of the War Room dealing with the energy crisis and he was the Head of the ANC’s Cadet Employment Operation.       In Parliament.     Well, that role is actually incredible important.  It is a role which makes sure that Parliament meets regularly.  It is the role that ensure that certain issues are placed on the Parliamentary agenda and are not.  It is the role that ensures that Parliament deals with the necessary legislation that comes before it.   And if certain legislation is lagging behind, the Leader of Government Business steps in makes, you know, does an inquiry as to why the legislation is not being heard.   That particular role also ensures that the Cabinet is kept up to speed as to who is appointed to suit certain boards that deal with state owned entities and legal government business.   You have to inform the Cabinet as to what decisions, pertinent decisions are being made in the state owned entities that will have any effect on Parliament whatsoever.     Yes.  335     Yes.  If I may by way of an explanation.  When you ask a kind of this kind of sensitivity, the Questions Department withhold the name of the question if it is commercially sensitive or if it would in any way infringe upon the economic impact that a sale may have, for example.  But when the question is answered by the Minister, the name of the company is then revealed.       I do not consider that to be an adequate answer to the question.  And I have many a time given, at that stage, Minister Brown the opportunity to, if she felt, that the commercial sensitivity was of such a nature to allow me to sign a declaration that I would not, you know, disclose the amounts of money. But that I would satisfy myself upon seeing the amounts of money and the directors of the company the money was going to but there was nothing to be worried about.   So I offered that particular option to Minister Brown.  She turned me down and remained steadfast that it was too commercially sensitive for members of Parliament to be informed of.     That is a fair comment.  And the reason I said that was because I am a firm believer that any money that goes into a state owned entity is money that belongs to the South African country as a whole.  And we have every right to know where every cent of that money is going.     That is correct.     Correct.     Well, I think it is fair to say that at that particular point in South Africa’s history there were many social media photographs doing the rounds of the Gupta’s at various events held by the ANC.   Probably the most famous one was the big fund raiser held by the ANC where the Gupta’s sat at the table with Jacob Zuma.  We knew about Gupta dealings that were taking place in state owned entities and the fact that Ministers were taking instructions from the Gupta’s.    335 We knew a lot of corridor talk that was happening where very concerned members of the ANC were discussing how much of an influence were having on the ANC in terms of their involvement in parliamentary operations, in terms of the appointment of heads of state owned entities.   And there was a general split starting to happen within the ANC that was becoming very obvious.  And you could see that there were those who were very uncomfortable with the situation that they found themselves in.  And there were those that every time the name Gupta was mentioned, they would heckle and boo and try and drown it out.   But there was definitely a split in the process happening and there was definitely an exposé happening of just how much of an influence the Gupta’s were having over Zuma.   The problem, however, was this.  Where do you turn when the very person who you would turn to in the normal set of circumstance being the President and the leader of your organisation is the very person who is being accused and who is known to be a friend and an accolade of these particular individuals.   And at that stage, we now know that the term “connecting the dots”.  We had started connecting the dots but we had not yet formed the spider web that we now know.   335 And it was very difficult to pinpoint exactly who was on what side and who was trustworthy and who was not.       I do indeed and it forms part of my affidavit as well.      I do indeed.      I do remember that.      I do indeed.      It is correct, yes.     I am there.     With pleasure. “The request for a full Parliamentary inquiry into the Gupta’s. Dear Ms Letsatsi Duba.  I am writing to you to request that the Portfolio Committee of Public Enterprises conducts a full Parliamentary inquiry into the capture of state owned entities by the Gupta’s. In recent weeks a number of allegations of undue influence had been raised regarding the Gupta’s involvement in a number of state owned enterprises. (SOE’s) These allegations necessitate an urgent investigation into the Gupta state owned  335 entities by the Portfolio Committee.     That is correct.     It is correct.     Correct.     I do have a copy.     That is correct.     That is correct.  335     That is correct.     Yes.     That is correct.  That is quite correct.     No response.     It is there on 209.     Absolutely.  But I go a stick further Advocate.  And I wonder if it would not pertinent for me to perhaps read this particular statement.  I realise we are very cognisant of time.  But this statement was really the beginning of the ball rolling and perhaps I could read this into the evidence so that people do not ...[intervenes]   335     A brief extract.  And what I find the important part is if one goes down to the middle of that     Right, so to give the Commission a bit of background, every Wednesday during a normal sitting of parliament, you know, when a session is open, there is a meeting that takes place that is known as the Chief Whips Forum and it is customary for the chief whip and the deputy  335 chief whip of every party represented in parliament to attend that particular meeting.  The chairpersons of portfolio committees attend that meeting, the ANC chief whip and the deputy chief whip attend the meeting and then certain staff members attend the meeting.   Now this is a meeting that is closed to the public so it is a closed door meeting and the aim of the meeting is for the Chief Whips to find consensus on certain items. So, for example, we will look at the way in which we schedule debates and whose debates will be up next, we discuss personal issues such as MP’s homes at the parks that they live in and we discuss the general upkeep of parliament.  So it really is – it is not a decision-making committee at all but it is a meeting where the chief whips – what we like to do is we do what we call finding one another. At the time – and when you ask for an ad hoc committee, your first port of call would be to ask at the Chief Whips Forum because not only does the chief whip sit at that Chief Whips Forum but the chair of chairs also sits at that particular forum and the chair …[intervenes]     Yes of that type or you can ask for an investigatory committee. There are many kinds of committees that parliament can ask for but of course it is very unlikely for an ad hoc committee or an investigatory committee – so, in other words, an – so for example, the Eskom Commission was not an ad hoc committee, it was a Commission of Inquiry as established by parliament.   So it is a lot easier if you have consensus of the chief whips and the consensus of the chair of chairs before you go into parliament and simply ask for this particular committee be because there is a very good chance that it would be thrown out otherwise if you catch people off guard.  So you would seek to find consensus amongst other chief whips in the establishment of such committee and then bring it to parliament for formalisation and that is one of the roles that Chief Whips Forum plays. I, at the time, I was a whip of the DA in parliament but I was not the chief whip or the deputy chief whip, so I  335 did not attend the Chief Whips Forum.  However, I had in my mind that there was this absolute necessity for a ad hoc committee or a Commission of Inquiry to be establish for the Guptas and more especially in our case to start off by looking at Eskom and then going one by one through the state owned entities and I had asked the then chief whip of the DA, Mr John Steenhuisen, to please raise it at the Chief Whips Forum and to get a feeling for whether or not we would be able to establish a Commission of Inquiry or an ad hoc committee and what the general feeling was of the fellow chief whips.     That is correct..     That is correct.     That is absolutely correct, he was absolutely supportive of all our endeavours.     I think that there was perhaps a heated debate that happened in the Chief Whips Forum and now being the chief whip of the DA myself, I had sat through enough of these meetings to know just how heated they become.  They become very rowdy, they are not calm and collected meetings.  Also I suppose because they are done behind closed doors, one lets one’s guard down a little bit and I think that there was perhaps a misunderstanding about what was agreed to and what was not and I can only imagine that Mr Mthembu took exception to the fact that Mr Steenhuisen had very happily announced that there was an agreement, that there would be an inquiry and I think that Mr Mthembu perhaps intended the advice that he had given for a debate – that he understood that to have been taken as an misunderstanding as an inquiry.  But you are quite  335 right that Mr Jackson Mthembu was very supportive later on and I can only imagine that it was some form of great misunderstanding that happened from a rather robust meeting.     Yes.     Judge Zondo, I am completely at your disposal and how long you require me, I am happy to be at the Commission’s disposal.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, I have it in front of me.     That is correct.  335     Yes.     I do.     That is correct.     Yes.     That is correct.     I am.     Yes?     That is correct.     That is correct and if I may, Advocate Freund, one of the reasons that I went into such a hard dispute was because the rules committee had a subcommittee that was sitting at the time that all of this was happening and we were redrafting certain sections of the rules and I was the DA representative on that rules committee and I had dealt specifically very closely with  335 this particular angle of the rules and I knew that in the subsequent rules, the edition 9, the rules were changed very – hardly at all in terms of this particular section.  So I do and I did at that stage consider myself to be an expert on the rules in parliament.     No.     Correct.     That is correct.     Thank you, Judge.  The excuses they gave were a myriad of excuses ranging from the fact that we could go and do oversight at the necessary institutions, that they would ensure that the auditor general would come and give to our committee the outcomes of the audited financial statements, that we had at our disposal the process of questions and motions in the house which we could use and that there were other processes in parliament including the questions and answer sessions that we would have in parliament that we could utilise instead of going into an inquiry.   They also used the excuse that the parliamentary terms were going to be shortened somewhat because we were soon going to be heading into an election, that we had had an election in 2014 that had shortened periods of parliament which, in my opinion, was moot for our committee as we do not ever deal with any type of legislation. And I think that the big problem is this, the ANC has study groups so they do not just have a study group for example for the Department of Public Enterprises, they will have a study group for the economics cluster as well as then for the Department of - you know, the portfolio committee of Public Enterprises and if a decision is made that it is not politically viable or politically expedient for  335 such an inquiry to happen then their majority is used to shut down any possibility of an inquiry from happening and at that stage I think that there was a great deal of strife going on within the ANC and it was thought that it would just be better to, to coin the phrase, to let sleeping dogs lie and to try and keep the opposition happy by making sure that Eskom and Transnet and whoever else would come and do presentations to our portfolio which, quite frankly, had become a complete waste of time.     So the Democratic Alliance has it as well, we just call – we term it work streams and what we do is we keep one another abreast of what is happening.  So, for example, I am chief whip and I have working alongside me 13 other whips and I separate the whips into groups and those groups deal with the economics cluster, of which I had three, they have the social cluster, they have the environmental cluster and what we do is we look at information  that is happening in parliament and possible legislation that is coming up in parliament and anything that we should be aware of and the ANC also have exactly the same kind of formula except they call it work study  335 groups, that they have, they do not call them work streams and they also have parliamentary research staff that join their specific study groups and those researchers then also sit on our committee and they produce the study material and the information per committee meeting that we have to give to everyone on the portfolio committee.     They absolutely are, they are fully ventilated in the study group.  All problems, all foreseeable eventualities, any letters that may have been written by the opposition would have been fully ventilated in an ANC study group.  Legal advice would have been taken during that particular study group perhaps from the state law adviser that we would have to ask parliament itself but it would have been fully ventilated in an ANC study group before it then came to the portfolio committee and it happened then, it happens now, it always does and always will happen before a portfolio committee meeting.     Absolutely, Judge, I used to mention this committee on a regular basis and in fact sometimes I would suggest going so far as to perhaps attaching certain assets of some of the state owned entities when things were really getting bad.   I also proposed motions in the house which is something that we can do.  We can either give a notice of motion or propose a motion without notice in the house which I did asking for a committee to be established to discuss and to investigate state capture and I asked my  335 chief whip to raise it in the Chief Whips’ Forum in the hope that he would be able to get enough of the chief whips together to persuade the ANC to have either an inquiry or an ad hoc committee.  So there were many times where I requested that either an inquiry or an ad hoc committee was established to investigate what was now obvious state capture within the state owned entities.     Judge, I am absolutely able to.  What I would then need you to do is to refer to the timeline which I handed in.     So, Advocate, I am not sure about your numbering, I have printed my timeline completely separately so I am not sure if Justice Zondo has a copy of that timeline.     There is not.  335     Justice, excuse me for having left your screen for a second, I just want to quickly refer so that you have a clear indication of what I mean.  So I just had to – because I have got a table in front of me here.     And I am just – sorry, Justice, if you just give me one second I can find the date.  On the 11 April, Judge Zondo, I wrote to the then Minister of Public Enterprises to request the details of the Eskom penalty settlement with the Gupta-owned Tegeta resources.  I also – and I am sorry to take you back…     On the 13 February I made a submission in terms of the prior to gain access to the full and original unredacted Denton report.    335 On the 15 February 2017 I called for the full text of another Deloitte report, this time on Eskom’s 08 procurement of the energy coal valued at R10 billion to be made publicly immediately. I then on the 16 February requested the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Ms Letsatsi-Dube to summon the full original unredacted report as released by the Financial Mail to the committee for further inquiry.  I then …[intervenes]     2017.     By that time it was in the public domain, yes.     I also, Judge, on the 18 April I requested the Public Protector Advocate Mkhwebane to probe the R30 million pension payout to Brian Molefe.  I submitted the application - prior application to gain access to the employment contract of Brian Molefe.     Judge, just so that I do not confuse you in any way, what I did is once I realised that the initial inquiry was being blocked I attempted to do smaller inquiries.     As I went along.     In the hope that those smaller inquiries would result in the committee having to have a large inquiry.     That is why I did the [indistinct] 25.18 of certain documents, the [indistinct] 25.19 of applications, I wrote to certain ministers for information.  All of those were mini-inquiries.  335     That I hoped that when the result of those would come to me it would give the committee no option but to adhere to my request for a full investigation because that evidence even of itself was so damning.     It takes place in a plenary, it either happens in the National Assembly chamber or it happens in the assembly chamber just above the National Assembly chamber or it happens in the Old Assembly chamber.  So we sometimes break up but Public Enterprises due to the importance of the nature it normally has a large public audience so it normally does happen in the National Assembly chamber.     No, certainly not, it is a plenary of the house.     374.       Yes.     Forgive me, I went to 474, I am just going to 374.  Yes, mine starts at the bottom, the declaration of vote.     Yes.     That is right.      That is correct.     Correct.     Certainly not.     We worked exceptionally closely and I hand on heart say she became one of the bravest women I ever, ever worked with.     Yes.     Yes.     All ANC members present.     That is a fair comment and we also at the time of the vote called for a division so when you call for a division in Parliament it takes a little bit of time but each person’s vote is recorded so next to your name it will record whether you voted yeah or nay.     Judge when you propose a motion of this nature the opposition party or any other party in Parliament doesn’t have an opportunity to really talk to the motion or to talk down to it.  If anyone from the ANC did talk down to  335 it I am afraid I don’t recall it.  What I do recall, because it shocked me to my very core, was the massive jubilation and the burst out in song that the ANC had upon the announcement of the result of the division having been called in the house, so when they realised that they had defeated the motion they began to dance and sing ANC veteran songs and ANC rally songs in the house and they very jubilant – you know there was great jubilation that they had beat this particular motion in the house, but nothing in the house that I can remember was said you know because you stand up and you announce your intention to propose the motion and then the vote is taken so if anything was said Judge I am afraid I don’t remember, but I do remember the great jubilation when the motion was defeated.     Judge I think that there could have been and I think that Advocate Freund has the minutes of that particular meeting, so if he could quickly jog my memory.     Advocate 361?       Ah, there we go.     Yes that is this.      Yes.     No it was an open division.     Yes.     Yes, this is the type of answer that the opposition has become accustomed to, there is no regulation and certainly not accountability to Ministers who do not answer questions correctly in the House.  We had a powers and privileges committee and an ethics committee,  335 I can tell you that the Ethics Committee hasn’t sat for over a year, the same can go for the Powers and Privileges Committee, so this type of answer unfortunately is regular and it is to be expected because there is no accountability for the way Ministers answer questions.     Judge you are quite correct, that is the case, and when we complain about the answers we are told that we must resubmit them and that if we don’t like the answers that is not the House’s fault.     Judge Zondo unfortunately we have reached the stage, and we have had for some time, that if  335 a Minister does not want to answer a question they simply don’t.  When we resubmit a question the questions office will then tell us that that question has already been asked within a certain period of time and that the response was given.  We can refer the response to the Rules Committee, but the Rules Committee equally such as the Ethics Committee and the Powers and Privileges Committee also doesn’t sit, so there is no actual structure that sits and holds a minister to account. So one would hope that the leader of government business or certainly the head of the Executive would hold the Ministers to account, but that certainly does not happen.     We most certainly do and there have been many occasions, especially oral questions to Parliament which Judge if you have ever watched an oral session in Parliament it becomes very robust and sometimes very unruly, and we often refer Ministers who don’t arrive or who simply stand up and say yes or no and sit down, we do  335 refer those particular Ministers to the leader of government business or to the Chair of Chairs, we also do so in the Chief ...[indistinct] if there is a continuous pattern that we see development, however I have yet to see a Minister have any consequence to refusing to answer a question, and I have been in Parliament since 2009.     Yes, it would be the leader of government business, it could also be the ...[indistinct – distorted] of Parliament and either one of them could then bring the matter up in a Cabinet meeting.     That is correct.     Yes.     I do.     No.     That is a very fair summary.     That is correct.     That is correct.  What had happened was Mr Gordhan and his Deputy had been relieved of their duties as Finance Ministers, the one, the Deputy, had resigned to my recollection, Honourable Gordhan had  335 decided to stay on as a member of Parliament and had been placed as a member of the Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee.  Where we were politically to answer your earlier question was that we were now moving into the period of the ANC Congress and a build up to the ANC Congress and the clear division lines had been drawn within the ANC separating those who were now clearly on the Zuma camp and those who were now clearly on the Ramaphosa camp and battle lines so to speak had been drawn, one could see it in reactions to heckling and to speeches made in Parliament and one could also see the reaction of members who now – who had one time were scared to speak out and were following a certain who were now giving a freedom to take another line and to pursue a different way of – of dealing with issues.    That – that is correct it is the elective conference of the ANC that took place in December of 2017.    I am here I could hear you.    Yes I am sorry about that I could hear you.    Yes absolutely.  It was a fundamental turning point in more ways than one.  When I arrived just to explain the – the structure of the Townhouse Hotel the – where you have the meetings you have to go downstairs and then you are in a sort of basement level.  When I got to the basement level I was there with the leader of the opposition – the Chief Whip of the opposition rather Honourable Steenhuizen who had joined me for that particular meeting because there was going to perhaps be a question raised about the sub judice rule and he was at the time and probably still is the expert on sub judice.  When we arrived the ANC section of the committee welcomed me,  they –  335 there was a definite warmth that had not been there before.  They told me that they would back me in all the questions that I was going to ask and they informed me that Honourable Pravin Gordhan was also going to be there because he had such in-depth knowledge about the finances and how things had worked so there was a sort of sigh of relief that we had an ex-Minister of Finance joining us who knew about the finances and how they – the finances would have been paid over.  During the course of the meeting it was very obvious that we had gone from a committee divided to a committee completely united in being on the side of South Africans and what was correct for South Africa at the particular time and that was the fundamental shift where we went from a normal Portfolio Committee meeting – committee to being team South Africa in taking the issue forward as a united team.    That is correct.    I am almost there.  I have two pages stuck together.  Yes I have it.    Well members of Parliament are often given documents; we are sent information, documents are left at certain places for us and I had been given a in those days it was still on a CD Rom I had been given a CD Rom of a collection of the Gupta Leaked emails which were in the public domain already which had been released mostly by the – by the media in which you could of course get.  You know it was public if you went onto certain media houses web pages.  I then sat down with a grouping of the DA staff and what we did is we did computer searches on particular names.  So we would do a computer search on Brown and then we would do a search for everything that came up linking Minister Brown to state capture and so we did it Minister by Minister.  What we then did is we printed a set of each one of the Gupta Leaked emails that involved certain Ministers in Parliament.  We put them into a big brown manila envelopes.  We labelled them accordingly with the name of the Minister and when I had completed this task which was quite mammoth task it took us a good few days and nights to complete I went into the House and as soon as the Speaker had called the House to order I stood up on a  335 point of privilege and I informed the Speaker that in my hands I had a set of Gupta leaked emails and that I had separated these Gupta leaked emails into packets according to which Minister had been implicated or alleged to have been implicated in any of the Gupta leaked emails and that I was handing up the full and complete set of emails to the Speaker for her then to disseminate to each one of the Ministers and I explained that I had labelled each of the envelopes accordingly.  Of course there is televised footage of that as well as a rather famous photo of me standing up with a huge pile of these brown envelopes as I handed them up to the House.    Yes.    Yes.  I am just going to – it is easy for me to remember when I write down the names.  Advocate I off the top of my head really remember the name of four and I do not want to in any way perjure myself so I will give you the names of the four that I remember.   It was Minister Brown, Minister Van Rooyen, Minister Zwane and Minister Gigaba and I cannot recollect the name of the fifth.    Minister Brown was the then Minister of Public Enterprises. Van Rooyen was the Minister of COPTA and then he had become the Finance Minister.  Minister Zwane was Mineral Resources and Minister Gigaba at the time had taken over as Finance Minister but was previously the Shadow – the Minister of Public Enterprises.    Yes and Home Affairs – but Home Affairs was later.    Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely a lot of the Gupta Leaked emails had already been made public.  So many of the documents were in the public domain but the facts of the matter is you want a Minister definitively to have read something and to assume that they have read something.  You have a duty to hand it up to them in the House and that is what I did.  I executed my – my diligence in the House by handing up the document to them.    Huh-uh.    I was Advocate Freund I also had a meeting with Mr Cedric Frolick.  Our committee asked for a multi- party delegation to go and meet Mr Frolick in his office.  It was made up of myself, Ms Daphne Rantho and Mr Naransing from the IFP and we asked – we were sent to Mr Frolick’s office to ask him for assistance with our inquiry in terms of getting us an evidence leader and making sure that we had everything at our disposal.  He kindly arranged all of that.  It is minuted in a meeting when we report to our committee that we had in fact executed that task that was given to us and Mr Frolick did everything that we requested of him.    Yes I do.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is all correct.    You are correct yes.    That is correct.    That is – that is – in fact there was a very public falling out between Denel and Treasury in the called the Assembly Chamber during a Portfolio Committee meeting on Public Enterprises where the Public Enterprises Committee actually threw the board of Denel of Parliament due to their contempt in which they held the committee and we realised therein and what the problems at Denel were a lot bigger than we had originally anticipated.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I would agree and I would go so far as to say there were even many members of the ANC who wanted that particular report appealed and there was a large pushback saying that the Public Protector had not given members an – the correct opportunity to state their claim.  So there was continuously a fight about that particular document of the Public Protector’s.    That is correct.    I am sure.     Well, he was absolutely determined to get our committee up and going as fast as possible.  When we required a legal opinion from a senior advocate when Ms Lynne Brown had questioned the validity of us having an inquiry.   There was absolutely no question about getting that particular legal opinion.  So everything in Mr Frolick’s power was done to ensure that we had a venue and that we have everything at our disposal.   So I suppose that one could say that it is conjecture but it is also a matter of having lived through the experience  335 and seen someone’s first-hand reaction.  And then with the     That is correct.       Absolutely correct.     Well, Mr Jackson Mthembu by his very nature was a very friendly and very kind person but even more so during this particular inquiry.  A lot of the inquiry was done in the old assembly chamber and just off the old assembly chamber is the office of the ANC chief whip.   So often in the morning, we would have – we would arrive a little bit early.  We would discuss as a committee who would be asking the first set of questions.  In other  335 words, we would sort of caucus as a committee.  We had the morning coffee and settle in.   And often Mr Jackson Mthembu used to pop in, check on us, make sure we are all okay, ask us if we need anything, if the evidence leader had everything that he needed and make sure that we were all okay.   We had a few instances where a few movements had tried to come into Parliament and disrupt our meetings.  And Mr Mthembu made sure that the security around our venue was heightened and that we felt completely safe while we were executing our oversight duty.       Yes.     Yes.  It became a very strange time in all of our lives and it is very hard to explain unless you have lived through something like it.  At times it felt like we were living a James Bond movie.   And the members knew very clearly that one way or  335 another they were going to be in a great deal of trouble for having supported and for having robustly questioned many people who had a great deal of influence over the ANC and more especially over ANC coffers as they came in.   And as it happened, only one member of the Portfolio Committee that was a current member returned to Parliament.  Minister Gordhan was of course made a Minister again but not one of the other members came back to Parliament in the end as a member of Parliament.  They were ranked very low on the list.   And yes at times when I expressed to them that I thought that what they are doing was very brave.  Because as an opposition it is my job to hold the executive to account but it is very difficult when you are holding your own Ministers and your own potential cadets that have been deployed on behalf of your party to account on this.  It is a very difficult thing to do.   And I often say to them that they were being incredible brave in their actions.  And one of the members said to me that that they were well-aware that this is a Kamikaze mission but that they had to for the sake of their future mental health and also for the sake of – in one case – their religious believes had to put South Africa first.  And they could no longer be privy to the corruption that they knew was happening.    335     Ms Rantho came in as the acting chairperson of the committee.  She showed a bravery of the kind not often seen in business nor in politics.  Ms Rantho had children that at one time were threatened.   And we all experienced some kind of oddness that had happened which we went public about which is not part of this committee.  It was dealt with at the time by Parliament.   But Ms Rantho stood incredible firm, incredible strong and she maintained a level of decorum throughout the inquiry which was fair in the line the timing of questioning. And she certainly ensure that the committee acted as a team South Africa and otherwise what would happen is that the ANC would been a disproportioned amount of time to ask their questions to other members of the committee because that is how Parliament works. Ms Rantho decided not to go that particular route and gave everyone equal opportunity to speak.  And I think showed an immense amount of bravery at a time where harm could come to her and her family.  335     Absolutely.  A chairperson of a committee can make or break whether that committee is able to execute their duty as put down in the rules of Parliament, and more importantly as envisaged in the oath of office that a member of Parliament takes.   I have seen many a committee chairperson who has actually stopped me from doing my oversight duty and has stopped me from being able to execute my oath of office. Ms Rantho was the exact opposite.  She was an enabler who has to hold the executive account rather than someone who stood in our way.      Thank you.  Thank you very much Indeed Advocate.  I consider myself to be a senior member of Parliament and I also consider myself to be a senior member of my party and as such I think that I have the experience to speak on issues on how we can improve oversights in Parliament. I specifically referred to the oath of office or the affirmation that every member of Parliament takes upon being sworn in which is done in front of the Chief Justice because we sway our allegiance our oath of office to uphold the constitution.  And one particular, if I may, I would like to read out     Yes, there are no opposition chairs of committees.  Excuse me.  One needs to understood and accept that's the majority party governs the country.  opposition parties must also be allowed the scope and room to exercise oversight within governments and to hold the executive to account. It is reprehensible that the very individuals discussed and investigated by this committee of inquiry are currently serving as Ministers, chairs committee's and ordinary members of Parliament.  Advocate Freund and Judge Zondo with your indulgence allow me to repeat that sentence.  It is reprehensible that the very individuals discussed and investigated by this Commission of inquiry serve as Ministers, chairs of committee's and ordinary members of Parliament.  It is our submission that there should be a  335 committee made up of one member of each party represented in Parliament that decides an establishment and composition of ad hoc committees, the scheduling of debates and the taking of motions.  The rules of the ethics and the powers in the committee needs to be urgently relooked.  The majority enjoyed by the governing party cannot be used to evade accountability of members that appear before these committees.  There  should also be criminal repercussions for those who are found guilty of an infringement by either one of these committees.  These committees must be open to the public and to the media to ensure transparency in the Parliamentary process. The programming of the Parliamentary term needs to be fundamentally changed.  We are still looking at a sort of six months, six months which dates back to the old style system the Parliament would sit six months in Cape Town and six months in Pretoria.  The amount of time that MP's do not spend in The House during the basic work of legislating and holding the executive to account is unacceptable.  The leader of government business and the leader of opposition should be consulted in the programme in process.    335 We submit that the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Deputy Speaker should not belong to any political party, no hold any office of any political party and thus must be completely politically independent.  The presiding officers of Parliament should be apportioned as in accordance with the representation of parties in Parliament. Advocate Freund, in conclusion.  It cannot be that we sit at the Commission like the Zondo Commission that looks at the state capture and honestly say to one another that the entire Cabinet did not know that state capturing was happening. it is a physical and factual impossibility.  We cannot say under earth and say to Judge Zondo as chairperson of this committee that the very person who was the head of government business, the leader of government business and also the head cadet appointment programme of the ANC did not know that state capture was happening.  It is impossible that the Speaker of Parliament did not know that state capture was happening. One must look at the divisions that exist in our country and one must realise that it is to the interests of some to divide us and not to unite us.  It would be very naive of us to come here and think that we can scapegoat one ex-president and maybe 5, 6, 7,  335  of the Ministers and CEO of various companies.  those Ministers were appointed by the ANC cadet employment programme and their CEOs enjoyed a turnstile ball approach to the appointments in all state owned entities.  And there is no way that people in the executive of the ANC could even not have known that state capture was happening.  Thank you very much.      Judge Zondo, I think address that problem is that although we are a multi-party Parliament, we are a  335 multi-party Parliament that enjoys an overwhelming majority who takes the decisions on behalf of that multi-party.   So what we need is we need to see a levelling out of the playing field when it comes to certain decision making functions.  Otherwise we may as well just be a dictatorship or a you know a two-party show. Because theoretically if one looked strictly at the way time is allocated, someone who has one seat in Parliament for example would get 15-seconds during the debate to make their contribution.   So it is my opinion and the opinion of the Democratic Alliance that there are some committees that needs to be established where the leader of the opposition together with the leader of Government Business make decisions for example on the Programme of Parliament and the Scheduling of Debates and Motions that happen in Parliament. And it is also my submission as well as the DA’s that we have a committee made up of one person from each party represented in Parliament that form a Committee of Parliament that make sure that oversight is executed in terms for example of where a Minister refuses to answer questions and what kind of repercussions that particular Minister will have. Because at the moment regardless of what  335 committee that particular Minister is referred to, the overwhelming majority of the ANC will always protect that Minister.   So what we need to see is levelling of the playing fields in terms of the numbers that we have in our Parliament.     [No audible reply]   335     Justice Zondo, I know more probably than most people would about holding the party line.     Because my job as Chief Whip is to make sure that my members hold the party line.  And often in a snap debate or a snap motion that will come to the floor you will see me stand up and I will walk around and I will inform my party members how to vote.  That is what a Chief Whip does. But how we get around this particular mine that I think we find ourselves in is that we must not be naïve to the ideology that parties have.  All political parties have an ideology.  That is why you join them because you believe in what they stand for.  So there are certain fundamentals that a political party will always vote for or against based on the  335 ideology of the party.   There are certain circumstances where I believe that a secret ballot is necessary.  For example I think that the election of the President and the election of the Speaker are examples of where there should be a secret ballot as well as the impeachment and removal of either a speaker or a president should be in a secret ballot form. I also think that the South African public have a lot more right to find out exactly how members of Parliament who may have voted into office are voting. So I do not believe in a simple yea or nay system.  I think we should have a system in Parliament that logs every single vote that you as a member of Parliament make because I should never be ashamed of voting yes or no for an issue and I should be completely and fully accountable to my constituency as to how I voted. Now I know there has been a lot of talk about allowing you know changing, fundamentally changing the system of government the way we elect governance in South Africa and that is something that we are going to be looking at and certainly the Van Zyl Slabbert Report is going to be looked at too. But perhaps what is necessary is for the South African public got to realise that we hold our positions because they had given us their mandate to hold their  335 positions. And Judge Zondo, I think that perhaps that if you knew exactly who voted for what and when, you would have more power as an individual South African citizen who votes to hold me accountable than you do at the moment. And I think it would also make many members of Parliament think twice before they vote in a certain way if they knew that the general public would know next to their name it said yes or no. And in a case such as we had now where we had an entire inquiry into state capture.  I think we have to hold those who voted against an initial ad-hoc committee who voted against that ad-hoc committee, I think we have an obligation to hold them to account. And I think we have an obligation to hold many MP’s who have voted for certain issues to account.  And I understand that it is not something that is easy to solve and it certainly will not happen overnight but I think as our democracy matures so must our attitude to the way we are hold accountable, mature. And I take comfort in looking at governments around the world where without a second guess if they are found to have done something wrong they resign their office immediately.   And it is my hope that the dignity and the quorum of  335 our Parliament matures at a much faster rate to ensure that we have ministers and members resigning should they be found to have infringed the rules in any way.       Justice Zondo, whatever you need from me I am at your service and I thank you very much for your time. 
MAZZONE: My name is Natasha Wendy Bonita Mazzone.   Well already it had become public knowledge with many of the ANC members publicly declaring for whom their support was going – going towards.  Now this is not uncommon in political parties.  My own political party recently went through an electoral conference and many senior members as well as many junior members quickly make known who they are supporting and they publicly endorse that particular person.   So we know that endorsements had started coming through for either Jacob Zuma then President or for the leader of government business Cyril Ramaphosa. Also what one must bear in mind is that in Parliament  335 a lot of the heckling is missed by the public because our microphones are deeply sensitive.  So the microphone at the podium is set to a much higher frequency than the rest of the chamber.   So when you are giving a speech in Parliament and it is done so that the hand slide can record it and so that obviously the public can hear it you do not hear the heckles that are made or sometimes you can dependent on how far away they are but the heckles do not sound as loud as they do when you are in the house. But the Democratic Alliance obviously ...[indistinct – word cut off] the ANC in Parliament and we could see groupings of people together who were no longer sitting in their seats that they were allocated to.  They had moved to sit in clusters.  And when a member who was either pro-Zuma or pro-Ramaphosa would speak, a cluster would often heckle.  Sometimes turn their back many a time walk out and not listen to the Speaker and the divisions were just highly visible.   And as I say, I have been in Parliament since 2009 and one does become accustomed to who is close to who and I mean, we spent a lot of time in The House and you get a general feel for what is going on in The House.  And it was very evident in The House who was in favour for example of a commissioner of inquiry being started and who was against  335 such a commission of inquiry.
