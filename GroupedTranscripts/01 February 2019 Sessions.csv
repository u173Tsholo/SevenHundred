CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius.  Good morning everybody.  Good morning Mr Bloem.    Thank you.    Yes, Mr Pretorius.    Ja, thank you.REGISTRAR   Well Mr Bloem before we start I just want to thank you for coming forward to assist the Commission.  We really appreciate all people who come and assist us.  Thank you very much.    Well it is T5.  Thank you Mr Pretorius.  I have got it.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    I am sorry what is the paragraph again?    Oh, okay and you say the last line?    Where it says contract to Operations?    It should say Bosasa Operations?    Oh, thank you.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    I am sorry what is the paragraph on page 10?    Ja, page 10 what paragraph?    Oh, okay.    Yes, ja.    Huh-uh.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Oh, okay, okay.  Nyuku.    [Laughing].  Okay.  I must, I must confess when I read it I did not think that NYOKO was meant to be Nyuku, Nyuku because, but I think when I read this is money I should have thought it is supposed to be Nyuku.    Okay.  So instead of N-Y-O, it should be N-Y-U?    And, and should it not be U after K or is that the Zulu version?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Oh.    Ja, okay, okay.  Thank you.    Okay, thank you very much.    Ja.    And a Portfolio Committee can call upon the Minister of a particular department the Director-General at any time to come and account on, on the work of the department.  Is that right?    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And officials of a department?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.    Before we proceed what powers does a Portfolio Committee have in terms of what it can do when it is unhappy with reports or explanations from aGovernment Department, from a Minister, from a Director-General, from officials of a department if it is unhappy with explanations or if it believes that there is something wrong going on there?  What, what are the powers that it has in terms of what it can do?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, but of course I assume that a Portfolio Committee maybe like any individual who has, who, who has knowledge of something wrong going on in any Government department like criminal activities or maladministration, corruption may report that to certain agencies or institutions provided for in our legal system?    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And then if he or she does not take those or if you are not happy with whatever measures he or she takes then you can report to certain agencies?    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Okay, thank you.    So the, there you are talking about the leadership at national level?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Or maybe before, before this.  It might be convenient if you tell uswho the National Commissioner was if it was only one during the time that you were.    You were Chairperson of the committee.    Or if there were more then you can just tell us from that year to that year it was so and so.  From that year to that year it was so and so and then you can tell us about the challenges.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Okay, thank you.  Then Mr Pretorius you had asked aquestion.    Yes, thank you.  Did you form any view about whether the delay in giving the committee documents or information or the failure to give information to the committee by the department was a matter of incompetence and inefficiency or did you form a view that it was much more than that or are you not able to tell?  When I say much more than that maybe that it was deliberate to sabotage the work of the committee or is it something you are not sure about?    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Hm, hm, hm.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Ja, thank you.    Yes.    Maybe you could elaborate just a little bit on the havoc.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Year in year out?    Yes.    Was that the state of the affairs from 2004 up to 2009 when you left the committee throughout or was it the position only for some of the years and not all?    Oh, okay.  Oh, you are only became Chairperson of the committee in 04?    But a member, a member of the committee you started in 1994?    So you had very good knowledge of what was going on in    Yes, okay.  So, so, just so that we, we, we know.  So this situation of qualified audits had been the position for all the years or only some of the years from 1994?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Ja.    In relation to corruption?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, just, just something.  I assume that the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services must have been very unhappy about this situation in Correctional Services where there were qualified audits and there was havoc for so many years andthat they were doing something to try and put a stop to this havoc.  Were they and if so what, why were they not succeeding?    But the Portfolio Committee itself it has oversight responsibility.  It had oversight responsibility.  It was aware I assume at the time that as you were aware that there was only havoc as you put it at Correctional Services and it must have been their responsibility to do whatever they could to put an end to this havoc.  So were they doing anything and if they were obviously they were not succeeding.  Why were theynot succeeding?    Yes, but I am happy if you want to deal with it later as long as you deal with it.    But if you want to say something now you can.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    When you, when you used to have discussions with, with him did he also acknowledge that there were serious problems, but did not want to do anything about them or did he deny that there were problems?    Even when the [indistinct] include corruption?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Now obviously we have seen from the membership of the committee during the time when you were chairperson that the majority of the members were ANC people?    Members of Parliament.    If you are a member of a Portfolio Committee and you have serious problems about how a certain department is being run in terms of corruption and things like that and you are not finding joy with the relevant Minister.  Would members of the ruling party also report to the ruling party to say we have a problem here you know?  This will give a bad name to our party, because it is going to be like you know the party is failing to make sure that its deployees, a Minister makes sure that a department is being run properly.  Would such reports be made to the ruling party and would it doanything about such things?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm, hm.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes and what came out of those discussions where it was an ANC study group where these issues were raised?  Did anything come, come out in terms of addressing the corruption at Correctional Services?    Thank you.    Budget for Correctional Services?    Hm.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Who called you and reprimanded you?    Mbulelo Goniwe?    Yes.    Did you find that as a member of the ruling party serving in the Correctional Services Committee, Portfolio Committee did you find that you were in aconflict situation, maybe a conflict of interest situation in the sense that in your own mind you knew what you thought should be done to stop the havoc, to stop the correctional, but at the same time you were being told not to follow certain steps, not to follow a certain line, because it was said it would put the ANC Government in a bad light?  Did you find yourself in that situation or not really?    Yes.    So were, were those who were approaching him and wanting you to be removed what was their basis for complaining about you?  What did they find wrong with what you were doing?    Well part of what you have said is very important and, and hopefully the Commission will hear from more people from Parliament on various issues because one of the questions that arises is whether two the extent that there was, there is state capture and as I always say I will only decide at the end of the Commission whether there was.    My terms of reference say I must investigate the allegations.    And, and it - well be also that with or without state capture orcorruption it may well be that there are certain understandings, different understandings from different quarters as to how members of Parliament who happen to be members of political parties how they are supposed to do their work when it may appear that their party wants something else and they think the right thing is something else.    So it may well be that as the commission goes on with its work it should keep an eye.    Or to what extent our parliament may also have been affected.    From happening.    Or from continuing.    It may be that it may have been able to strop certain people.    From doing certain things.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   But it did not do so.    And the question may be in not doing so…    So I just wanted to say from your evidence those are some of the things that come to my mind.    But thank you.    Because – if I can add because as I said quite early after my appointment as Chairperson of this commission I see the task of this commission as including that if we find – if I find that indeed there was state capture and all the thingsthat are happening that happened under state capture one of the things that the commission has got to look at is what enabled state capture to happen?    What are the things that facilitated state capture to happen the way it did?    What is it in our environment legal and maybe even constitutional that may have and political that may have provided fertile ground for state capture to happen.    Thank you.      Thank you very much.    Thank you.    Yes we will take the tea adjournment and we will resume at half pasteleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes, Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    And, and going back to the installation of TV sets in prisons and as you say even in single cells that issue was also raised by the Committee with the Minister of Correctional Services at the time.  Was it raised as well?    And did he, was he able to articulate to the Committee what need hethought existed for the installation of TV sets even in single cells or just the installation of TV sets in prisons at all?    Thank you.    Well if that was his attitude and he came at a time when some functions had already been outsourced I would imagine that his attitude then was to    Yes.    Yes and now in terms of functions that had previously been performed by Correctional Services staff officials, workers which then became outsourced.  What happened to the staff who had been performing those functions?  Were they taken over by the entity that, to which the function was outsourced?  Do you know?    Okay.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   [Intervenes] I am happy, I am happy for you to deal with it later if.    I have gone ahead of Mr Pretorius.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Okay.  Do you want him to do [intervenes]?    Okay.    Hm.    Ja, you can deal with it, ja.    You are telling me that effectively what would have happened is that if Bosasa/Sondolo took over in terms of the contract that they were given took over today there was in practical terms no difference between how the food for the prisoners,how the catering had happened yesterday and how it was happening today and how it would happen the following day other than that there was some Bosasa official in the kitchen and maybe other people, but the actual cooking was not done by Bosasa staff.  It was done by the inmates themselves and the dishing out and everything happened the way it had been happening before Bosasa got the contract.    That is what you are saying?    Yes.    So on the face of, in the light of the fact that Correctional Services has got farms as you say where it grows vegetables I assume and a lot of things for the    In the light of that if Bosasa was supplying any food it may have been to supplement, but otherwise one expects that the food that was grown in, on the farms of Correctional Services is the food that was supplied to the kitchens all over the country?    Is, is; you were a member of the Correctional Services Portfolio Committee for over 10 years, from 1994 to 2009.  Is that right.    Yes.  So it is a long time?    Is there any chance that a person who was Minister of Correctional Services during that time would not have been aware of what was happening and would not have been aware of, would not have asked the question what are we paying Bosasa for?  What do they actually do?  Is that something you are able to, to answer?  Is there something that you might not be able to answer?    And you are saying, well you left the Portfolio Committee ofCorrectional Services at that, in 2009?    Yes.  Since then your knowledge of what is happening at, at Correctional Services would it be based on, simply on what you read in the media or do you have anymore, better information in terms of what is happening there?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You know what you are talking about?    Yes.    So which would mean actually if Bosasa’s contract was to, were to be terminated now, if what you say was happening up to 2014 if it is still happening if it is still the same realty the only difference in practical terms in prisons and Correctional Services would be, there would be no difference really in terms of practically termsbecause the inmates would continue to, to cook and so on and the only difference really would be that Bosasa would stop receiving millions from Correctional Services?    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    What did I say?ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   [Laughing].  Ja.  No, it is hundreds of millions, thank you.    [No audible reply].    Yes.    So it is only seven?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    What we have just heard is very concerning in terms of tax payers’ money.  If the evidence we have heard is true it will be very concerning.  I hope that the investigators can urgently establish whether even as we speak that is still the position with regard to the catering contract, because if it, if Mr Bloem’s evidence is true and is corroborated it maybe that some urgent steps need to be taken by the relevantauthority and it may or may not be that the Commission might have to consider whether it has any role to have the issue dealt with urgently.  Whether it has got any powers and any role, but I hope that the relevant authorities might not wait if they hear this evidence and they verify and it appears to be true that urgent steps can be taken to deal with this    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    You said that the meeting that you want to tell us about where Mr Petersen said something.    Was in October.    Okay.    Right.    As far as you can remember I know that you said that the PortfolioCommittee was not informed in advance that Mr Petersen was to be redeployed and moved to I think you said Sports and Recreation, but after he had been redeployed were you, were you ever or did you as a committee ever ask what the reasons were and were you ever given what the reasons were by the then Minister of Correctional Services?    Ja.  Okay.    With no consequences to anybody?    So your oversight was being rendered in effective as a committee?    Hm, must have been quite frustrating.    Hm.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Hm.  Well I, I am just concerned if a situation where a structure of Parliament a very important body in our country a structure of Parliament which has very important constitutional responsibilities of oversight over the executive raises issues and they are just ignored and nothing happens to anybody.    Because that is what your evidence says.    Hm, thank you.    As Portfolio Committee or would a Portfolio Committee or its Chairperson at some stage be expected to maybe report to the Speaker of Parliament if a Government Department or the executive authority in regard to a certain department, a Minister is not able to assist them with issues that they have raised with hisdepartment and if that is part of what a Portfolio Committee does did your Committee raise with whomever the speaker was at the time and if so what happened?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, but nothing came out of it?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Nobody did anything about it?    Hm.    Thank you.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    But you do not know, you do not know, you were not privy to the discussions?  What you do know is that nothing changed afterwards?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Hm.    Yes, okay.    Hm.    Well I do not know whether you intended to ask him to say something about the basis for his statement or you were not intending to.  Maybe I will ask.  Are you able to give me some factual basis for your statement that Mr Mti enjoyedthe protection and support of Minister Ngconde Balfour?    Thank you.    Thank you.        So would it have been the Secretary of Parliament and the police because you reported to both who should have investigated or initiated an investigation and ultimately there should have been a report that you would have been told about    But that never happened?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm, hm, hm.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Was the attack in the document and were the insults in the document related to your views or position with regard to contracts and tenders at Correctional Services or was it about something else?    Okay thank you.    Well I know it too. (laughing).    What was your understanding of what she was conveying to you when she said Chairperson [foreign word] it is money or this is money?    Ja.  Do you want to just explain to us what she – what your understanding was of what she was conveying to you with these phrases?    And when she said that she did not – she did not show you any money in her hand?    So this money that she was talking about your understanding was not money that she was going to give to her herself?    Ja.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Ja, yes thank you.    My mind is still – I hear what you are saying and it is important but part of my mind is still with that – with what she said to you.  You are playing with your luck Chairperson [foreign word].    Do not leave it.    Can it be said that what she meant was that here was an opportunity for you to make money, use it or do not disregard it or something like that?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Nkosi.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.  Thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes.    Ys.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes.    Yes, yes.  And I assume that you would tell the chief whip but this is wrong and it is our job and my job as chairperson of the committee to raise these issues?    Yes.  You were a member of the ANC the ruling party then as now but you are no longer a member of the ANC now.  Was it your understanding that the policy and the values of the ruling party required you to – not to raise issues when you see – when you saw things that were wrong that were being done?    So you are quite clear in your mind that certainly at that time while you were a member of the ANC it was not the ANC policy and it was not part of the values of the ANC that if a deployee of the ANC and government was doing something wrong you should keep quiet while you are a member of the oversight committee for that department.    I take it and you must tell me if I am wrong.  I take it that your position therefore is that when the chief whip – when the then chief whip told you not to raise these issues in regard to Bosasa and Correctional Services he was the one thatwas going against the policies and the values of the ANC?  I take it that that would be your position that – not that you were out of – you were going against the values and policy of the ANC.    Yes.    Yes.  Within the Portfolio Committee of Correctional Services I know you said earlier on that in that committee while you were chairperson you worked as aunit irrespective of political party affiliation membership.  The raising of these issues was it also done as a unit in the sense that it was just individuals raising them?    No, no I am talking about the Portfolio Committee now.    Ja in the Portfolio Committee the issues that you were raising about Bosasa.    It was just not you alone. It was not you and a few members of thecommittee.  It was either most of the members of the committee or the whole committee who were raising these issues, what was the position?    Okay yes.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Thank you.    Yes that is fine.    Take your time.    Would you like us to take – I think let us take a five minutes adjournment for Mr Bloem to – I think he needs some time.  Let us adjourn for five minutes.    Is it fine?DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   No thank you Mr Bloem.  Thank you Mr Bloem we have heard – we have heard what you have said and we will reflect on it the legal team and the    Judicial Inspectorate.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Yes, yes.    Yes.  Do you know whether he was from the Western Cape high court?    Oh because there is a Judge Erasmus in the Western Cape high court.    To the commission.  No thank you very much.  Thank you very much.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Ys.    Thank you very much yes.    He offered ja.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   No thank you very much for that.    Okay.  That is fine.    So that when we adjourn we are done for the day.    Yes.    Yes.    Do you know when in relation to his departure from Correctional Services that were when he, when he, when he spoke like that?  In other words how    Or was, was there any relationship at all between him articulating that stance and his removal from Correctional Services?  Is there any proximity between the two?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  That is fine.    No, thank you very much for your closing remarks Mr Bloem.  As I indicated earlier on I really appreciate that you have come forward to assist this Commission and you are quite correct that everybody out there who loves this country who appreciates the sacrifices that were made by very, very many people in order for this country to be free, everyone who appreciates all of those things who has got knowledge and information of corruption, a serious corruption that has been happening in our country that continues to happen and acts of state capture must come forward and give information to the Commission, give evidence to the Commission so that at least this Commission will have a good and complete picture of how state capturehappened.  Who facilitated it, who participated in it, who were involved in covering up corruption, who did not want other people to fight corruption, who were, who were busy facilitating corruption so that among other things this Commission can make recommendations as to what measures this country needs to take or to put in place in order to make sure that state capture never happens again and that there is hope thatone day this country would be a country free of corruption.  Of course we know that no country is completely free of corruption, but there is no reason why this country cannot in due course arrive at a time when corruption would be so negligible that we are all able, we can all be able to say our is a corruption free country, relatively speaking.  So we thank you very much.  I hope that other members of Parliament who may also be aware of issues of state capture, issues of corruption and maybe who may also be aware how Portfolio Committees in which they served how they were unable to play their proper oversight role because of people who may have been abetting state capture and corruption.  That they will also come forward and be able to tell the Commission and therefore share with the nation what has happened because if they donot come out and tell us we might not know the full extent of what has happened in terms of state capture and corruption.  We might not know how Parliament was affected by state capture and corruption and therefore we might not be able to make effective recommendations as to what should be put in place to make sure that this country becomes a better country tomorrow.  Thank you very much Mr Bloem.    I will release you for now, but from what you have said it is clear that you will come back.    Because there is more that you want to tell the Commission.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   So, and you will continue to cooperate with the investigators.    So that arrangements can be made for you in due course.    Thank you very much.    You are released.    Thank you.  Mr Pretorius [intervenes].    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Maybe we can mention it on Tuesday.    Ja, maybe we can mention on Tuesday what will happen for the rest of the week.    Or actually now I remember.  So I think you, you, you were hintingthat maybe I should mention it now.    [Laughing].  Well maybe let us, let me do it on, on Tuesday when we have seen, because what if we do not finish on Tuesday.    Ja, ja, so.    Ja, ja     Ja.  Well I think let me announce on Tuesday, ja.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Ja.  We adjourn therefore and will not sit on Monday, but we will resume on Tuesday at 10 o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    The next witness Chair is Dennis Victor Bloem.  May he be sworn?    Mr Bloem in paragraph 1 of your affidavit you place before the Chair some of your background.  Would you just relate that please to the Chair?    If I may interrupt you.  In your own words you needed not follow the text of the affidavit.  Would you just give a brief resume to the Chairplease?    Did you serve Mr Bloem on a Portfolio Committee?    Yes and were you Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services for a period?    Yes.  So in essence Mr Bloem you are giving evidence atvery short notice and we thank you for assisting the investigators and the Commission, but as I understand your evidence there is a lot more detail you can give, a lot more documentation you can provide and I understand you are happy to cooperate with the Commission in this regard?    Mr Bloem what is instructive about what you are going to tell the Chair is that you give an overview and an insight that this Commission has not really had before and that is the role of Parliament and the role of parliamentarycommittees.  In paragraph 2 of your affidavit then you speak of Portfolio Committees and the role of Portfolio Committees.  Please tell the Chair about that.    So the role of parliamentary committees in their duty of oversight over Government Departments and the work of the various National Government Departments is part of the structure of our constitutional checks and balances as I understand?    Right.  Right, before you then get into the factual part of your statement and the facts to which you testify can I ask you to go to page 12?    Is that your signature there above your name?    And on the facts in this statement from pages 1 to 12 to the best of your knowledge true and correct?    Are there any correction you wish to make?    Page 6.    That is correct Chair.    Let us return to your statement then please Mr Bloem and go to paragraph 2.2 where you deal in more detail with the role, the constitutionalrole of Portfolio Committees within Parliament.    So as I understand what you are telling the Chair insummary Mr Bloem is that according to our Constitution the executive arm of Government and in particular the various Government Departments are accountable to Parliament and must report to Parliament?    And in this regard Parliament works through its parliamentary committees?    And you are going to talk in your evidence about the functioning or lack of functioning of the standing committee in relation to Correctional    The; sorry not SCOPA?    The Portfolio Committee?    SCOPA does come into it, but we will talk about that later.    And I presume you also report to Parliament of course?    We were going to deal with the powers in very general terms that the Portfolio Committee has, but perhaps it is as well to complete this line of questioning now Mr Bloem.  The powers, the procedural powers of the Portfolio Committee does it have the power to call for reports and documents from the department over which it has oversight?    Can it call for information?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   And can it call persons to come and account to it in its meetings?    And during your term of office as Chair of this particularPortfolio Committee did this occur?    Right.    And we will give some detail in due course?    Right.  Is the work of a Portfolio Committee restricted to departments of Government?    In fact I understand that particularly in relation to the SIU investigation into Bosasa officials of the NPA or an official of the NPA actually reported to your Committee?    Right.  Let us then go to paragraph 2.3 please.  Again by way of introduction there were two entities or departments over which your Committee, the Committee on Correctional Services had jurisdiction.  What were those two?  Youhave told us about the Department of Correctional Services.  Was there another entity?    Right.  In paragraph 2.4 you list persons who were members of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services.  I take it that is during the period 2004 to 2009 when you were the Chair of that Committee?    And when you were Chair of that Committee in that    Tell the Chair please who else was, who else sat on that Committee?    Thank you.  Then the Committee that you have just referred to under your Chairmanship that tenure ended in March 2009?    During the period 2004 to 2009, we will refer to it now as the Committee, approximately how many Committee Meetings did it hold in relation to the Department of Correctional Services?    And did you conduct oversight visits for example in    And the purpose of these visits what was that?    And you have told the Chair that you interrogated for the purpose of approving or rejecting the budget of the Department of Correctional Serviceseach year?    Did you also interrogate the budget of the Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons?    And it is headed by a Judge?    Right and you say it was set up by the President.  Which President?    Okay.    The minutes of Committee Meetings reports in relation to site visits or oversight visits.  Are these, where are all these documents kept?    And these no doubt will through the correct proceduresChair be available to the investigators to supplement the statement in due course?    Right.  How did the Committee function?  It is a multiparty Committee.    From all, by all the counts the role and functioning of thePortfolio Committee the multiparty Portfolio Committee is a central instrument in our parliamentary democracy?    Did the committee during your period as Chair encounter difficulties in its operation and I am at paragraph 6 of your statement?    How did these difficulties present themselves in relation to your functioning?  What was the problem in fact?    And who was the Minister, just to complete that round of questioning?    Right you were going to tell the Chair how the difficulties presented themselves as a matter of fact in relation to information documentation reports requests made to the committee to the department.  Tell the Chair about that please.    [Intervenes].MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   You give an example of the lack of effective communication between the executive authority on the one hand and the committee on the other in paragraph 7.1 and you refer to the example of the redeployment of the Former National Commissioner of Correctional Services in November 2008 Mr Vernie Petersen.  Please tell the Chair of those circumstances.    Let us place that into context Mr Bloem.  What period, for what period did Mr Petersen serve as National Commissioner of Correctional Services?    Right.  So he was there for approximately one year?    What did he do to allow you to make that judgment?    Was he experienced and knowledgeable in matters related to Correctional Services?    How did you and other members of the committee react to the fact of Mr Petersen’s redeployment?    You say that Mr Petersen took over the functions and the    Who was the person he succeeded?    What was the state generally speaking of the department of Correctional Services when Mr Petersen took over?    Anyway it seems that Mr Petersen lasted a year.  Whosucceeded him?    Okay.    Let us deal briefly with the facts Mr Bloem that you testified to in paragraph 7.3.  Since 2004 what was the quality of the audit reports received by the Department of Correctional Services?    The existence or otherwise of internal financial controls within the department, you make a comment in that regard in paragraph 7.3.    Right and in what respect did these internal controls or lack of internal controls in particular reflect in relation to supply chain management processes?    In paragraph 7.3, I am sorry Chair did you want to?    I am told that at one stage or I am instructed that at onestage the committee, the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services actually rejected a budget presented by the Department of Correctional Services.    Do you have any comment or shall we move on?DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Thank you Chair.  In paragraph 7.3 you deal Mr Bloem with at least two other instances of failures relating to the Department of Correctional Services.  What role did the standing committee on public accounts pay –play and perhaps you should tell the Chair and the public at large what functions SCOPAperforms?    Were resolutions taken by SCOPA in relation to the Department of Correctional Services?    Right.  And the Auditor General what function did the    Did the Auditor General from time to time identify weaknesses within the Department of Correctional Services from an accounting point of view?    Did it make recommendations?    Right and then the Department of Correctional Services certainly in its procurement function is governed by legislation such as the Public Finance Management Act?    From time to time where breeches of the legislation identified by your committee?    The first is the decision to outsource functions to theprivate sector?    The second is the procurement of service providers, the issuing of tenders and the allocation of contracts.    To bidders who participate in the procurement process.    Let us deal first then with the prior decision to outsource.  One would as a general principle expect that to the extent possible a department would    But we know of course that is not always possible and a decision will be made to outsource?    Please tell the Chair about the decision to outsource in relation to services provided by Department of Correctional Services and you deal with that in paragraph 8.1?    Alright you deal in that answer with two processes.  Please tell the Chair what is the function of a feasibility study?  Why have a feasibility    Right we have heard evidence about feasibility studies and the lack thereof but are you saying generally you noted in your committee that there was a failure or a lack of undertaking feasibility studies or to take feasibility studies?    Thank you.  Chair is this an appropriate time before we move onto the detail?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Bloem we were at paragraph 8 of your statement.    And you had told the Chair firstly about the prior decisions to outsource and then the later procurement contracts that were awarded    Did the Committee which you chaired ever question the decisions to outsource serves?    Once more than once?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Alright.  Did you oppose or did your Committee oppose outsourcing on the basis of whether it was necessary to outsource or whether it was being outsourced at excessive costs or both?  What was the position?    Right.  In relation to priorities you have told the Chairthat in your view or in the view of your Committee there was not an appropriate or proper ranking of priorities as I understand your evidence.  Do you have anything to add what you said?  You have spoken about salaries, juvenile facilities and other matters.    Okay.    You do not have anything to add there?    Alright.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   You have raised issued before the Chair Mr Bloem in relation to the need to outsource the ranking of priorities and the procedures followed pursuant to outsourcing in procurement.    Were these questions raised with the Department of    Did you ask for information, documentation, reports in this regard?    Did you receive full cooperation from the department?    In paragraph 8.2 you identify four contracts which were subject to your investigations presumably amongst others.  Tell the Chair what those    Alright.  Right and we will come to the catering servicescontract and your observations a little later on in your statement.    Your observations concerning the prioritisation of those services.    And we know from evidence to date and perhaps you can confirm this that 100 of millions of Rand were spent on this project?    On the television distribution contract.    And the others, but this one in particular.    In paragraph 8.3 you refer to a response or justification given to your Committee by the Department of Correctional Services and you refer to an intervention by the National Commissioner Mr Petersen, the National Commissioner at the time in relation to a problem or problems related to outsourcing.  Tell the Chair about that please.    No, Chair.    Chair.    In fact it is a pertinent question.    And this is the issue to which.CHAIRPERSON   Mr Bloem has been referring and.    And he will illustrate precisely.    So deal with.    What you actually saw.    In Correctional Services.        Yes, Chair one observation hundreds of millions, Chair.    In fact you deal with that in paragraph 8.4 Mr Bloem and you say that on your estimate the Department of Correctional Services has awarded tenders to Bosasa Operations and its subsidiaries in a particular amount.  What is yourestimate?    You mentioned in paragraph 8.4 in fact seven prisons involved in the catering tender originally awarded.    Is that the catering tender that was awarded in July 2004?    And when the catering contract was entered into between Bosasa and the, the Bosasa Group.    By experts and placed.    Before you Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Mr Bloem perhaps a brief summary is acquisit here.  You have spoken about the need for outsourcing in the first instance.  You have spokenabout the award of contracts in the second instance and you have spoken about value for money in relation to outsourced contacts.  Those three issues were they raised with Parliament once, more than once?    Do you feel satisfied that your concerns wereappropriately addressed?    You speak in paragraph 8.5 further of the catering tender    And on 26 February 2008 did your committee meet?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   I am at paragraph 8.5.    You refer to a meeting.    Having taken place on 26 February 2008.    What happened at meeting in relation to the extension of the contract and perhaps I should just ask you a prior question.  Was the committee satisfied with the fact that this contract was to be extended or was extended by afurther 12 months?    We will come back to the meeting of 26 February 2008.    No.    You tell the Chair please of what you know in your own    And then you were to refer to a meeting of 21 Octoberand the intervention of Mr Petersen.  Would you tell the Chair about that please?    Right.  The contract and I am referring now to thecatering contract Mr Bloem that you speak of in paragraph 8.5 was first extended for 12 months without any tender process.  We have heard that evidence already and you seem to confirm it.    Was there a further extension?MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Was that preceded, preceded by a tender process?    Right and you mention a name on page 7 paragraph 8.5.  You mention two names an Ms Moodley and a Mr Gillingham.  How were they involved or not involved?  What are you telling the Chair there?    Is that when you called upon the Department of Correctional Services to account for these extensions?    Before the Committee.    You refer in paragraph 8.6 to a Committee meeting held on 19 August 2008.  What was the purpose of this meeting in relation to the catering contract?  Is that the nutritional contract you referred to?    Before you go on.  If a feasibility is not, feasibility study    Does feasibility also invest or does a feasibility study also investigate value for money [intervenes].    And did the Committee ask firstly whether a feasibility study had in fact being done in relation to the need to outsource as well as why if it had not been done it had not been done?    Did you also ask why seven correctional centres were selected?    Did you receive an answer?    And did you ask any other questions for the purposes of    Right.  Did you ask for this information at this particular meeting on 19 August 2008?    Was the information provided?    And the tender was at a stage awarded again?    Despite the concerns raised and the information requested by the Committee?    So who, to whom was the tender awarded?    Again?    Did the department account to the Committee in thisregard?  You had raised concerns in a meeting.  You were given certain undertakings by the department.  You had requested certain information which you say you never received.  Did they come to you and say look we are going to award this contract again to Bosasa?    How did you learn then of the re-award of the contract to Bosasa Operations?    You have given the example Mr Bloem of the cateringcontract what you described as the nutritional contract.    You have used that to illustrate the relationship between the department officials on the one hand and the Portfolio Committee on the other.    Did you call Messieurs Mti and Gillingham to account before your Committee?    Did you ask them to make presentations?    After the presentations had been made and after youhad an opportunity, had had an opportunity to consider the representations did the Committee raise objections?    Did you receive a satisfactory response?    Did your intervention or attempt to intervene have successful results in relation to the award and further contract of further contracts and further contract extensions to Bosasa or were they ignored?        You have told the Chair in General terms for the moment of your frustrations in relation to the conduct of the Department of Correctional Services and the inability of the Committee to really do anything it.    You were going to tell the Chair of your attempt to escalate your concerns on the Committee to another Committee within the parliamentary structure.    And we deal with in paragraph 9.    Yes.    These were formal meeting I presume in relation to which minutes would have been kept?    Did you speak to Minister Balfour?  You already said he did.  You did rather.    Mr Bloem you have given.    Mr Bloem you have given evidence at a general level of the history of the Portfolio Committee, its relationship with the Department of Correctional Services and the Minister in relation to particular contracts.  You have raised your concerns.  Of course you have already told the Chair that much of this information will be minuted and documented.    Right.    Right.    Let us move then to the statement at paragraph 11.  In 04 and in 2009 I understand you were Chair of the, this Portfolio Committee?    What was kept in this office?    Did you keep computers, digital information in that office?    What happened in 2004 and again in 2009?    Is there high security there?    Have you any explanation for why on not one occasion, but on two occasions this could occur?    Well perhaps you might mention to the Chair without speculating or speculating too much because the question I am going to ask you involves speculation.    2004 to 2009 at that time was your view in relation to outsourcing of the Department of Correctional Services contracts and your view inrelation to their award to Bosasa a matter of public knowledge?    Do you know whether the video footage was ever examined, the security cameras within Parliament?    Perhaps our investigators could look at that Chair.  You personally you have told the Chair that it was a matter of public knowledge your views in relation to the issues about which you have testified.  Did you ever yourself receivethreats and you deal with an issue in paragraph 13?  Tell the Chair about that please.    13, 1-3.    What in particular in that letter you were accused ofwhat?    Right.    Oh I see.  The irony will not be lost on the Chair about you attacking Bosasa and white monopoly capital at the same time but perhaps we can deal with that in submissions.  One morning you say in paragraph 14 you received a visit in your office.  More or less when was this?    Do you know the meaning of the words [foreign word]? I    Thank you Chair.  If you look at paragraph 15 at the top of page 10 of your statement Mr Bloem?    The very first line.      You say there precisely what at least in the statement was said to you by Mr Ngwenya.    Can you confirm the full sentence you refer to here and the words you say were used by Ms Ngwenya in relation to money whether in slang    Is that as you recall.    The conversation?    What conclusion did you reach after her approach and after you heard the testimony of Mr Agrizzi before this commission?    During the period of your chairmanship of the PortfolioCommittee you say it was public knowledge what your attitude was at the time?    Particularly in relation to Bosasa?    Tell the Chair about that please.    You deal in paragraph 18 Mr Bloem with certain other communications within parliament.  Please tell the Chair about that?  Take your time to    In paragraph 18 on page 11 you wanted to tell the commission about your response to the passing away of Vernie Petersen the former DCS Commissioner.  Now I understand that you want to tell the Chair of your concerns here and I am not going to stand in your way.  Just to emphasise that you have a belief but it is not based on any concrete fact as I understand it.    Other than the views and attitudes he expressed.DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   If I may then ask the witness?    Ask the witness to deal with his concerns in that    Do you have anything to add in respect of that    Before Mr Bloem makes closing remarks Chair there is some further information that he has brought to the attention of the investigators who recorded it in a supplementary affidavit but it is not in a state to be handed up and I would like to lead the evidence if I may and then we can put that evidence into the form of a supplementary affidavit.    And may we, I, I understand and trust that you would    Yes, Chair.    Thank you Chair.CHAIRPERSON   The supplementary note do you have it before you?    We will put this in affidavit form in due course.    But it refers to a meeting that took place in October 2008.  Am I correct?    What happened at that meeting?  Well firstly what    You say he lasted a year?    In his position as Commissioner of Correctional Services?    Did he mention in that meeting anything about planning and budgeting?    Did he talk about the redirection of funds in thatmeeting?    Thank you Mr Bloem.  You wished also to make some concluding remarks.  May he make then Chair?    You do so in paragraph 19 of your statement.    Thank you Chair.    As foreshadowed may we adjourn now.  There are fourother witnesses who need to be called.    In order to wrap up at least for the present, this phase of evidence.    The four witnesses can conveniently complete their evidence on Tuesday.    And the, if the Commission does not sit on Monday.    To prepare.    The necessary evidence so that it can be completed onTuesday.    And then Chair I do not know if you wish me to mention the rest of the week or whether you wish to do so.    Yes, Chair.    As you please Chair.    Well it is up to you Chair.  It was only a hint Chair.    Yes, we may not finish on Tuesday.    And therefore Wednesday we keep in reserve.    Chair I was thinking of the later part of the week.    Thank you Chair. 
MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM:  Dennis Victor Bloem.    Not at all.    Yes.     So help me God.MR DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM   Thank you Chairperson.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chairperson I am an adult male.  Since 2009 I am a serving member of the Congress of the People Party.  I lived in Pretoria.  [Intervenes].    Yes.  I, thank you very much Chair.  I am, I am married with children.  In 1994 I went to Parliament.  I was elected and represented the African National Congress as a member.  I first served in the senate, the then senate from 1994 to 1996.  Then in 1996 when the Constitution was changed it was then called the National Council of Provinces.  I was then shifted to the National Assembly and since then up until 200-, 2014 I served in the National Assembly as a member.    I served in the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services since 1994.  From the senate then I went to the National Assembly.  I servedin that Committee, but I also served in various other Portfolio Committees.    In 2004 I was elected as the Chairperson of the    Chairperson when I was following this Commission when Mr Angelo Agrizzi was testifying I said I must come to the Commission, because what Mr Agrizzi was saying I know for a fact that is what has happened in the Correctional Services Committee.  I am saying that as far as Correctional Services issues are concerned what Mr Agrizzi has testified that is why I am sitting here today.    I will give my full support to the investigators, to the Committee, to the Commission, because there is a lot that is still outstanding from this affidavit of mine.    In each and every term when members are elected and are sworn in, in Parliament Portfolio Committees and standing committees are being established there and to, to perform oversight on the work of the different departments. Each and every department is having its own Portfolio Committee or standing committee to do oversight on that entity or that department.    That is correct.    Sorry.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Page 12.  Yes.    That is correct, yes.    It is correct, yes Chair.    Yes, Chair.  I think it is two, two small corrections.    On page 6, 8.3 the last line.    Where it says contract to Operations.  It must beBosasa.    It starts with the DCS, 8.3 Chair.    The last, ja Chair.    Yes, yes.    It is 15, where it starts with Winnie.  Winnie replied, it starts there and then the last line.    It is page 10 Chairperson.    It starts from nine Chair at the bottom.    Winnie, Winnie replied.CHAIRPERSON   Ja.    Then the spelling of Nyuku, Nyuku.    Nyuku, Nyuku.    Ja, kenyuku Chair.    Yes.    Nyuku.    Chairperson that is; that is the only two.    Corrections.    Ja.  Chairperson the Portfolio Committees play a, must play a very important role when it comes to oversight.  That is the first one.  Then the budget of each and every department the oversight and the approval and scrutiny of the Portfolio Committee comes into play.  If the Portfolio Committee is not doing that.  Thenthere is no Portfolio Committee for that department.  So the Portfolio Committee plays a very important role oversight the budget, to approve the budget.    Chairperson the constitution of the country is saying that Parliament is doing oversight.  The executive must report to Parliament.    So in other words.    Is having power.    To call the Minister.    At any time.    Ja, to come and account.    Of the department.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Not, ja.    The Portfolio.    That is correct, ja.    Chairperson the powers of the Portfolio Committee isto approve budgets.  If the Portfolio Committee is not happy about anything the Portfolio Committee can vote against the budget of the department.    And not approve.    That budget.    That is the power.    Because the, the, the Portfolio, the departmentdepends on the, the Portfolio Committee.    It is a very serious power.    That the Portfolio Committee is having.    You are, you are 100 percent correct.CHAIRPERSON   Chair.    The first you, you go to the Minister.    And then after that after that you can go to the agencies.    And report.    Criminal activities.    Ja.CHAIRPERSON   That that is right.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes.  Each and every report goes to Parliament to the,to the Assembly.  Each and every report.    Must go to the Assembly.    To be approved or be rejected.CHAIRPERSON   100 percent correct Cahir.    We have done it.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Manier times, all the time.    Chair.    Yes, Chair.    No.  Chair we as, as the, as the Portfolio, any Portfolio Committee the scope that we are doing is that we can call any person.  For instanceChair when I was still the Chairperson of the Committee I called the Criminal Justice Cluster to, to the Portfolio Committee.  We visited different provinces and called this entity.  When we were dealing with the overcrowding problem in South Africa, in prisons.  So we called the police.  We called Magistrates.  We called the NPA, everybody that that, that stakeholders we called them.  So it is not only the Department of Correctional Services.    100 percent correct.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chair.    Yes, Chair.  It was Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons that were doing also oversight.  The treatment and, and so on, the care of inmates in prisons.  We, they also reported to the Portfolio Committee.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I must explain this, this when Portfolio Committees are being constituted it is multiparty committees consisting of all, all the parties represented in Parliament.  Now on this Committee it was myself as the Chairperson and then Cindy Chikunga who is now a Deputy Minister of Transport, Cindy.  Cele, it is not Bheki Cele.  This is another Cele.  Then it is Sam Mahote.  Then Winnie Ngwenya.  Then the late Reverend Bishop Tolo.  Then Inkosi Xolo.  Then Mr James Selfe.  He was from the DA.  Then Ms Sybil Seaton who was from the IFP. Then Mr Cupido who was from the ACDP and then Ms Rajbally who was from the Minority Front.  That was the composition of the Committee.    That is correct.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chair.    Chair we had more than 137 Committee Meetings and that, this 137 Committee Meetings was only there in Parliament, but we also have meetings outside of Parliament.    The, the purpose was to interact with the officials of the department.  I am talking now here about the foot soldiers of the department, the conditions of our prisons, looking at nutrition, looking at treatment of the, the inmates and so on.  That is a, there are a lot of other things that we are looking, but oversight that is what, why we are going to, in these prisons.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   This, this body was set up by the President to also, to do oversight in prisons when it comes to treatment of the inmates.  Inmates can complain to this body.  It is an independent body of, of, of, of the Correctional Services.    It is a headed by a Judge.    It first started with, if I am not wrong,President Mandela.    President Mandela then President Thabo Mbeki.  Ja, but it, it went on, ja.    Chair in each and every meeting of Parliament there are recordings, electronic recordings.  There are also handwritten minutes by our Committee Secretary.    That is correct Chair.    [Intervenes].ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chairperson I can say with without any doubt this was the best committee in Parliament during that time.  We were working in the interest of the country.  When it comes to political affiliation it was not in this committee.  We were working as a unit there.  If people from different parties were having problems or concerns they will come to me and we will solve that problem, but there was Mr Selfe, Ms Seaton, Rajbally, Mr Cupido was from the opposition, but I can tell you up until today I am still having that relationship with them.    Correct.  Yes, Chair.    Chairperson we had serious problems when it comes to the committee, the Department of Correctional Services, the leadership of the Department of Correctional Services the top leadership.  Not with the other, the ordinary members of the, of the department.    Let me, let me be specific.    The, the Commissioner.CHAIRPERSON   And his, his, his top structure.    Ja.    Ja.    Chairperson I, let me, let me be very clear.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    Chairperson I will not put the years, but I can tell you.    About the Commissioners.CHAIRPERSON   Linda Mti was the Commissioner at that time.    Then Vernie Petersen.    Took over.    From, from him.    And then after that it was Tom Moyane.    Who was the Chair.    The Minister was Ngconde Balfour Chair.    Chairperson.    What I am saying here.    Chairperson this was clearly undermining the authority    Chairperson there was a, a breakdown of the relationship between the committee and when I am saying here DCS Executive Authority I am, I am referring to the Minister of Correctional Services.    There was a breakdown in the relationship between the committee and him.  When Mr Vernie Petersen the Commissioner then the late Mr Petersen was redeployed to Sports and Recreational we were not informed.  Wealso learnt this redeployment from the media.  We were not taken into consideration about his re and the reasons why he was redeployed to another department.    Mr Petersen came into the department in 2007 and 08 he was gone.    That is correct.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chairperson anyone in this country can attest what I am saying.  It was the best National Commissioner in the department.    Mr Petersen was a corruption buster.  Mr Petersen hated corruption with all his heart.  He was a straightforward person.    That is correct.  Yes, Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Not at all Chair.    In, in that year when Mr Petersen was there.    We, we, in the first place we were very surprised.  The second it was a blow to the Department of Correctional Services and the committee.    Linda Mti.  He, he came after Linda Mti Chairperson.    Chairperson there was only havoc in the Department of Correctional Services.  Nothing else.  I cannot describe it any better, because I was doing the oversight work on the department.    It was Mr Tom Monyane.    Chairperson in the first place this thing of Bosasa washampering the functioning of the Department of Correctional Services.  There was no control.  There was no discipline in the Department of Correctional Services.  To mention Chair I had a very good working relationship with POPCRU.    And they themselves were unhappy with what had happened.    The staff Chair there was all the time protest marches.    People were unhappy in the Department ofCorrectional Services.    Chairperson it was only qualified audit reports and.    Year in year out.    It was; that is why I described it as havoc.CHAIRPERSON   Year in year out.  There was no control at all.    It was very weak.  There was, there was no control atall Chairperson.    Chair it was flooded.  There was nothing that was, they had not done anything according to the book.  It was a free for all that was happening in the department.    Chairperson this thing did not only start in 2004.CHAIRPERSON   As I have said I started in this committee in 1994 already.    That is correct Chair.    That is right Chair.    Chairperson there was, before Linda Mti there was aCommissioner Khulekani Sithole.    Havoc.  There was, this thing Chairperson.    If the investigators can go back.    And check.    What has happened.    Than this Bosasa.    In relation to corruption Chair.  They will find more damning.    Things than this Bosasa issue.    Under the leadership of Khulekani Sithole.CHAIRPERSON   Chairperson the only person who had tried to bring Correctional Services back in line was the late Vernie Petersen.  All these others no, Chairperson.  They have not.  It is only Vernie Peterson.    Chairperson I am addressing it in my affidavit that, but let me answer it.    Ja, I, I.    Yes.    Chairperson we as a committee raised manyobjections and many concerns to then Minister.  When I, I am talking about when I was the Chairperson.    The Chair, the Minister was Ngconde Balfour.  I raised    And him.    Talking about these problems.    And it was never addressed.    Chairperson his attitude was no, let us leave thedepartment to sort out those problems.  Let us not interfere in the operations of the Department of Correctional Services.  That was his attitude.    Chairperson even that.    He, he, he will come to the committee with Linda Mti.  We will raise it.  I am saying Chair we are having minutes.    Recordings.    It is not a thing that I am just raising it.    It is there.CHAIRPERSON   We have raised it many a times.    Nothing Chair, nothing.    Yes, Chair.    Yes, Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes, Chair.    Chairperson there in Parliament there is structures called study groups.    Study groups consists of members of the differentparties.    The ANC.    Was having its own study group.    And the Minister is supposed to be part of the study group.    In that, those study groups we raised these things.  Weeven invited the Chief Whip of the, the majority party.    Our Chief Whip.    To such meetings study group meetings.  Not Portfolio Committee meetings.    Where ANC members are alone.    And private.CHAIRPERSON   We raised these issues Chairperson.    In, in; so people were aware.    Chairperson the only thing that was said in such meetings, comrades you must work together.  Do not fight, because this is an ANC Government.  Do not fight comrades.  That is all and then it will, the Chief Whip will say I will look into this matter.  That is all Chair.    Chairperson when we were now aware that our authority is being undermined.  Twice we, we, we decided as a committee to reject and not to approve the budget of the Portfolio Committee.    The budget for Correctional Services.    I was called Chairperson to the Chief Whip’s office.    Twice Chair, I was called.CHAIRPERSON   Hm.    Mbulelo Goniwe, Mbulelo Goniwe.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.    Exactly Chairperson, correct.  Chairperson let me, let me say this to the, deputy, the, the now from Former President Kgalema Motlanthe was the Secretary General of the ANC.  Now deployment in the ANC is being made from Luthuli House to say this one will be Chairperson and what and what, what.  Many times people were going to complain to Kgalema Motlanthe.  I am having respect forthat man up until today.  Kgalema Motlanthe was asking them, they wanted to remove me as the Chairperson.    Kgalema Motlanthe was asking them but are you saying that the opposition must ask these tough questions that Dennis Bloem is askingour member.  Must we, must we now defend these things.  He was, he was saying that I am not going to agree with you because this is exactly the work of the Oversight Committee, the Portfolio Committee to keep the Minister and the department to account.  He rejected it.  Not once, not once he rejected it to say no.  This man is doing his work.  He is representing the ANC very good.    Chairperson I was being labelled as an opposition in the ANC, because I was asking these questions and doing my work.  Up until todayChair I am doing my work.  When, when I am given, being given a task I will do exactly you or anybody is, is giving me to do.  I will do it.    Yes.    Yes, Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes, Chair.    Ja.    Ja.    That is correct Chair we have.  We have opposed it.    Chairperson in the first place as I have said before we, we, we have not seen why it is necessary to outsource these functions of Correctional Services.  That is why we have opposed it and the procedures that were followed also contributed to our opposition.    That is; that is correct Chair.    Ja.    No, Chair.    Why, why; we have, we have asked these type ofquestions.  Why is it necessary to outsource but I will, I will go into detail when it comes to the, the, the nutrition issue Chair.    Ja, Chair.    Yes.    We have asked for documentation and reports on that.    Not at all Chair, nothing.    Chairperson we have asked this question why is it necessary to put television sets in prisons.  Even when we were doing oversight even in single cells there were television sets in, in, in single cells, in single cells.  We have asked and we have objected to this thing to say no, this is not a priority.  Please do not do it, but they, they just ignored us and they went us.    Ja.    Alright, alright Chairperson.    Correct Chairperson it was raised.    Chairperson the, the, the explanation and the briefing that they gave to us including the Minister was for development and training of inmates.  They were saying to us that they going to roll out educational programs for the inmateson these television sets.  Up until today there is no such thing Chairperson, up until today there is no such thing.    Chairperson on, on, on which one?    Yes on [intervenes].    Ja.  It was 237 million.  No, the, the, the televisioninstallation was R224 million that was spent on the television sets.    Chairperson Mr Vernie Petersen in the Committee said to us that he raised concerns in the Committee to say that this thing is not cost effective.  He, he was saying that he will never agree with the outsourcing of anything in Correctional Services.  That was Mr Vernie Petersen in the Committee.  I am sayingChairperson there are minutes of, of those meetings where Mr Petersen has raised objections.    Yes.    Chairperson let me come to the catering one.    Oh, okay.    Yes.    Chairperson this catering tender was just moneylaundering, a money laundering scheme.  The, Bosasa have said they are going to take over the kitchens and do the cooking and prepare food.  It was a blue lie.  The inmates were still doing the cooking and it was business as usual.  Chairperson I am talking out of experience.  I visited these prisons.  The inmates were still cooking.  Sondolo had one office in the middle of the kitchen.  One official, one, one of their people were sitting there in that office and they were just taking the money, Sondolo.  They were not actually doing the job.  Chairperson there was no labour.  There was no labour from Bosasa.  It was the inmates that have cooked that have prepared food that have dished out for the inmates.  I am saying Chairperson I am speaking out of experience.  I visited    That is so.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chairperson.CHAIRPERSON   Chairperson we asked that very same question in the Committee.  Up until today we never got an, an answer.  Who was supplying the food in the kitchens, but we know Chairperson that Correctional Services is, was having and is still having farms.  There are farms for meat.  There are farms for vegetables.  There are farms for chickens all over the country Chairperson.  They are having farms to grow these, this food.  So I, we have asked this question.  Vernie Petersen has asked thisquestion.  He has raised it to say, but we are having our own farms.  Why is it that you are outsourcing now these things?    Correct Chairperson.  It was the food from Correctional Services.    For 20 years Chair.CHAIRPERSON   20 years.    Yes, Chair.    Chairperson I can answer it.  We as the PortfolioCommittee, I myself as the Chairperson 2004 to 2009, I raised it personally with Minister Balfour one, one on one.  It is not a thing that even in the Committee even in study groups we raised it.  So it is not a question that people were not aware of this thing.    Yes, Chair.    No, Chairperson.  After 2009.    Then I resigned from the ANC.    And joined the Congress of the People.CHAIRPERSON   Then I went back to Parliament.    I, I then served again on the Portfolio Committee.    That is why I am saying it 20 years.    From 1994?    2009 I shifted.    To Cope.CHAIRPERSON   And I continued.    To serve on the Committee.    So I know.    Very well.    What is going on.CHAIRPERSON   Chairperson I cannot say now.    I cannot say it now.    Yes, but I am saying.    Up until 2014.    It was the position.CHAIRPERSON   Chairperson the only thing that they Bosasa were doing is to give these inmates a certificate at the end of the year saying that he istrained, but the inmates were doing the work.  I do not have any doubt, I do not, I do not take chances Chair.  I am saying.    I know what I am talking about.    I was there Chair.    Correct Chair.  There will not be any disruption.    In, in, in prison.    Nothing.    Chairperson it was close to a billion or maybe more than a billion rand, these tenders that the department gave to Bosasa, one billion at that time and can I add something Chair?    You see it is only seven, seven, seven prison, prisons that was identified, those big prisons for this catering business.  Not all the, the prisons the 241 prisons.    We have 241 prisons.CHAIRPERSON   Not, it is only seven and I have listed it here Chair.    Chair it was only seven and then later on they rolled it out to other prisons, but not all the prisons in the country.    Yes, but that rollout was also a question of now this, this amount that they have went up.  It, it, it went up with R89 million, 89.    Plus this amount.CHAIRPERSON   Ja, but not all the prisons.  They targeted only the big prisons.    For this project.CHAIRPERSON   Yes, yes.    That is correct, ja.    Ja.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   It was R240 million per, per year.  Chair it was a, a three year cycle.  Each and every year this amount will be paid, 240 this year, 240 and 240.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    It was raised not, not once.  Many a times Chairperson.    No, it was never addressed Chairperson.  It was never addressed.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    That is correct, yes.    We were not satisfied Chair with the extension of this thing.  If the Chairperson will allow me to say what the Commissioner then Vernie Petersen had said in that meeting.  That that was a meeting on    Chairperson.    Sorry, sorry Chair.    Ja.    Ja.CHAIRPERSON   No, we can; Chair, we can deal with this one.    As well, ja.    Ja.    Chair in a Portfolio Committee meeting Mr Petersen raised concerns.  He was saying poor planning and budgeting in the Department of [indistinct] millions of Rands has been wasted on a catering contract and buying of TV sets.  He then accused the department the officials some officials in the department to say these officials of re he accused some of the, the, his officials of redirecting money intending for certain projects to secure lucrative food contracts and TVs at the huge cost of the department.  That is what Mr Petersen had said.  It is in the minutes Chair.  It is there.  Mr Petersen was totally against this outsourcing.    Chair we asked the Minister what is the reason.  He said no, it is Mr Petersen’s skills is being needed in another department full stop.  That was his, his, his, his, his answer to us.    Ja.    No not, no, no tender process.    Ja.  Ms Moodley was part of the executive in the Head Office in Correctional Services, but Ms Moodley was not that senior person, but then when they came to the Portfolio Committee to answer now these extensions they used Ms Moodley to answer this question and not Mr Gillingham, but Mr Gillingham was theCFO.  So they have just used Ms Moodley to cover up for that thing.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja.  In, in this meeting Chair we asked whether afeasibility study had been done to establish if outsourcing; that is the point that I have made before.  Where in this meeting we have asked and the period was the, the Public Finance Management Act followed.  It was not.    That is correct.  That is correct.    Chair we asked these questions.  We never, we nevergot any answer.    Yes Chair.  We asked.    They were telling us that this seven big prisons in the country they, they are having a problem when it comes to dishing out food and preparing food.  That is why they must outsource it to a private company.    That is correct.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   That is correct.  There was an undertaking.    Up until today no, Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   It was simply ignored Chairperson.    Nothing Chair, nothing.    It was awarded to Bosasa.    Again.    Chairperson they never, never ever came back to giveus any, any explanation.    We only saw it in the media that the contract was again extended.    100 percent correct Chairperson.  100 percent correct.    Chairperson you see my hair is grey now.    Yes.    Yes, Chair.    Yes.    Yes.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Other contracts as well Chairperson.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  We raised concerns and objections to these contracts.    Not at all Chair.    They were ignored, completely ignored Chairperson.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chairperson the Speaker, it was, no it was Max Sisulu.  It was Mr Max Sisulu.    He was well aware of this, because Chair the Chairperson of the ANC caucus.    It is where all the member of the ANC every Thursday.CHAIRPERSON   We are meeting.    We even raised these problems to the Chairperson of the caucus.    It was Ms Vytjie Mentor.    At that time.    to say this is and we raised it in the, it was on the agenda.    To say here is this problem.    So all the members of the ANC.    In Parliament.    Was aware of this problem.    No, no Chair, nobody.    Nobody.    Yes, Chair.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Yes, Chair.  Before I, I respond I just want to make one correction.  Ms Vytjie Mentor.    On this issue.    So in other words.    She had also attempted.    To address this.  I just want to put that.CHAIRPERSON   It is not that everybody was not.    Doing anything.    At least she.    Was doing on that.    Ms Mentor.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Nothing changed.CHAIRPERSON   Nothing has changed Chair.    Ja.  Chair.    Ja.  Chairperson, SCOPA also raised concerns about this outsourcing of Correctional Services.  They called us in a meeting, but before thatmyself personally I was, I was with the Chairperson of the Committee and the study group of SCOPA.  First with the Chairperson of SCOPA.  I think at that time it was either Vincent Smith or it was Gavin Woods the Chairperson.  It was not Godi.    Ja.  It was.    Godi came later.    It is either Vincent Smith or Gavin, Gavin Woods.    That person.    So they also raised concerns and they called us andwe had a joint meeting with them Chair.    It was formal meetings.  It was formal meetings.    Yes, correct.  I, I, not one.  Man, many a times.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Chairperson to me it was quite clear that Mr Mti, Linda Mti had the support and the protection of Minister Balfour.  That is what I have seen and what I have observed to watch this thing.  He was very protective of Linda Mti.    Chairperson many a times when both of them appear before the Portfolio Committee and we, we ask difficult questions to the Department, Mr Mti or Gillingham the Minister will interject and say he will answer such questions.  When we, I meet with him personally one by one he will tell me that no Comrade Bloemyou know this comrade is an experienced comrade.  We must not harass this comrade.  Let us, let us treat him well.  That is my conclusion.  That is my observation.  That is why I am saying that Chairperson.    That is right Chair.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   I am 24 hours available Chair.    I will cooperate.    Yes Chair, yes.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   That is correct Chair.    Chair all the documentation, all the briefingdocumentation and my personal belongings were kept in that office in Parliament.    That is correct Chair.    Chairperson my office, there was a break in, in my office and the only thing that was missing was some of the documentation.  That is the first, the first break in.  Then the second one the same thing happened, documentation was missing and I reported it to the Secretary to Parliament even to the police, but up    It was in the Parliament building, in the Parliament.    Very high security with cameras in the, in the passages, high security.    I cannot answer that question, because I reported it.  There was no follow up, no feedback.  I asked the question what happened to myoffice, no answer Chair.    Never, never, never feedback.  Nothing happened, Chair.    Ja.    Everybody knows in this country that I was very vocal on, on these issues Chairperson.  Everybody knows.    I do not know Chair.  That is why I am saying there was no feedback on the break ins, nothing.    Paragraph 30?    Ja.  Chairperson the last break in before I left Parliament as a member of the ANC and as the Chairperson my office was againransacked.  Many documents and only documents.    Were taken.    This letter or this document that Angelo Agrizzi was talking here of me being protecting and promoting white capital was part and parcel of the documents that went missing.    In that document they were swearing at me and my family and whatever in that document.  I was, I was keeping that document in my office,but during that that break in.    They took it.    My personal belongings.    Yes, very valuable things.    Were taken Chairperson.    Yes.    Ja.    That is correct, yes.    Correctional Services it is a very, very dangerous    And you, you must be very careful because something can happen to you.    So Nadira decided to, to resign.  Commissioner was also saying to us he was criticising this Bosasa contract and saying that why are you outsourcing because we are having farms.  We are producing our own food and, and, and so on.  In the meeting, where Gillingham and them were there in the meeting.  He was, he was, he was very vocal Chairperson.  That is why they have removed him from    That is what has happened in that meeting.    He lasted for a year Chair and then he was gone.    Ja, the new one, ja.    He was saying to us poor planning and budgeting inthe Department of Correctional Services is a very serious problem.  He said millions of Rands have been wasted in the tendering, catering and, and, and TV contracts.  He, Vernie Petersen and he said this thing must come to an end.  That is what he had said then in that meeting Chair.    Ja, he said that people are, are, are, are redirecting money intended for certain projects to secure lucrative food contracts and TVs.  That is what Mr Petersen the Commissioner had said.  Money is being diverted to this catering and television, because these people were hell bent Chairperson that this thing must go on the kitchen, the outsourcing of the kitchen and this thing of the television sets.  Nobody could stop them.  So Mr Petersen was talking about those things.    Chairperson a few months after this meeting he was removed.    And then he was taken to Sports.    And Recreation.CHAIRPERSON   Everybody Chairperson, all the NGOs that have worked with us.  Everybody.    Was very surprised.CHAIRPERSON   And shocked.    About his removal.    From Correctional Services.    But all of us knew that it is because of this thing.    This man fought against corruption.CHAIRPERSON   In the Department of Correctional Services.    Chairperson thank you very much.  The reason why I have decided to come to this Commission I really want to see anybody who has made him or her guilty of corruption or any other crime must be imprisoned.  They must go tojail.  Chairperson the reason why I am saying so Nelson Mandela many other leaders went to prison for a very long time.  Many people went into exile for a very long time.  Other people have paid with their lives for this freedom that we are that we are enjoying today.  We cannot allow that this thing must happen when we are still alive.  Chairperson we, we must encourage each and every person, we must rid this countryfrom this corruption that we are facing today and Chairperson I must say I am having full confidence in this Commission and I want to, to give you the assurance Chairperson that I am all the time, all the time ready to assist, but there are other people out there who know about this corruption and state capture must come forward.  Chairperson it is not only in the Department of Correctional Services.  Many other departments are also having this problem.  I am saying Chairperson that people must come forward and assist because I am doing it Chairperson to assist this country.  I do not want my children Chairperson to, to, to live a life under a corrupt society.  We must, we must save this country Chairperson and I am having full confidence in you Chairperson that you, you, you are the hope of South Africa as we speak now at this Commission. Thank you very much Chair.    Thanks.    Yes.    Yes, Chair.    Yes, Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes, Chair.    Thank you.    Thanks Chair.

DENNIS VICTOR BLOEM:  Yes Chair.    Ja.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes. Yes Chair.    Ja.    Chairperson this standing committee on public accounts are scrutinising all the departments.  The budgets, the records of each and every department.  Now SCOPA also raised questions and concerns about Department of Correctional Services.  They called the Department of Correctional Services to come and account.  They went to the head office of – in Pretoria of Correctional Services.  Nothing, nothing has happened Chair.    Chair there was many resolutions.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   It was never implemented.    That is correct Chair.    Yes the..ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   There was no implementation.    That is correct yes.    That is correct Chair.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    That is correct yes.    Chairperson we ask questions.  The first was, was there any feasibility study done to come to this conclusion?  There was not.  The department was telling us and promising us ja no we will come with the documents.  Up until todaythere was not.  All the PFMA and everything was floundered nothing – they have never ever advertised or put the tender out so that everybody must have a fair chance, no.    That feasibility study never – the document never came to    Chairperson we as the committee have said there are other urgent priorities in the department.  For instances the poor salaries of the staff because we have said pay these people better.  The other one was dedicated juvenile facilities.  Overcrowding was a serious problem.  I think up until today overcrowding is still a problem.  This thing of outsourcing was not a priority.  It was just manufactured by thedepartment.  But this a problem of salaries for the low salaries of the staff – Correctional Service Officials.  The overcrowding.  The dedicated juvenile centres was priorities because we had that problem Chair of juveniles were sitting with adults.  They were mixed in prisons.  That is why there was sodomy, there was all these bad things in    Chair in the first place we were opposed to the outsourcing of any service to – of the Department.  It was a waste of tax payers money, this outsourcing and I will come to the catering issue step by step Chair on the outsourcing.    That is correct.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   That is correct Chair.    No it was about Bosasa, the contracts Chair.  It was in that document.    I was promoting white capital.    They were saying I was promoting and I am protecting white capital.  Why I am fighting Bosasa because Bosasa is giving a lot of people work.    Chairperson I was sitting in my office doing work and oneof my committee members Ms Winnie Ngwenya came to my office and she is saying that she wants to discuss something with me.  I ask what is it all about. She said no she was sent by people.  I asked her who is this people.  She said it is the owners of Bosasa they want to meet with me.  And I said to her I am not interested.  I am doing    Ja.  And she said to me Chairperson you are playing with your luck.  You must see these people.  I said no I am not going to see this.  I am not interested in meeting these people.  Then she said to me Chairperson [foreign word].  I said Comrade Winnie I am not interested.  She is saying this is money Chair.  I said I am not going to meet with them and that was the end.  Then she went out of the office.  I never met with those people but Comrade Winnie Ngwenya they were sending Winnie to me so that we must have a meeting with them.  I refused.    Ja there is the Chairperson. The Chairperson also know it as [foreign word].      Chairperson my understanding was this Bosasa was already all over the media and what and you know there was this allegations of cars bought to Linda Mti to Gillingham.  It was in the papers it was all over.  And I said tomyself I am not going to be part of that.  Because it is public knowledge Chairperson there was these cars, there was this Volkswagen Tiguan that Mr Mti was involved in and I am saying it is allegations at that time and I did not want to get involved in this people.  Why must I meet them?  My work as a member of parliament was to do    Ja.    Chairperson my only understanding at the time was that these people wants to come near me because I was very vocal on these tenders and what.  Now they have sent one of my committee members to soften me to get to them. And I was not there in their conversation Chair but what I think they have said to her no money is not a problem we can give him.  I am saying I was not in their conversation but she said to me [foreign word].    No, no, no Chair no.    No she did not have money.    At page?ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   10 ja.    Ja.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct ja.    Chairperson I was all the time worried and concernedabout the attitude of Winnie in the meetings.  She can be very cool and calm with any other discussion but when it comes to Bosasa or Sondolo then she will become very protective, very negative towards the discussion and protect them.  Now Chairperson I know – I know that the members of the committee and I was having a very good working relationship with them, all of them but after – I was not suspecting anythingChair but after Agrizzi was now testifying about how people were bought now I am getting a clearer picture to say no but why this has happened it is because of this that is my only, only conclusion Chair that I am having now.  To say why was this person so protective and negative when it comes to this company?    Ja.    Ja.CHAIRPERSON   Ja.    Here is a chance to make money Chairperson that is my observation and my conclusion.    Ja.    Yes.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Yes, yes Chair.    Chair during this time when I was so vocal about these tenders I received many, many calls but from private phones threatening me with my life.  I have kept it – tried to keep it away from my wife, my family so that I must not affect them.  So that I must keep it away from them and I must stomach it myself.  But one day Chair unfortunately it was on a Friday I was with my wife, Friday afternoon and    No this person was telling me we are following you and we are going to finish you.  I said to this caller please come I am waiting for you and this person dropped the phone.  When he dropped the phone my wife was asking me why did you shout over the phone, I had to tell her that what happened now that this.  And so it was between me and my wife.  I ask her not to tell anybody because – let me just drink a little bit of water.  You see Chairperson because..    I was never ever scared of anything, never.  Even now that    Nobody will intimidate me.    But I do not want anybody to touch my family.    Up until now.    Because I discussed it with her.    That is what is – you see Chairperson why I kept it.  During our struggle it is not the first time that I am getting this type of things.    The security police was doing that to me all the time.  Sotelling me that they are going to kill me there outside the house and they are following me and what so I know that if I am going to go in a corner they will get me.    But I was all the time prepared.  That is why I said to this person and all the time Chairperson.    I said to these people when they called me no come.    Come I am also ready for you, please come.    I – the chief whip of the ANC will call me and warn me and reprimand me that what I am doing is wrong because this is deploys of the ANC.    And I am all the time fighting against them.  All the time Chairperson I was in the chief – if it is not because we had meetings on Tuesdays.    In the chief whip’s office to go and answer why I am so vocal?  Why I oppose this thing so much and so.  That is what has happened Chair.    Chairperson I have never ever backed down on what I    No he will say to me, you must know that you are a    You are going to follow party line.  You cannot do whatever you do.  We are going to remove you from that position.    Chairperson it was never ever the policy of the ANC.  It was never.  The ANC was the most respected party, liberation movement in the continent and in the world.  Those things that has happened was personal greed.  Theywere greedy to stop me and corruption. It was not the ANC it was not the ANC policy Chairperson.    It was never the ANC policy Chairperson and the values of the ANC.  I, Chairperson I worked with – when the late President Mandela came out of prison I served under him for five years.  President Thabo Mbeki I served underPresident Thabo Mbeki. Those people were having the values of the ANC at that time.  It was never about yourself.  It was about the people of the country.    Not only him Chairperson but all these other members of the ANC who was against what we were doing in the Portfolio Committee.    We were not following the values and the principles of the ANC.  They were not doing that.    Chair let me understand the question properly.  Are you saying the entire study group?    Yes.    Yes.    It was Chairperson it was the committee.    The entire committee.CHAIRPERSON   Ja because we were in the majority.  I will single out one or two people.    But the majority opposition and the ANC.    I can tell you Chairperson.    In the committee there were very credible ANC members.    Ja.    Chairperson I am having a personal plea.      I am having a personal plea to the committee – to the commission.      No it is fine Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    His name was – his surname was Erasmus.    Chairperson if the committee can call him as well.  Chairperson he raised in his reports many a times objection to this tenders.    Ja and he was raising those things all the time.    He is from the Western Cape high court.    Yes it is Judge Erasmus ja.CHAIRPERSON   Exactly.  Exactly Chairperson.  And according to me he is an honourable person.  He will give information to the commission.    He called me Chairperson.    And he said Judge Erasmus said to me Mr Bloem I am giving you full permission to tell the commission that I am prepared to contribute and help this commission with information.    So he is prepared.
