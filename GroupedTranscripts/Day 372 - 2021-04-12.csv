CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Yes I got your message that Mr Singh’s counsel indicated that they might be a few minutes late.    But I see that it is sixteen minutes past ten and they are still not here.    Any affidavit they have for this morning obviously will not be used this morning.    And it could have been dealt with later. So – so it is really – it was not a few minutes.    Ja.  So the – the further fifteen minutes or so was from what time when you called them and they said that?    Two minutes ago?    So that will take us beyond half past.    Hm.  Ja that is quite late.  I am going to adjourn just a pity that we are losing a whole thirty minutes.  I will – I will adjourn again and come back at half past.   We adjourn.    I see that Mr Singh and his counsel are still not here.  Ja this is unacceptable. This is completely unacceptable.  The commission does not have time      We are working into the evenings, we working weekends to try and make sure we can finish in time.  We cannot afford to lose time like this.  I am going to adjourn.  I hope that whatever affidavit they prepared – I am going to adjourn until half past eleven.  I would like you to get a chance to read whatever affidavit they have prepared so that if possible that can be used today as well because we – we are losing time.    I am going to adjourn and will return at half past eleven.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    I see Counsel for Mr Singh and Mr Singh are here now.    Yes.  I am sure Counsel for Mr Singh would like to say something.    Good morning.    Hm.   No, no that is fine you have given me a full explanation in chambers.    That is fine.  Okay alright let us start then and let us try and increase the pace.    Yes.    Okay alright please administer the oath or affirmation to Mr Singh again.    Yes.    Mr Seleka will see how – whether he is – itis accords with his plan to do so but of course if there were things that needed clarification last time at some stage or another they need – the clarification should be given.    And you had a chance to look at the affidavit?    Hm.  You have not had a chance to look atthe annexures?    Oh some of them.    Ja. Ja.    Well I …    Ja.      Ja you sent me just the affidavit Whatsapp – on Whatsapp and I had a superficial look.  So I think that the important thing is whether it is going to be fruitful to ask him questions on these matters before you have read the annexures. If – if it will be manageable that is fine but I have not …    I have not read the – I have seen some parts of the affidavit I have not read it.    So of course we can – you could continue on the way you had planned and if Mr Singh in responding to those questions uses information that is in the affidavit that is fine.    And – but later on when you have had a chance to look at the annexures and everything.    And when I have had a chance we might revisit the issues.    Ja.  So I think let us carry on on thatbasis.    I think when – I think when he answers he can answer using the information that is in the affidavit.    But since we have not had…    Read it there might be difficulties if he isgoing to refer in detail.    To annexures.  So maybe he can use the knowledge that he has and say that some of the things are dealt with in certain annexures at a later stage when we have all had a chance to read the affidavit and annexures.    We can go back and then he can supplement his answers by referring in detail if he wishes to the annexures.    Okay.    I have got Bundle 16.    I do not want to forget this Mr Seleka.    It relates to Eskom but not to Mr Singh.  I wanted to look for something in Mr Marokane’s affidavit forwhether we can – I could only see the supplementary affidavit or second not the first.  Apparently when my Registrar mentioned the name to you – you…    You could not remember.    But maybe I did not pronounce it correctly when I spoke to her but I thought I had because I subsequently checked the spelling and I thought I got it right.    You know which affidavit I am talking about?    Yes well I do not know.    He – I do not know his first name I just know the surname.    So if you can indicate to her where she will find that.    Ja.     Okay alright.    Remember to just tell us Mr Seleka whose affidavit you are …    Referring to at 702.221.    Dr Weiss.    Oh this one is still his?    Okay.   Okay.    Okay give it to me.    Not actually but I did hear that I am checking something else.  You can continue I have got 220.    Well they are important –3.  Says McKinsey never paid money to Trillian.    And says  4. Or McKinsey never authorised payment to Trillian by Eskom.  Then 5.   5. Any payments that were made by Eskom to Trillian or paid after McKinsey had informed Eskom of the fact that Trillian had failed its due diligence requirements. 6. McKinsey has found no evidence to suggest that any of its personnel were involved in corrupt activities with any employees of Trillian.” I just thought 3, 4 – 3, 4 and 5.    Appear to be quite important in the light of the issues.    Well Mr Seleka be careful not to have a situation where you have read to Mr Singh a number of things.    And when you ask him to comment he cannot remember a lot of things so I think you need to…    Break it into manageable portions.    Ja okay alright.    Okay that is fine.  Okay alright.    And as – as you prepare to do that Mr Singh I just want you to be aware that last time and I think the occasion for last time we dealt with the issue of whether it was Regiments who had the sub-contract with McKinsey or Trillian or both and the question of who rendered the services was it Trillian or Regiments and the question of whether Eskom should have paid Trillian direct.  So I do not want us to repeat the same thing but I do believe that Mr Seleka was right to draw your attention to the portions of affidavits that he has done so.  So as you respond just bear in mind that I know what you – what your version was that you have said or if you do not intend changing it then you just want to add or clarify it is enough.  You do not need to – go into details about that.   Yes.    Yes.    No, no that is fine.  Your counsel didexplain to me in chambers.  It is just that the way it happens was not good but as I have said your counsel has explained everything to me and…    Ja. MR    Ja okay alright.    Not form part of?    Oh is that so?    Oh.    Is that so?    But have you had a chance to read them subsequent to the 3.3 Notice that did not include them or you have not had a chance to read them?   Oh so your only chance to look at them was now?     H’m, h’m.     Oh, sorry.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay.  No.  Mr Seleka.    H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.    I do remember that there was a request to ...[intervenes]      ...an affidavit of Dr Weiss.  It is just that I do not know whether he has provided one affidavit or more one affidavit.     But I do recall that there was referenceto at least an affidavit of Dr Weiss.     If you say to me this is the only affidavit, then it means it was this one?     By the Money Flows?     Ja.     Yes.     But the – but your real answer to the concern ...[intervenes]      ...is that Dr Weiss’ affidavit to which youhave referred know has been in the bundle that was given to Mr Singh quite some time back. ADV SELEKA     Before his first appearance?     In the Eskom matters?     Yes.  Counsel for Mr Singh, do you accept that?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Ja, okay.  No, that is fine.  As I understand it, Mr Singh, Dr Weiss’ affidavit was included inthe bundle that was given to you before you came to testify in the Eskom work stream the last time for – I mean, for the first time.  And if that is so, it would seem that there has been enough time for you to familiarise yourself with it.   And from what Mr Seleka says, it does look like you did look at it and you did not think there was anything implicating you.  And you may be right about that but what     H’m.     Relating to?     H’m?     H’m?     Well, but I thought you said it does not implicate you?     Yes.       As I understand it, which is not redacted, was part of the bundle that was given to you a long time ago.     Okay, no, no, no.  I understand that,yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.  Well, but I think the bottom line is.  As far as these particular paragraphs that Mr Seleka has referred you to.  As I understand the position is.  They might not be implicating you.  All he is doing is.  You have been given certain version and here is somebody else who might be talking not having you in mind but says something that might be contradictory to what you want to say.  In fairness, he wants to give you a chance to     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Okay.     No, no that is fine.  Ja.     Do you want us to go to what page, 220, or what now?       692 first?  Yes, okay.  Yes, you may continue.     Alright, alright ...[intervenes]      Ja, the ...[intervenes]      I think there would be a normal word for it.  A break-away.  [laughs]      There was to be a break-away from Regiments.     Ja.     Regiments and Trillian people..?     Ja.     H’m.     But of course ...[intervenes]      No, before you proceed.     I just want to say.  Depending on whether you accept his evidence that Trillian never had a subcontract with McKinsey.  Your answer that you gave might not be so important.     Yes.  Yes, but in his affidavit, in that – in the passages that Mr Seleka read earlier on, if I recall correctly.  It is just that I was reading other passageswhereas he might not have read.  So I may be mistaken but he does say somewhere that...  No, actually, the – one of the passages that he read where I even read more of the paragraphs, he does say that Trillian never had any contract with McKinsey.       So I am saying, if that – if you accept that and I do not know if you do accept it.  If you accept it, it may be that the fact that they may have or certain people who were with Regiments or Trillian attended meetings, theweight one attaches to that, it might be different if compared to a situation where there was a contract.So, in other words, if the contract was only with Regiments, whatever that personnel may have been doing, they may have been doing for Regiments and not Trillian if Trillian had no subcontractors with McKinsey.       Oh, okay.       Not Dr Weiss ...[intervenes]      Okay, that is fine.  That is fine.     Not definitive?     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     You want your counsel to assist – to remind you?     Oh.     Are you referring to your affidavit that is on page 591 of Bundle 16, Mr Singh?     Okay.  You are looking for a paragraph that says what so we can assist you if we see it.     Paragraph 15?     No, that is fine.       You want to indicate what you are looking for?     An email from who to who?     Oh.     That relates to the letter from McKinsey ...[intervenes]      ...that talked about Trillian?     Mr Seleka, are you able to assist him?  And his counsel can indicate if she is able to say where we find those emails.     Or what we can do is.  We can deal with other matters and then later on ...[intervenes]      Yes, okay.     Okay.     Okay, h’m.     Are you done with Dr Weiss?     You will come back?     Okay alright.  That is fine.     Mr Seleka?     Ja.     Ja-no, it is fine.     No, that is fine.     Yes, you have a chance to look at those emails and then come back.     Go back to Bundle 14, is that right?     What page?     Ja.     I have got it.     Yes, I am there.    Ja?     Yes.     At the request of both?     Yes.    And was the request then granted?     It will be checked?     Okay.     You are reading now from page 702.221.  What paragraph?     Oh, at 222.  Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     H’m?     H’m?     H’m.     Ja.     Yes.     And I am not sure that, Mr Seleka, an internal legal advisor would give advice to an attorney-client privilege.     [laughs]  Ja, I mean an internal legal advisor is just an employee.      Ja.     Yes.  So they might have to produce those – that – those communications they did not produce because they sought to – they sought cover under attorney-client privilege.    H’m.     Yes.     Yes.  Well, that must be pursued Mr Seleka.     It has not been pursued, ja.    H’m.  Yes, Mr Singh.     I am sorry.  It is just – ja, I have got something with regard to my - no, but I think something to be dealt with outside the hearing.  Okay alright.  Continue.       So it seems to have been – before it was sent to Eskom you say it seems that it was subjected to quite some detailed scrutiny within McKinsey and Trillian.    Yes.     Well, speaking generally, there ought to be no problem with placing reliance on a letter that comes from – that genuinely comes from McKinsey but two things that I want to clarify.  One, as I recall that letter, it did notspecify certain conditions which, as I recall from last time we were dealing with that letter, would have had to have been met before any payment could have been made to Trillian and where they met.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Which bundle or what page is the letter if you are able to…?     Yes, it helps if we know the bundle.     Okay, alright.    I think my registrar already has bundle 16.  16, is that correct?     If it does appear there as counsel indicated then we can use that one.     Yes, I have got the letter at Eskom bundle 16 page 697, the letter from McKinsey and Company and it is addressed to Prish Govender at Eskom.      Yes.  Okay, alright.  And then the next question would be, when Eskom made the payment to Trillian, had these conditions been satisfied?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes okay, deal with that and then come to this.     I do not think that you necessarily need to misrepresent anything but when you say at material times that that might widen.     Ja.     Let me mention this and then we can hear how you deal with it.  That last sentence in the first paragraph of the letter suggests two things.  One, that McKinsey at the time of the writing of this letter had already subcontracted a portion of the services to Trillian.  That is one.But two, but that the services were yet to be performed under the agreement.  That might be a certain interpretation, maybe somebody else might interpret that sentence differently but my first impression was it looks like they are saying we have already subcontracted to Trillian but that is for services to be performed in the future but maybe what they meant is, at the time ofsubcontracting, the services were to be performed, but maybe they had already been performed by the 9 t h, I am not sure.  I just want you to deal with those things.     Okay, okay.     Yes, yes.      Ja, okay, okay.  Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     Oh yes, yes.  Ja.    It is – we will put everything into the basket, into the pot and see what we come out with, ja.     Maybe let us not go back to it.     Let us leave it at this that everything must be put into the pot to see what the real picture is, what you have said, the passages that you read in the affidavit and what Mr Seleka referred to, everything will be looked at to see exactly what picture emerges.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, no, I understand what you say, I understand what you say.     The conditions.     Eskom.     So your short answer is you have no personal knowledge whether or not these conditions were complied – had been complied with by the time Eskom paid the money to Trillian.     Ja.     No in this case meaning yes to my question.     I said is your short answer that you have no personal knowledge of whether these conditions had been met by the time Eskom …[intervenes]     Ja, okay, it is yes.  Ja, you know, no and yes can confuse.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     Ja, well if you think it is important you can.     Take it that we do not – we will not be going back to this letter of the 9 t h any time soon?     So this can go.  702.191?    Yes?     I am sorry, you have moved from page 702.191 now?    You referred us to page 702.191, Mr Seleka, paragraph 7.     Ja, what was the point about paragraph 7?     Ja, tell us what he says there, MrSeleka?     Do you want to say anything, Mr Singh?     Yes.    Well Mr Seleka there may be different points that need to be looked into with regard to the Corporate Plan, Trillian, Regiments, McKinsey, Eskom and the payment that was made but on the face of it if McKinsey gave Eskom a letter that said you may pay oursub-contractor, Trillian, directly on the face of it Trillian can’t say McKinsey – I mean Eskom should not have paid except insofar as they say we did say Eskom could pay Trillian directly but we said if certain conditions were met and Eskom was  not supposed to pay Trillian directly those conditions were not met, so that – the latter point I understand.      So I think that to the extent that there may be the question of – to the extent that the letter of 9February may be seen as relevant to the question whether Eskom should have paid Trillian directly, even assuming Trillian was McKinsey’s sub-contractor the real question, it seems to me, would be whether Eskom ensured that the conditions that McKinsey said should be met before Eskom could pay Trillian directly were met.So that is – that is how I see, if there are other points one can take it from there.   You have indicated that you don’t have personal knowledge of whether those conditions were met or not by the time Eskom made the payment.   Maybe somebody else would tell us whether they were met.      Ja.    Yes?    Oh, the question is you made the point earlier when you gave the background or the context of the letter of demand, that Eskom and Trillian asked McKinsey to provide the letter, as I recall what you said, and Mr Seleka’s question is why did Eskom ask for the letter?      H’m, h’m, yes, well I – Mr Seleka you can look at it and then pursue what you believe needs to be pursued.  On the face of it I would imagine that if Eskom did not have a contract with Trillian and Trillian was supposed to have been McKinsey’s sub-contractor Trillian should look to McKinsey for payment and not to Eskom, and if Trillian approached Eskom to say please pay us directly Eskom if it was thinking about agreeing to that first would have been acting prudently to say the least, let ussee whether McKinsey, with whom we have a contract, has any problem with that, in which case we would like to have something in writing so when one looks at it in that way one can understand but it may well be, and you would know better, it may well be that there are other issues that you want to explore in relation to that first, so I just mention that.     Ja, but we should take the lunch adjournment now, I just want to say I am keen for us to move away from the Corporate Plan.     We have already spent a lot of time last time on it, but obviously if there are passages and affidavits that are important or documents and so on it maybe important that at least we place on record which documents or which paragraphs and which affidavits I must have regard to when I come to deal with this matter, so that I can go to those documents, go to those passages in – when I consider the matter.     So I am just saying I am keen that we move away to go and deal with other matters but if when we come back somebody feels strongly that there is something that needs to be mentioned other than sayingChairperson when you deal with this matter please remember to look at that paragraph and that affidavit and that document, then let me know, otherwise in the afternoon we could just do that exercise and move on to something else. Okay, alright.     We will adjourn now, it is ten past one, we will resume at ten past two.     We adjourn.     Okay, let us continue.    Yes, ja.     Yes.     Okay, alright is there a particular page in the transcript where we will find Dr Weiss answer that you have just told me about, if that could be mentioned on record so one can know where to find it in due course.     Yes, that is right.    Yes.      Okay, no that is fine.      11 of December of 2020?     Okay, no, that is fine.      Paragraph 9 of the bundle B or C?     Page number?     390?    Six, nine, zero?     Yes.     Just Say that again?     So the MSA, would be like an instrument that would broadly regulate the relationship between the two.    And then there would be under a specific agreement relating to specific matters.     Went that way.     Okay.     Ja, okay.     Yes, as long as you do not feel that that is unfair on your part.     That is fine.     Okay, no that is fine.     Yes, okay.     Just to remind me when you say that is that reliance on the correspondence that was exchanged?     A formal agreement?     Yes, okay alright.  I do not believe I have the affidavit in front of me as yet. So that is fine.  So, but my question, Mr Singh was this.  When you say there was an agreement whether you mean, there was already a formal agreement, as we know it, or whether you were saying there was an agreement because there was an offer, that is the clarification I was looking for.     An agreement, based on the offer andacceptance.     You mentioned the page you are looking for is it not.     743, yes I am right sir so in the same bundle…[intervene]     743, in the bundle 14 (c) that we are dealing with?     Page 743?     Okay, yes I have got it.      So this is a letter from Mr Vikas Sagar and Dr Weiss, that is from McKinsey and is addressed toMr Edwin Mabelane, chief procurement officer at Eskom     Okay, take it from there.     Ja.     You can read the relevant part, if you want to.     McKinsey’s letter of?    Ja, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Only if it is necessary for the point you wanted to make.     You say there is a contradiction.     Ja, one of them is not true, you say?     So the point you are making is there is talk of a termination mid-year 2016.    But in terms of Dr Weiss’s affidavits he said he signed the agreement late in the year.     But backdated it because he believed that is what Eskom preferred, is that right?     Yes.     No, no, I think I understood you, yourpoint clearly, ja.  You sought to say, how could he be signing the agreement in October when already mid-yearin June, he is talking about the January with the same agreement.     Ja, with the January date.     So you are saying that if he is right, in saying he signed the agreement in October and backdated it to January…[intervene]    …he would not have – there would not have been talk of a termination of an agreement in June.      Yes, no that is - well, I am not sure if I understand your emphasis on the date in January, because…[intervene]     …my understanding, just hang on one sec.  If he is right, that is I think the point you are making.  If he is right, that he only signed the agreement in October, then that means as at June, there was no agreement. There is therefore nobody could talk about the termination of an agreement that did not exist in June.      Ja.     Yes, although I do not follow your part of referring to that once you accept…[intervene]     Just one second - just because whether the date was May or whatever, as long as in June, he had not signed, there was no agreement to terminate.     Ja, no, I think I am not sure that your emphasis in January makes much difference but I think the importance of your point, as I have said is on his version if he signed in October, then there was no agreement in June, and if there is no agreement in June, how could he be writing this letter.     Ja, okay.  Counsel, you are done?     Yes.     Oh, okay no then that is different, jag that different, ja.  Then you are not - your reliance shouldnot be about backdating.      Your reliance should be about what he says here.     Ja, okay no that is fine.     What he says in his affidavit, when he says he signed the agreement in October, is contradicted by what he says here when he says the agreement was concluded in January 2016 taking in June.     Because in June, if he had not signed the agreement yet, on his version, he could not talk aboutthe agreement having been concluded in January.      Ja, okay alright Mr Seleka.     Oh, you were still making – continuing.     Ja.     Taken to?     Ja.     I guess, also, you may be making thepoint in due course if you are not already making it, that it looks like this is at least the second letter from McKinsey where they write one thing in correspondence but in affidavits seems to say something that contradicts what they have written in correspondence.      Because there was the letter of the 9 t h…[intervene]     …of February that we are talking about.     Except, insofar as with regard to the letter of the 9 t h of February, insofar as they may have said our authorisation or agreement that you may pay as Eskom you may and direct subject to the fulfilment of this condition. Except for that there are other things in that letter, which you say they seem to want to deny or run away from in the affidavit.    And you say certainly here the correspondence of the time says one thing, but in affidavits that they have signed subsequently they seek to say something else, is that right?     Okay, alright.     Of course, if McKinsey received a letterfrom Eskom that brought them to terminate an agreement and if they - that is now on 24 June 2016 and if they did not know that there was an agreement between them and Eskom on the particular subject they would have said what are you talking about?    We do not have an agreement yet.    Ja.    Ja but certainly they would not receive aletter saying we – we are terminating an agreement and they thought there was no agreement but respond as if there was an agreement.    Mr Seleka.    Well I am assuming Mr – Mr Singh you have completed or you still have some points to make?    Ja I think you should – you should cover yourself by making sure you have responded to everything that you need to respond to.    What page?    Okay.  Yes.    Paragraph.    Paragraph 30 – paragraph 29?    Okay.    I am at paragraph 29 I am just looking for– yes I can see “by then”.    Yes.  Ja no I mean if you say in August McKinsey was paid in regard to this work and – and Dr Weiss says the agreement was only signed by McKinsey in October it means in August when they were paid there was no agreement.  That is what it would mean and that is the point you making.    Yes.    What is – what is the implication of the fact that in that sentence that you have just read Mr Singh Dr Weiss talks about the termination of the turnaround programme as opposed to the termination of the agreement.  Is there – is he using those terms interchangeably?MR    Okay alright.      Ja, yes.    Okay, okay.   Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay, okay let Mr Singh be the one to dealwith that. Mr Singh what do you say to Mr Seleka’s proposition that Dr Weiss is deliberately talking about the termination of the turnaround programme here because he knows that there is no agreement at that stage.    Of course I see that in the previous sentence he – he talks about October 2016 and then in the – he then says by then which must mean by October 2016.    Ja.    Hm.    That he talks about there.  Which was – which agreement is he talking about?    On your understanding.    So which agreement is he talking about in    Hm.  But you – you – he would not – the reference to signing an agreement.    Contemplates as I understand it wherethere would be a single document that has been signed.    As opposed to an agreement that is constituted by the sending of an offer and the sending of an acceptance which are signed separately.    So if that understanding is correct what agreement was he talking about in the first line?    Ja.  Mr Singh what would be your understanding of what agreement he is talking about in the    And it would have been sent to McKinsey?    And when it was – it did have play – two places for signature.    By McKinsey and by Eskom.  Okay if it had that then one could talk about an agreement being signed.  Maybe one could talk because it is – it is a single document, it is signed by both sides – both parties and it may well be that Mr Seleka is right in his understanding that theagreement that he is talking about there is the agreement as constituted by the offer and acceptance.  You would go along with that?    Yes, yes.  Okay at least that part I understand.  Okay I think you were still wanting to go on to make some points Mr Singh or had you finished?    Mr Seleka.    Ja, ja    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.      Hm.    Yes.    Could it be that there is confusion and confusion is created by the fact that at a certain level McKinsey talks about an agreement had been having been signed on the basis of – of an acceptance.  And then talksabout a formal agreement as I understand it a formal agreement not in the context of a – for an offer and acceptance but a normal agreement.    Being signed by McKinsey in October.  Is it not two – two transactions or two documents maybe they relate to the transaction but first you have an offer and acceptance which in law could constitute a contract but then there is a desire to have one document that reflects all the terms and conditions of the agreement and that processcomes after the – the signing of the acceptance by both parties and that is what comes later but should the situation arise where for some reason the formal agreement is not signed any one of the parties can still say based on the offer and acceptance with details an agreement and this is what I did under that agreement and I should be paid this or that and that?    Hm.  But you – you have a version that also goes along with the idea that once there was an offer and acceptance and the signing of the acceptance there wasan agreement.    Ja you agree with that part.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes but if – if we were to go along with the idea that a contract came about when there was an acceptance of an offer then in June there would have been an agreement is it not?    And why do we not look at whether the termination we are talking about that they are talking about in that letter of June is – relates to the termination of that agreement as constituted by the offer and acceptance?  Hm.    So in other words what I am – in trying to establish what really seems to be confusing I want to see whether if we follow that line – that approach the whole thing does not begin to make sense or not.    743.  Yes.    Ja.  Where is the letter of termination?    Ja.  Let us – maybe I just want to look at that first.    So what page?    877.    Yes it is a letter from Mr Edwin Mabelane.    Chief Procurement Officer and it isaddressed to Dr Weiss of McKinsey and Company and it is dated 16 June.  Oh this one is dated 16 June 2016 not 24 but let me see this one.  It is a letter of termination it seems. “This letter serves to official notify McKinsey and Company of a board decision taken on 9 June 2016 to terminate the McKinsey Risk Based Contract.  You are requested to engage with Mr Prish Govender to discuss the pertinent issue to give effect to the board resolution.  In conclusion Eskom will embarkon a transparent procurement process to reallocate the activities under the Risk Based Contract. McKinsey and Company is welcome to participate in this process.”That Risk Based Contract could fall within – I mean the – the contract if there was one that would have come about as a result of the offer and acceptance could fall within this M – is it not?    Ja.    MSA.   Oh that is…    Refers to MSA?    Okay.  So…    That is not what we are looking for is that right?    That we are looking for?    Okay but – okay no, these contracts have got different names.    The one that Dr Weiss says he signed in October.    Was it the MSA or this Service Level Agreement.    Was over 00   Or October or whatever.    Ja.    SLA?    Yes.    Ja they refer to it – ja.    MSA.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.  So on…    Is December 2015?    Yes.   Ja.    Yes.  Okay.  Okay so the offer and acceptance also referred to MSA?    You know that correspondence that we talked about.    In other words the subject matter was thesame.    Ja.    811.    Okay.    Yes I have got 811 page – you say 112?    111?    Okay.  Okay.  That is the letter – that is the letter of acceptance.  But where is the part signed by McKinsey?    Oh okay but do we know whether there is a letter of acceptance that has the signatures of both parties in the same document?    Yes.  Yes but I am now going back to an earlier point that I had made remember Mr Singh had said to me in response to a question I put to him that the parties had signed the same document in terms of letter ofacceptance and that kind of answered by query.  But if factually that is not the case it might revive that concern.    Yes, no, no.    Ja.    Ja.  Hm.  Well maybe somebody will havea look and then we can take it from there.  Let us move on in the meantime.    Ja.  Okay alright.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    What was the page of that letter again?    Oh okay.  I have got it yes.    Hm.    Engineers.    Ja.  Ja.    Okay.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja MSA.    Ja.    Yes.    So – so going back to one of my earlier questions what do you say to my thinking that – thinking that the termination of the agreement that both parties Eskom and McKinsey are talking about in June 2016 could be the termination of the agreement that came about as a result of the acceptance of the offer?  What would you say to that?    Ja, ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Responding to the letter of termination.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja I am there what do you say about it?     Well, he might, at that stage, have said so but with all the discussions, he might have made up his mind which one is false.  [laughs]  Mr Singh, have you made up your mind which one is false or not yet?     H’m.     H’m.  But Mr Seleka says, earlier on you were not sure which one is false of the two versions ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]      But he says he thinks you are now saying there is a particular one that is false.     And I just want you to clarify.     H’m.     Yes, but Mr Singh, if you are not sureyet whether you are choosing which version is false, you do not have to say so now.     I think Mr Seleka just wanted to have clarification and I wanted to have clarification too.     Whether you have reached the point     Is that where you are Mr Singh?  One of them false.  You are not sure which one?     Ja.     And the version that he signed in October?     Is false? MR     Ja.    Ja.     October, ja.     H’m?    Ja.     Okay.     Ja-no, that is fine.     Ja.     Do not motivate further because youhave covered the ground.     Okay Mr Seleka.     You had completed the points that you wanted to make, Mr Singh, or had you not?  In response to Mr Seleka’s ...[intervenes]      H’m, h’m.     Yes.  Yes, Mr Seleka.     I am sorry, Mr Seleka.     I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  Before you go there.     Please do not forget what you want to deal with.     I just remembered.  There is somethingthat I need it to be cleared.  You remember when we went to the letter of acceptance?     No, to the letter of termination.  I was – I had asked for the letter dated 24 June 2016 because in McKinsey’s letter of 28 June 2016, which is at page 743, they say many thanks for the letter dated 24 June 2016.  But you said I would find that letter at whatever page you said but that letter was dated 16 June and not 24 June 2016 and yet you said that was the letter oftermination.  So I want to raise the question.  What is the story between – is there a letter dated 24 June 2016 or was that an error.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Is it the termination letter?     Okay.    Ja.       Okay.     Okay.     Ja.     Okay.     Okay.     So the termination letter is the one who is dated 16 June.  But there was subsequent correspondence, one of which is the letter of 24 June.     But it is more about ...[intervenes]     ...matter ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay.  Okay.  Now I understand.     Ja.     Okay, okay.  Okay Mr Seleka, I think that has been cleared for.     Ja.     What page?     what is the bundle?     Well, the one I have will not have page 77.  You said page 77?     Ja-no, it will not have.  So it must be B because I have C.     Is it B?     D?     Oh, should not be D...  Are the numbers not going up?     Because this is C and it does not have 5 – page 500...       Oh, I am sorry.  Maybe it does.  I am sorry.  No, no 77 it will not because it starts at six-hundredand something.  That is for 1-14-c.     So if you are saying Bundle 14, page 77 it must be another bundle and it should be Bundle A, I would imagine.       I have in front of me Eskom Bundle 14(c).     To the end of...?     I must go to the end?     877?     Ja, but I have been saying 77 and you did not say no.  You said 877.  That is why I am saying it must be an earlier bundle.     I thought you said 77.     No, I say...    That is why I was saying it has to be earlier than Bundle C.     877.     Okay.  What, point what or only that?     156.       Now why is this page not marked, paginated?     There is – the last page is 877.155.     And then there is a document that comes after that, Exhibit U-33.1 but it is not paginated.     And that the last document.  So it must have been slotted in at some stage but your team – you should have made sure they have paginated.     Is it the Eskom’s formal request for information?    Will you make sure that it is done after we have adjourned?     H’m.  Okay, okay.  I am – have you got it Mr Singh?  But you have got it somewhere ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Just make sure, Mr Seleka, that in mine and the witness’s one, as well as, of course, yours that we all have the same thing paginated.     H’m?     Ja.       Okay.     This is a letter from Mr Anoj Singh, CFO of Eskom addressed to Dr Alexander Weiss of McKinsey & Company dated 19 February 2016 and the subject is Top Consultant Programme, Risk Based Contract Proposal and Negotiations.    Ja, okay, continue.     Ja.     Yes.  [laughs]  Mr Singh, thesedocuments and letters and emails that you and McKinsey and them were writing are confusing.  [laughs]       You were just saying that the agreement was concluded in February.     In January but now in February – on February 19, you are still talking about the agreement still to be signed.     Do not add confusion, please.     [laughs]       You give clarification?     Well, you say to – or October on Dr Weiss’ ...[intervenes]      Version.     Okay.     Well, you see, earlier on your evidence was – your evidence in reaction to Dr Weiss’ statement in his affidavit that he only signed the agreement in October, backdated it to January.  Your evidence was that the agreement either was or must have been signed in January.I understood that to mean even by him.  In otherwords, this backdating from October, you were rejecting.  Is it – was my understanding correct, at that time, that is what you were saying before we came to this letter?     H’m?     H’m.     H’m?     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     Ja.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  You see, my understanding of what you were saying, and I thought that that letter of 28 June ...[intervenes]      ...from Dr Weiss was supporting – was supportive of your version because I understood you to besaying the agreement was signed in January.  This whole story that he only signed in October is not supporting by anything, you know.  And then you remembered that in the second paragraph of that letter ...[intervenes]      ...of 28 June, he himself says the agreement was concluded in January 2016.     So that is when I was thinking he is supportive of your version because I had thought yourversion was the agreement was signed or must have been signed in January.     Then the story about October is really not good enough     What you are saying, certainly now, is that there must have been some backdating that happened.     I was about to ask whether you say on both or only one side.     You say on both?     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja, yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.  Mr Seleka.  [laughs]  So the confusion does not get properly clarified but we continue to try and understand...     H’m.     Mr Seleka, ja.     Agreed to by...?     Ja.    Was not there?     As if it had been signed?     At a time when it had not yet been signed?     Okay.     Were fulfilled?     Ja.     Mr Seleka? ADV SELEKA     What page did you say we must go to?     Oh.     Well, it is the same situation.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, I have got the letter so it is – and weadmitted the document previously as EXHIBIT U33.2.     So what remains is just the pagination.     But this is a response from McKinsey to Mr Singh.     Responding to Mr Singh’s letter of 19 February.     Okay.     Yes.     So, Mr Seleka, what was the – or what were the points that you sought to make by reference to these letters, was it that even in March there was still nosigned agreement?     Yes.     Yes, okay.  And are you going to be taking that a step further and saying that it is likely that even in June no agreement had been signed yet or you are not going to go that far?     Yes, okay.     I guess that – do not forget your point – I guess, Mr Singh, you must tell me whether you know from what the date is when Eskom signed had backdated and what the date is when McKinsey signed and backdated if in respect of McKinsey you are saying it is not October.     Yes.     So but you – are you saying you do not have personal knowledge as to when Eskom actually signed?     And you do not have personal knowledge as to when McKinsey signed but based on what you have seen in the documentation, none of them signed in January 16 and for sometime thereafter there was – nobody had signed.  So you say they must both have signed at some stage after January 2016 they backdated.    As to both, you do not know exactly when but you say that well, in regard to Eskom Mr Mabelane must be able to say.  But why would you then dispute Dr Weiss’ evidence that look – in the affidavit, that I actually signed in October but the document gives the – reflects that I signed it January because I gave that date but the reason why I did so, because I was – I understood that Eskom preferred that we should put that date.  Why are you disputing that evidence?    You do not accept now?     Ja.     But basically you are saying you challenge it because of your understanding of the correspondence and other documents and your terms of logic but you do not have personal knowledge.    Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     So you are saying if to Eskom’s knowledge …[intervenes]     …when McKinsey sent that letter of the 28 June…     Which you said is a letter of demand.     If, to Eskom’s knowledge, no agreementhad been signed, one would expect Eskom to say but we have no signed agreement.     And you say the fact that they did not say that suggests to you that there must have been a signed agreement by that date.     That is what you say.     And that is the basis on which you sayby that time the parties must have signed and backdated.     You no longer say in January there was a conclusion of the agreement to say – it must have been later than that but not later than 28 June.     Somewhere in between both of them must have signed but they backdated?     That is what you are saying.     Okay.  Mr Seleka?     Page 876?     You said I must go to page 876?     I am there but maybe we are at ten past four, maybe we should take a short adjournment.  We can take it either now or you can complete the point you wanted to make with reference to this letter.    Ja.     Oh, okay.     Where are you reading from on page 876?     Are you reading from page 876?     Okay.      “..of the service level agreement between Eskom and McKinsey entails the requirement of outsourcing a percentage of the total resulting fee a supply development but now we are fully committed to giving effect to this obligation despite the termination in light of the previous subcontractingrelationship with Trillian which under the current conditions would not be possible.  We would appreciate an opportunity to develop options with Eskom to ensure that meet our supply development obligations.” So they – two points are made in this paragraph.  One, is there is a draft service level agreement between Eskom and McKinsey, which means it has not been signed as at     Yes, same paragraph, after the first  Oh, the termination of those discussions?    Okay, alright.     So I guess is the point you are making that as we look at when it is that the agreement was signed, we must accept that as at 30 March 2016 it had not been signed otherwise they would not talk in these terms.  That is the point you were making.     Okay.  You accept that point, Mr Singh?     You accept it?       Ja, Okay, alright.  Was there anotherpoint in regard to this letter that you were making other than…?     No.     Follow up.     Ja, ja.     I have got it, it is dated 9 June 2016.     829.19.     It is submission document from Eskom to the board tender committee and it is dated 9 June 2016.     Before you deal with that, Mr Seleka, let us just for the sake of completeness say who signed the submission.     It was – it is not clear who compiled it     Let’s say the title of the submission is given as “Briefing on McKinsey risk-based contract”.     And that is under one, under two it says     I am sorry, would you just repeat, I am sorry I was looking at something that I raised just now.     Yes, you may comment Mr Singh.     Yes.     Well I see that in this document, the first page of this document in bullet or under bullet point – the     Ja, okay.   Let us take the short adjournment, it will be ten minutes. We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    By?    Yes.    Well if he is still going to respond I was hoping that if we did not finish Mr Singh’s evidence today we would finish tomorrow.    I know he is due to come back on Transnet later – later in the month so how far is that process?   Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay.  Okay.    Ja.    No that is fine.  I guess what I am lookingfor is that there ought to be an understanding of where or when the process of obtaining or preparing his further affidavit will be completed or when the affidavit would be available.  Obviously if it has got to be served by way of a Rule 3.3 on certain people may be implicated in it that would have to be done.  So maybe at some stage either at the end of today’s proceedings or tomorrow let us – let us try and have finality on the dates.  But if Mr Singh is able to deal with some of the issues connected with that then whatever can be done should be done in terms of covering as many issues as possible.  And those that he might not yet be able to deal with until he has done the affidavit then he would deal with them then hopefully if we have to find to make time for him at some stage or other after tomorrow then the time would be limited just to come with these specific issues.   Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  No that is fine.    That is fine.  Okay Mr Seleka.      Which you are not going to?    Oh okay ja    Ja.    Well he – he could comment even if theyare not read into the record if that was necessary.    Is what you were not inclined to do reading into the record or allowing Mr Singh to comment or not.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay ja    Do you not want to ask Mr Singh tocomment on those – those parts without reading them into the record.    And then if you want to question him on his comments then you do that.    Okay.    Yes.  I am just going to 7.7 – 74.3.  Now this is the letter which says the Master Services Agreement was finally concluded in January 2016.   Which you dispute – which you challenge?    Yes but when we conclude we are talking about signing – you and I understand that – we are on the same page on that.    ja.   Well you remember when we were talking earlier about whether the agreement was concluded in January or later we were talking out when it was signed and – and you said at a certain stage nobody signed the agreement in January as far as you are concerned.    Everybody signed it later but backdated it.    Ja that is – that is – ja, ja.    Because if it is meant to be signed until both sides have signed it is not concluded.  Okay.  You accept that?  An agreement that requires to be signed is not concluded until both sides have signed.    Okay.  Alright but – but you and I agreed earlier I thought that if we find a time in 2016 when the parties had not signed the agreement then there was no agreement between the parties yet.  I leave out the issue ofthe offer and acceptance which we discussed earlier.  But I thought that we – we understood each other that as long as Eskom had not signed McKinsey had not signed there was no agreement yet.    Did I misunderstand?    Letter?    Ja.    Ja.    Yes but remember I said let us leave that(speaking over one another).    Yes and the letter or an offer and acceptance.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  That I understand you have explained that so I know that.    Yes but too when you say that you are relying on the offer and acceptance is it not?    Well if it has not been signed.    If it has not been signed I would (speaking over one another).    No remember we are talking about an agreement here which we both understood or understand to have required both parties to sign.    That is why they signed and that is why they even backdated it because it was important that it be seen to have – that from a certain date.    Or am I confusing you?   Okay alright let – let us take it – let us take it step by step.  Do you accept that there was no Service Level Agreement or MSA before both Eskom and McKinsey signed?    You say – you say it was that?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So …    So is your – is your position that even in February remember you have a letter – you letter to McKinsey dated 19 February.    Saying – talking about signing that was still to happen.   On the contract.    Are you saying even on the 19 th of February as far as you are concerned if the two suspensive conditions had been met already and I cannot recall whether they had been met – if they had been met then as far as you are concerned there was a Service – a Master Service Agreement between McKinsey and Eskom as at that date?    It was there.    And it was binding.    And so you say the signing was neitherhere nor there?    But it was not important?    Yes.  So – so when – when the termination happened you remember you said earlier on there must have – there must have been – they must have signed by the 28 t h of June.    Because otherwise if anyone or if Eskom talked about termination McKinsey should have said termination of what because we have not even signed.    Yes.    But then if signing was not important then it would not have been open to Eskom to say why – what are you talking about because we have not signed?  Because the answer would be we do not have to sign we already have the agreement on your version.    Mr Singh it was not in tongue in cheek.    Yes.    Yes.  So – but once you accept that then you have got to change your earlier evidence that there was a Master Services Level Agreement even before the partiessigned.  Once you say they – it was a requirement to sign and at a time when that requirement had not been met there could not be a Master Service Agreement between the parties.    Yes leave out the suspensive conditions because we have talked about that.  Just talking about signing.    Well you just said to me a while ago that when you said signature – signing was not important that was tongue in cheek okay and you said seriously signing was required, do you remember that?  And in response to that I said to you but if signing was important – was a requirement then you cannot say that there was a Master Services Agreement between the parties at a time when they had not signed.  In other words when they had not met that requirement.   No, no, no before we get there – before we get there remember that there is an issue here.    That Mr – Dr Weiss says in effect in his affidavit in June the McKinsey had not signed the agreement – I am saying in June but for many months before October there was no – no agreement because McKinsey had not signed.    And he says he signed in October but backdated …    His – to his signature to January.  So thequestion of whether – of when it was that there was an agreement between the two parties is important because whatever payment gets made we want to find out was it made at a time when there was an agreement and what was the – what was the effect of the agreement.  So we have letters that say the agreement was concluded in January but you have said no it cannot be.  So – but on what I understand you to be saying now you accept that  1. The signing by the parties of the agreement was – or was a requirement here and you accept that if we findat any time that they had not signed we can accept that therefore at that time there could not have been a Master Services Agreement between the parties.    Sorry just repeat that?    No, no what I am saying is I – I am not dealing with the question of the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions now but I am simply saying assume that the conditions – the suspensive conditions were met.    If the agreement had not been signed andyou say the signing was a requirement I am expecting that you will accept that as long as the agreement was not signed we cannot say there was an – a Master Services Agreement between the parties because you say signing was a requirement in this case.    Yes.    Not my version.   Proposition ja.    Ja.    Ja you say if there is no signature.    There is no agreement.    That was your – that is what you said ja.    Yes.   Ja.    Ja well you introducing liability now we are talking about whether there is an agreement or there is no agreement.    When there is no signature.   No, no I said in terms of an existing agreement.    You see if you talk about liability you might talk about liability that comes from the contract; you might talk about liability that comes from something else okay.  So that is why I am just saying let us talk about the contract but my understanding of what – where you are now on your evidence is that you are saying in this case the signing of the agreement by both parties was a requirement and as long as they had not signed one cannot say there was anagreement.  But it is a different situation where the signing is not a requirement.  I am now going back to something you said earlier as I understood.  That is where I understand you to be.  Is it not what you intend conveying?    Ja.    Ja.  Ja.   Ja.  Okay.    You going back to the – to the facts.    Or to the version that you put.    I am saying not necessarily to the facts because – because we are trying to establish when …    The contract is signed.    But I have told you what I make of your evidence now.  Mr Seleka.     Well I am – I am not sure what the answer – what effects of the answer that you are giving to Mr Seleka is but I just remain on what I think has come out clearly from your evidence namely the signing of this agreement by the parties was a requirement in this case therefore if the parties – if we talk about any time in 2016 when factually the partieshad not signed we cannot say as at that time there was a Master Services Agreement between Eskom and McKinsey. So that is the one set.You have said something about the suspensive conditions.  For now for my purposes in terms of what I have been asking you for me that is neither here nor there for present purposes you know.  What was important is to – to establish what your understanding was.  So that is where I am.    I think he has said enough.    I do not think he wants to say anything further.    Ja.    Was it not in relation to the corporate plan?    It was in regard to this one?    Okay.  Okay.     I do not have difficulty with that, you know.  But it makes it all the more important to establish as to exactly what the position is because Dr Weiss has     But do you not accept in all of these circumstances they would not have sought to advantage themselves in any way by saying they signed the letter inOctober if in fact they signed it much earlier?  But ...[intervenes]      H’m.     H’m?     No, but that is fine.  Remember, my question is.  Do you accept or do you know that – I mean, normally – from what you have said, I think you are suggesting that Dr Weiss is being untruthful in saying thathe signed the agreement in October.  He must have signed before or during the second – the first half of 2016.So my question is whether you do not accept that he or McKinsey would not derive any benefit from saying they – he signed the document, the agreement in October if, actually, he signed it in the first six months of 16.     What is that?    Sorry?     No, what benefit do they get by saying that?     H’m?     H’m?     No ...[intervenes]      No, no.  You are dealing with a different point and I know the point you are dealing with because you have told me about it and I have indicated to you that I understand the point.  I am simply saying, if McKinseyactually signed the agreement during the first six months of 2016.     It does not appear that there would be any benefit for them if they said instead untruthfully the signed it in October.  Normally, people become, you know, tell untruths when they seek to protect themselves or to gain benefits.  So I am saying that for them to be paid, it would be in their interest, actually, to say we actually signed in January.  So as we were doing work there was an agreement in place, you know.  Rather than saying – rather than effectively disclose that there was no agreement until October and then would backdated it.  So as we were doing work for Eskom, we had no agreement with Eskom.  Thatwas not beneficial to them to disclose that.     You see, I – I have said to you I understand your point about that.     And about saying – but the letter, the letter talks about the agreement had been concluded already because it says January but talks about then beingconcluded.  That might need explanation from their side, from Dr Weiss’ side and so on and so on.  I understand that but I was saying, let us look at the – that part of the evidence that was simply to the effect that they signed in October but they backdated, if we look at that.     Ja.     H’m?     H’m?    H’m, h’m.     H’m.     Yes.  I guess we have ...[intervenes]     ...canvassed it sufficiently, Mr Seleka.     Ja, ja.     H’m.     But maybe... maybe ...[intervenes]      ...it will just – do not forget your point, Mr Seleka.     The issues that you set out in your letter in respect of which you said the signing was contingent upon those ...[intervenes]      ...being satisfied.  To your knowledge, were they satisfied all of them and if so, when?     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     But up to when was it outstanding?  Because based on what you say in your letter, as conveyedby Mr Seleka because I am relying on what he just said now.     There would be no signing until those issues were – those requirements were sorted out.  So until when did it remain outstanding, that issue?     To your knowledge.     The date of...?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     But would it be correct to say you had no personal knowledge of whether or not it was, that outstanding issue was ultimately satisfied?    Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  So Mr Mabelane might be the person who can clarify this?    H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.    H’m.  Okay.     Now, that of course, what you have just said now and the contents of your letter insofar as it said the signing can only take place after you have satisfied these requirements.    Depending on what the evidence is as to whether all of those issues were addressed or those requirements were satisfied, it may well be that as long as one of them was not satisfied, no signing took place which may explain why the signing might have taken place in October on the part of McKinsey because they would – there was this issue that remained unsatisfied.  But it depends on whether there is somebody     H’m.    I am sorry, just repeat the earlier sentence?     Ja, h’m.    H’m.  Of course, that is if they were still not satisfied, those issue.  If by October, when he signed, they had all been satisfied then he would not have raise any issues.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, ja, okay.  Mr Seleka.     Well, he says he agrees.     Ja.     In which case, then have you got any reason why Eskom would have signed the agreement with McKinsey even if one of those requirements, as part in your letter, including that one was not satisfied?     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.    H’m, h’m.     But what do you say to this proposition that...  Or let me put it this way.  Is the position not that you as Mr Singh, as the author of that letter of 19 February 2016, you would have been surprised if Eskom or Mr Mabelane signed the agreement even if one of those requirements, such as the one that Mr Seleka has named, has not been satisfied?     Yes.     Ja, ja.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     Yes, but ...[intervenes]     Yes.     You would have – you expected him to come to you and deal with that question if there was one or more of the requirements that had not been met, is that right?     I accept that you are saying you cannot recall whether ...[intervenes]     Yes.     With or without seeing the – you see Steer Co or whatever.  Ja, you would have expected ...[intervenes]      Okay alright.     H’m, h’m.  Without coming back to you.     Ja, okay.  But you have no personal knowledge of ...[intervenes]      You have no knowledge whether he signed with them having been satisfied, all of them, or without them – without one of them or maybe more being satisfied?  Or is the position that you accept that one of the – one or more of the requirements set out in your letter was not satisfied but there may have been a reason that persuaded Mr Mabelane to sign even if that was – that one was not satisfied because of the discussions that happened at Steer Co?     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka.       Well, I thought he accepts that he has no knowledge – he is not in a position to say they were all met.     Am I right?    H’m?     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     Ja, h’m.     No ...[intervenes]      No, no, no.  You cannot answer the question like that Mr Singh.     Well, there is the question of what yourpersonal knowledge is, okay?     Whether they were all met or they were not all met.  And then there is a question of what your source of knowledge is, okay?     If you say    Leave out the letter for now.  In terms of just knowing what happened.  Do you or do you have knowledge whether all those requirements were met?  And then you can go to the letter.  Or in terms of what was happening, were you sufficiently involved to have personal knowledge whether they were met?     Ja, okay alright. MR     Ja.     Yes, ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.    Yes.     H’m?     H’m?     So you are saying to me at a certain stage after you had received the response, their response, Eskom was not satisfied that they had met all the requirements.     Okay.     Do we need to go there or not really?     Okay, alright.     What page, Mr Seleka?     700, okay, continue.     Give your response, yes.     Which letter are you talking about now?     Which letter are you talking about?     The 19 February, your letter?     Ja?     I thought – I did not – I did not – I am not sure that I understood you to seek a clarification, I thought it put requirements to say this is what we as Eskom wants.     Ja.     But I think what Mr Seleka is saying toyou is Dr Weiss is saying in paragraph 74 at page 700 that by June 2016 they had not been able to identify any partner who could have taken the place of Trillian.     Therefore Mr Seleka is saying that means that if one follows the requirement of your letter of 19 February, that one of those requirements which you said in the letter had to be met before the agreement to be signed had not been met as at June 2016.  That is the point he is making and he is inviting to say whether you disagree.     No, no, no, remember the propositionthat he is putting to you as formulated by me is …[intervenes] MR     Your letter – is your letter of 19 February.     Said there cannot be signing of an agreement unless all these requirements are met.     And now we see that on Dr Weiss’ version as at June one of those requirements had not been met according to him.  Therefore, if your letter was to be complied with, Eskom could not have signed unless they were to act in breach of your letter.     You agree with that, ja.     The agreement.     Ja.  Ja, ja.     Yes.     Well, the signing of the – whether the agreement was signed in breach of the requirements as set out in your letter, probably would not be immaterial but for present purposes, that is hard fact, okay?  Is the positionnot that if the requirements in your letter had not been met as at June then based on your letter – and not on something else and maybe we can look at whether other factors might override this but based on your letter, one would expect that no agreement had been signed by Eskom because your letter had been clear, those requirements must be met.  But that is separate from saying are there other factors or events that happened which might have overridden your requirements in your letter. You understand that?  In terms of simply looking at your letter, one would expect Eskom not to have signed by June if one of those requirements had not been met but it may well be that certain developments had occurred which might have persuaded Mr Mabelane to sign even if that requirement had not been met.    You agree, ja.  Mr Seleka?     Mr Singh, we are all going to remember your letter of 19 February for a long time.     As well as …[intervenes]     As well as Dr Weiss’ letter of 28 June.     Well, we should have talked at four o’clock, actually.  You know, we normally talk at about four o’clock.  I would like us to go as far as we can today so that – to the extent that we do not finish today, we should finish tomorrow.     Obviously I am interested in hearing what you have to say, what Mr Singh has to say and what this counsel has to say but particularly because of the time that we lost in the morning I would like us to go as far as possible.  You know, Mr Singh has been coming here for quite a few times.  I know he will still come back for Transnet and he might still even if we do cover a lot of his evidence tomorrow, there might still be a little bit that hecomes back for but we are in April and the intention was to finish all oral evidence by end of March, so we – so I am trying to push as much as possible so that he can finish because I do not want to go into May.     I may – well, there is already one or two witnesses in regard to [indistinct – dropping voice] a date or two for May, but I do not want to go into May with oral evidence, I want us to finalise.  So counsel for Mr Singh, you have heard what I say.    Well, you see, even if we had started on time, my plan was that we were going to go into the evening, so there is that part but if and when a witness says I am tired, I am not so [indistinct – dropping voice] I will stop but I do not think Mr Singh will say that if he is not really tired [indistinct – dropping voice].  So I am quitehappy to say if and when Mr Singh says look, I am tired, I am happy that we adjourn, that we will because it would be unfair to continue.     Yes, yes.  So but it is important that we all do the best.  I know that certainly there has been cooperation in terms of us working into the night to try and finish but we have been – we have sat for about close to two hours since the last break so maybe it is fine, let us take a break and then we will talk about – we will finalise the subject when we come back.  Okay, let us take a ten minutes adjournment.    Okay.      Well, I must decide.  You said if it depended on you we could go on for some time.     Are you, what is your situation Mr Singh?    Yes.     Ja, so you - how much else do you need to deal with with regard to Mr Singh in terms of issues?    Other than the MSA?    Ja.    Ja.     Ja.    Okay.  Look, we have reserved for tomorrow to try and finish Mr Singh’s evidence, but last week I did postpone to tomorrow Ms Norma Gigaba’s evidence for the evening session.  So we do have some time but if indications are that we should finish with Mr Singh’s evidence by lunch time, then there might be no need for us to try and go too far this evening, because then we will finish early and maybe still have some hours.  So what is your assessment if we finish the issues that, two issues that you talked about to council for Mr Singh, how much time do you think we would need?    A whole morning?    Okay, alright.  No, that is fine.  We are at quarter past six now.  We go on until half past or you would like, provided Mr Singh agrees and his counsel to go up to quarter to, so that you finish those two issues and then tomorrow we start on Tegeta or what is the position?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.     Ja.    Can we try that counsel for Mr Singh, 30 minutes?  Mr Singh, would that be fine?    Let us give it a try.  If you feel that you have become too tired, let me know.  There is no intention to force you to testify even when you are tired because you are the only one on that hot seat.    Is that fine counsel?  Okay, alright.  So let us continue.  Maybe we might finish around quarter to seven.    Okay.    Oh, is it interfering with you?    Ja, okay.  Can somebody adjust it or ...[intervenes]    Will that be fine?    Okay, alright.     Yes, 769 I am there, yes.     What document is this?    Oh, okay alright.      Do you agree or disagree with Mr Koko’s evidence that this agreement should not have been signed because the approvals contemplated in Clause 22 approvals in terms of the PFMA were not obtained.     I am not sure if I follow.  Did you, what is your answer to the proposition that if the approvals required in terms of the PFMA were not obtained, the agreement should not have been signed?    Without approvals?    Ja.  MR    Subject to approval.    Okay.     Okay.    Okay.  Mr Seleka?    Just for the record.  State whose affidavit we are looking at and obviously the page.     I am saying for the record, state whose affidavit we are looking at.     And the page.     And obviously in what proceedings.     Ja, okay.  You said we must go to 1193.     So I take that to be, I take that to mean that you are saying look, I do not have personal knowledge of these matters so I am not in a position to agree with them or disagree, but all I am saying is that my understanding is that a 75 note was obtained or email was obtained from national treasury which I understood not to say we needed approvals in terms of the PFMA for the agreement at the time. That is what you are saying, is that correct?    Okay.    Is that because you are going to say no, that is not your understanding?    So you wanted him to confirm whether your understanding of what he said was correct.    That McKinsey said they were misled.    Whether that they were right in saying so or not, you are not going there now?   Okay.    Ja.    Okay.     Ja.     Ja, not that is fine.     Oh, you are not done yet, okay ...[intervenes]      Oh that was the first point, well we willrespect the arrangement, Mr Singh can he go into his second point?     Okay, alright, okay.     You think he needs some rest?     You know he is the only one who has been standing the whole day.    But he ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay.     Okay then that is fine, let us adjourn then.   I think that it would be good if Mr Singh could get a chance to have a look at Mr Koko’s evidence that has beenreferred to because in answering he has emphasized that he has not seen that evidence, so that tomorrow if he has picked anything that makes him qualify his evidence or add it  he can do so, so I guess that you would be able to indicate where he will find it, the relevant evidence.     Okay thank you very much to everybody for your cooperation, let us adjourn now and tomorrow we could start earlier than ten but there is no point in starting earlier than ten if we are going to finish on time anyway, so should we make it ten o’clock?     Okay, alright, we will adjourn then until tomorrow at ten.     We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Yes.    They are still not here Chairperson.  Ihave phoned the Advocate again and she indicated to me that they are running ten to fifteen minutes late because they needed to commission an affidavit of Mr Singh so it is a further affidavit apparently which they would like to hand up this morning and that will take us beyond half past ten by the look of things.    Correct.    No it is more than a few minutes.    From just two…    Just two minutes before the…    Hm.  But she is – she is apologising profusely.    Than you Chair.    They are not Chair but the attorney is here.    Yes.   Yes.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Indeed.    Yes.  Did you…    Yes during the adjournment I did glance through the affidavit.  The affidavit itself is fairly short – it is eight pages but the annexures are quite voluminous.      Not all of them.    I looked at one or two of them.    But I have seen the contents of the affidavits.  What I could do for Mr Singh is to – I could ask you – some of the questions which I intended asking Mr Singh this morning bear on the issues that he seeks to address in the affidavit.  So I could follow my line and then in the course of him answering he could refer the Chairperson to that affidavit to the extent that he wants to answer some of the questions.    And I know the Chairperson has not seenthe affidavit.     Yes.    You have not.   No.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I think so.    Yes.  Mr Singh you understand – so we carry on on the basis that I have prepared insofar as you need to refer to this new affidavit – ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes Chair.    Thank you.  Okay you follow that Mr Singh.  Chairperson the affidavits of Mr Singh are found – well the ones which are already in the bundle are found inEskom Bundle 16.    Eskom Bundle 16.  But the bundle Chair which I wish us to focus on as we proceed now is Eskom Bundle 14(c).  Eskom Bundle 14(c) and from time to time I will refer to the relevant passages.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Yes.    Oh okay.    Yes it is – if it is Dan Marokane Chair I know.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I will.   Thank you.  Mr Singh just by way of recapping on this we were mainly dealing with the McKinsey matters last time when we adjourned.  We dealt with the corporate plan and the – we started with the MSA and on the corporate plan it was a debate for the in inverted commas “at the heart” who rendered services and we were trying to enquire as to who rendered services and in regard to the – well we had gone beyond that enquiry about who rendered services and on the MSA we were dealing with the conclusion thereof.Now I just want to quickly finish off by reference to the affidavits of Dr Weiss and Dr Amankwah on the services or the identity of the entities which rendered services in respect of the corporate plan and I am going to simply referyou to the paragraphs without too much time being taken on that.So that is Eskom Bundle 14 Chairperson.  Mr Singh turn – I will start first with – firstly with the affidavit of Dr Weiss and I – I will read from paragraph 38 – oh page – page 692 – 692 yes.    The black numbers as usual.  692.    You are there.     Ja.  So you will see the heading there above paragraph 37 is an introduction of Regiments/Trillian at Eskom and subsequent dealings with Regiments/Trillian and then the sub-heading is introduction of Regiments at Eskom.   Now the dates of October and November15 are significant in regard to a partner of Regiments going to form a company called Trillian Management Consulting because he comes back to that in paragraph 45.     Yes 702.221.    Yes.  Now just for context …    Yes.    The – yes – the affidavit that we read pre – that we have just come from now.    Is Dr Weiss’ affidavit.    This one now is one of Mr Amankwah Chairperson.    Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah.    Which starts on page 7021. 174.    We read certain excerpts from this affidavit previously and I have said page 702.221.  Just by way of context Mr Singh what Mr Amankwah deals with starts on the page 2 – page 702.220 and it is under the heading 9 February 2016 Letter.  And he has – is Chairperson on page 702.220?   Yes.  Mr Singh let us start on point 220 – paragraph 20.18.    We going to 220?    Ja.  Paragraph 20.18.  So he say   Yes.    Yes Chair.   Yes, no the Chairperson is correct those aspects are important.  And Then Mr Singh in regard to this letter of the 9 th of February 2016 which relates to the direct payment to Trillian of R30.6 million that reads on the next page.  He says paragraph 21.1. “On 9 February 16 Mr Vikas Sagar transmitted a letter to Mr Prish Govender of Eskom.”And he references their annexure K65. “The letter related to the professional services contract that is the corporate plan.  The letter recorded that McKinsey has sub-contracted a portion of the services to be performed under the agreement to Trillian Proprietary Limited.  It authorised Eskom to make payments directly to Trillian but only if McKinsey confirmed in writing that it was satisfied with the relevant services performed by Trillian and that the amount of the invoice was correct.  Two conditions that were never met.”   Yes Chair.    Yes.    Components ja.  That is alright Chair.  It is just the paragraphs I wanted to read all deal with the same theme.   Ja. So they all deal with the same theme.    I will give him a chance just to respond to this one before I go to the next ones.  Mr Singh lastly turn to page 702 – 2.224.    Yes.  224 paragraph 21.7 he says    Thank you, Chair.       Chair, I know that they – we traversed this last time.  They were or Mr Singh was given the affidavit through the Money Flow work stream because they – the evidence of Dr Weiss was led by the Money Flow.  So the request, I think, would have gone – would have been addressed to that work stream.     But the full affidavit of Dr Weiss is in the bundle.       Mr Singh has been given the bundle from the time or prior to the time of his appearance.       And we have asked him questions, previously, on two occasions relevant to that.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     It is this one but what Mr Singh and my learned friend are saying is that when they were given the affidavit the first time around, last year, it was redacted.     By the Money Flows.     It was redacted.     But I have since explained to them, Chair, and even here in an open session that witnesses are given affidavits to the extent that they are implicated. Mr Singh has dealt with the affidavit in reply.  He has a replying supplementary affidavit where he is expressly saying the affidavit of Dr Weiss does not implicate him.So all we are doing, Chair, from our point of view, is to put Dr Weiss’ affidavit in the bundle for his benefit and then we put the version of Dr Weiss to him.     Yes.     Before his appearance in the Eskom matters.     Yes.     No, a spin-off.  A spin-off.     A spin-off.     It is the first ...[intervenes]      I know what it is, Chair.     Eskom Bundle 16, page 591.    Yes.     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Mr Singh.  But he is talking about Trillian becoming an SDL partner of McKinseyinstead of Regiments.  That is in regard to the Turnaround Programme, the NMSA.  It is not the Corporate Plan.       In fact, Mr Singh, you have answered that question yourself in the paragraph – in the preceding paragraph on the page before which specifically shows that his answer relates to the Turnaround Programme and not the Corporate Plan.      Yes.     Ja.  Mr Singh, if we move on to Mr Amankwah.     I was saying to you.  In your affidavit ...[intervenes]     ...you referred the Chairperson to page 597 and you read paragraph 18.     And I was drawing your attention that what Dr Weiss is talking about there is the proposal to have Trillian as an SDL partner of McKinsey in the Turnaround Programme and not the Corporate Plan because we are dealing with the Corporate Plan.     Yes.  And I am saying, the answer that gives credence to what I am putting to you is evident from your quotation in the previous page that he is specifically dealing with the Turnaround Programme.  You are quoting from page 595, paragraph 17.     And in summary, Dr Weiss states, and then you have all those paragraphs.     Regiments was actually quite capable internationally - and he talks about Regiments.  If you turn the page and you go to the last paragraph on that page, he     And Mr Amankwah?     Sorry, just give us the reference again, Mr Singh?     Oh, yes.     Thank you.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Ja, evinces.     Ja.      Ja, just talking about Eskom receiving it in good faith, Mr Singh, just remember that he says this was a letter at the request – prepared for the request of Eskom and Trillian.     That is the point.     Ja, let me just finish.  So it is not as if the letter comes unexpected to Eskom and Eskom simply oh, it comes from McKinsey, we will act on the letter in good faith.  It was specifically Eskom and Trillian who requested the letter to be prepared according to Mr Amankwah.     Mr Chair, again, McKinsey is a world-renowned company, they are a global company.  If they receive a request from Mr Singh and Mr Singh says to them listen, I want this letter or it comes from Mr Molefe or it comes from Mr Govender or it comes from whoever in Eskom and he purports to request McKinsey to not factually represent the state of affairs that McKinseyknows, why would McKinsey issue the letter?  Or why would McKinsey have to issue the letter and that is where I am saying, if I request something in good faith I expect the reciprocation and therefore we rely on letters or we rely on assertions or we rely on representation or we rely on warrants that are made in good faith.     Ja, we – it is also contained, Chairperson, in Eskom bundle 13.     No, 14.     Okay.     Yes.  Yes, Chair, your – the Chairperson’s question about the condition should not be forgotten.     Ja, because, Mr Singh, we cannot turn a blind eye to the correction they made that the information was inaccurate and the people who drafted the letter have since been disciplined or have left the firm.    Ja.     Thank you, Chair.  Just for the benefit of the Chairperson, Mr Singh, in the same affidavit of Mr Amankwah and I will not read this Chair unless when you look at them you will find them crucial(?).    Yes, let us look at paragraph 7, Eskom bundle 14, Eskom bundle 14 page 702.191.    Ja, point 191.  You know it is just…     No, Chair.  You can put aside.     191, correct, Chair, paragraph 7.  And I am concluding on this because…     Remember Mr Amankwah said the information in the letter is inaccurate because they did not subcontract to Trillian and to say otherwise, would contradict information that existed at the time, in that last paragraph we read.And he deals with that in …[intervenes]     Okay.  He says in paragraph 21.7.     Ja.     I have – yes, Chair, I thought – sorry, Mr Singh, what did you want?  Let me ask you what did you want?     Oh.     Oh, just repeat, yes.  Okay, but you are on page …[intervenes]    That is right, Chair.  Paragraph 7, yes.     So before I read it, I want to underscore the paragraphs here by what Mr Amankwah says.     Which is what he said in paragraph 21.7.     Yes.       It is where he says it is inaccurate to say Trillian had been subcontracted in corporate plan as McKinsey’s subcontractor.To say otherwise is not reconcilable with contemporaneous information.  Yes.  So that is the underscore.  Then I go to this paragraph.  Do you hear, Mr Singh?     Yes Chairperson.     Chair if I may, before we take the lunch adjournment.    I think Mr Singh to add to what the Chairperson is saying the other factor I think Chair to be looked at is the fact that the letter doesn’t appear to have come voluntarily from McKinsey, in the sense of it did not come without a prior request, it came on the basis of a prior request from Eskom and Trillian, and you may want to answer the question Mr Singh why did Eskom make that request to McKinsey.   Could you, ja?    Yes.      Yes, Chair, let’s finish.     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson Mr Anoj Singh and his team wanted us to emphasise something that Mr Singh said during the testimony about Dr Weiss, that in his transcript when he was asked whether it     Ja, but from his affidavit I was making a different point.     About who McKinsey intended to be the supplier development partner and that it was in respect of the corporate plan, I mean the turnaround program based on that paragraph of Mr Singh’s affidavit.     Just give the date please?     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, I am going to move on.  Thank you, Chair, the - Chair I am goingto move on to the Master Services Agreement, which is this Corporate Plan, and I start off by the paragraph Mr Singh in Dr Weiss’s affidavit paragraph 29 and 30.     Yes, Chair.     Eskom bundle 14 (c), page number 690.     Six, nine, zero.     Yes, paragraph 29 and 30.     Yes, we read it previously but just to     Say again?     Interchangeably, yes.  So from these two paragraphs…[intervene]     Okay, I am going into approaches this with Mr Singh from what we read in here is that there was a delay on the part of Eskom in signing that Service Level Agreement, that agreement.  He then ultimately receivesthe signed copy in late September 2016 or early October 16 and when he signs it, he gives it a date of 11 January 16. The signing of it at the very latest, maybe September or earliest maybe September the latest October 2016.  But     That is correct, Mr Chair.     Thank you Chair.       You want the reference to the paragraph?    29 and 30.    Then as …    No can I just comment on this one?    Because I think he is not necessarily using them interchangeably.    It is because the turnaround programme Chairperson was going to be rendered pursuant to the SLA.    So I think he is using it deliberately.    To distinguish between the two.    Because on his version in the affidavit this – the SLA had not been concluded.  So what got to be terminated was their services as rendered in terms of the turnaround programme.  Because he does say they had already started rendering services.  So I think it is a deliberate use of words or choice of words there Mr Singh.    Yes.    Chair sorry Mr Singh.  Look at how he starts paragraph 29.    He says   Ja.    It is this acceptance and I suppose it isthe acceptance but because I want to – you will see how he deals with it in the second paragraph – I mean not paragraph    Yes.  According to my understanding he is specifically referring to as Mr Singh is saying to the Chairperson the letter of acceptance.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.  Correct.    That is correct.  I will – I mean one will have to see whether they canvass this with him during hisevidence.    When he was here on the 11 th of December 2020 Chair and how it was dealt with.    Ja I did.    Chairperson Eskom Bundle 14.    Yes.    Page 877.26.    Ja 877.26.     877.26.    Yes.    Subject line Chair.    No that is the one Chair.   Yes.    No look.    Page – can I give the Chairperson the page number?    811.    .111.  I see this – Mr Singh you – you might have the signed one by McKinsey.  This one is only signed by Mr Adrian Mabelane.    In your annexures.    The acceptance letter page 811.111.    Ja Eskom Bundle 14.  Eskom Bundle 14(c).    No 111.    Yes.  Mr Singh you are there?    You are there?   Ja I see in the bundle investigators have this one which is not signed by McKinsey and I was asking Mr Singh whether the one which is attached to his affidavit of this morning is signed by both parties.    Oh you do not reference no.    Yes Chair the investigator is checking exactly that.    The Chairperson’s second point or I think Mr Singh.    And the letter of …     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    H’m.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, just to envisage the point.  I think when you – as you follow the trial of documentation.The acceptance letter is17 December 2015.  And apparently it was counter signed by the parties on that date.  What Mr Singh has said in his affidavit is that the Service Level Agreement/MSA was concluded in January 2016.  This letter from Dr Weiss says the same.   “In January 2016, in negotiate the Master Services Agreement that we finally concluded in January 2016...”Now this is a letter of demand, Mr Singh, by McKinsey.  When he, Dr Weiss, puts the facts in theaffidavit, he explains how he signed the Master Services Agreement or when he signed it.  Now I want to take you to your own letter because the operative date here or month is June 2016.  Remember, we showed you your letter of the 19 t h  of February 2016, last time on your appearance, 19.     Chairperson, I want to go there.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     No, I think I was not answering your question, Chair.     In so far as it relates to the 24 t h.     No ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Thank you Mr Singh for that clarity.  So Mr Sing, then, talking about this date of January 2016 being the conclusion date and looking at Dr Weiss’ affidavit.  The last time we accepted to the bundle yourletter dated 19 February 2016 which we marked – we paginated as 877.156.  So it will be the – at the very end of Eskom Bundle 14(c), Chairperson.     877.156.       Eskom Bundle 14(c).     Page 77 ...[intervenes]     It might be D.     It might be D.     Yes, D.     This ...[intervenes]      877.     Yes.     No, Chair, you have the numbers in reverse order.       Yes, go to the very last – at the end ofit, Chairperson.     Of that very same bundle, Eskom 14(c).     To the very end of it.  877.     Yes.     Oh.     Oh, no.  I thought you heard me Chair.     Sorry.  It is eight ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Sorry, I thought ...[intervenes]      877.     Point 156.  Yes.       You do not have it there?    Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Which is ...[intervenes]      That in fact Chair ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chairperson.  It should have been formally – the bundle should have been formally updated, Chair.       Yes, I noted that a message has been sent already Chair.     Oh, yes.  Yes, and the Chairperson had requested that the first page be separated.     So that you have two – the front is enlarged to have two of these sheets in two pages.     But Chair I have made the request. Let me...     Let me move on.  Mr Singh, in this letter we – we have traversed this letter of 19 February 16 the last time.  The essence ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     And it says    H’m. “We also further note that Regiments Group is in a process of transition and that ultimate BEE partner would be Trillian Group.Eskom would like McKinsey to provide a response relating to an article published on page 9 of the Financial Mail, February 18 to February 24 regarding allegations associated with Mr Mohammed Bogart, a former employee of Regiments Group...”    And I will not read it.  I will go to what     It would help, Mr Singh, if you tell the Chairperson the facts as you knew them, because clearly, on the basis of the facts, you are now saying the Steering Committee meeting on the 9 t h of February 2016, this letter of yours and there will be another letter from McKinsey.  Two letters, in fact.  You would clearly have known that January cannot have been – January 2016 cannot have been the month in which the MSA was...     Yes.     It is the next page, Chair.     Yes.     It is the same situation.     I have paginated mine, I know because I had to ask for leave to have them admitted as exhibits.     But does the Chair have that letter of 25 February 2016?     That is correct.     Correct.     Correct, Chair, yes.     Correct.    Correct.  And there are certain relevant paragraphs here which might be of – which are of importance, Chair.  And I want to go to page one, two, three, four which has paragraphs (3) and (4) and (5).  I would read (4), Chairperson which is…     Ja. “The development of BEE partners as regards to the vision, aspirations, skills and competency mix.” Mr Singh, you have that in front of you?     Thank you.  It says    You see that and I think they too accepted – there was a paragraph I was looking for whichalso suggests that the proposed agreement to be concluded between you – between Eskom, sorry, not between you, between Eskom and McKinsey was also at a time envisaged that it would be signed.   We did read it previously but I cannot find it now, Chair.   Anyway, the subsequent letter, there is another letter, one of the 30 March 2016, where you are advised that they will also not subcontract with Trillian in respect of the MSA.   Do you recall that as well?     That letter …[intervenes]     Correct, Chair.     Yes because of the letter of the 30 March.     No, I am going to take it that far,Chair.     Because Mr Singh, when McKinsey – McKinsey is like a creditor, has on its version rendered services to Eskom.  You would understand why they say the agreement was concluded in January 2016 because they want to be paid.  They are demanding payment.  But when Dr Weiss puts in an affidavit – because now it is a sworn statement, he has to tell the Commission the true facts as to when he signed this agreement and that is what he says in his affidavit.  I do not know whether – because that letter does not say we signed the agreement in June 16, it says the agreement was concluded in January 16 which you have said – well, you did not say but on your version subsequent, that cannot be true becausethere was delayed from both sides and backdating from both sides.     But, Mr Singh, if the facts are as they are, it would have been Eskom which should have said but we have a defence to this claim, to this legal – to this demand in the sense that we have not signed the agreement or send it to them to sign, they have no leg to stand on.  It is you who should raise that as the person to be sued as opposed to the one who is suing you.     Why would?     Chair, just by way of reference, the letter of the 30 March 2016, is in the same bundle, Eskom bundle 14C, page 876.    Page 876, 877 and Chair you will see on 877 the penultimate paragraph still refers to a draft of the service level agreement.     Yes.     No, the point is made, Chair.     In what you said to me, I am just giving you the reference.     To where you will see even McKinsey     Okay.     No, Chair, sorry, please turn to 877.    The penultimate paragraph    Is it in the same paragraph, Chair?     Oh yes, okay, I see.  Not that is the termination of McKinsey’s further discussions with Trillian for Trillian to become their subcontractor.     Yes.     So then they decide here that Trillian will not be McKinsey’s supply development partner.     Correct, correct.     No.     I think – I wanted to follow up on that demand.     Can I follow up on the demand, Chair?     Mr Singh, you see, it seems to – itseems on the documentation that the payment or the decision to make a payment to McKinsey came from Eskom and McKinsey only reacted pursuant to the letter of termination and I would you like you to quickly, before we take the adjournment to turn to the same bundle, page 829.19 which is a submission to the BTC.  Eskom bundle 14C, 829.19.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes, so that is before McKinsey’s letter    Yes.     Yes, thank you, Chair.  Now Mr Singh would you have had sight of this before?     Yes.     Yes, so in this submission Mr Singh it ...[indistinct – coughing] the BTC it appears that the willingness to make a payment, negotiate and finalise on cost came from the part of Eskom, even before the letter of demand, even before the purported termination of the MSA or SLA.  Your comment?     So it appears from this document, this submission to the BTC, that the willingness to make a payment under the MSA, even before it is terminated, purportedly terminated, even before the letter of demand you have referred to of McKinsey, that Eskom was willingto negotiate and finalise on the cost with McKinsey.     Your comment?     Evidently Mr Chair.   Okay thank you Chairperson.  Chair we will ask Mr Singh about allegations made by the travel agent in due course.   By the travel agents in due course.    But Mr Singh has indicated in an affidavit the supplementary affidavit that he wishes first to have – for his team – legal team to engage with the legal team for Mr Essa before he responds to those allegations. But we have agreed that he could deal with some of the aspects relevant to or arising from that affidavit.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Chairperson before I proceed during the adjournment my learned friends made a request to me in regard to that letter of the 28th of June 2016 which is in Eskom Bundle 14(c) page 743.  A request which I am not going to do I am told is that…    I am not going to do what they are asking me to do.   But I need to place it on record.    What they are asking could be done is to have the letter the bullet points in that letter read to the record because the letter seeks to quote clauses of the – of the contract and we produced them in this letter and they wanted me to give Mr Singh the opportunity to comment on them.    Ja.    No the former.    The reading into the record.    Because…    Ja because the question is where would Dr Weiss and Mr Vikas Sagar have obtained these clauses if he says in his affidavit that the contract was only sent to him in late September early October 2016?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Singh you have referred the Chairperson to that letter – the letter from McKinsey which is a letter essentially of demand and the – I suppose you knowwhat your legal representatives wish to have done are you able to comment on the clauses that are quoted in that letter?    And Mr – Dr Weiss even agrees.    Yes, no thank you Chair because –because Mr Singh your letter of the 19 th of February would not have been drafted the way it was drafted if you believed that the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions went about the existence of the agreement.    No I am talking about you Mr Singh.  You wrote a letter on the 19 th of February.    2016 and you said the –  “The signing of the proposed agreement”    There was 00   Yes.  Thank you Chair I – and the letter is what it is is the signing of the proposed contract is contingent or if you want to use a simple word is dependent upon the receipt of satisfactory responses to the above question.  It is a proposal but I am going to leave it there Mr Singh.  If you want to comment you may comment but I amgoing to leave it there.    You have already said to the Chairperson – ja.    Ja.    But based on this letter Mr Singh and you were expecting a response I suppose from McKinsey is it notfair to say it would be expected of you to know when exactly was this SOA signed?     H’m.     Ja.     Ja, I am not going into it, Chair.  [laughs]       My question was about Mr Singh’s knowledge as to – well, that, would it not be fair, based on his letter of the 19 t h, to expect that he would know when is     Oh.     Yes.     Yes.     But by ...[intervenes]      I hope ...[intervenes]     Okay.     Yes.  But Mr Singh, if you wanted these aspects to be satisfied, you, Eskom.  It would be you, Eskom if they are not met and satisfied that you would not sign the contract.  I mean, McKinsey stands to be benefit.  It can ignore this thing and signs the contract, render services and get paid.       But it is to your benefit because the demand or the request for these conditions or theseaspects to be met, it is – it comes from you.     And I want to deal with one of them but let me give you a chance to just address the Chairperson.  What do you say to that?     Okay.     Yes.  And one of them, it seems, was     Yes.    H’m.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, I am sureMr Mabelane, he is going to tell – to you as to whether or not this requirements were met because you heard the matter, they wrote it back to you.  You need to tell us what you know because you communicated directly to McKinsey and not ...[intervenes]      Okay.     H’m.     Thank you, Chair.  And on the one, MrSingh, on which you agree with me was never met, Dr Weiss, which is the BEE partner, Dr Weiss – Chair, I am just going to refer to paragraph 74 of Eskom bundle 14 page 700.     I will read it to you, Chair.     Because he talks about …[intervenes]     Okay, page 700, of Dr Weiss’paragraph 74, maybe the Chairperson can go there as well.     Paragraph 74.  Essentially what he is     700.     Paragraph 74. “Given the short period of time between McKinsey’s proposal of the SD and L fund and the termination of the turnaround programme by Eskom’s board in June 2016, we ultimately were not able to identify any new partners prior to the termination of theturnaround programme.” So that requirement was in fact never ever fulfilled.  Do you see that?     Is it a yes or no to my question?     No, the way he is, not me.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay, what is your answer?     Thank you, Chair.  And just to clarify this, Mr Singh, that one requirement says the development of a BEE partner (Regiments Group) as regards the vision.  So it appears to have been very specific.  It may not have been to Trillian but it was definitely to Regiments, specific to Regiments.     Your letter of 19 February, number 4.    No, I am saying you were saying earlier your requests were not specific to Trillian, the BEE partner request but it is in fact specific to an entity, Regiments Group.     That was?     Okay …[intervenes]     No, no, all I wanted to place on record because you were saying your requests were not specific to a particular BEE partner.     I am saying that your letter was.  That is all I wanted to place in record.     Chair, should we carry on until halfpast six or less?     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.INQUIRY ADJOURNS    Yes Chair, I ...[intervenes]     Ja, no I thought we could finish the McKinsey matters when I was saying at half past six enquiring with the Chairperson at that time.   Exactly during that space of time.     Which was about 25 minutes.     That would have left us with the Tegeta matters, the Tegeta transactions which we have led evidence on them previously before the commission and I envisage that we could run quite fast with her on those matters in the morning tomorrow.    I think we will need the whole morning Chair.     Yes.    Yes, so now it will be well, I should not only mention Tegeta, because the travel agent ...[intervenes]    Issue should also be touched upon.   But I can finish, I think we can finish the McKinsey matters now.    In, I have anticipated 30 minutes.     Roughly, I do not know whether ...[intervenes]     Ja, we might finish earlier than that.    Mr Singh, Eskom bundle 14 Mr Singh, page 769 ...[intervenes]    Ja, back upon that service level agreement.     Page 769.  This is going to go fairly fast Mr Singh.      769.   Are you in the right bundle?    Paragraph 22.  The PFMA requirement.  So the clause reads, Chairperson you are there?  Is the Chairperson there as well?    Thank you Chair.     It is the same service level agreementChair.     Clause 22 of this agreement, PFMA   Mr Koko.    When he was here he said this MSA or SLA should never have been concluded because Eskom did not obtain the national treasury approval to conclude, to appoint McKinsey on a risk basis as opposed to a tariff basis.  I suppose you do not disagree with him.    The question is ...[intervenes]   Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh, what transpired in Court is consistent with what Mr Koko said.  Which is that in order to appoint McKinsey on a risk basis contract that Eskom required to have the approval of the national treasury.He distinguished that appointment from what Eskomdid in regard to McKinsey in relation to their corporate plan.  He said the corporate plan was specifically on a confinement but on a fixed rate.  Well, the amount was agreed or the contract price was agreed. In this case it was on a risk basis.  That you are paid only if you achieve the outcome of the contract.  He said to the Chairperson the conclusion of the contract without the national treasury approval, was wrong,  it should not have been done. What exactly are you saying to what he is saying?   No.  I say what was said in the court papers where Eskom sued McKinsey and Trillian  ...[intervenes]    Say again?    Yes.     It carried the same theme that there was no national treasury approval.  Mr Koko came here and said the same thing.  So I am trying to understand just inresponse to that what are you saying?    Yes.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh, the starting point in regard to the requirement for national treasury is exactly the appointment on a risk basis in Mr Radebe’s affidavit.  That affidavit is in Eskom bundle, 14D.  Eskom bundle 14D.  I will give you the page reference.  11, page 1194.    Paragraph 79, on paragraph 79.  Well, Chair sorry can we start so that it makes sense.  Let us start on page 1193.  I will read from the last paragraph 78.4.    Sorry Chair?    Oh, yes.     Sorry Chair, thank you.    Yes.  This is an affidavit Chairperson ofMr Phakemani Radebe.  There is a founding affidavit which was filed in the court case, number 22877/2018.  The applicant there being Eskom Holdings against five respondents; firstly McKinsey and company and the second being Trillian Management Consulting, the third being Capital Partners and then the National Director of Public Prosecution was also cited, as well as the fifth respondent, MMS Nxumalo and oh, the affidavit starts on page 1161 of Eskom Bundle D, and it runs all the way to page 1132 and is dated 29 March 2018.     Yes.  Yes, yes Chairperson.  Page 1193.  There are a couple of issues but I want to concentrate on this one of the national treasury requirement.  I will start Mr Singh rather at paragraph 78.3.     Okay.    And ...[intervenes]     Thank you Chair.  The allegations gofurther with the opinions that are obtained by Eskom, which says approval is required and then by McKinsey where it says well, we are not sure but let us take a chance, let us proceed without an approval.  But of course McKinsey Mr Singh alluded earlier that they have come on record, saying they were misled by Eskom.Eskom said to them they had obtained the approval when in fact they had not obtained.  Is that correct Mr Singh, that is what McKinsey is saying?    Of McKinsey’s version?    Whether or not they are right is another matter, but I was saying but you understand what I am saying.    Because you can come back and explain it tomorrow, whether or not they are right that they were misled, is another matter.  All I am saying is you alluded to that version that earlier that they said they weremisled into thinking that Eskom had obtained the national treasury approval. That is all I am saying now.    Yes.     Yes.     No, I am not going there.  We can deal with it tomorrow.    But you know that version of theirs.    Yes, okay that is all.      We will deal with it tomorrow, because then on page 1199 Chairperson, paragraph 87.    1199, paragraph 87.  Then the affidavit    Ja, I know it is somewhere there.  We can go into it tomorrow, but first and foremost is the issue of the approval.  Does it mean you knew, or you said it was not within your purview?  So then Mr Koko had knowledge because he was in that meeting.  The policy was signed by him, dated August 2015.  I suppose well, let me ask you this whether you can dispute what he is saying about the requirement of the approval?     Ja, but I think ...[intervenes]      He has cut a long story short Mr Singh, when he came here he was unequivocal, he was very clear to the Chairperson, Chair you will recall I even said that helps, that saves us three hours of going into the MSA, so if you go to his transcript the 29 t h of March 2021 that is when he testified.     Thank you Chair.        Well that was the first point.     The second point Mr Singh is on page 811, point 416.     Of that – no sorry, sorry Chair.   That is on Bundle 14.     I envisaged Chair, I think I am going to propose we adjourn, I envisage there is going to be a lot of questions from this.     Ja.     Yes, it is already on the website.  That would be 9 March 2021.     I think so ten o’ clock is fine.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yes good morning Chair person.     First of all we want to apologise for being late this morning.     Unfortunately as it go with these things we had a few challenges some of them personal others just running late so we apologise for not being here on time.     Thank you.     Chairperson before Mr Seleka start.     Based on the questions that was asked on the last occasion we prepared an affidavit for Mr Singh.  We believe that it is in the interest of this commission that Mr Singh start with some of those issues. I think having regard to where we were on the last occasion it would give you an the commission clarity on – on some important issues.  So we – we beg leave for Mr Singh to first deal with the issues that is in the affidavit before Mr Pule continues leading his evidence.     ...sir ...[intervenes]      Sorry, to interrupt.  Maybe just to place on record that we have in writing – probably on the go, requested the unredacted versions of bothDr Weiss’ and Fines’ affidavits.  As I think in my client’s response to with what we were given, he makes it quite clear that he has only been given certain pages with certain paragraphs but up to now – and I think I have approached my learned friend, also, on one of the occasions ...[intervenes]      ...but we have not yet received the unredacted versions.     Except that, Chairperson ...[intervenes]      I think what my client is trying toexplain and what we are trying to explain is that at the time when he responded ...[intervenes]      It was a partial response to a redacted version.     So, basically, he cannot be faltered for only dealing with those specific paragraphs.     Chairperson, I think the letter that we are speaking about is AS19.     To my client’s affidavit.     So I am going to leave it there because I have got a further issue with the interpretation that is attached to the letter but I am going to let my client deal with it.     And if necessary, I will bring it to your attention.  Thank you very much.     Sorry, it is AS7, my attorney just corrected me.     It is from 16-697, it is in the black…    Chairperson with the greatest ofrespect to my learned friend if you look at the letters it is specifically refers to the MSA.  Now my client has alluded to the fact that there is other letters that precedes this. We have attached them to our current agreement but they all consistently refer to the MSA so there can be no doubt that they did – they are referring…    Not to a programme but to an agreement.    Chairperson can we just all get on the same page.  I do not know what my learned friend is referring to at this stage maybe he can just guide us.   Chairperson maybe just for the record I do not think for purposes of your discussion it wouldreally make a difference if you look at the one that is not sighed.  I think what you are interested in is what exactly is stated in the letter of acceptance whether it can be construed as an agreement or not visa vie the points that you raise.  And I think for that purpose you can look at the one that is signed by only one party.    Chairperson in fact Dr Weiss refers to it.  He says that they have signed the letter of acceptance in December of 2015.    On the 17 th of December 2015.  As I say the – my learned friend might not be able to lay his hands on the actual signed one but you can accept it for a fact that is what is stated that there was a signed letter of acceptance by the same date that they got the offer.    They have signed the acceptance and that is the 17 th of December 2015.    Chairperson I think maybe it is also prudent to place on record that we were also over the weekend served additional documents etcetera.    And based on that I have informed my learned friend I do not want to go into the details is that we most probably going to do another affidavit to deal inter alia with some of the issues that is now being raised in respect of McKinsey and the witness’ which would most probably make incriminating statements with reference topeople but time will be needed to actually serve it on the relevant persons.      So the – even if we come to the end of Mr Seleka’s examination by tomorrow we cannot take it further.    We have however when it comes to the issue of the travel agent agreed Mr Seleka can ask him about the various invoices.    But what my client has done he has gone and he has analysed it and he has drafted a little spread sheet to be able to deal with those issues.    So he can to that extent.    He feels comfortable enough to with reliance on this deal with the various invoices etcetera.    And that we think would also assist in speeding things along.    At this stage.    Chairperson it would even go a little bit further in lieu of spending a lot of time on re-examining.    We will take care of those issues.    And literally just highlight it.     Under oath say we refer to this issue, this issue and I think that would save a lot of time.   Because I think you can see there is going to be a number issues to be dealt with in re-examination.    Thank you.     Chairperson, I would be the last person to indicate to you that you should not use as much time as you do but my – I have already placed on record that over the weekend we were served with extra papers.  Reading those papers I understand from my client took most of yesterday because then I think on a Saturday evening he got a whole bundle of annexures.  Based on that, the client then had to go and read other documents to place it in context.  If you work throughout the weekend, and in fact he started on Friday, I do not think it is fair to a witness and Chairperson, you know it yourself from practicing, to keep a person that is tired in a box and keep on pushing, pushing, pushing, people lose their concentration and was it dependent on me I would have said it is – let us try and push through but at this point Iwould rather let us start tomorrow early.  I think we have made up two hours of the hour and a half we lost this morning.  I would much rather that we start tomorrow morning early and give my client an opportunity to – ja.     Chairperson, may we take maybe two minutes of your time, if we can adjourn for two minutes, let us just confirm with our client.

MR SINGH:  Anoj Singh.    I do not.    I do.    So help me God.    Black numbers, correct?    I am there.    Paragraph 38?    Yes Sir.    Sorry just repeat that 7?   .221    224?    Thank you Mr Chair and again just from my side just apology for the delay that we had caused this morning.    But we – at least I am of the view that the information that was provided this morning would eventually in time.    Reduce the amount of time we would have to spend on this one.    Thank you for…    Mr Chair just a couple of points before we go into the – the responses.  Firstly in terms of Dr Weiss’ affidavit Mr Chair I would like to place on record that the – the paragraphs that I am asked to respond do not form part of the 3.3 Notice that we have received.    Part of the 3.3 Notices that we have received.   Relating to Mr Weiss’ statement because we received a redacted version.    To that statement.    Right.    Well we have not received the unredacted version I think as of here – as at now but obviously we have read it now to Mr Seleka’s passage.    Was now, we did have, or I certainly have occasion to read Dr Weiss’ transcripts.     Relating to his evidence.  And secondly ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, the point is taken.     I think my additional comment regarding thisis, Mr Chair.  If the issue relating to Dr Weiss was going to be relevant to the discussion ...[intervenes]      The affidavit of Dr Weiss ...[intervenes]      ...was relevant and produced in the bundle.     Mr Seleka is correct in saying that the affidavit that we have been provided to before did not implicate me.  Yet we comment on the paragraphs thatwere required to comment.  If it was as significant as what we are now saying, my question is.  Notwithstanding the fact that it does not implicate me, we should have been given the opportunity to comment on it in its entirety.     On the redacted version, Mr Chair.     Not this one.     Yes, Mr Chair, but the comment around not being implicated relates to the unredacted version.     And a similar point I have with Mr Amankwah.     Yes, it is ...[intervenes]      Yes, it is now going back to the bundle.  We have access to it ...[intervenes]      ...because of Mr Seleka has ...[intervenes]      ...has given it to us.     But again, if we were placing such reliance on this document, as we are now doing, then I would have at least expected that this would have been provided to us for us to provide an appropriate affidavit.     Ja, I realise that.     I just want to place on record ...[intervenes]      ...my reservations.     But I am done.     So in that light, we can continue.    Mr Chair, I am just trying to think the best of way of dealing with this issue.  Okay, it is fine.  Let us deal with 692 first, relating to Dr Weiss’ comments.     Sorry, sir, 692.     Mr Chair, if we look at the paragraphs that have been referred to by Advocate Seleka, as he had mentioned, they relatively have one theme that runs throughout, is that mister – Dr Weiss was of the view, at some point in time, there was Regiment that was doing certain amount of work and there was then a period of timewhen there was a, let us call it a merger or acquisition type of initiative that was happening between Regiments and Trillian.       Okay let us call it a buy-out.       Yes.     Yes.     So, Mr Chair, I think – I certainly do not deny that but what I want to raise in terms of the issue relating to the – whether Mr Weiss has concretely concluded that Trillian or Regiments had done the copy plan work.  If you have reference to his transcripts, those that I have read, then we can probably go to the relevant paragraph.When he was posed the questions, Chair, it was not definitively answered.  He basically said, there were emails, there was training, there were people, there were meetings and Regiments and Trillian people attended thesemeetings.     Attended these meetings.     They were trained as such.     Emails came from Trillian email addresses.  They came from Regiments’ email addresses.  So he could not conclusively conclude that Trillian had not done the work, from my recollection of his transcripts.  And that ismy response to the question relating to Dr Weiss’ comments.     Mr Chair, for now.  If you allow me?     Yes.     Mr Chair, I do not think whether Trillian had a subcontractor for McKinsey was put to Dr Weiss.     So ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, firstly, the passage that you are referring to comes from Mr Amankwah(?).     Not Dr Weiss.     And I will deal with that when we are dealing with ...[intervenes]      But for now my response relating to theparagraphs is that, from what I recall from Dr Weiss’ transcripts is that he is not definitive on the question ...[intervenes]      He was not definitive.     In terms of saying Regiments’ people did the work ...[intervenes]      On the Corporate Plan.    He was not.     Yes.  And I will come back to this point when I deal with the issue of Mr Amankwah’s comments.  In having to deal with Mr Amankwah’s comments.  I think, Mr Chair, I will have to refer you back to one of my affidavits.  I am not too sure which one it is.  It is the one that we responded to the Corporate Plan.       Filed there?     [No audible reply- silence]     Sorry, sir.  I am there.  I am just looking for the relevant paragraphs.     in terms of the STLN - I think I have found itin paragraph 15.     You see, Mr Chair, if you look at para – so     Mr Chair, we can check that but my understanding and my recollection of the transcripts was, if that was a response to a question as to whether he could say whether Regiments or Trillian was actually the people that did the work on the Corporate Plan.  Further, Mr Chair, I would like to take you to the emails that relate to the 9 t h of February letter.  I am just trying to find it.       Sorry, Mr Seleka.     Just give me one second.  I just want ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Mr Chair.  I am not sure where this...  Sorry.       I am looking for the emails that relate to the9 t h of February letter.     It is a string of emails Mr Chair.     That culminated in the issuance of this 9 t h of ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Trillian.       It is in one of the affidavits but while welooking for that, Mr Chair.  In the interest of primarily, I can just deal with ...[intervenes]      No, I will deal with Mr Amankwah’s ...[intervenes]      Responses to the ...[intervenes]      ...while we are trying to find this.    So we are looking at Mr Amankwah’s issues relating to paragraph 20.18(?).       No, no I am saying ...[intervenes]      I will come back once we find it.     If we indeed have then.     Yes.     Yes?     Yes.     That is correct, sir.    That is correct, sir.     Yes, sir.     Mr Chair, as I said.  I will check thesetranscripts and come back, if indeed it is that ...[intervenes]      ...we will, obviously, accept that.     But for now I am saying, the reason why I put this is because of my distinct recollection that this was asked.     As it relates to page 29 of his transcript.     Yes.       So, Mr Chair, in terms of responding toMr Amankwah’s affidavit relating to paragraphs – sorry, on page 702.221, which is paragraphs 20.18, 21.1, 21.2 and 21.7.  Mr Chair, in order for me to respond.  Or well, now...  Okay.  I would need for the Chairperson to actually go to paragraph 21.5.     Yes.  Yes, sir.     Let me just get it for you, sir.  It will be on, Mr Chair, 702.221.      It is starting on 702.221, which is at – where you stopped at and you have quoted all of those paragraphs.     Right.     So, Mr Chair, in order for me to respond to those specific paragraphs and the issue that was put to me by Mr Seleka.  If we – I would need for the Chairperson to go to paragraph 21.5 which is on page 702.221.     Okay.     Mr Chair, if you would allow me, I will read the following.  This 9 t h of February 2016 letter have been prepared at the request of Eskom.     And Trillian.     At the request of both.     Okay.     Well, Mr Chair, that is ...[intervenes]      Yes.     And Trillian.  IN order to streamline the process for Trillian to receive payments for work, it had undertaken to that date in conjunction with the Corporate Project Plan.     Paragraph 21.5.     Oh, sorry, yes.  701... 702.222.    Paragraph 21.5.     It says – let me start again, Mr Chair.     Yes. “This 9 t h of February 2016 letter has been prepared at the request of Eskom and Trillian in order to streamline the process for Trillian to receive payment for work it had taken –undertaken up to that date in connection with     It then puts in brackets    So what it says to me, Mr Chair, that this letter was not simply contemplated by somebody in McKinsey that made a mistake to this letter.     Firstly.  Secondly.  He then goes off to state in paragraph 21.1, 21.5(1).    Yes. “Dr Weiss and McKinsey partner and Mr Sagar, consulted with McKinsey’s legal advisor regarding the content of the letter. As a result, certain internal communication are subject to attorney-client privilege and have not been reflected below...”But what is important for me is that Dr Weiss, whose affidavit we have just been through, is part of thisprocess in preparing this letter.     Well, that was the other raised point that counsel going to raise, but I ...[intervenes].     Yes, exactly.     Right?     And Mr Chair, we will implore that we will actually get there.     Because we would like to see what this was.     Then on subparagraph 2 it says    Mr Chair, then 21.5(2)    Evinces?     Never heard the word.  (8) “Mr Clive Angel followed up Mr Vikas’ email noting that Trillian had invoiced Eskom and under the conditions of the letter McKinsey needs to write to Eskom to the effect that McKinsey was satisfied with the work Trillian had done on the corporate plan.  Eskom never requested such a letter of satisfaction and McKinsey sent such confirmation.  Eskom has confirmed that the 9 February did not initself basically…” I would like to stop there, Mr Chair, in terms of the question that was posed by – or the issue that was raised by Mr Seleka is that, Mr Chair, I do not believe that if you read these passages that it can be simply dismissed, that this letter was an erroneous letter that just happened to be issued and for …[intervenes]     Mr Chair, in terms of the email trail that I am requesting is provided, you will even see post the letter the legal head of McKinsey follows up on the letter to suggest is there anything further that has actually happened relating to this letter.  He then escalates it to the head of the accounts department within McKinsey to say please follow up on this matter and make sure it is dealt with.  He then sends an email to Eskom saying to Eskom – and this went to a lady called Mary-Anne Hendricks who I think is the PA of Mr Prish Govender who was the project manager on this project which states that should you have any issues relating to this matter further, please bring it to my attention within McKinsey so I can elevate it to the appropriate leadership level within the company to ensure that these things are streamlined.  Now, Mr Chair, takingall of that into account I will not understand how McKinsey basically says that this letter was prepared on the basis that it was incorrect and stand away from it.Mr Chair, this brings me to another point that I would like to make to the Commission for the Commission to take note of.  Mr Chair, these documents, this letter, 9 February letter, is a letter that has been issued by McKinsey signed by a partner of McKinsey, received by Eskom.  Now, Mr Chair, when Eskom receives this letter, in what mind does Eskom receive it?  It receives it in goodfaith that McKinsey has issued this letter.  What does Eskom do with it?  Eskom places reliance on it that this letter was received in good faith.Now for whatever reason, McKinsey decides to sidestep this letter and say no, we did not issue it or it was invalid or for the fact that these two clauses in the agreement was not fulfilled by Eskom therefore it is invalid.  Part for one minute, Mr Chair, the fact that the letter may have in Eskom been used for other purpose but for now, the purpose that we are using the letter is to understand whether McKinsey at any point in time contemplated Trillian to be their SDL partner and from what I have read to you, Mr Chair, I cannot find it in my being to suggest that they were not.So McKinsey can say and do whatever they wantbut on objective fact that I have just read to you, in Mr Amankwah’s affidavit himself which suggested that they at all material times believed that Trillian should have been paid for the work that they did on the corporate plan.     Yes, Sir.    Mr Chair, again, if we look at …[intervenes]     Mr Chair …[intervenes]     Mr Chair, I do, on the basis that it is forming part of the letter.     Mr Chair, I think before we go and answerthat question…     Let us deal with the issue that Mr Seleka had posed to me.     Relating to the identity of the party that performed the services.     And I am saying, given the content of this letter in terms of sentences one and two of paragraph 1, it is clear for all intents and purposes and at all material times McKinsey understood that Trillian had been doing the work and there was a subcontract, they were the subcontractor to them …[intervenes]    Okay, okay.  Alright, so at the date of this letter, Chair.     Not it would appear, it is factual that based on the paragraphs that I have read to you from Mr Amankwah’s letter – I mean, Mr Amankwah’s affidavit, as well as the – which results in this letter of 9 February, itwould – it is that McKinsey accepted that Trillian would be their subcontractor on the corporate plan.     Mr Chair, I would hazard to say it is your second interpretation and I will tell you why I say so.  Firstly the reference “the agreement” which can only be the corporate plan agreement because they actually define it in the first sentence, okay?And secondly, Mr Amankwah in the passages that I have read to you, states that the bit on which this letterwas prepared in the process that I had taken you through, by that time the work relating to the corporate plan had substantially been completed.     If you recall the corporate plan would have needed to be submitted by the 28 February.     And this is around the 9 t h, so substantial completion was achieved by that time.     Oh, yes.  So hopefully, Mr Chair, this puts paid to the issue of whether the identity of the party relating to the corporate plan is still a mystery or not.  In my view, it should not.  In terms …[intervenes]     Well, Mr Chair, the fact that the people …[intervenes]     Yes, Mr Chair.       I think again, Mr Chair, not going back to the issue…     But the fact that someone has beendisciplined, someone who has left the organisation, does not detract from the fact that this is a legitimate letter.     Coming back to the issue of, Mr Chair …[intervenes]     Not the conditions.  Mr Chair, as I understand it, once Mr Angel – once this letter was transmitted to …[intervenes]    To Eskom and to Trillian and after Mr Angel’s subsequent amendments to the letter was rejected, Trillian’s CFO, Mr Lebalo, issued a letter or an email to McKinsey requesting this sign-off in terms of these proceedings and I think the email had been sent to Mr Lawrence Chamberlain a McKinsey manager or senior partner and he then in the email basically said the sign-off should be sent to Mr Edwin Mabelane.  In terms of whether the sign-off was actually provided or not, I am not too sure, but I know that a request had been made.  In my affidavit I do go to the extent of saying that Mr Govender also engaged with Mr Lawrence to understand whether this is approved by McKinsey or not.  I do not have an email to prove that Mr Lawrence had given the go-ahead but maybewhen Mr Govender is requested for an affidavit or when Mr Govender appears he can be asked and Mr Edwin Mabelane can also be asked in terms of what was the status of these conditions being [indistinct – dropping voice] or not.     No, Sir.    Other than the documents …[intervenes]     No, I did not …[intervenes]     Yes.     191?     Sorry, Mr Chair, can you just repeat?     21.7?     No, no, you started speaking and I was not listening.     So I just said if you could just repeat what you have said.     So which are those paragraphs?     21.7?     That is what I was looking for.     CHAIRPERSON    Indeed, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, in terms of the passages that were read by Mr Seleka, firstly I would like to point to 7.1.  It is disingenuous of Mr Amankwah to say that McKinsey was notified late in the contracting process that Eskom would require and SD partner for work being performed at Eskom.  This is not the first piece of work that McKinsey was doing at Eskom, so they know that there is always an SDL portion relating to McKinsey work – I mean, work at a state owned company like Eskom.In terms of late, Mr Chair, he signed – Dr Weisssigned a letter of acceptance for the work I think on the 29 September 2015 which indicated that 30% SDL partner.  So before that date they could have not known that they would get this work because it was not approved.  So how would we have told them before that?  So it could not have been late in the process.The letter that he signed acknowledged that 30% had to be sub-contracted, an acceptable statement that he made.   In terms of the rest of the paragraphs that Mr Seleka is saying Mr Chair again if you look at paragraph 7.5 for example McKinsey’s decision to proceed with the Corporate Plan, without a formal contract in place with any supplier, with a supplier development partner, it doesn’t say Regiments, it says a supplier development partner, is an example of the mistake that should not have been madecontinuous to the last sentence of this paragraph, the lack of contractual rigour is an example of the type of mistake McKinsey has sought to remedy with the updates to its policies described below.  Now they – Mr Amankwah and McKinsey specifically try and obfuscate the obligation relating to the fact that they had a relationship with Trillian, originally with Regiments and it morphed into Trillian and for whatever reason that currently is playing out, whether it be political or reputational or otherwise they are attempting toobfuscate the actual facts that were available at the time, and I will come back to paragraph 27, at 21.7 Mr Chair, because it is now very convenient to say although Regiments worked on the Corporate Plan and was overseen by Eskom the ambiguity surrounding the relationship between McKinsey and Regiments, with respect to the Corporate Plan led to confusion amongst McKinsey staff and allowed Regiments to undertake work with less supervision.Mr Chair I can understand if my kids were confused, this is the Legal Head of McKinsey South Africa, it is the head of their Accounts Department, two senior partners from McKinsey are involved in the process.  Dr Weiss has two PHD’s, not one, two.   Now you are trying to tell me that these individuals that were part of the process, thatwas involved on a daily basis, that met me almost on a daily basis, were involved in meetings relating to all of these projects, were all of a sudden confused, and had ambiguity in their mind to produce a formal letter that went through the rigour of the process I just explained to you and now McKinsey is of the view that it was ambiguous.I cannot reconcile the two Mr Chair.   If you go back to 21.7 which is on page 702, point 224 Mr Chair such evidence makes it clear that Trillian was not McKinsey’s sub-contractor, because it was not contemporaneous withthe information that exist.Mr Chair I took you through the information that exist, it is just convenient for McKinsey to now state that it was Regiments that was doing the work at the time.   There is no ambiguity in my view and I do not believe that McKinsey can claim ambiguity.   If anything Mr Chair if you look at the process that letter went through for it to be issued, and if McKinsey distance itself from that letter now we should be asking the question who actually committed fraud.     Mr Chair.     I will just ask Mr Seleka to repeat the question.     Mr Chair I was not the guy – I was not the person that requested the letter but I would assume that the letter was requested as Trillian has indicated that Eskom required confirmation that the main contractor was happy that the sub-contractor would be paid directly in terms of the content of the letter, and if you look at the emails that were attached to it and Mr Amankwah’sconfirmation that could only be the reason for the letter.     What page sir?     It was used interchangeably, that is correct.     I said it was used interchangeably.     Sorry, Mr Chair, if I just can clarify that point.     I said, if I can also just clarify that point.  It would seem that at some point in time, between Eskom andMcKinsey, they had contemplated concluding a Master Services Agreement which is the MSA and additionally, SLA’s or Service Level Agreements.  So there would be an overarching Master Services Agreement and then basically underpinning the Master Service Agreement, there will be these individual Service Level Agreements, from what I understand, but eventually it migrated into the SLA.     Yes.     Yes, matters, as I understood it, but I do not think it actually…[intervene]     Went that way.     And that enhanced the interchangeable use of MSA.     Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, I think in responding, I would, in the interest of time, not want to traverse the whole issue of the 1034 document which I think you and Mr Koko and Mr Seleka has traversed quite significantly in Mr Koko’s last appearance at the Commission.      No, no I mean, at the end of the day, it was what I had started in my previous sessions and I think it was further amplified by Mr Koko.     And hence, in the interest of time, I will notrepeat that but it also does form part of our affidavit that we have submitted into the record or it will be submitted into the record as of today.      So from that perspective, the sentiments are alike.     So in response to Mr Seleka’s question about an agreement not being in place, in terms of the 1034 document, there is a legally binding commitment betweenEskom and McKinsey on signing of this, and that was done.     No, Mr Chair.     Remember, there was a letter of acceptance that was signed by McKinsey and Eskom dated 6 t h December 2015.  So that creates the legal obligation between Eskom and McKinsey, as of December and that is the basis on which they begin work in January, based on the temporary order, so that's the first response.     Mr Chair, I am saying there was an offer an acceptance therefore there was an agreement.     Based on the offer, which was a letter that was sent on the 6 t h of December, so, it is the first part of the response. Mr Chair then he - then if you look at the next part of paragraph 29 – and actually Mr Weiss concedes that the letter of acceptance was binding on Eskom comment. He     Yes, sir.     That is correct, sir.      So, Mr Chair I will come to the letter itself, Mr Seleka is correct in that the MSA was terminated via a BTC resolution, a Board Tender Committee resolution and that then empowered Mr Mabelane to inform McKinsey of the termination via a letter, the letter that was dated 16 June 2016.  Subsequent to that, Mr Chair, there were various letters that were exchanged between Mr Mabelane and Dr Weiss regarding the termination between, let us say, the 16 t h and the 28 t h, which is the letter in question, which is at 743.  And the letter in question at 743 Mr Chair, is thefinal letter but our affidavit that we have submitted this morning covers the other letters that transpired before them.  But for the purposes of now, let us just cover the issue relating to the issues that appear on 743.  Now, if we     That is correct, yes.     So you will see or note Mr Chair that the letter refers to a previous letter of 24 June 2016, in the first four lines.     Mr Chair, the gist of the…[intervene]     Just in terms of background, the previous letters that Mr Mabelane had sent to McKinsey and you will see it when you see that, they will deal with it.  But just ingist Mr Mabelane terminated the relationship and also in his letters referred to the fact that because of the termination, Eskom will not reimburse them on a risk basis.  But he will reimburse them on a cost, on a time and material basis let us put it that way and the exchange of letters prior to this letter related thereto which culminated in this letter.  So, this letter Mr Chair, basically, is McKinsey's, let us call it for a want of a better word, McKinsey’s letter of demand vis a vis…[intervene]     Demand.      In inverted commas.     Vis a vis it is the termination of the Masters Service Level Agreement.     So, Mr Chair, I will read the most relevant     Mr Chair, the point that I would like to make is that if you take this letter, which is dated June 28, 2016.  It is difficult to understand how Mr Weiss in paragraph 30 refers to a date in September when these things are concluded yet he is signing a letter in June, that references a January date.     What I am saying either one of these things are not true.     Yes, and I am saying this ostensibly is a letter that we received again, I am saying in good faith from McKinsey based on the facts that exist as an existing yet again for matter of convenience or I am not too sure what motivates Mr Weiss to say he signed in October.     Yes, sir.     In October.     Mr Chair, I think what I am trying to say is the date on which Mr Weiss backdate or the date on which Mr Weiss asserts or alleges to have backdated the agreement in October, I am saying it cannot be.     Because he signed a letter that references the January in June, right. So there must have existed an agreement signed on the date of this letter.     With the January date.     Which he alleges he inserted in October.      This letter would not have reference to that.     With a date that references January.     Mr Chair, what I am saying…[intervene]     That is correct, Mr Chair.    And I am using the date of January to come to the conclusion you have come to.    But my point Mr Chair is that he alleges thathe signed the agreement in October and backdated it with a date of January, in October, okay, yet in June, there is a letter that is signed by him.   That references the very same agreement that he says he only signed in October and backdated it to January.  I am saying when he drafted this letter in June, how would he have known the date of January if he only signed it in October.     Correct, Mr Chair.    Yes.      Here, yes.     So I am saying in here Mr Chair instead of…[intervene]     Yes.      That is correct, Mr Chair.      I…[intervene]     Yes.     So those are the first two responses to Mr Seleka’s question relating to the fact that it would seem on McKinsey's version, that a MSA did not exist thetermination, 16 June and I am saying another point to consider coming back to the issue that McKinsey is a global company.  Mr Chair, again, if you look at the testimony of Dr Weiss, Mr Amankwah, Mr Mieszala, Dr Fine I think those were the guys that testified from McKinsey.  And not maybe not too much, Mr Fine but certainly the other three.   They go on record and state the extent to which - and even this letter goes out and states it, the extent to which McKinsey was taking risk, not only relating to the fact that there was no signed contract, or no signed SLA on the fact of the magnitude of the project being 100% risk in terms of a MSA, zero success, zero payment.  Now, imagine in a firm such as McKinsey, you go and take undertake this project.  You do not haveaccording to them; you do not have a signed agreement in place.  And all of a sudden the client gives you a termination – even the exposure that they had taken Mr Chair, in my considered unprofessional, if it's inconceivable that this thing would have not triggered alarm bells from the people that were sitting at Eskom right through to someone in Globe because of the size, magnitude and risk relating to the standard.  So my view would be that when this termination letter landed at Eskom or was given to Dr Weiss, Dr Weiss’s first reaction wouldhave been to take it to legal.     Take it to legal.     And say, listen, we have got this termination thing, this termination letter from Eskom.  It is our biggest project in Africa, and it is now been terminated.  The legal guy’s response to Dr Weiss would have been to say, fine, bring me the agreement, because what is the legal guy going to do if there is no agreement?  So it cannot be, in my view that when this termination notice was served that everyone in McKinsey, just left Dr Weiss in his little corner to do as he pleased with this significant exposure that McKinsey had.     It is completely different.     Yes.      That is correct, Mr Chair.     That is correct, Mr Chair.    And, and again Mr Chair, I mean, at the end of the day, if you look at this letter, there is no way that McKinsey would send us a letter like this if it had not gone through corporate legal within McKinsey itself. And basically, they are here saying that they request that Eskom basically applies the termination clauses, which will give rise to the claim of R2.8billion that they would claim under the MSA.    That is correct Mr Chair.    Or they would have said if Dr Weiss’ version is correct they would have said we understand that these things are not concluded – they are not…    They are not – can we find a suitable way to conclude these things an arbitration or an investigation or something.    Was an agreement – exactly.    Well Mr Chair if – if Mr Seleka wants me to cover the other aspects of the paragraph I can do that.   Sorry Mr Seleka that page and the reference again?    690ne?    Yes.  So Mr Chair to go back to paragraph – page number – page reference 690.    690.    If we then look at the second last sentence of     “By then.”    Oh sorry paragraph 29.    It says second last sentence.  It says   It says   That I am making.    And nowhere does anyone rely on that specific.    Chair if I can continue?    Mr Chair …    Yes Sir.   That is correct.    That is correct.    Mr Chair I will.    I think Mr Chair it was just in response to …    Mr Seleka’s or I think it was your question Mr Chair that the termination is there a distinction between terminating the turnaround programme or terminating the SMA?  And I said I think it is used interchangeably.    And I think Mr Seleka then went to …   His path to try and explain that is probably not used interchangeably.    In my view Mr Chair it is a moot point if we accept that the 28th of June letter could not exist as we have just explained it.  So whether he is terminating the turnaround programme now in the context of this – of this date which is October it is moot point.     Or engaged with the settlement process that started sometime in – well started with this 28t h of June letter – well actually started with the 16 June letter and ended with the 17 February I think it was settlement agreement it was signed between Eskom and McKinsey.So again I am not too sure why Mr Weiss is stated these things but I guess he can – he can explain if need be.   You did do Mr 00   Again Mr Chair if you will see Dr Weiss qualifies    Mr Chair I find…    Mr Chair that is the version that McKinsey prefer you to accept or to believe.  And I find that very difficult to – in my own mind accept it.  And the reason therefore is Mr Chair if you look the June letter it does not refer to a letter of acceptance.  It refers to a signed MSA.    No, no I agree Mr Chair.    I gave – I agree that there is a two step vote.    In terms of Regiments.    There would have been a legally binding agreement.    On the acceptance on the signing of the acceptance letter.    But the point that Mr Seleka is trying to raise or he is trying to make is that the date on which there was termination there was termination of a non-existent contract.    Correct Mr Chair.    Let us go there Sir – Mr Chair.    It is 743 I think.    Indeed Sir.  So we go to 743 Mr Chair.    Which is the term – which is the letter of 28June.    877.26    Mr Chair if you look at the heading.    There is a – it will …    The subject line it says   MSA.    So this Risk Based Contract refers to the MSA.    MSA.    Because the – so the MSA…    No that is the one.    Yes.    Yes Mr Chair.    So Mr Chair as I explained originally when we started the topic.  The MSA/SLA.    Was usually interchangeable.  But what they eventually signed whether it be January or June or …    October.    Was the SLA.    A SLA was signed.    But they interchangeably use it in conversation.   As SLA, MSA.    Risk Based Contract.    But effectively it is there Sir it was signed either in January.     June or October.    And there was in December a letter of acceptance that was signed by both McKinsey and Eskom.    2015.    So Mr Chair those are the only two.    Let us call it Contractual documents that exist.    Where is that one?    We will find it for you now Sir.    Oh ja – maybe I did sign it.    I think we may have…      Sorry.    Yes I am.    This does not form part of our 00   Well Mr Chair you were looking to understand whether there was a correlation between the letter of acceptance.   Given that it was signed by both parties.    Equals an MSA or a SLA.    Or what was conflicted by that.    So if you then look at basis of acceptance Mr    Sorry Mr Chair you are now at 811.111.    Yes.  If you look at – it is addressed to Mr – DrWeiss McKinsey and Company Notification of Acceptance for Provision of Consultancy Services Basis of Acceptance. “We accept you proposal for the provision of consulting services concerning the Top Engineers Programme on the terms and conditions generally agreed in the draft contract recently negotiated between McKinsey and Eskom.”    You see.  So what you will find Mr Chair as acommon thing is that whether you refer to MSA or SLA it always – it always encapsulates the Top – the Top…    Engineers Programme.    So that is a – that is a thing that will string across all of this.    So when you go back to your termination letter which is at 877.26.    You will see it says   And then it says MSA or it could have said SLA.    Which is basically – and then in the – in the body text it refers to McKinsey Risk Base Contract which again is the other colloquial term.    That we have used – MSA.    Which was the Risk Base Contract.   So this is what 00   Mr Chair then we – we were then going to page reference 743 before you Mr Chair took us to …    The letter of termination.    So I think we have now established that there is a link between the letter of acceptance, between the letter oftermination and now we come to this letter of 28 June.    2016.    Which in essence – which – ja responds to the letter of termination.    And this I think will be able to answer your questions.    As to whether it is one or both or where does it lie?    So Mr Chair if you look at the second paragraph     [laughs]  Mr Chair, as you quite correctlyconcluded, Mr Chair, it would seem that, for the sake of convenience, McKinsey moves between versions.     In terms of affidavit – when it is required to commit to an affidavit versus what was committed on evidence during the previous time.       No, Mr Chair, on objective evidence...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, on objective evidence, as I have said. If you look at the letter and if you look at the contents of paragraph 29, I am saying this is blatantly false.  If you look – and I have said it, not only in terms of the termination, but also to the fact that Mr Weiss says he did not expect any other compensation.     Yet he then receives compensation and he signs the termination agreement ...[intervenes]      Okay.     No, Mr Chair, I am saying that I believe that this one is, based on what I have read in the letter ...[intervenes]      ...this does not make sense to me and this should be false.  It is false.     Yes.     That either exist in Eskom or exist in all of the plethora of pages that we have gone through ...[intervenes]      ...that refers to a contract that was signed in October.     Mr Mabelane who is the subject matter of signing this document ...[intervenes]      ...also does not refer to a date in his affidavit.     Relating to where he has signed.     But based on the letters that he has received, Mr Chair, because if Mabelane received this letter and if he was of the view that there was no signed agreement.  Again, he would have said that there was no signed agreement.     So why he is lying on a termination clause.     Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      I mean, just the last point in terms of the factthat, again, as you have said, McKinsey moves through these issues and they are critical issues.  Yet they write it off as confusion.     Mister – Dr Weiss in his last sentence in     Well, Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      If I can just add clarity, Mr Chair?     You – the letter on 743 does refer to the letter of 24.     The 24 June letter does exist.    ...not in the bundle.     But it is part of our new evidence.     It – Mr Chair, if you recall when I introduce the subject, I said Mr Mabelane correctly did terminate the MSA through a letter dated 16 June.     He then sends subsequent letters between 16 and 28(?) June.     And there are three letters, I think ...[intervenes]      That followed the same train of thought.     In terms of the fact that Eskom has terminated ...[intervenes]      ...and we are reimbursing you on a cost basis.     Not on a ...[intervenes]     ...risk basis.  So the others, really, just ...[intervenes]      16, Yes.     24 June, exactly.     The basis of ...[intervenes]      ...the basis of settlement.     So now one disputed this.     No one disputed the termination.     [No audible reply]      Mr Chair, not in the Reference Bundle but Ihave ...[intervenes]      I have got a copy that Mr Seleka has given us, yes.      [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Mr Chair if I can add some ...[intervenes]     No, no confusion.     Mr Chair, if you ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.  If you recall, Mr Chair, when I was traversing this issue of when exactly was the, let us call it the SLA, signed because that is the document that was eventually signed.  I said it was either signed in January for the date or it was signed by June or it was signed in October for Dr Weiss.  So I gave a range of dates because ...[intervenes]      Dr Weiss’s version.    Yes.     Okay.  And Mr Chair, this letter is the letter.  It is signed.  On this date, there was a draft version of this contract that we had contemplated signing within seven days or whenever.  So Mr Chair, I do not concede that there was a backdated – I do concede that there was a backdating of the agreement of some sorts on objective facts.Whether it was in October, is what we are trying to establish but on objective evidence, there has to be some backdate.  And Mr Chair, the other point I would like to raise which is also in our, I think, our new affidavit that we submit, is that you would recall that Advocate Seleka started the MSA by traversing the happenings at what was called the Steering Committee, okay.Now I think it was – I think it is the presentation to the second Steering Committee that took place, that there is a slight that effectively envisages the signing of the MSA.  I think it was by the 31 s t of March or some date.  I think is the second Steer Co.  There is a presentation and there is a table there and it says MSA and I think it says 31 March or something here.  So even that Steer Co minutes, Mr Chair,envisages that there was something that was draft and not signed, as of that date of the Steer Co but it envisaged the signing by the 31 s t of March.       Mr Chair, what I was saying is that the backdating occurring in October ...[intervenes]      ...it was not possible ...[intervenes]      ...giving the letter that existed on thet h of June that said an agreement had been concluded in January.     And then they go on to effectively list the termination clauses that they then relay on relating to that agreement that was concluded in January.  So that was thepoint that I was trying to make there, is that, if the agreement was only signed in October, it will be making reference to it, as you have already said.     If it did not exist on that date, then they would have said but why are you terminating something that does not exist, okay?     So it was in reference to the existence of a signed contract by that date being the 28 t h of June.    But ...[intervenes]      ...I did not say that it was not backdated.     There was an element of backdating ...[intervenes]      ...on Eskom’s side as well McKinsey.     Yes, sir.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay let me ...[intervenes]      Okay.  So let me ...[intervenes]      There must have been some back – on both, Eskom as well as McKinsey.     No, I am ...[intervenes]      Essentially, that will be on both.    Because even in the Steer Co ...[intervenes]      ...which was chaired(?)     It was envisaged that the agreement would have been signed sometime in – end of March.     And those Steer Co documents were prepared by Mr Govender ’s and Mr Mabelane’s ...[intervenes]     So they would have known the status of that document.     If I can offer my view?    As to a response to Mr Seleka’s point.     You will recall that the SLA required – it was basically in place and was, let us say, agreed to by the parties.       Agreed to by the parties.     Okay.  And the parties operates as if the SLA was in place?     No, was in place.     As if it has been signed.     When it had not been signed.     Okay.  The agreement itself contained – the SLA.  Let us just use the word SLA.  The SLA itself contained two suspensive conditions.  And Mr Seleka led     Were fulfilled.     As of the required date to January.  And those two suspensive conditions, Mr Chair, was one, that a steering committee should be constituted.  So in our viewwe have provided a VTC minute from July 2015 that in our view constitutes the steering committee, we have provided an email – I think it was dated 26 January, if memory serves, that effectively says listen, these are the steering committee members.There is another email from McKinsey that says listen, these are the steering committee members that must come from their side as well as two Trillian representatives.  Then we attach a terms of reference relating to the steering committee that was agreed to between Eskom and McKinsey.   So in our view those documents indicate that by the steering committee was constituted albeit that it met on the 9 February due to, as they identified in the emails, due to diary constraints. The second point, Mr Chair, was that there neededto be auditors’ sign-off in something called a Wave tool.  Now the Wave tool is basically a McKinsey proprietary software that basically tracks these let us say risk-based contracts and, Mr Chair, there we offer an email – well, it is actually an email as well as a report.  The email basically – I think it is sometime in December 2015 dated, if I recall correctly, and copies the head of IT, Mr Sean Maritz, he copies two individuals from Eskom internal audit and it is from the head of information security, I think, at Eskom IT.Now the issue is that the suspensive conditions required auditor sign-off on the Wave.  So in my view, Mr Chair, you find that Eskom internal audit individuals are copied in the mail, the individual that actually does the work is from IT and he is identified as an individual called Mr Vimal Nike(?) and he does a whole lot of work, it is in a document that is six pages long and he basically says he is happy with the Wave tool with certain reservations.  He then sends that to the head of IT, Mr Sean Maritz and the internal audit individuals are copied in that mail.  But for me, my understanding was that is what Eskom relied to say that the suspensive conditions were fulfilled in terms of audit sign-off on the Wave tool. In addition to that, Mr Chair, we attach an audit report that was provided by McKinsey from audit firm Ernst& Young which basically gives also some comfort around Wave tool and security measures and the Wave tool and so on.  So that is the basis on which we believed or Eskom believed at the time that the suspensive conditions were fulfilled.  I am assuming that that is the same view that McKinsey took at the time because we continued as if the contract existed in terms of our behaviour because we set up the Steercos, we went on to do the work, we did all of these things. So, from that perspective, when we talk about thecontract being concluded, so there being a contract that existed, it was on the basis that the suspensive conditions relating to the contract had been fulfilled.  What remained thereafter, Mr Chair, may have been the annexures or the schedules to the contract relating to certain initiatives, maybe the BEE partner because obviously at that point in time Trillian was still going through a vetting process and all of that stuff, so those may be things that were still outstanding which prevented the formal signing of the agreement but the parties operated as if the agreement of the suspensive conditions to the agreement had been fulfilled by the 31 January.  So that is the reason why, Mr Chair, we would say that the word concluded in January would be appropriate to use because the suspensive conditions relating to the contract was concluded inJanuary.     Yes.     I do, Chair.     I do, but if you can refer me to the letter, it will refresh me.     Mr Chair, within my personal knowledge I cannot say and hence I – the only person that can tell you when he actually signed was Mr Mabelane.    But from where I sit in terms of the documents that I see, I could only envisage that by the 28 June, based on McKinsey’s letter, that an agreement existed and was signed.     No, Sir.     That is correct, Sir.     Mr Chair, because as I said, other than for the letter itself, had said we concluded an agreement in January.  The letter …[intervenes]     Yes.     The letter goes on to rely on the termination clauses that existed within the agreement or the SLA.  Now it is inconceivable that you would – you would send a letter of demand to somebody and not say that it is actually based on an unsigned agreement.     No, no, I do not have personal knowledge.     But that is exactly my point, Sir, I am sayingthat by 28 June, when the letter arrives, there had to be a signed contract between McKinsey and Eskom else why would Mr Mabelane not raise that defence?     Why would Mr Mabelane not raise exactly the point that you are raising?     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Exactly.     That is correct, Sir.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes.     829 point?     Point 19.     Mr Chairman ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair I think the first question that Mr Seleka asked was would you have had sight of this document.  Mr Chair I would not have had sight of this document, and I did not sign it.     But the nexus of this document, or the origins of this document originates from the Steering Committeemeeting, was it the second or the third Steering Committee – at one of the Steering Committee meetings there was a closed session where there was a discussion held, and I think it was I think either the June, I think it was the June meeting, but anyway, there was a Steering Committee meeting where we held a closed session to decide on the future of the MSA, and at that meeting the Steerco resolved that it would probably be best for the reasons discussed at the Steerco, that it would recommend to the BTC to consider cancelling the MSA for the reasons that it had discussed as well as the reasons that are set out by Mr Mabelane and Mr Govender in this submission.So that is the nexus we hand this document Mr Chair.   In that meeting Mr Chair I also requested, given the fact that Steerco had come to the conclusion that therewould need to be a termination of the MSA I requested Mr Mabelane and Mr Govender consult legal as well as commercial, now commercial was another word for procurement within Eskom, to understand the consequences of the said termination, and once they were satisfied with that they would proceed to the BTC who at that stage did the required approval or submit a recommendation to get an approval as to what they had thought would be appropriate in the circumstances.So that is the background, so Mr Chair in terms ofresponding to Mr Seleka’s comment directly no I would not have had sight of this specific document but I would have known of it, because of that, yes.Secondly Mr Chair I am not too sure how Mr Seleka comes to the conclusion that Eskom had mooted us before the termination of the SLA, because the termination is contemplated in the document, so they would have taken a decision to terminate if they thought it appropriate and if so I would assume that Mr Mabelane had gotten advice to understand whether there was cost implications relating to termination and again Mr Chair if there was a signed contract between McKinsey and Eskom at the time the termination clauses of that contract would result in these costs that are requested, so as it relates to Eskom being willing to pay again it would rely and relate to thecontractual agreement between Eskom and McKinsey at the time.    Yes Mr Chair.  The – the clauses as quoted in the letter refer to clause 24.14 of the SLA.  13.1 of the SLA. 7.3, 7.31, 7.32, 7.33, 7.35, 7.33 again 7.34, 7.35 and 7.6 lastly.  You see the point again is as Mr Seleka has raised that these clauses come verbatim from the Service Level Agreement that we have said has been signed.  So the issue is if Mr Weiss only received a copy of this agreement in October as he alleges where did these clauses actually emanate from?    That is correct.    No Mr Chair what we are challenging is when this agreement was actually signed.    Mr Chair as I tried to explain to you before in the contract contained two suspensive clauses.    And those suspensive clauses needed to have been fulfilled by the 31st of January and Eskom’s – well our version is that those conditions were fulfilled and therefore the contract was concluded.    If we were…    Okay if you define concluded as the date of signature.    Then it is.   Well Mr Chair in signing it would (laughing so not audible).    Mr Chair.    Well Mr Chair if we look at it right legally there was an obligation through the letter of award.    From – through the letter of award.    There was a binding agreement.    Between Eskom and …    Part that 00   Offer and acceptance.    Flowing there from is the Service Level Agreement.    Now the Service Level Agreement itself has twosuspensive conditions for it to become effective.    Yes so from what I understand is if the suspensive conditions are fulfilled the contract becomes effective notwithstanding when it is signed.    No even – even the agreement itself Mr Chair.    Unless – unless…    Unless there is an express clause in the agreement that says this agreement only becomes effectiveon date of signature.    Yes.    Okay.    I think you are Mr Chair.    Mr Chair no because in my…    It – when the suspensive conditions were fulfilled.    Mr Chair the agreement became effective.    That it became effective or there was a desireto backdate the agreement to the date on which it became effective.    Which is sometime in January.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was effective.    Yes.    Yes Sir.    It was good for – for governance purposes to have it signed.    It was not important.    Yes Sir.   Agreed or when the letter of demand came.    Transnet – Eskom should have said but why you issuing a letter of demand?    Yes Mr Chair I think maybe when I said signing is not important it is probably tongue in cheek but the – there is a requirement for contracts to be signed within Eskom.   No Mr Chair okay seriously I think there was a requirement for the – for the contract to be signed in terms of if you look at the 1034 document as well.    There is a requirement for the contract to be signed.    Well Mr Chair my understanding is that if the conditions of the contract are the suspensive conditions of the contract are fulfilled the contract becomes effective on the date on which it was fulfilled.    Okay if there was no – if there was no suspensive conditions and there was no other agreement between the parties to say listen this thing is effective other than the fact that we have not signed then signature isrequired.     But Mr Chair again I think we talking about hypothetical.    Yes Sir.    Yes.    To January.    Mr Chair I still do not see how the suspensive    I said Mr Chair what I find difficult in agreeing to your last proposition is in the absence of the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions.    Yes Sir.    Okay let us maybe answer the question differently.      So let us agree that on your version…    Or on your – on your proposition.    On your proposition.    That there would be no agreement with no signature that is your proposition.    Then there is no …    There is no acceptance.    So my – all I am distinguishing Sir is I am saying there might be no signature and therefore there is no agreement.    As you – as you proposed.    But why I am taking that one step further to say by virtue of the fact that there was no signature it does not mean that there is no liability.    Because – because Mr Chair…    You prefaced this by saying that the signature is important to understand whether the payments were made in terms of an existing liability.    But that is the point Mr Chair where does the – where is the liability – where does the liability come from?    Okay Mr Chair let us just put it this way.  For ease of reference my version is a signed version of this contract existed.    Sometime between March and June.    Based on the evidence that I have seen.    So that puts…    Yes so…    Yes.    The contract is signed.    Yes.    Mr Chair again we go back to this issue of whether there was an agreement – the parties for all intents and purposes if the parties did not believe that there was an agreement and the suspensive conditions were fulfilled there would have been no need for a stakeholder – there would have been no need for mobilised people.   Yes.    Yes.  Of the proposed agreement.  I did not say of the fact that we did not have an – an effective contract because the parties behaved as if there was an agreement in place.  There was…    Yes there was only the mere fact of actually thephysical signature of the contract and that was the only thing that was outstanding and therefore we referred to a draft contract.  It does not say if that was the case Mr Chair the letter would have been drafted very differently.    Mr Chair I think we have also traversed this issue the previous time that we gave testimony.  The delegated authority relating to signing of contracts.    No Mr Chair.    No it was relying on this one.    Was and eventually signed by Mr Mabelane and as I mentioned before that the second stakeholder did indicate that the contract was going to be signed by the 31st of March.  So for all intents and purposes I was under theimpression that the agreement was signed by the 31st of     Now, you see, Mr Singh.  I do not have any difficulty with that point you make, namely, one would expect that McKinsey would not issue a letter of demand based on an agreement that had not been signed.  I do not have a difficulty with that point in principle.  Obviously, Mr Seleka can canvas issues further around that but I do not have a difficulty.  One – that is what one would expect equally, I think, as Mr Seleka said earlier on, one would have expected Eskom, upon receiving that letter of demand, which was based on an agreement,     Exactly.       Well, Mr Chair, I will attempt to clarify(?).  Mr Chair, if – I mean, McKinsey has gone on record on a number of times.  At the Parliamentary Inquiry, making announcements on their own relating to the billion or so that they paid back.  Have gone through an extensive exercise in – on their own version, looking at thousands of records, emailsand investigating I do not know how many of their employees.  Look, that entire process, no one actually discloses that this agreement was actually – did not exist.  Yet in December 2020, Dr Weiss decides to say but this agreement did not exist.   So during that entire process and that entire and that entire investigation, what was mister – Dr Weiss’ view and what was McKinsey’s view, during that entire process.  It was not actively(?) approaches if you understand how and what they did.  In the Eskom application, Mr Chair, itself, they do not rely on the fact that an agreement did not exist, that they paid(?) the money(?).  [Speaker not clear.]  They go to this entire process of saying, now they understand that Eskom mislead them relating to the fact that the NationalTreasury approval was not welcomed.  Even on that version, the truth(?) say but listen     Mr Chair, if that is the case.  I come back to my original point that I made this morning, is, if that is the case then the 28 t h of June letter is either made in bad faith or is fraudulent.     But it was because – the truth of the matter is, Mr Chair.     Eskom relied on this document.     Well, Mr Chair, I think they derived substantial...     By getting Eskom to believe that the agreement was signed.     By getting Eskom to believe that the agreement was signed if indeed it was not signed but not disclosing the ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, if you did not have regard for all of the facts that we now know around the issue of the – okay my letters are referring to a draft contract, for example, and all of that.     And you just had these letters that came from McKinsey.    What would your view be?  Your view would be there is an agreement that is in place ...[intervenes]      There is termination clauses that are relevant to this.  Let us engage.     Yes.     Look, Mr Chair, I can then only assume that the position is that Dr Weiss and Mr Sagar took the 28 t h of June letter and took in the interest of McKinsey.     Yes.     Ja, I was trying to explain that, Chair.     So in my view.     The only way I could explain this is, if, as I said.  Dr Weiss and Mr Sagar acted, let us call it, in their professional capacity issuing this letter and in December when Dr Weiss gave the affidavit, he probably gave it in his personal capacity.     And wanted to, I do not know, disclose that okay this is what – this the actual truth(?) that existed at the time.     But in the capacity of the partner of McKinsey, this is what I had to do.     That is the only explanation I can...     No, Mr Chair, I said it would be incumbent upon Mr Mabelane to ensure that the agreement was signed in that he was the delegated authority to sign it.      My expectation would have been – it would have been signed by the 31 s t of March.     Given the presentation that was done.     Yes.     Mr Chair, I think the Steer Co minutes do go, to some extent, to indicate that we were not completely satisfied ...[intervenes]      ...with the responses ...[intervenes]      ...that McKinsey had given.     But in principle, if you look at the letter that McKinsey’s response was.  They accepted each of the issues that were raised in terms of – how can I call it?  Let us say, for example, changed management.     They accepted the changed management should form part of the master services – or the Top Engineering Programme.    For interruption, for example.     Contact management will form part of the...  So each of the issues that we raised, in principle, they did not reject it.     Right.  So the – basically, I think the actual timing out of how it would form part of the actual underlining Master Services Agreement was the issue that was outstanding...     And that is recorded in the minutes of the...     Yes.     Mr Chair, I am not too sure ...[intervenes]      ...what the date of that Steer Co was where we recorded that ...[intervenes]     The date of the Steer Co.     That recorded the fact that McKinsey had responded.     Yet we were not completely satisfied ...[intervenes]      ...with the responses.     So I ...[intervenes]      I would not, Mr Chair.     Because Mr Mabelane – I do not recall that Mr Mabelane had come and engage with me ...[intervenes]      ...regarding this letter.     And the contents thereof.     Who can clarity.  From what I can understand, Mr Chair, I think there was some discussion at one of the Steer Co’s.     To say    But we never then said that it should not - the contract should not be signed or anything like that.       It might have been one of the reasons that were mooted around the ultimate termination of the agreement ...[intervenes]      ...at some point.  But I was not – I have no personal knowledge relating to Mr Mabelane coming to me     Yes.     Yes, sir.     I agree, Mr Chair.     But if that was the case, Mr Chair, when Dr Weiss was presented with the document for signature, he... if that was the reason why they had not signed by then.     I am saying, on your proposition Mr Chair of let us call it these issues, being the reason for non-signature or delays in the signature.     I would then have expected Dr Weiss to be aware that these were the reasons and then once he was confronted with the document for signature, he would have said but we cannot because Mr Singh still needs to be satisfied which is not what he said.       Well, Mr Chair, if there was this delay ...[intervenes]      ...then I would assume so.     And if it were for the reasons that you said.    No, mister ...[intervenes]      I agree, Mr Chair.     I agree.     And I agree.     Well, Mr Chair, as I have said.  I have no personal knowledge as to when this document was signed.     And under what conditions it was or it was not signed.     All I can say is, factually yes, I did sign the letter.  Yes, it had a condition in it.     But if you look at the specific condition that Mr Seleka refers to.  In their letter they do say, as yousaid, the relationship is under review and the annexure to the SLA allows for multiple or additional – how can you call it - ...to be considered.     That is the first point.  The second point is.  When they did inform us that it was going – never – it was not going to be Trillian, they came with other options in terms of an SDL partner.       It was not on the basis that because that thing was not fulfilled that there would no agreement.     Because they came with other options, right.  According to Dr Weiss, I think, they came with the proposals right up to September, I think.  August or September with proposals.     Mr Chair, ordinarily, I would probably besurprised.     If in the absence of this table(?).     So the letter of the 19 t h was issued.     McKinsey responded.  Then there was subsequent...  Now these, the letters were, as I said, or the responses were discussed and the Steer Co took certain positions.  So as I said, ordinarily, if I had issued aletter and if I was dealing directly, then I would expect a response and I would be the one that decides or makes a decision.  But in this case, Mr Chair, there was a Steer Co.  There was additional information that was discussed at this table.  And then there was Mr Mabelane that decided to sign or not sign.  And in my view, given the context of the discussions of the Steer Co, Mr Mabelane must have signed or decided to sign with whatever date.  I am not sure.  But I do not recall Mr Mabelane expressly     So that did not happen.     Well, if it happened, I do not recall it.     Ja.     No, no.  Mr Chair, I am saying.       No, I – what I am trying to convey is that.  In the absence of the Steer Co where these things were then canvassed that allowed Mr Mabelane to understand what was happening, I would not expected him to sign without engagement.     Because he would have not known.     No, no.  I am saying.  In the absence of the Steer Co ...[intervenes]      ...I would have expected him to come to me     Yes.  But because the Steer Co was in operation and these issues were discussed at the Steer Co and Mr Mabelane was part of the Steer Co, we would have either discussed them and decided on them and that would have formed Mr Mabelane’s mindset at the time regarding whether he could or could not sign.     Without coming...    I do not...  One, I do not recall.     Mr Chair, I think it is the latter proposition.     Well, Mr Chair, if you – well, let me put it this way.     If you read – if you have a reading of the letter, the response.  There are no issues – McKinsey does not take issue with any of the requests, okay?     S on face value, they – all the requirements were met, okay?     When we go into Steer Co, there is one of the Steer Co minutes that reflects that we do not believe that McKinsey has addressed all of the issues holistically.  So I think that is something – there are some minutes to that effect.    But if you had to go and read the letter, all of the requirements were met.So they have not ...[intervenes]      They have not ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Okay.     No, Mr Chair, I mean, the letter is addressed to.  So this letter ...[intervenes]     That is what I was getting to Mr Chair.  I mean ...[intervenes]      ...obviously I have got some knowledge of that.     And then the response would have come to me.     In terms of the response from McKinsey(?).     So I have personal knowledge ...[intervenes]      ...of the fact that I – the letter will come to me.     Because it is addressed to me.     As I then said.  If you have regard to the response in terms of each of the issues that was raised. In principle, they did not reject any of them.     So from that perspective, Mr Chair, I am saying that they have acceded to each of our requests.       First point.  Second point, at some Steer Cothereafter, we did raise the concern that in the responses that McKinsey had given us notwithstanding the fact that I agree that they in principle agreed to each of the issues, there will still be a need for us to understand how this thing will holistically fit into the – let us call it master services or top engineers programme and that concern was raised, I understand.  So that is what I have personal knowledge.     That is correct, Sir.     Sorry, where is it?     Paragraph?     Mr Chair, the issue of the letter spoke …[intervenes]     No, in the context of the way that you are presenting it, Chair …[intervenes]     Ja, well, the way that he is presenting it, Chair, no.     Let us get this right, you are putting to me that the condition was not fulfilled because of what he is saying.      And I am saying what he is saying does not equal what you are asking.  So you are putting a proposal to …[intervenes]     And I say …[intervenes]     And I am saying the letter that we wrote on the 19 t h start to understand certain issues relating to BEE …[intervenes]    Sorry?     The 19  February letter.     Yes, my letter.     Sought to understand certain issues relating to BEE and how they were going to integrate and what benefits will come out of it for them, okay?     Yes, Mr Chair.    So what I am trying to get to is that it was not Trillian specifically, it could have been any BEE partner that we were engaging in, in terms of the February 19 letter and therefore, when we – when the decision was made by McKinsey to say there is going to be no Trillian, the discussions around the BEE partner so confused because it was not as if that condition specifically related to Trillian.     Yes, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, I think you cannot go from here to the proposition that you are making because the agreement may have still been signed.     Yes.     That is correct.    No, I agree, Mr Chair, and …[intervenes]     And, Mr Chair, it is – again, let me come back to this point and say it is common cause that the letter was signed because there is a physical signature …[intervenes]     Ja, I mean, sorry, was signed because there is a physical signature that appears there.     Okay?  Of both Dr Weiss and Mr Mabelane.    So whether the conditions relating to my letter with either fulfilled or not, is immaterial because the contract was actually signed.  The question, when was it signed?  Was it signed in October or was signed sometime in the first six months?     Agreed, Mr Chair.     Where are you reading from, Sir?     It seems so, Mr Chair.  It seems so, Mr Chair.     It is becoming an infamous letter.     Of 28 June, yes.  So the question is?     As in this – as that was applicable at this point in time.     Sorry, Sir, as it is relating to this point in timebecause it says …[intervenes]     If you look at it, I mean, at the end of the day we are also recognising Trillian, at the end of the day in the opening paragraph, so it could also refer to Trillian but my raising of these issues, Mr Chair, in this letter or what my intention was behind raising these issues, was to understand how was or what was the actual plans to give effect to the intention that an SD partner partnering McKinsey would result in a let us call it an empoweredconsultancy firm, right?  And the reasons these issues are raised here, Mr Chair, comes from the issues that Ms Goodson has raised in the past relating to how McKinsey had treated, either you want to call it Trillian – well, Goodson was Trillian, so relating to the complaints that Ms Goodson had raised vis-à-vis McKinsey and the way that McKinsey had been engaging with Trillian as their subcontractor for potential supply.  So that is the intention behind raising it.  The issue was to get a very clear and concise answer in terms of how our objective relating to SD would actually realise at the end.     Yes.    Yes and I am giving you a response as to why it was specific because it was specific to the company at that point in time but had it changed over the life of the MSA, the point would still be, I want to know, as Eskom, how are you going to develop these people, whoever they may be but at this point in time it is either Regiments or Trillian as the letter is alluding to.      Mr Singh, I would appreciate ... sorry, Mr Chair.  I would appreciate ...[intervenes]     If we could adjourn early today.    Ja, let us give it a try.     No Mr Chair, 30 minutes would be alright.     Sorry Mr Chair, I do not know if that light has moved or something has happened, because ...[intervenes]   It was not before.     That is fine.    Yes, thank you.    What page reference was that?    Maybe I should take long to turn to the page.     Yes.     I am there sir, ja.     Sorry, who is that?    Yes.     The question is?    Mr Chair, in terms of I have not seen Mr Koko’s evidence in detail regarding this aspect, but from what I can recall, again Mr Chair, these issues were not within my personal knowledge as I have explained before to my interactions at the parliamentary enquiry.  I had to gather this information.So one of the annexures that we have submitted through the affidavit that we received this morning is actually an email from national treasury that confirms that the practice norm that was applicable at the time, allowed for this base contract. So that is what Eskom had relied upon at the time to ensure that the basis on which this contract had been included, was appropriate.     Mr Chair, if having regard to paragraph 22, as I understand it would normally apply Mr Chair.  These approvals would reference either Section 54(2)B I think itis, of the PFMA where you would require specific approvals in terms of capital projects. Else it would reference mitigality and significance frame that would either deal with capital projects, procurement contracts and the like.  I do not specifically recall that there was a requirement, well basically the PFMA says you must comply with all legislation and to the extent that the prescripts of national treasury form part of legislation we would require to comply with. Hence I am saying if it is contemplated that the remuneration model of the agreement is contemplated in this Section 22, then I am saying Eskom relied on the email that it received from Mr [indistinct] of national treasury.  He was I think at the time the chief director in governance and monitoring in the office of the chief procurement officerthat indicate the required schedule was applicable at the time and enabled this type of agreement to be entered.     From my reading of the email ...[intervenes]    Subject to approval.    It said the practice note is applicable and therefore this contract can be, this type of contract can be entered into.    It then went on to say listen, you must make sure of certain things, but he did not say you know what, send me a formal approval request that I would then approve for you to do this.    So Mr Chair, maybe we should just clarify firstly.  The issue relating, when you say Mr Seleka that the court relied on the same assertion that Mr Koko is making.     This is Mr Radebe’s affidavit.    This is Mr Radebe’s affidavit?    Okay.    So firstly let me respond to your issue around Mr Radebe’s court papers. Mr Chair, Mr Radebe does indicate that national treasury approval was required, but not for the same reasons that Mr Koko alludes to, or I am understanding Mr Koko to allude to.Mr Radebe in his court papers and maybe we can refer to it if it is in the reference bundle.    We can go there, but from my recollection inthe interest of time, references, the email that I have just referenced, but basically what is down there, the emphasis that is placed on that email by Eskom in that it says it is arbitrary, right and also it is received from Mr Didifango and we do not know his position and we do not know if he was empowered to issue the email.Now Mr Chair, a simple Google search of who Mr Didifango is, would tell you as I have just told you, that he was the chief director in governance and monitoring in the office of the chief procurement officer of national treasury.  So that is the weight of the position that he carried. Secondly, if you read the email as I said, it is quite clear that he does not say you require an approval for this.  He says you can actually do it.  so the issue of the court papers is a separate matter vis-a-vis what Mr Koko hasallegedly assented, and I am not privy to the basis on which Mr Koko has made this assumption and maybe if you give us some time I will go and refer to it and I can come back to you and refer to it, but I know Mr Radebe does allude to the fact that national treasury approval is required. The basis on which they rely on the fact that national treasury approval is required, is the ambiguity between which schedule was applicable at the time.  so from an Eskom perspective Mr Chair, Eskom did engagewith the council in terms of understanding which remuneration model is acceptable, given the applicable practice note, and there was some ambiguity in terms of the opinion that was obtained but it eventually said you know, just ask treasury because treasury is the authority.  Okay, and there was then a second opinion that was obtained, if I am not mistaken.  It was actually obtained by McKinsey themselves, that effectively said actually the practice note is applicable and therefore you do not need approval.  Okay, but notwithstanding that, Eskom thought it prudent to actually engage with National Treasury and they engaged with National Treasury in the form of a meeting, and the outcome of that meeting was this email that then was received from Mr Didikane on the 4 t h of February Ithink, 2016. So that is the basis upon which Eskom relied on the fact that it had the necessary authority to enter into this space.      Sorry Mr Seleka, you are at?    Mr Chair, as I have mentioned none of these issues that Mr Seleka raises, was within my personal purview at the time.    In terms of my response, I have given my response in terms of the reliance that Eskom had placed onthe two opinions as well as the email that was received from national treasury.    That is correct.    Well Mr Chair, if we are going down this roadwe are not going to finish before eight o’clock.    Well, it is not my understanding.     Well, Mr Chair this is the reason ... if we are going, let me say this.      No.    Yes I do Mr Chair and for the record I do not agree with it.     1199?    It is here somewhere.   Well Mr Chair, as I said I am not too sure what Mr Koko said in evidence, but if I just had to have reference to paragraph 81.4, Mr Koko stated his intention to obtain an external legal opinion on the matter.  McKinsey also stated they would provide their own view about whether the remuneration was in line with national treasury instruction.Now if it is alleged as Mr Seleka is saying, that Mr Koko signed the instruction, I mean signed the policy document knowing that approval was required, in my view then an instruction would have followed from Mr Koko, from this meeting, to do the necessary that is requiring him to comply with the policy.Yet, his response here is his intention to obtain an external legal opinion on the matter, which then led to the opinions that Eskom had received, so in my view this indicates that notwithstanding the fact that he signed thepolicy, there was some doubt in Mr Koko’s mind as to whether it was applicable or not, hence he sought legal opinion.     Mr Chair I said at the end of the day I can only go on what is here and based on what is here it would seem that at that point in time there was some ambiguity in his mind, hence  he is requesting a legal opinion, becauseif he was, as in fact it is what Mr Seleka says when he sat in this Chair then the logical thing to have done was to say Mabalane get the approval, or Bridge get the approval because Mr Nene is right.     On the second point.    Of this bundle?      Mr Chair I think Mr Seleka requires some rest.     I think Mr Seleka requires some rest.     That is true Mr Chair.     Are you giving me a date, okay that is fine, no I will find it. 
SINGH:Thank you for your indulgence and understanding Sir.  Mr Chair I think he is using them interchangeably.  Because I do not find any other correspondence, Mr Chair.  The letter that was signed by me...[intervenes]   Which is in [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]  He did not require, he did not say ...[intervenes] 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson on – I do not know where exactly it is in the – they are just going to show me on the bundle itself.      So it is in the transcript on page 29 of the day 323 approximately, line eight, Advocate Chaskalson asked it, and am I correct Justice that the supply development work that was done on that Corporate Plan was work that was done by Regiments not Trillian, Dr     It is on the 11 t h of December of .     Yes, as I said it is day 323 of the transcripts.      Thank you, Chairperson.     Chairperson, maybe just to assist on the affidavit that we brought today.  It is annexure AS3, we took the liberty of attaching it for you with the front page and the relevant provision that deals with it.    Chairperson.     Chairperson, I just wanted to - I think the points that my clients trying to make specifically refers to paragraph 2 of the letter.      Where he states emphatically that the agreement, finally was concluded in January of 2016.  So his status as a fact that…[intervene]    Chairperson, Mr Seleka undertook to deal with two questions.  He said he is going to be finished before half past and we conceded to that.     But the client is tired, he actually wanted ...[intervenes]    You see, he is really tired.      And tomorrow is probably, you know we could go on a bit later tomorrow.
