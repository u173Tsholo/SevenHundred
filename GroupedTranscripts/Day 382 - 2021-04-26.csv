CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay please administer the oath or affirmation.  Good morning Mr Gama.    Thank you.    Thank you very much and thank you for coming back Mr Gama to assist the commission and availing yourself.    Thank you.    Yes okay I have got – I have got both of them.      Mr Gama’s legal representatives are they still the same?    Okay alright.  For the record Mr Gama is still represented by the same legal representatives.  Thank you.  Okay.    Yes, no that is fine.  So the page that you have asked us to go to now is 200 and?    Okay.     Page 250.175 Mr Myburgh being the last page of his affidavit?    Of the affidavit that starts at page 250.130?    Is that correct?    The affidavit of Mr Siyabonga Innocent Gama that starts at page 250.130 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB28.5.13.    Okay.    Oh yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay alright.  Well the previous one I have seen so if there is any new one I would need to see it first.    Ja.  Okay.  But that one can be dealt with later not now is that right?   Ja.    Oh okay.     Yes.      Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Well maybe Mr Gama if it is fine with you I do not think I would have any difficulty to you articulating your concerns but I would like just to read it in advance.  Can I give you a chance to deal with thissometime during the course of the day?     Would that be fine?  When I have had a look at it.  But the previous one you can deal with it now if you would like to read it.    Well you can go into the relevant books of record.       No, thank you, Mr Gama.  Well, one, what you have just finished reading is – those parts of your opening statement which you were – you did not read last time.     So it is one opening statement.  Now the significance why I want to emphasise that.The significance is that I have just noticed that the other one that was handed up to me that we talked about earlier, theopening statement, that was handed up to me this morning is marked Second Opening Statement. MR     [laughs]  So I know that earlier on without reading it and without having had time to look at it, I said you could deal with it later but now what is – has crossed my mind is.  I may be starting a wrong precedent if I start allowing second or first opening statements.  There may be third opening statements and they all take time. So, but to the extent that that statement might be dealing with Friday.  Is it Friday, the 30 t h?     To the extent that you might be wishing to raise concerns about what will happen on Friday, I would imagine that that could be articulated maybe on Friday.  There is nothing wrong with articulating concerns about what will happen on Friday, labelling that as an opening statement might be a wrong label.  It might just be articulating those concerns.  So in principle that is one thing.  But allowing a second opening statement might be problematic.  But maybe we can – you can reflect on that and sometime during the day we can see what we can do.  I have – I think my eye did land on some sentence here that suggestswhat your intentions are about Friday. I just want to say, to affirm that I want to hear all perspectives.  And I want to hear as many people as possible particularly people against whom allegations of wrongdoing have been made.  But of course, we operate within certain time constraints.  The only thing that has crossed my mind a few minutes ago is that with regard to Friday another option might because in terms of time it is difficult.  It is just difficult.  We have for this evening the application –Mr Gigaba’s application in relation to Ms Magma’s evidence and depending on the outcome of that application, we should or could have Ms Magma’s evidence.  If the Legal Team could consider whether there is a possibility that Ms Ngoma and Mr Gigaba are available on Friday morning and if they are available on Friday morning, we could consider proceeding with your evidence into the evening which could then enable us not to lose any time because then we could right into the evening with you which is the time we would have taken on Friday morning and maybe even more.So that if we do not finish then on Friday morning, I could hear Mr Gigaba’s application and maybe Ms Magma’s evidence and then hear you in the afternoon.  But that would depend on how the Legal Team is with thattoo.  I think Ms Ngoma has been issued with a summons for this evening and that would depend on whether – on their availability.  So, but that is the only thing I could think of but if that does not work, I cannot see any other way of dealing with the situation.  But I would allow you in due course preferable on Friday if we still have to proceed in that way to make the remarks you want to make about that point.  You understand?     Ja.     No, no.  I understand.     Ja.  No, I understand that.  All I would like to – understand is that there are logistical and practical difficulties.  Not like one does not want to, you know, just practical.  Mr Myburgh, I do not know whether you wish to say anything about what crossed my mind?    Yes.     Yes, okay, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, we cannot go too deep on Friday.  In fact, we cannot go into the evening at all Friday and that is one of the problems.       Yes. ADV MYBURGH     Because...  So what it amounts to.  I mean, generally speaking, one, between one and two is lunch time.    So if Mr Gama’s counsel becomes available at one, it means, generally speaking, starting at two.     And we cannot go beyond four.  So it means just two hours.  Actually, I have been considering whether on Friday if I should not ask you to talk to Mr Gama’s legal team with the view to starting earlier.  That was even before I thought, you know, that theywanted us to start at one.  So, but maybe during the tea break ...[intervenes]      ...you and Mr Gama’s counsel can approach me.  But let us take it from there.     Okay alright.     Is the answer no?    I think you were, ja.     And she would be very happy.  I am sure that you got it outside of the country.     Yes.     September 2016.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, before you go away from this particular meeting, I just want to make sure, Mr Gama, that in regard to this meeting of Mr Salim Essa and Mr Singh where you saw Mr Essa in Mr Singh’s office and you came to him, Mr Singh, are you saying you cannot be mistaken about that?  You know it happened?     Ja, ja.  And would you have any reason to falsely implicate Mr Singh in having a meeting with Mr Salim Essa in his office?     And you said it is not convenience, thereis no convenience.     Ja because he was categorical that it did not happen.  Ja, okay.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.  Ja, you mean the meeting atSaxonwold?     Yes, ja.  Mr Myburgh?     Is that the settlement agreement you aretalking about, Mr…?     You want him to comment on the proposition that the settlement agreement does not say anything about him being paid back pay?  I think it might not say that but it does say reinstatement, I think retrospectively if I am not mistaken.     I am sorry, just bring the mic closer, Mr Myburgh? ADV MYBURGH     It is about costs that you are talking about?     Not – oh, I thought it was about back pay.     Okay.     Oh, okay, okay.     Sorry, sorry?     Oh, you want him to refer Mr Gama to the settlement agreement?     Yes.     Do you want to keep the question until later and proceed with other questions?     Yes and then when the files maybe after tea break be here then you can go back to it.     Ja, please speak up a bit?     Well, the question relates to their response when they were questioned here, irrespective of what they knew.  The question relates to how they responded when they were questioned.     Yes, Mr Myburgh?     Ja.     Yes, yes, I remember that, ja.     Yes.     There is certainly – my recollection is that they certainly had difficulty justifying it.     Yes, Mr Myburgh?  Maybe we should take the tea adjournment now.     Yes.  It is twenty five past eleven, we will resume at twenty to twelve.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     I am sorry, I missed the page, Mr Myburgh.    ON bundle 7?     Bundle 3.     I think my registrar is not hearing you.  I do not have bundle 3.  Bundle 3B?     Okay.  It is only – it is bundle 3, there is no A or B?     Okay.     Is it 250.262?     The affidavit of Mr Siyabonga Innocent Gama that starts at page 250.262 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as EXHIBIT 28.5.15. AFFIDAVIT OF MR SIYABONGA INNOCENT GAMA STARTING AT PAGE 250.262 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT 28.5.16.     Mr Myburgh, bundle 6, can I send that away for the time being? ADV MYBURGH     Ja, okay.  Thank you.  Yes.       Okay, I have got it.     Ja on that one you use black numbers.     I think you will start dealing with witness2 at page 250.265, it starts on the other page but there is nothing of substance on the other page, if that is what you are looking for?     Ja.     You start at paragraph 9 and in paragraph 9.1 you deal with paragraphs 1 to 4 of witness 2’s affidavit.     Ja, okay.     You just want to say that is where you respond – you comment about this.     Okay.     Is the lighting quite bad there or sometimes you see better without the specs.     Okay, alright.  Do you want to repeat what you say in the affidavit or you just wanted to refer Mr Myburgh to …[intervenes]    Yes.     Ja.     Okay.  Mr Myburgh?     Just remember not to lower your voicetoo much, Mr Gama.     Oh, okay.     Oh, I missed that.     No, I did not hear it.     No, no, I am just wondering whether witness 2’s use of maintenance there relates to the job of a mechanic or whether it is something more superficial but of course we do not know, he has used maintenance here.  I think we can move on.     I see some …[intervenes]    I wanted to say, Mr Myburgh, for the record I see that some pages in this bundle have got both the black and the red numbers.     But we will stick to the red numbersthroughout, is that right, on this bundle.     Ja, okay, okay.     Did you say black?     Black, ja.     Maybe one can ask – the picture may or may not have been your vehicle but is the picture similar to your vehicle?     Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     Which maybe since he says you owned them, maybe you might be, maybe you might wish to specify which ones you owned, which ones you did not own because he makes the allegation that you owned them.     Oh, okay [laughing] okay.     Ja, well do you want to clarify that, do you want to clarify which ones you own, which ones youmay not have owned.      Just repeat that.     H’m, did you own it before you gave it to her or you bought it for her without first owning it?     Okay.     Okay.     Just one second, the transcribers can they tell me whether they hear Mr Gama clearly, is that a thumbs up or what is that, he must raise his voice?  Okay, please try and speak up.     Ja, ja, let us continue.     I see that he says that is Witness 2, thatthis was on or about November 2016.  I remember from the affidavit of yours that we dealt with earlier that it seems that when you went to the Gupta residence it was around November, was it 2015 or was it 2016?     2015, yes and we know Mr Myburgh whether during 2015, Witness 2 was providing protection services to Mr Gama because I am wondering if whether we are dealing with a situation where you did go there, there a problem with the dates and then maybe about whetherthere was a suitcase or not, but whether - because he also refers to November and I think in your affidavit you talk about November but as you say 2015.     I thought he deals somewhere with the periods when he was providing protection services to you but I do not see it.     Did you confirm that those are the minutes you are referring to?     Okay, alright, okay let us take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two, we adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    Yes.    Ja there are difficulties.    Ja.    Would you remember whether you wouldhave gone to that meeting in the car he was driving?    You do not remember.    Okay.    How – how many cars would go with him?  Would there – would you be in one car and then there would be another car that in terms of reconnaissance.    Yes.    With one or more of the protectors in your car?   Yes. Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes and the other one would – would follow you or be in front of your one?    (Inaudible).    Ja okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.  The – most of the – that day to the extent that this reflects that he was there what is true is that you were also there for most of that day, is that correct?    Ja for a certain number of hours.    You were in the same place?    Ja.  Now you – you cannot remember orcould – can you whether you would have been – he would have driven your car or whether he would have been in the other one on that day?    Yes.  Oh okay.    On your version he would be in the other car.    Yes.  Yes.  But in terms of practice and what used to happen is the position that the two cars insofar as one of them has got you inside would – would be supposed to be together?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Is just too much yes.   Yes.  So assuming that is not a situation where he was – okay let us put it this way because I think there are facts that both of you agree upon namely for a certain number of hours you were in the same place on that day okay.  And even on your version he would have been there in his official capacity would have been working he would not be there on his own – on his private you know – for his private purposes alright.  Now one would – one would have assumed and you must tell me if that assumption is wrong that he would therefore – because he was at work he would be expected to be there for as long as work required him to be there and would leave when work required him to leave.    Unless he decided to do his own things and that I would image maybe you would be aware if he – if he changed and left work at that time. So – so would you – would you accept or would you not accept that the probabilities are that there – there whatever time he was there including the time that you think he would not have been there he is supposed to be connected with – he is not supposed to have started doing his own things, is that a fair assumption?    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Go (speaking over one another).    Yes.  Yes.    Ja.    Ja that is fine.    Ja.   Yes at least that – that – he was on your version he would have been on the other – in the other car?    Ja.  Ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Yes he would not be required yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Well I do not know how categorically you maybe that you left at a particular time or as soon as the meeting ended because one knows from experience sometimes depending on how first one is for time sometimes when meetings finish sometimes people hang around and talk more and so on even though maybe sometimes that amount of time might be unusual.    Ja.    Ja.    You want to go.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.  Mr Myburgh.    Of course I am sorry Mr Myburgh – of course Mr Gama this is all on the assumption that the time stipulated in the minutes is correct or when the meeting ended? MR    Ja.    Okay.    Ja okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    That is on your version?    Ja on your version.    Mr Myburgh.    Are you – are you saying there is an incident that you know of.    In terms of which he went to this address without you and without your knowledge?    Okay that is a particular incident.  But generally speaking would the position be that in your absence he would have no legitimate reason to go there.    As far as you are concerned?    Correct.    Okay.  Mr Myburgh.    Just on this issue of the diary because it is the second time you mentioned it.  Would that have been your diary that you are looking for that you were using at the time?    Okay.  Is it a diary that would have remained at Transnet when you left or is it a diary that you would have taken with you but you cannot find anymore?    Yes.    On – in – is that the same bundle?    What page?    Oh I think it is the other bundle.  250.    297. – 297?    Yes I see that ja.    Ja it is very fine print.    It is fine print ja.    Affidavit.    Ja I think it was 114.    Ja.    Yes.    Five thirty.    Okay  Mr Myburgh.    Alright let us go back to page 95 of Witness 2’s affidavit and deal with the second collection he says called on the 13t h of July 2017 and Mr Gama perhaps what I will do is I will go through the whole part again I am mindful of the defence that you raise in your affidavit and    Well, I am – can you see where it is, 17...  There is a seven.    It appears to be a six ...[intervenes]      ...point two six.  Ja, maybe it is 17 but it is difficult to tell.     Yes.     Copy?  Alright.     Yes, yes.  Ja.     H’m, ja.     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      On my – is it page 294 where it shows when you left or when the meeting ...[intervenes]      Okay.  The meeting ended – 15.47.     Okay.  H’m.       The one with the ...[intervenes]      [laughs]     Yes.     H’m.     I do not think I have any chance of ...[intervenes]      Mr Myburgh, maybe you can tell me ...[intervenes]      What ...[intervenes]      In it and then if the Commission’s Legal Team can check on the computer and see that is true, that it can be placed on record.     So say – although on the hard copy one cannot see, on the computer this is what one can see.     Ja.  Okay.  So what is in there?     It is four o’clock?     H’m?     H’m, h’m.     Ja.     Ja, okay.     During ...[intervenes]      In – during the entire time that he was one of your protectors, is there any time, even if it is not in relation to the bag, is there any time when you may have accused him of stealing any money?     At all?     H’m, h’m, h’m.     Okay.     [Indistinct] [Speakers intervening each other – unclear]     H’m.     H’m.    Okay.  Mr Myburgh. ADV MYBURGH     Is the one that you know the Bryanston one?     Okay alright.  The one that you do not know is 16 Melrose...     That is the one you say do not know?    Ja.     Ja.     H’m?     That...     H’m.    H’m.     I see, Mr Myburgh, that the witness says     So I am not sure where he meant Matjila Koko or whether he meant ...[intervenes]     ...Collin Matjila.       So there would need to be clarification.     H’m.    It might help if you started by giving the answer to who you think coached him.  Then if you need to elaborate we can take it from there, because the question was do you know or you have somebody that you think coached him.     Of course you are not saying, but you willtell me if you are saying, are you saying that is what happened or are you saying it is a possibility that something like that might have happened?    It is the latter?    Yes.     Mr Myburgh?    If I understand his version, it was not a loan.  There was enough money and you were just giving him money.  There was enough money, there was no problem.  R50 000-00 was not a problem.    Well, as I understand his version, at least the context, he seems to have made it clear to him that you were just giving him money which he could use as he so fits.  That is my understanding of his version.  As Isay, because there was money, money was not a problem.    Ja.     You take the money.    Ja.     Mr Myburgh?    I am sorry Mr Myburgh, do not forget what you want to put to him.  Let me go back to the issue of witness 2 and his version against your version.  Was there a time when you and witness 2 had issues between the two of you while he was one of your drivers?      Well, what I am looking at is I know he said you accused him of stealing money from the bag but you said there was no such.  So I am asking from your own version whether the two of you ever had any issues while he was your drivers to [indistinct]    It was not about money?    There were some issues but not about money?    Yes, okay.  Now the reason why I am asking is because you said that he may have been induced with something, it seems to me you suggest at work, atTransnet, to effectively fabricate stories about you.  Did I understand you correctly?     Yes.  So what I wanted to find out was whether your position is that to the extent that he makes allegations against you which you say are false, you say he is fabricating because he must have been induced to do that against you or whether he might have some grudge against you as well, and there might have been some issues that you say would drive him to falsely implicate youin all kinds of things. So that is what I want to establish.  Whether it is only the issue of inducement or whether you say there were some issues also between the two of you which you think may have driven him to fabricate stories against you.    Yes, okay I see the sun is giving you a problem.  The sun light is giving you a problem.    Okay, but there are certain issues which you think ...[intervenes]     Which drive him to, drove him to fabricate some stories about you.    Okay, alright.  At some stage I guess we can hear about that.     Ja, maybe ...[intervenes]     I do not know if something can be done, but I can see you are having a problem with the, is it the sunlight that ...[intervenes]     Is that something that can be dealt with or not?  Oh, okay alright.  Let us try and continue in the meantime but they will attend to it.  Okay.  so I think Mr Myburgh says well, maybe let us hear about those issues that you say may have driven the witness to fabricate stories about you.    Mr Myburgh?     Well, you must say when you run out of water.  They will give you more water.  Are you running out of it?      Okay.     I am sorry, so are you saying that where he says that your close friend used to make demands in effect for him to do non-work related tasks or trips for her and that this then strained the relationship between you and him, that is witness 2, you say there is no such thing?     Okay, alright.  I just wanted to be sure, ja, of what you are saying.  Okay, continued, ja.     Of 2017?     Now is that sprinkling something?  Is that what you observed?     You observed him sprinkling something around your house.     Okay.     Yes, okay, okay.     Yes, yes, yes.     On cameras?     Ja.     Would this have been during the day?  Would it have been during the evening?    When he sprinkled it according to what you observed or it …[intervenes]     It was at night?     Okay.     Oh, so in terms of – as far as you were concerned you did not expect to be in your house.     He came there?     Oh.     Yes, okay, alright, continue?     So he acknowledged that he had been – that the cameras correctly captured him, he was at the time – the cameras showed him to have been there and he justdenied – he denied what it was that he was sprinkling or there was no denial, it was [indistinct – dropping voice]  or what was the position?     To sprinkle.     But did not sprinkle.     Okay.  I interrupted you while you were dealing with this.  I do not know if you have finished.      Am I right to say you suspected or believed that what he did was connected with witchcraft?    Ja.   Ja.  How did he put it?     You have got his statement?     Okay, so you can make arrangements to share it with the Commission.      Okay, alright.    Yes.  Okay, Mr Myburgh?     Mr Myburgh?     It is about ten to four.     A short adjournment.    No, that is fine, we normally take it at four so we may as well take it now.  It will be a ten minutes adjournment.  I think, Mr Myburgh, we would start with the next stream.     It is the same stream but maybe at five?     On this one, yes, yes.     Oh.     Yes, well what I have in mind is that we should go on with Mr Gama to five.     Because the evening session we always say they must arrive at four, be ready.     If we are done with the day witness then we start.  If not, we start at five.  Okay, alright, we will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     Your explanation.     Or your side of the story about whatever allegation he makes.     Ja.     It’s a hardcopy that you are looking foror?     But I take it that it’s something that people in the Commission is not in possession of, whatever it is you are looking for?     Ja.     And, has Transnet said they don’t have it as well, Mr Myburgh, do you know?     Has Transnet said they don’t have it as well?    They have ja so I just wanted to make sure that if there is a complaint against the Commission it would be addressed but you say Mr Gama also confirms that he accepts that the Commission doesn’t have it, obviously if the Commission had it, it probably would  have no reason not to give him.  So, the position is simply – is the position, Mr Gama that you simply – you are simply lamenting the absence of that diary without blaming anybody…[intervenes]? Yes, okay, alright okay that’s fine…[intervenes].     Yes, okay.     Ja, but not everything?     Okay, alright, well maybe I may as well mention this, Mr Gama, now that we’re talking about this.  To the extent that anybody, witness, whether it’s somebody implicated, wrongdoing or not, if they have got concerns we are quite happy for them to articulate those concerns and my attitude is that, we must look at those concerns and be able to say, we have looked at this, has got merit, this is what should happen, address it, this maybe we don’t agree it’s got no merit but if people have got concerns let them articulate them and then we look at them, we comeback to them and say, this is our response.  So that is part of the reason why I wanted to know about this diary even earlier, okay.     Yes.     Yes, okay, alright.     That answer was yes.     Okay, alright.    Specifics and the processes.    Okay. Mr Myburgh.    And that is at Bundle 7?    Paragraph 20.2.    Unfortunately some of us must go into the evening session.  Yes I think let us adjourn the day session at this stage.  I think that in terms of where we are with regard to Mr Gama’s evidence Friday we are where we last discussed in chambers.  I do not know whether in the meantime there is anything you wish to project to me that is either yourself or your (talking over one another)   Ja.    Molefe.    Yes.    Yes.     Okay alright.  Okay.  We leave it on the basis that on your side sometime on Thursday or the evening session or sometime on Thursday we can make time for Mr Gama to continue his evidence even if it is for the number of hours that his counsel would not be available on ...[intervenes]      ...on Friday morning and then continue at a certain time on Friday subject to what they have to say.     Yes, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     No, that is fine.    No, that is fine.  Before – he might be able to address us but I wanted to hear your side.     But you had made that offer.     You are able to make that to may be to be a position that from the Legal Team’s side and the Commission’s side ...[intervenes]      ...once the President’s evidence on Thursday is done, we could continue with Mr Gama’s evidence, whether we have restricted it to a particular number of hours to make sure that we do not lose time that would have been used on Friday morning.  From your side,that is available.  Then he can indicate what his position is.     Okay alright.  Counsel for Mr Gama, are you able to say anything about the position?     Yes, yes.     Ja. ADV     Yes.     Ja, okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  I think as far as I am concerned.  One, Friday proceeds as planned, starting usual starting time.  However, we could start later than theusual time to accommodate counsel for Mr Gama if on Thursday they are available for us to make sure whatever time we would lose on Friday is used on Thursday but if, obviously, they are not available to take advantage of Thursday, then the position would remain – Friday remains as was prior to today.  Okay alright.     We will then adjourn for about 10, 15-minutes.  Will ten minutes do Mr Myburgh?     Ten minutes, ja.     Yes.  Okay.  Maybe we will say 15-minutes.     Just to be on the safe side.  We will adjourn for 15-minutes and then we will then start with the evening session.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon, good evening to those who may not have been us during the day session.  Mr Myburgh, are you ready? ADV MYBURGH     H’m?     Yes.     H’m?     Yes?     Yes but ...[intervenes]      Let us do that.  Well, before we do that.  Ms Magma’s legal representatives, if they wish to place themselves on record in regard to this application or they want to do so only in regard to the leading of evidence?     Yes.     H’m?    Yes.     Yes.  Okay alright.     Alright.  Good afternoon, good evening, Mr Solomons.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m?     Well, just hang on one second.       Sorry, Mr Solomons.     I am aware that there is a certain letter, a long letter that was shown to me this afternoonMs Magma’s attorneys.  It is too long for me to read or it was too long for me to read within that tea break.  So I did see certain part of it, very little.  I have not read it.  I do not know – I did not get the impression that it is essential to read it before the hearing.  At any rate, it came late.  So I do not take it as part of this application, nor do I take that other letter that was read out on that day as part of this application.  I believe that what I have got here is simply the papers as they stood n that day.  Whether or not anything has been filed since then, I am not aware andcertainly I have not been told.  So I am very keen ...[intervenes]      I am very keen that we use the time we have to deal with the application because if the position is that we will or that we end up having to hear her evidence, we need all the time that we can have.  So I just mention that so as you address me you know what it is that I have read and what it is that I have not read.     Sorry, Mr Solomons.  I think Mr Myburgh want say something.     Oh, okay.  Did you hear that Mr Solomons?     Yes, okay.  But ...[intervenes]      We – I can see you.  Yes, continue.     H’m?     H’m?     Well, I want to say to you is.  I just wanted you to know what the factual position is, namely that I have not read the whole of that letter and what I have read is very little.  That is as far as I wanted to go, you know?     Whether or not you can rely on it and if you want to rely on it, what needs to be done, I have not gone into that.  I just wanted you to know that as a matterof fact I have not read it because it came – I have not had time.  I have been sitting the whole day hearing evidence.  Ja.     H’m.     Yes.     One second...[intervenes]      One second.  Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]     One second, Mr Solomons.  Mr Myburgh, do you have any position about the use of those letters that are not here?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.  I think, Mr Solomons, if you say – if you submit to me that I can and should rely on it as it is and I do not know if maybe you rely on both or both letters, the one that was read out here last time and the one that arrived today.  If you submit that I can and should have regard to it, I am quite happy to let you make that submission and you refer me to whatever portions of it that you think are relevant or important and we continue without me making any ruling.  And then once I have heard everything, I can take it from there.  Is that fine with you?    Ja, but I do not want somebody to read the whole letter because it is quite long.  So I – if you have certain parts that you want to rely on, I am quite happy to allow you to read those parts.  That is number one.  Number two.  I was must choose to place some time limit on the time for the application.  So maybe let us do that first, so that as you make your submissions you have an understanding of how much time we – you have.  Because of the fact that you are such an experienced counsel, I think I should not give you more than 15-minutes.  What do you think?  [laughs]  Thisis nothing.  This is nothing.       You can... [laughs]     You can handle this easily.  [laughs]  So if I give you 15-minutes from now, is that fine?     Yes, let us try that.     No, I have not seen them.  I read the papers last time when the matter was going to be heard.  I have not seen any new papers today.  They might be here but I am not aware of them.  I have not been told of anything that may have been filed today.But ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes-no, that is fine.     Yes, that is fine.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, you may do so.  Yes, it is but let me find out.  Mr Myburgh, do you know whether I have go a hard copy here in the file?     Ja, I think your junior also shakes her head.  So.ADV MYBURGH     You do not ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.       Yes, I will not be able to read the text,Mr Solomons.  So it will be better if you deal – you articulate those parts of the revised written submissions that you believe are important.     I will not be able to read from where I am.     Ja.     Maybe ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Maybe ...[intervenes]     Maybe what I can tell you Mr Solomons is that it might be convenient because of time constraints that you deal with your client’s application only insofar, today, only insofar as it relates to your relief other than leave to cross-examine because even if were to grant you leave to cross-examine, you would not cross-examine today  So another day can be arranged.     So maybe ...[intervenes]     Maybe you – maybe the relief to cross-examine can be dealt with some other time.  What is more urgent is such a relief as need to be dealt with today if Ms Mngoma is to testify.       Well ...[intervenes]      Well, let us take the first one.  What is the basis for the first one?    Or is it difficult ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Hang on one second, Mr Solomons.  Maybe because I am listening to what you have to say more than reading, I am not reading what is on the screen.  Maybe you should just let us see your face and not thewritten submissions.  I will make notes of the important points.     Well, I can see a little bit but I am focussing more on your – on what you have to say to me than the written – I prefer to see you.     Ja, ja, ja.  I prefer to see you as you make your submissions.       And will simply ask that you look at your written submissions and see what you need to ...[intervenes]     Ja.     H’m.     Well, you have relied on two points in relation to the first relief.  The marital privilege and the acrimonious nature of the divorce proceedings.  Is that right?     Yes.  Marital privilege.  You are saying I must refuse to hear evidence as a Commission that may relate to allegations of state capture and corruption from a person who is willing to give that evidence and knowing that I am not a criminal court?    Well, have you got ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  Have you got an accuratestatement of the law on the privilege that you refer to?     Ja.     What...  Ja, what does it say?  Just read it.     No, no what I want is this ...[intervenes]      What I want is the statement of the privilege, the principal.      Where you have an accurate statement of what the privilege is.  This what may not be done.  This is what may be done.       Is it not that – is it available?  Can it be invoked in a Commission – a Commission proceedings?     But once – I am sorry, Mr Solomons.  I know I am interrupting you but ...[intervenes]      I want to make sure by the time the 15-minutes is finished, you have dealt with things – matters that I think are important to assist me.     Once it is accepted that the privilege is not, let us say, applicable in commission proceedings. What you would be asking me is.  You would be saying, and you must just confirm if that is what you are saying.  We know it is not applicable, strictly speaking, to the commission proceedings but we think that it is something that the Commission can take into account, whatever else in deciding whether to grant the relief that we are asking for.  Is that what you are saying?      Yes.  I do not know whether you have gone beyond the first relief, because I am looking at your time, whether you have started addressing the second relief or the alternative relief as well.  So I am just alerting you to time. I think you may well have exhausted 15 minutes, but maybe you have exhausted ten.  So I just want you to be alive to that.     Yes.     I am sorry.  In your written submissions, whatever you think is important, I would like you to articulate it, because I might not have time to go and read but if you have articulated what you believe is important, that is fine.  In regard to this stress relief.     Relief.    In the written submissions.     Okay.    Yes.     Just hang on Mr Solomon.  I was still just looking at the power in Section 4.    To you know, in camera proceedings strictly speaking are proceedings where the Court or the tribunal would exclude the public in effect from the hearing.  I know that in this commission the term in camera has been used sometimes or what we have done namely to allow witnesses who fear for their safety, who do not want their identities to be disclosed or their faces to be shown, to give evidence from a venue that is different from the venue of the hearing and they are, their evidence is heardby the public and they can be cross-examined. But their identities are not published and their faces are not shown.  Sometimes members of the legal team have referred to that as in camera but strictly speaking it is  My recollection Mr Solomon, my recollection of evidence relating to children seems to besimply evidence about some present being given to a child or something like that.  I do not remember that there is evidence that relates to children that is ...[intervenes]    Really of any serious negative nature.  ADV SOLOMON    Ja.      No, no.    Ja.  ADV SOLOMON    No, no, no.   Okay, alright.  Is it fine if I give you, I see we are at nearly quarter past.  I think you started maybe about quarter to or twenty to, I am not sure.  Is it fine if I give you five minutes to deal with whatever remains?    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No Mr Solomon.    No, no Mr Solomon.  If the commission is set up to investigate allegations of State Capture and corruption, it cannot stop to look for people who can assistus, just because they happen to be married or happen to be going through some divorce proceedings. It looks for people who can assist us to determine the issues before it.  It is doing the right thing.  If it becomes aware that somebody may have information that will help it with the issues that it is required to deal with, it would be doing the right thing to make the approach, because it seeks to carry out its mandate.     No, that will be a separate matter.  That would be a separate matter.     Ja.  ADV SOLOMON    Okay.      Okay, no thank you.  Mr Myburgh, do you want to say something?    Okay.    Okay.    15 minutes.     Ja, okay.  Well, Mr Solomon ended up having much more than ...[intervenes]     Ja.  Okay, alright. ADV MYBURGH    Just one second.  Mr Solomon, can you hear or, I see I do not see your face, but can you hear Mr Myburgh?     No, no that is fine.  I just wanted to make sure that you are able to hear so that if you, when you are required to respond, you will have heard him.    Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?    Yes, yes.     Ja.     I see, ja I see particularly 28.3.6.    Ja.   Ja.     I guess that it does not help Mr Solomon’s case that his client was a public representative.    That does not help that case.  Yes.    Yes.      I think he did not but he might have mentioned some things relating to these that are mentioned in the cross-examination application but I said to him let us leave out the cross-examination application for another day.    Well, I think on the contrary…     She reaffirms or affirms her cooperation from what I – the bit that I have read, she seems to be suggesting that it might not even have been necessary fora summons to be issued.     Ja.     Ja.     No, that is fine.  Thank you.  Mr Solomon can I give you seven minutes in response?     Okay, alright.     Thank you, Mr Solomon.  Prayer one is clear, prayer 2A, I am not sure what it means, Mr Solomons.  Mr Solomons?     Oh, I am not sue – do you persist in that prayer?     Or is that for later?     Okay, okay.     Yes and then B is the in camera one.     Ja and C?    Is C for now or for later?     Well, if I were to grant B you would not need C, is it not, because it would follow from B.     But if I am not prepared to grant B, whatwould that make of C?  Would it survive that or not?     Yes.  Okay, alright.     Ja, D we leave for another day.     And your side can remain so to speak dominus litis in regard to that after today in terms of what is to be done and when it is done, we can look at that and see to what extent argument is necessary or whether I can just deal with it in chambers without hearing in – without oral argument.     So we look at that after today.    Okay, alright.  I am not going to give reasons for my decision but if anybody wishes to have reasons they can make a request in writing and reasons would be provided. RULINGHaving heard the application, I am satisfied that Mr Malusi Knowledge Nkanyezi Gigaba’s application for prayer one in his notice of motion should be dismissed and it is DISMISSED.With regard to the alternative in prayer two that relates to Ms Mngoma, Mrs Gigaba’s evidence being her in camera, that also is DISMISSED.The application for leave to cross-examine will be dealt with at some other stage and any other relief that the applicant makes it necessary to be dealt with at that stage, that is covered by the notice of motion.That is the decision, so the long and short …[intervenes]     Yes.  The long and short is that Ms Mngoma, Mrs Gigaba, may give evidence and will do so in the open.       Okay, alright.  Shall we take ten minutesadjournment and resume?  We will adjourn for ten minutes before we resume.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Are you ready, Mr Myburgh?     Yes, okay, you can do so from where you are if your work is working and you will be comfortable,okay?     Yes, okay.     Okay, that is fine, that is fine.     No, no, that is fine.  But is the position that she is here on the basis that although she has concerns she is happy to assist the Commission or is the position that she has concerns, she is only here because she is compelled through the summons, otherwise she would not like to be here?     Well, I want to know …[intervenes]     Because Mr Solomon was interpreting the letter in a certain way, that is the attorney’s letter, and I had received a certain impression of it which was different from what he was saying, so I want to hear from you exactly what her position is.     Yes.     Well, the one of self-incrimination is separate.     So that stands on a different footing.  Ja, okay, continue?     It is like you are confusing me even more because when you started I thought you said she is saying she is happy to assist the Commission, she thinks it is an important job that it is doing but she just has certain concerns and particularly she is concerned that in her affidavit there may be certain or there are certain parts which are not within her personal knowledge and she would like or she would have liked to have done a supplementaryaffidavit which would have identified those.  Now that is not a problem, that is somebody who says I want to assist but there is a problem with some of the – some parts of the affidavit but then when you went on …[intervenes]     Or is the instructions that are difficult?     Ja.     And therefore I would not like to be here if I have a choice.     Okay, I think that answers my question, not here by choice.     She is here because of the summons.    Okay.     Yes, yes.  Well, I seem to have – I seem to remember that she gave an interview to one of the television stations and she said she would be prepared to give evidence before the Commission if she was asked to, is that not true?     Okay, alright.     Okay, okay, alright.  Alright, thank you.  Let me say, as I said earlier on, it is the duty of theCommission when it becomes aware of anybody who might have knowledge of information about matters that fall within its terms of reference to approach that person and seek evidence, seek a statement, seek an affidavit and if it is satisfied that the person knows matters that are relevant and material to the Commission to ask that person to make themselves available and if they are not prepared to make themselves available to testify unless they are compelled, to compel then.     So you might just be talking on television or you give an interview to a newspaper, you say something, if the Commission becomes aware that you may be having knowledge of matters that it is interested in, it will approach you.    And it would be dereliction of duty if the Commission would be aware of that and not approach you when it appears that you may have information that falls within the terms of reference.     Yes.  Okay, alright, thank you.  And then let me just mention this.  All concerns that your client has about how the Commission may have treated her, how investigators may have treated her or the legal team,requests that she may have made or whatever, she is – there is no problem articulating them.  I will hear Mr Myburgh who might be able to say something about them or some of them either now or at a later stage when they have had enough time to look at the contents of the letter but we are interested in making sure that if anybody has concerns and they articulated them, we look at them and where we think the concerns have got merit, we will say so.  Where they can be addressed, we want them to be addressed.     Yes.  Ja, ja, ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja, no, no, that is very important.  I think earlier today I may have made – I may have referred to Mr Montana who was giving last week, former Group CEO ofPRASA, he had his own concerns, he chose to come and make his request very respectfully, articulated his concerns and they are being looked into.  Those that can still be addressed, attempts would be made to address them and he was allowed to continue to give evidence.  He is cooperating with the Commission and my own sense is that if anybody asks him he would tell them that he is being heard fairly but his concerns will be looked at and the Commission will go back to him and say on this one, we agree on this one, we do not agree on this one, this is the position so that he knows what has been done about that.  So …[intervenes]     So same thing with Ms Mngoma, MsGigaba, and I think she will tell me just now which she prefers I must use.  If she has any concerns we will look at them and some we might not be able to address but those that we can address we try and address and where the Commission or the legal team or investigators might not have gone back to her, they try and go back to her on those.     Okay, thank you.  But maybe one thing that I can say about the change of the evidence leaderbecause I did hear that she expressed a concern about that.  I must say that I am responsible for that.  So it is not Mr Myburgh’s fault and it is not for any reason other than simply that Mr Pretorius is busy with certain matters, Mr Myburgh was busy with certain matters at a certain time and I said that in these circumstances let Mr Myburgh deal with the matter and – so it is nothing – but I understand that sometimes a particular person might find that maybe they deal better with a particular person or maybe that is not the issue, it is just that she had to now start afresh with somebody and tell the same story, so – but that decision came from me and it was simply a way of trying to see how best to use our resources.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes, it happens quite frequently.  Actually even today I just made another change in another work stream and said okay, this one will deal with that, this one will deal with that, so it happens quite frequently. Okay, alright.     Okay, thank you.  Mr Myburgh, would you like to say something?     Yes, yes.     At some stage, ja.     Okay.     No, no, that is fine.  Good evening, Ms Mngoma and you must tell us how you wish to be addressed.  Is it Ms Mngoma or Ms Gigaba or either is fine?  Which one do you prefer?  Either is fine?  Okay, alright.  Okay, you have been listening to the discussion, is that right?  The one thing which I did not mention to your counsel and maybe she – well, she is listening, is the issue of a supplementary affidavit.  I would imagine that she should be fine with a situation where as she goes alongwith her affidavit, with her evidence, she can point out what she would have corrected in a supplementary affidavit, is that fine?  Just point on your mic.     If necessary she can file it later on but as she goes along she says no, this is not accurate or something.  Would that be fine?     Are you suggesting that her oral evidence should be postponed until she has filed asupplementary affidavit?     Yes.     Yes.  No, there is a problem with that.     But what your side could have done or – well, I do not know how long ago you came into the matter but…     Her legal representatives could have prepared a supplementary affidavit even without involvingthe legal team to say here are in here earlier affidavits that she wants to say A, B, C, D about and this could have been made available to the Commission and the evidence leaders much earlier or even if it was made available only today he would have been able to see it before she starts her oral evidence, but postponing is problematic because we don’t have the time.     Okay.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja, okay, alright.   No we will continue with your evidence Ms Mnogoma and – but in the end if there are aspects or parts of your affidavit that you believe do not correctly reflect the position you are free to indicate that.  Mr Myburgh?     Okay, no that is fine, at some – as we go along she must feel free to indicate what she believes does not reflect the position and she will have to say whether that’s what she said what is written, but on reflection she does not think it is true or whether she didn’t say it at all, but by the time she finishes if when Mr Myburgh has finished if she – if there are parts which were not touched upon which she wants to deal with and say they don’t reflect what the position is she will be allowed to say that.Okay, Mr Myburgh?     It is Transnet Bundle 7 Mr Myburgh?     And what page?     Oh yes, no thank you for that.   Please administer the oath or affirmation, thank you.     Sorry they might not, you might have been speaking too softly Ms Gigaba, they might not have heard, is that the concern?     Yes, please raise your voice so it will be recorded.   Okay, please start afresh.     Was it audible?   It is fine, oh, okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh?     Maybe let’s – you might have formulated the question in a legal way.      Except for saying that in the course of your evidence you will point out those parts of this affidavit that you think are not the truth, or do not reflect the position, except for saying that are you happy to say those parts, other parts of the affidavit will be true and correct?     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     The affidavit of Ms Nomachule Gigaba formerly Mngoma which starts at 8999 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB26.1     Let’s say are you confirming the correctness of this affidavit on the same basis as you did a few minutes ago the other one, namely there may be parts that you will point out during your evidence as being inaccurate or not correct, but those that the rest will betrue and correct.     Oh on this one everything is correct?     Okay, alright.       The affidavit of Ms Nomachule Gigaba formerly Mngoma which starts at page 1021 is admitted asan exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB26.2.     But does it accord with your knowledge or you don’t know whether it is true that he held these positions during these times?     About the dates?     Okay, alright okay.  Mr Myburgh.     I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  So is the position that one of the things you would have corrected in terms of this paragraph is to say let’s not put the dates because I am not sure about the dates.     Those positions I know about those positions.     Yes.     Yes, ja, no that is fine, that is fair enough.    Sahara Computers?     Sahara Computers?     Okay.    Was that before he moved to the Department of Public Enterprises?     When he told you that?    Do you know how long before he actually moved or can’t ...[indistinct]      Okay.     Can you recall – remember how he feltabout this news that he had been told namely that he was going to move to DPE, can you remember how he felt about it?     Okay, alright.   Okay Mr Myburgh?    I am sorry I did not hear the last part of your – say what you said.  After but I did not hear what you said.    Oh okay.    I see that in the affidavit paragraph 17.2    Is that correct?    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    They were to?    Okay.    Okay I am not sure – I just want to make sure that – so the two of you and your sons went to Waterkloof, is that right?    And – and the purpose of going there was to …    Was to welcome the guests.   The Gupta’s?    Guests. Okay. And you brought your sons with you?    The older one?    Oh okay.  Alright thank you.  Continue Mr Myburgh.    Say it in your own words.    Say it in your own words.    Hm.  Okay alright.    Okay.  Just one second Mr Myburgh.    I am sorry Mr Myburg.    Just one second.  Will the technicians please switch off this screen here because it is distracting me. Okay alright we can continue.    Just switch on your mic Ms Gigaba.    Just one second.  The transcribers can you hear the witness well?  Okay alright.  Okay.    Let us continue.    Try and speak up a bit.  Which chairperson of SAA are you referring?    Okay alright.  Thank you. Mr Myburgh.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh I just want to makesure that I understood this.  Paragraph 26 of your affidavit.    You say at some stage Mr Gigaba told me that Mr Ajay Gupta wanted him to get rid of Mr Brian Dames.  Having met Mr Dames I asked Mr Gigaba why and he said that the Gupta’s did not like Mr Dames because there are things that Mr Dames was supposed to do but did not do    That is correct?    Is it correct?    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    Can I – I am sorry Mr Myburgh can I go back to paragraph 29?  Did it ever happen that Mr Gigaba told you that he and Mr Gupta – Ajay Gupta were discussing any projects at Transnet?    Huh-uh tell me about that.   Okay.  Mr Myburgh.     Ja?     Well, I think Mr Myburgh is – all Mr Myburgh is trying to do is to check whether this is one of the affidavits which are going to be the subject of corrections in the supplementary affidavit.     Yes, yes.  So I think Mr Myburgh wanted to be fair so that we know that we must not take this affidavit, this paragraph as not subject to corrections.     Ja.     H’m?     Well ...[intervenes]      I ...[intervenes]      I...  Mr Myburgh has not said – has not responded to you but I have a very good sense that he was not saying that because he wants to hold the witness to whatever is in the draft affidavit.  I do not think he wanted to – I think that is what you maybe be concerned with.  I do not think ...[intervenes]      I do not think Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]  ADV     I do not think Mr Myburgh wants to say     H’m.     H’m?     Yes.     Because you know there is a problem, ja.     H’m.     Ja.    Okay.     Okay.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.       No, no, no.  That is fine.  I think Mr Myburgh is saying, because he is aware that you did raise issues with this paragraph and he thinks the supplementary affidavit that corrects this might affect certain other paragraphs that follow, should rather not - he would rather not take you through them.     Because he is aware of that.     That is what he wanted – he was tryingto convey.     Mr Myburgh.     Okay.  Maybe let us take one at a time.     So it is clear.  Let us talk about Mr Brian Molefe.  You say that after one of The New Age Breakfasts sessions, Mr Gigaba told you that Mr Brian Molefe was going to be moved from Transnet to Eskom Holdings Stock Limited.  And you say he told you thisbefore Mr Molefe was officially appointed to Eskom?     He told you that the Guptas wanted Mr Molefe at Eskom and not Mr Brian Dames.  Is that correct?     Okay.  You did not put a date here.  Do you have some recollection of which year it may have been?     He was Minister at DPE at that time?     Now ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  Just repeat that, please?     Yes, okay.  Now Ms Lynne Brown was giving evidence last week and she said she was appointed as Minister of Public Enterprises at some stage in 2014.  So I think it would have been after the General Elections of 14.  So if you say that Mr Gigaba told you this while hewas still Minister of Public Enterprises, it would mean that he told you this either at some stage during the first half of 14 or earlier.     Would you say that?     Okay alright.  Is there a chance that you might be mistaken about that?     Yes, but he was still Minister of Public Enterprises, you say?     Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     I did not hear the earlier part, the first part of what you were saying.  Were you saying that you are not sure when ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Yes.     He was not coming from outside?     Yes.     Well, Mr Siyabonga Gama was CEO of adivision of Transnet at some stage, TFR.  And he was dismissed in 2010.  Ja, I think June 2010 and he was reinstated in February – or the settlement agreement was in February 2011.  He started or resumed duties in that position as CEO of TFR, namely, a division of Transnet, I think in April 2011.  And then later on when Mr Brian Molefe was seconded to Eskom in 2015, April, Mr Gama was acting CEO of Transnet.     And then, I think later on he wasappointed.  So that ...[intervenes]      The last part.     Yes, okay.  So you heard that he was going to be appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Transnet ...[intervenes]      ...in 2015?     Or you are not sure when it was?     Was he still Minister ...[intervenes]      ...at that ...[intervenes]   He was still Minister of Public Enterprises?     When he told you about Mr Gama ...[intervenes]      ...being in line to be appointed as CEO of Transnet?     Okay.  And you do not think you are mistaken about the fact that he was ...[intervenes]      ...the time?     You are not sure whether he was still at DPE at that time, that is Mr Gigaba, when he told you?  Could it be that he was no longer Minister of DPE at the time?     He was?     Okay alright.     Ja.     Okay.     Public Enterprises.    Okay ...[intervenes]      Okay.  No, that is fine.     Ja.     No, that is fine.     Would you have made a distinction ...[intervenes]      ...between being told that Mr Gama was going to be made or appointed as CEO of TFR, a division of Transnet?  Or being told that he was going to be appointed as CEO of Transnet?  In your mind would you have been able to make that distinction?     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  Mr Myburgh.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m?     Now you talk about Mr Gama coming back or something like this ...[intervenes]      ...appointment.     Yes.    Yes.  You see, he was dismissed in – at the end of June 2010 from his position as CEO of TFR, not of Transnet.     Then he ...[intervenes]      ...he was fighting his dismissal.     And then there were negotiations for a settlement.  The negotiations happened when Mr Gigaba was ...[intervenes]      ...the Minister of Public Enterprises.     And as a result of those negotiations, a settlement agreement was reached in terms of which he was allowed back.     He was reinstated.     But he was not ...[intervenes]      When he was reinstated, he was going back to his earlier position ...[intervenes]     ...of CEO of TFR.     He was not being made CEO of Transnet.     You were talking about the first one?     Oh, okay.     Okay alright.  But did you say they held a meeting in – at your home, Mr Gigaba, Mr Mahlangu and Mr Gama at some stage?     Oh.     [Indistinct]      The three of them?     Oh, okay.    H’m?     H’m?     But were those discussions, were they taking place in your presence or you were hearing from Mr Gigaba that such discussions had taken place?     Yes.     Not in the meeting?     They are talking on the phone?     Oh.     Yes.       Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     I am sorry.  Just repeat that answer.  I have missed some things.       H’m.     H’m.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh.     And what did you say in response?     You cannot remember.      Okay.      What did Mr AJ Gupta say?    As a Minister of Public Enterprises?    Did he say this in your presence or did you get, did you hear from Mr Gigaba that that is what ...[intervenes]     He told you?    Oh, okay alright.  Mr Myburgh?    Well, you have been standing the whole day.     How are you feeling?     You are fine?    Okay.  Ms Gigaba, can we continue aftera break and try and finish?    Okay, alright.  We will take a ten minutes adjournment.   We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Okay, let us continue.    Just switch on your mic please and then repeat the answer.     The previous page.     At the bottom.    At the bottom.   You said earlier on that Mr AJ Gupta told you, told Mr Gigaba ...[intervenes]     That ...[intervenes]     He would be returned to Home Affairs.    So now I see that you are saying that Ms Myeni also said that same thing.     Are you sure that both of them said the same thing?    Yes, okay.  Mr Myburgh?      And what did Mr Gigaba think of that reason, or think of that?  Do you know what his reaction was to being told that he needed to go back to Home Affairs in order to strengthen border controls?    Yes, okay.  Mr Myburgh?    No, no.  The witness is not being asked to say anything she does not know.  She is being asked whether that sentence is true or not and therefore she is able to say no, it is not true or it has been put in a way that I am not comfortable with or anything like that.     Mr Myburgh?    Ja.     Yes.      No, no, no.  The witness has deposed toan affidavit and she then says there is something in the affidavit that she is unhappy about.  The evidence leader is entitled to say is it the first sentence that you are unhappy about. Is there anything untrue about it.  He is entitled to ask that and the witness is quite entitled to say yes, it is not true or yes, it is true.      Well, I think Mr Myburgh wants to establish which part of this paragraph the witness says was put by the commission, because that is a serious allegation.    Ja, those are serious allegations.  So it is important that if there is something that she never told the commission which has been put here, let us have clarity.  If she says, as I believe she did with regard to some earlier paragraph where she says the substance might be fine but the way it has been put is not right, it is important that we know exactly what it is.  So Ms Gigaba, when Mr Myburgh ask questions about this paragraph, feel free to say what you wish to say. If you want to say this is not true or it has not been put in the right way, feel free to say so.  If you say it is true, but the way it is put or whatever, feel free.But if you say that the investigators or members of the legal team of the commission have put information in your affidavit without having been told that by you, it is important that we know.     Yes.     You can take it, Ms Gigaba you can take it that if you have a problem about a year or a date, as far as I am concerned that is not going to be a big deal you know, but it is more about whether the substance does not reflect what you told whoever prepared the affidavit.     Yes, yes.     Okay.    Okay, okay.    No, I think I understand completely what you are saying.  Mr Myburgh?   In other words even if you did not look at this affidavit, at these paragraphs, in terms of what he told you if you were to just relate that.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Of what he told you.   Would you be happy to through your legal representatives, put in an affidavit ...[intervenes]     How you wanted it to be put?    Yes.  So you can still deal with it but you would like to put it in your ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Okay.    Okay.  Well, Mr Myburgh I do not knowwhat you think but it may well be that when we see that affidavit, it may well be that whatever you might wish to pursue, you might look ... do that after looking at that.     Ja.      Ja.     No, that is ...[intervenes]     Ja.    No, no ...[intervenes]    Do not worry, that is fine because you want to put it in your own words.     That that is acceptable.  You could do that in a supplementary affidavit.     And then once the commission has got that we can look at that and take it from there.     Yes, yes.     No, no, no, no.  It is fine the way it is.  What has been said, is he has said that some of the things that are here she knows, but others have been put in a certain way.  She did say Mr Gigaba did say he was assisting, I think the Guptas about the citizenship.But as far as I am concerned, the arrangement is a supplementary affidavit will be obtained where under the Guptas application for South African citizenship they canput her evidence they say she wants to put in terms of what she knows, and in terms of what she was told by Mr Gigaba.  Then we will have that.  What happens after that will depend on what emerges because if her supplementary affidavit says what is wrong is the 2015 and the 44, and then the way this thing is put has lost the essence of what I told whoever was drafting the affidavit. This is what I said, it is fine, but I do not think there is any other way of doing it, because this is an affidavitwhich she signed.     Yes, I have heard that.  I have heard that, I have heard that.  It is enough.  I know what, I know all the points you have made.  I have not forgotten them.  We are going to proceed, but we proceed on the basis that one, as far as these paragraphs are concerned a supplementary affidavit will be provided in which she will put her knowledge or her evidence the way she wants toput it. If in subsequent paragraphs there is another paragraph where she has a similar discomfort we will talk about that and probably do the same thing.  But let us make progress.  It is late in the night, we all want to finish, okay.    Alright.      Ja.    Do not worry about that for now.     In your supplementary affidavit you can explain the circumstances under which you signed it, because when you prepare your supplementary affidavit, when you ... it is looked at, it may well be that in substance you will not be deviating much from what you have said. But one can only make that judgment call when one compares the two, but when you do your supplementaryaffidavit you can just explain that these are the circumstances under which you signed this first one.     Okay.  Alright, let us continue.     Please speak closer to the mic.     Was it a BMW?    Okay, and what colour?  Do you recall?    Do you recall what colour?    It was white.     I am sorry.  Did you say, was this a new car as far as you know?      And ...[intervenes]     But it looked new.     Did you say it was transferred into your name?    At some stage?    Okay.  Mr Myburgh?     I am sorry, before that, Mr Myburgh. How did it come to be registered in your name?  Was this a gift for Mr Gigaba, was it a gift for you?     You were?     Okay but when it was given to him was it given as a gift or was it loaned to him to use as he …[intervenes]     H’m?     It was a gift to him?     But he allowed you – then he gave it to you?     And you got it registered in your name?     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     Or you say you took it to somebody to fix the lights?     And then what happened about it?  Itnever came back?     Did you take it there or Mr Gigaba took it there or somebody else?     Why did you not go back to fetch it?     Who were you asking?  The person to whom you had taken it or Mr Gigaba?    Both?     Okay and …[intervenes]     Oh, the person to whom you took the car was his friend?     And that person was somebody who fixes cars?     Ja.  So it was nothing serious, it was just the lights?     And when you asked for it back what did that person say to you about it?     You bought your own car?     And Mr Gigaba, did he tell you anything about the car about why it was not coming back?     Yes and you cannot remember the year when this car was given to Mr Gigaba as a gift?     But you remember which position he was holding at the time, what ministry he was in?     Around 2015.     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     How do you know that it was Mr Ajay Gupta who paid for your honeymoon?     Who told you?     So he told you that Ajay Gupta had paid for your honeymoon?     Okay.     So R4 million to R5 million for the cost of wedding appears to …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, even if it was not a possibly that was made at one time, it is still sounds quite a lot.  How do you know that it was about R4 to R5 million?    Is that amount – is that number, is that figure [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      Yes but is it an estimation that you made because you were using the money, you know the money that was available to you and you were using it?  Yes, [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] as well.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay, okay.  And did you say you paid incash or you paid in different ways of paying?     Okay.  All the expenses were paid in cash or some were paid by EFT or whatever?     In cash.  And when you say the estimate of the cost of your wedding, the estimate is R4 to R5 million you think that either 4 million, 5 million was in cash at different times?     Throughout the year.     Okay, alright.  Yes.     Money market account.     Are you able to – are you saying that it was normal or usual for him to give you amounts of cash that maybe somebody else might regard as large amounts but you did not regard as large amounts?     Yes.     Ja.  And what kind of amounts did you regard as normal in terms of cash that he would give you or he would have?    It was normal to have that, yes.     Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     I wonder whether – ja, it might be good not to mention the name because I do not know, you know, the drivers whether one of them …[intervenes]     Ja.     To what?     Okay.     And again do not mention the name.     But you can talk without mentioning it.     You are making certain gestures I think towards you shoulder or hands – did he put it in his – did he carry it on his arm or shoulder?    Ja, okay, alright.  Continue?     I am sorry, when shopping how did he pay for whatever he was buying?     One of the protectors?     To go and pay.     Would he take the money out of his wallet maybe?     Okay.     Okay.  Mr Myburgh?     I am sorry.  Earlier on you said you never saw I think him with cash at the Gupta residence.     So when here you say – you refer to cash collected at the Gupta residence, what is the basis for saying that?     Ja.     Ja.     I am sorry you say when he opened ...[intervenes]      That is Mr Gigaba opening the bag?     And he opened the boot, is that right?     Ja, and you and the – bodyguards arrived.     And did you see anything in the bag?     What did you see?     Yes.      Was their a lot of cash in the bag?     Would you say about half a bag or you are not able, but you know it was a lot of money.     Ja, okay, alright, okay.  Mr Myburgh?     Did you say when you were travelling together overseas, he would give you money?     Oh, without him, and then he would give you money to spend.    Okay and you say sometimes it would be 0 000,00 sometimes 150 000,00, is that right?      Yes, okay alright Mr Myburgh.      Paragraph 56.     When he is at the Gupta residents?     Yes?     Okay.      And what did he say in response?     Thankfully that is the last page?     Okay, he is saying is it correct that as a result of that incident that you don’t want to talk about of the 18 t h June 2020 there was proceedings and a judgment that was handed down in your favour.       That was another incident, okay, alright, okay.   Mr Myburgh the answer is that was another incident.    The one that resulted in a judgment is another incident.     Ja.    Ja – ja hang on – hang on Ms Gigaba let Mr Myburgh finish, make a note of what you want to say.    Ja.    Sorry.    No wait until Mr Myburgh has finished.  I will give you a chance to clarify.    Ja.    Hang on.  Ms Gigaba I will give you a chance after Mr …    I will give one of you a chance not both of you – you or your counsel.  Let us     Ja.       Yes.  I will allow one of you and not both of you so …   Counsel – Counsel you should be the one because you are here and she…    She has brought you here so you can speak on her behalf.    Oh you prefer that she – okay.    Okay Ms Gigaba do you want to say anything.    In response.    Yes.    Mr Myburgh.    Okay.    Well…    Yes.    Okay alright.  Ms Gigaba it is – it is goodthat you have articulated what your concerns were and are and the legal team has dealt with those matters that they are able to deal with.  I think Mr Myburgh it would be good that there be an affidavit that explains everything from the side of the investigators.    Or the legal team in response to the – to the  concerns and a copy thereof obviously should be made available to Ms Gigaba’s legal team and once they have got it it would be up to them whether they want to file anaffidavit that responds to it and then one can it from there just so that we know exactly as far as possible exactly what happened.  So that is the one point.The second point I want to make is that with regard to leaks Ms Gigaba you may or may not be aware but during in – in 2018 soon after the commission had started having hearings we had a problem of witness’ affidavits leaking or finding their way to the media and we were not sure whether it was happening from within the commission or whether it was people who were served with copies in terms of the rules of the commission that is people who were implicatedI went on record and said that I was asking the investigation team to investigate how that had happened because a number of people were also complaining and there was an investigation that was done then and I do notthink it was the only one I think later there was another one and I had appealed to the media please not publish information from the commission that is not authorised – that is not official and a lot of media houses complied but there was one or two that did not comply and publicly I have talked about them I have said which ones they are.  I know that one of them is I think Sunday Independence or Independents on Sunday and I think at a certain stage Business Day also did that - did not comply but a lot of other media houses respected the processes of the commission.But the point I want to make to you to make you is that the investigations that in the past have been conducted have not always been able to determine exactly how whether the media got the information from the commission or from somebody else. I think maybe at some stage there was an investigation that said the leak would not have come from the commission must have come from outside.  I am not sure but investigations have been done in the past. Some of the investigations have not been able to pin down who exactly did that.So – but Mr Myburgh has said that he has been told that the investigation in regard to this leak is at an advanced stage and – so once it has been completed he will need to – the commission will need to let you know exactly what the outcome is.So any leak of information that has not been presented to the commission and by way in a public hearing is most regrettable. But I just make the point that we have been talking about it   There have been investigations in the past and whereas a number of media houses have respected our – respected our processes. There are some who have not done so.  So but once the investigation has completed the – you will be notified what the outcome is.    Ja.    Well the summons you have complied with the summons is it not?  You have been summoned – you have been - you have complied with summons and the summons was issued because your legal representative informed the commission that you had withdrawn your participation you had decided to withdraw it and you have confirmed that you had withdrawn it so the issuing of the summons was fine.  So it was fine.  You may have hadcertain concerns but once you – we were aware that you had information that is important for the commission you had deposed to an affidavit, you had undertaken to come to the commission but you changed your mind.  It was proper that  summons be issued. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Yes we are.    Chairperson as you know today has been scheduled for the continuation of Mr Gama’s evidence.  He last gave evidence I think it was on the 11March this year; he is here.    And ready to take the oath.    Chairperson the documents that are of particular relevance to Mr Gama’s evidence are firstly and principally Bundle 7 Transnet Bundle 7 Exhibit BB28 that is Mr Gama’s exhibit and then we will also be referring to Bundle 6 that is Exhibit BB27 the Trans – the so called Transnet POI Reference Bundle.    Since last …   Yes and they are present.    Chairperson since the last sitting Mr Gama has provided us with two additional affidavits.  He – one of them is contained towards the end of Exhibit 28 the other one was given to us this morning.  We have hard copies and at the appropriate time I might ask you to – to introduce that into evidence.  We hope maybe at tea times that we can formally get it paginated and added to the bundle.  So for present purposes I would like simply to add Mr Gama’s – an ultimate affidavit. Mr Gama could I ask you please to turn to page 250.130.  Chairperson the documentation last time went up to page 250.  The pagination of the documents that followed are 250.1 and further so not ideal but it was caused by the fact that there is another exhibit that starts at page 251.    250.130.    Are you there Mr Gama?    Mr Gama there you will find the commencement of your affidavit that runs up until page 250.175 and then includes a series of annexures which run from point 176 all the way to point 257.      Do you confirm that?    If I could take you back please to page 250.175 do you confirm that you depose to this affidavit?    On the 18 t h of March 2021 and do you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit   Yes.    Yes and if I could ask you…    If I could ask you please to enter that into evidence Chairperson marked Exhibit BB28.5.13.   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson subject to your direction we have agreed with our learned friends that the proceedings will commence this morning with Mr Gama reading the balance of his initial opening statement.  We have looked at that; we have no objection to him doing so.    You will – you will recall that previously…    There was a ruling where he dealt with part of it and just the evidence of the witnesses thathe was going to deal with on that day.    So Mr Gama had dealt with the first five and a half pages of his opening statement.  I assume that he would want to pick up there and perhaps I could direct your attention please.    To page 250.6.  I understand that Mr Gama would like to carry on reading into the record his opening statement.  From there he did previously deal withthe evidence of Mr Todd and also the conclusion.Chairperson Mr Gama has then prepared a further opening statement which seems to me to deal predominately with procedural matters.  He wants to read that opening statement after he has dealt with this. We were provided with their opening statement this morning we have got hard copies and perhaps at the appropriate time I can hand I up to you and we will then find a place for it in the bundle.    I can then hand it up to you if I may?    Well I think that subject to your direction as I have it and I have just squizzed through it it seems to deal with predominantly procedural issues.  Mr Gama has certain complaints that he wishes to level against the legal team which is of course of right and he also appears to take issue Chairperson with the ruling that you made.    In relation to proceedings on Friday.    To the best of my knowledge he seems to deal with those two things broadly.    So we do not have any difficulty – it is not a case of someone being implicated or …    Anything of the sort.  From the legal team’s point of view we would have no difficulty.    With Mr Gama dealing with that subject to your direction.     I have two other possible proposals.     Maybe my learned friend and I can address you in chambers on that.     There is – as you know, Mr Molefe is set up presently for Thursday evening.       But I am quite sure that he may be – might be easier to move him than to move Mr and MsGigaba.     The other thing which we could discuss with you, DCJ, is how deep we could go into the evening on Friday.     Alright.     Yes.     Sure.     Yes.     Thank you.     Good morning, Mr Gama.     On the 11 t h of March, we have dealt with certain introductory issues, we have dealt with Mr Segang, your MBA.We have dealt with your reinstatement.  We have dealt with the issue of GMS and Abelose and certain auxiliary issues.  I just want to before going forward to othertopics, just ask you a few questions that relate to the things that we have dealt with, broadly, already.  In relation to your relationships or your visits to the Saxonwold compound of the Guptas.  Were you invited to the Gupta wedding?     It was held, as we have it, on the 1 s t of May 2013.     You were not invited?     And then if I can take you, please, in relation to the evidence you gave about Mr Essa.  Could I ask you to turn to page 52 of Exhibit BB-28, Bundle 7?     You will recall that you were asked in the 10.6 about the trip, a Dubai trip in January 2016.  I just want to pick up, if I may, at paragraph 32.5.  This is at page 52.  Are you there?     You say    I see that if Friday was the 22 n d,then I assume ...[intervenes]      ...the 24 t h was the Sunday.     So as I have it, you would have stayed at the Oberoi Hotel then for two nights, the Friday and Saturday night.     The next subparagraph    So you say he phoned you?     Mr Essa phoned you?     And how did it come about then that Mr Essa arranged your hotel booking?     Did you stay there before?    Okay.  Did you ever stayed there afterwards?     And then you say your discussion, for the most part, centred on information sharing concerning his vision to create a majority black owned management consultancy.  Can you expand on that?     So was he talking about Trillian?     But did you discuss Trillian and Regiments?     So you did not discuss by name Trillian and Regiments?     By this time, did you know that Mr Essa was involved with Trillian?     When did you come to learn of that?     Well, we ...[intervenes]      Mr Gama, can I – I did not get the date.  What date did you say?     Sorry?  September ...[intervenes]      So just so that I can understand the context and I only have, really, one or two more questions.  Just so that I understand this.  Was Mr Essa suggesting that you should join this black owned management consultancy or was Mr Essa feeding you out as to if this consultancy was established would Transnet give it work or what exactly was the object of this meeting?     And what was your response to that?     So, correct me if I am wrong, but by January 2016, Transnet had already done some business with Trillian, had it not?     And we will come later but that relates inter alia to the club loan.  Correct?     And there we know that payments were made or a payment was made by – to Trillian in December of 2015.  Correct?    So with no mentioned made at this meeting of work that Trillian had already done for Transnet?     Alright.  And could I take you then, please, back to page 48?  And perhaps I could just ask you to have a look at your paragraph 31.3.  I do not want to rehash this but I just want to put to you the evidence that Mr Singh gave in response to this paragraph, so to refresh your memory.  This paragraph refers to the fact that you saw Mr Singh and Mr Essa together in Mr Singh’s office in July or August 2015.  Mr Essa then indicated that he would like to have a meeting with you and you said that he could get your contact details from Mr Singh.  And this, essentially Mr Gama, you will recall the background how you came to visit the Saxonwold residence.  Do you recall that?     It is not true, to put to you.  Mr Singh says that this never happened and that it simply – you have made it up as a convenience, as he puts it, to explain how it is that you came to go to the Saxonwoldresidence.     Thank you.  Mr Singh made the point that it could not have been in August because you will see     Then it means it must have been in July?     So just to end off in relation to Mr Essa.  As I understand your evidence, Mr Gama, andplease correct me if I am wrong, you are saying that you met Mr Essa four times.  The first in 2015 as part of we might call a Regiments’ meeting …[intervenes]     Thank you.  So, Mr Gama, I just wanted to make sure that I have this correct, your evidence is that you met Mr Essa four times.  The first time as part of this Regiments’ contingent which you deal with, this is during 2015, you deal with that at paragraph 31.2.1.  The second time then in Mr Singh’s office you now say that in July of 2015 then in Dubai in January of 2016 and as I recall, you say you saw him on one other occasion casually in a restaurant.  Is that an accurate summary of your evidence?     Then in relation to the things wedealt with last time, I just wanted to put to you - and an affidavit will need to be produced to this effect but we asked Transnet to search for your payment of the Eversheds’ cost bill of about a million rand.     Of the Eversheds’ costs bill.     Remember you say that you paid it in December of 2009.      Transnet has not been able to find any proof of that.  Do you want to comment on that?     The settlement agreement itself I take it you would agree does not say anything about you being reimbursed for amounts already paid.     Yes.     Yes, well the provision says that Transnet will make a contribution equivalent to 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed legal costs.    Yes.     Yes.     In other words, I am simply sayingthat the settlement agreement does not talk about Mr Gama being reimbursed amounts that have already been paid.     That is really the only point I am putting, Mr Gama, if you want to comment on that? MR     I have got no difficulty with that at all.     Mr Gama – Chairperson, for some reason the files are always behind the witness, today I see that they were file boxes on the floor but seemingly have not been brought from storage.  I do apologise.     Yes, I think I am going to need to.    And then just on this issue of costs.  As I understand your evidence, you accept that you did not pay the Bowmans’ account or you cannot remember having paid it, is that correct?     Yes.     And then I just want to put to youthat when Mr Mkwanazi and Mr Mapoma were asked how you came to be paid 75% of Transnet’s costs, they were both at a loss for an explanation.  Neither of them said well, we were paying Mr Gama to reimburse him.     Well, it is not how I recall the evidence but I think it can perhaps be something dealt within argument.     You will remember that both of them were taxed about how is it possible that you landed up paying Mr Gama 75% of Transnet’s legal fees?     And to the best of my recollection they did not know, that seemed to be something of an anomaly for them.     And also – if you could bear with me for  a moment?  Yes…     Yes.  What they certainly did not do,to the best of my recollection is to say this was aimed at reimbursing Mr Gama for monies that he had already paid because that is something – and I am not criticising Mr Gama, that is something that we heard about for the first time when Mr Gama gave his evidence, that is my recollection.  So, Mr Gama, when we get the files I will then take you to this single paragraph.     Yes, thank you.  And then, as I recall your evidence dealing with the MBA, I just wanted to go back to one thing.  As I understand, Mr Gama, you mustcorrect me if I am wrong, you say that your [indistinct], that the university conducted an investigation when the allegations about Mr Sagar came to light, is that correct?     And I asked you whether you be prepared to share those documents with us, it probably is my fault, for not having followed up on that, are you still prepared to share those documents with us?     Have you?     Yes, thank you, Chairperson, we can get out the files.     Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Gama, as I understand it, the files have now been retrieved from the store.  Could I ask you please to go to Transnet bundle 3, that is EXHIBIT 16 and 17, Mapoma and Todd.  I would like you to go to 16 and if I could ask you please to turn uppage 19.  I am just going to show you the provision in the settlement agreement.     19.  So the relevant clause is clause 3.5, which I read to you.  I was requested to show you it in     Page 19, one nine.     No, bundle 3.     EXHIBIT 16.       Bundle 3, EXHIBIT 16.     No.     So paragraph 3 or clause 3.5    Alright.  Now, Mr Gama, could I ask you please to go back to page – bundle 7, page 22, yourfirst affidavit.     Bundle 7.  I just want to – I have not led you with reference to each particular paragraph but you     Yes, is there anything that you feel you would like to deal with at this stage?  Of course my learned friend is more than entitled to re-examine you andto take you to anything that he feels has been left out but for present purposes is there anything that you wish to deal with that has not been dealt with?        Right.  And then at page 29 you deal with Mr Mapoma’s statement and that is, we know, relates to your reinstatement and costs.  That goes all the way to page 35.  Anything you want to deal with there?     And then at page 36 you deal withthe evidence of Mr Todd and you deal with his affidavit dated the 31 July which deals with your reinstatement and then at page 40 you deal with what is referred to as his second affidavit and that relates more to the GNS issues and that runs through to the end of page 46.  Those are things that we canvassed last time, is there anything you would like to add to that?     And then at the foot of page 46 you have a heading In General and you then deal with paragraph 29, any political interference, those are paragraphs in the 10.6, 30 that deals with costs, 31 deals with your visits to – or your single visit to the Saxonwold compound and that then runs on to the end of page 30.  Is there anything you want to add to that?    And then you deal with overseas travel at the foot of page 50.  The only trip that we have deal with and that we have questioned you about is the January 2016 trip which you deal with – and we dealt with this morning at paragraph 32.5 and further.  We went through that this morning.     Is there anything you want to add to that?    And then page 53, at the foot of the page, the basis for the three payments of legal costs, I think we’ve traversed most of that.  That then takes you to     If I could then take you please – those assisting me have managed to have placed in the file your latest affidavit, the one you gave us this morning dealing with witness two.  Could I ask you please to go to page 262?  So it’s 250.262, right towards the end of bundle 7.     Point 262, you will find it, Mr Gama, the last sort of 20 pages or so.     250.262, yes, Chairperson.  Are you there, Mr Gama.     There you find an affidavit, it starts at 262, it runs to 269 and it includes I think it is four annexures SG1 through to SG4 running from point 270 topoint 297.  Do you confirm that?     If I could ask you then to turn page to page 250.269, the signature page and although the date is not filled in there it would appear from the police stamps and I would just ask you to confirm this, that you appear to have deposed to this affidavit on the 26 April 2021, presumably earlier this morning.     And do you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Chairperson, might I ask you then to enter into evidence Mr Gama’s affidavit deposed to on the 26 April 2021 as EXHIBIT 28.5.15?    Now, Mr Gama, this affidavit deals with the affidavit of witness 2.  What I would like to do is to take you to that affidavit and then we will also obviously go through what is in effect your response.  But perhaps, ifyou wish, leave open bundle 7 at page 250.262.  Could I ask you to draw out bundle BB14D?     BB14D.  If I could ask you – and I am now going to refer you to the red numbers of the right hand side.  Could you turn to page 89 please?  Are you there?    Are you there, Mr Gama.     I want to just take you through this    Presumably because you do not have personal knowledge of paragraph 1?      “3. For the period January 2018 to December 19 I was self-employed.  In this period I was contracted to perform close protection duties for various business people in South Africa and other African countries.” Do you have any comment on that?     You are going to cross-refer to your affidavit?     Okay, just give us second, we can balance everything.  Chairperson, that is bundle 7, Mr Gama wishes to cross-refer to his affidavit, that is the affidavit at 250.262, bundle 7.     Please go ahead.     Alright, well let me take you through that, Mr Gama, I suppose the easiest is …[intervenes]     Yes, can I just ask you, what is the source of your information?     Alright and then if I can take you back to witness 2’s affidavit who says – witness 2 says at     Then under the heading    Paragraph 9    Paragraph 9    9.1.1    Is there something you want to add?     Alright.  9.1.2    Mr Jiyane.     I am indebted to you, Mr Gama.     Well, it is the DCJ that usually picks me out but please feel free to do the same.     But other than that point would you agree with that paragraph?     We then go over the page,     Paragraph 9.3    So you say he was not responsible for the maintenance?     Was he responsible for making – sorry, DCJ?     Alright.  If he was not responsible for the maintenance and the technical would he have been responsible for ensuring that your vehicles were in goodorder, in working condition?     Paragraph 9.4    Sorry, I beg your pardon?     Alright.     Yes.     Well, for the purposes of this evidence, if we could stick to the red numbers please.     What colour was your Range Rover Vogue, Mr Gama?     Sorry, just so that I …[intervenes]     Just so I understand your evidence, you say with reference to this photograph this may or may not be your vehicle?     Alright.  Then please go back to paragraph 9.4.3.     Yes and then the third vehicle listed     And then the fifth vehicle that is     I beg your pardon?    Then over the page, paragraph 9.5    Alright.     So Mr Gama if you look at paragraph 9.5, which of those vehicles did you not own?     So just so that I understand it, the Mini Cooper, you say it was my daughter's car, you did not own it?     Ja.     Yes, and then the Land RoverDiscovery and the Lexus four by four at 951 Witness 2 says Land Rover Discovery, which was later traded to buy the Range Rover referred to in paragraph 9.4.2, do you deny that?     952 Lexus four by four which was used by Mr Gama’s wife.     Where do I find the Land Cruiser?     Alright, Lexus four by four which was used by Mr Gama’s wife an old Land Cruiser was traded to buy this.  So you say that 952 is wrong in its entirety?     Okay.     At paragraph 9.6    And then under the heading trips to     On the one occasion that you say you went to the Gupta residence did Witness 2, take you there?    So he may have taken you once?     Paragraph 11    Right, 12    Paragraph 13    Paragraph 14, on a…[intervene]     Paragraph 14    Do you know whether Mr Molefe everdrove an Audi S8?     And do you know whether Mr Jiyane ever drove a white VW Golf R?     Then under the heading suitcase     What do you say to paragraph 15, do you have any comment?      For what period of time did Witness 2, provide you with CP0 services?     He says generally at paragraph 2, you would have seen DCJ, “I was previously employed as a CPO and personal driver for Mr Gama in his capacity of Chief Executive of Transnet and ten later as the new CEOof Transnet.” Can you remember what period of time he provided you with CPO services?     And hence, as you said he might have been the driver who – or he might have taken you to the Gupta residence on the one occasion that you say you went there.     Then at paragraph 16    Paragraph 17    Paragraph 18    During the time that Witness 2, provided you with CPO services, did you have occasion to visit the Maslow Hotel at the corner Rivonia and Grayston Drive, is it somewhere you would go?     And then under the heading     Did you ever meet Mr Essa at Melrose Arch?    Did you know where Mr Essa’s officers were?     At paragraph 20    Could I ask you please to go to red number page 110, one one zero, do you want to comment on that paragraph and the photograph?     But, do you know, picture at page 110, do you know that to be Salim Essa?     Then Witness 2 says at paragraph     Yes, I think that is perhaps best then you can refer to the minutes that you want to or should we go through the whole thing, okay fair enough.  And then at     Please go ahead.     Yes, 2017.     Alright, well perhaps I could take you through this, so that we can go through it thoroughly, if you would try and assist.  You dealing as I understand,correct me if I am wrong, Mr Gama with paragraph 13 at     And then you say at 13.1.1.  “Witness 2 alleges in paragraph 22 to 26.” That is what we have been dealing with. “That on 13 June 2017, I contacted him and allegedly requested him to collect a parcel from Salim Essa at Melrose apartments and that following on the collection of the parcel I allegedly requested him to collect me from African Pride Hotel.  As can be seen from Annexure W2-05, Witness 2 arrived at Melrose Arch at 20h27 anddeparted 20h36.”     Between half past five and 6 o'clock in the afternoon or early evening?     And if we can - I can take you then to SG2.     Oh sorry.  From annexure W2-06   Thank you Chairperson.  Good afternoon Mr Gama.    We had been looking at SG2 at page 250.276 and we saw that that was a special board meeting   So if I understand the point you make in your affidavit at paragraph 13.3 you say that W206 reflects that Witness 2 left Pretoria at 19H43 – one hour and forty minutes after the meeting had concluded.  You say there was – would be no reasonable explanation for me tostay in Pretoria for one hour and forty minutes after the meeting. Is that right?    If we go please to that annexure at page 114 – red numbers – 114.    Yes I beg your pardon.      So the first part of it appears to reflect if one follows how the timing works in other instances and    As you have it though you would haveleft at approximately what time?    And then the second part the fact that    But you have accepted that you wereat CSIR for the whole day.    But Mr Gama how can you say with certainty that you would not have – or that you would have left immediately and that you would not have stayed there for another hour and a half or so?    How can you say that?    So what – when you look then at 114 is – is it your case that you –you consider this page here to be a fraud or are you saying well perhaps Witness 2 went tothese places but he was not going with me    But would Witness 2 have taken you on the 13t h of June 2017 to the CSIR in the ordinary course?    No in the ordinary course of events?    Yes.  Yes.    Yes thank you.  So if we go back to the affidavit page 94.    No Witness 2’s affidavit.    So do I understand then if you go to page 95 that what you saying is you did not go Melrose Arch – page 95.  Red numbers.    At the top of the page.  Is that what you are saying?    Okay.  Did you then later that evening go to this address in Bryanston of a close friend of yours?    Okay let us have a look at what – go back to this annexure at 114.  In fact at 115 at the foot of the    114 and the second page of it is 115.  It reflects that Witness 2 arrived at this Bryanston address at    Sorry.    Well would there have been any reason for Witness 2 to go there without you?    So Mr Gama I just want to understand    Did Witness 2 transport you to an address in Bryanston?    Mr Gama did you have a close friend who resided at 22 Egland Road, Bryanston?    Not your house?    So what would have caused Witness 2 then literally in the middle of the night to go to this address    Thank you.  And did you – I might have asked you this – did you on the – the evening or the night of 13 June go to this residence of your close friend in Bryanston?     Do you see the green circle?     Yes.  Where to from here?  Consulate General.  Opposite that.  You see that time     19    One, seven ...[intervenes]      Two, six.     I will ...[intervenes]      Perhaps I can ask the investigators, Chairperson.  In fact, I have already asked them.     What we have here is an improved copy.     I will see if they can perhapsimprove this page in particular.     Maybe there is a different way that it can be printed or perhaps print it in a darker or lighter colour or something so that it can be seen.     And then the Annexure W-208, you will find at 119.     And there you will see 25 ClevelandRoad, Sandhurst.       And then at paragraph 30 you say     Under the heading at 13 July at page 250.267, paragraph 14.    You want to go through that?     250.267.     [laughs]     Yes.     Well, I – I mean, perhaps a better way to do it is just to ask Mr Gama’s attorneys to print this out for us in an A5 or something that we can all read and it can then be attached to his affidavit.     Mr Gama, you say that on the13 t h of July, you attended this whole-day meeting.  If you go to page 278.  So this is a meeting that is held at the offices of the TNPA, Transnet National Ports Authority in Parktown.  Is that right?     But the minutes, in fact, reflected that you were not there the whole day.  If you go to page     Well, do how we do we know that you stayed until the end of the meeting?     When you read the minutes, it seems to me that you came there and you told the people a seriesof things from your perspective as the GCE that captured, is it not?     Two hours later Mr Gama.     Okay.     Can you after – if you go to 285.  It     Was that your input?     Is it recorded there in those passages?     I think what I will – what I am looking to ask you is.  If you have a look above theheading 8.6 at page 287.     You will see that the second last    Page 287.     Just above the heading 8.6.  It is where it says the meeting was adjourned.  Two lines above that – three lines above that you will see there is a     Do you see any further reference to you in these minutes after that?     Ja, I understand your evidence.  Iam just asking you if you see any reference to you having said anything after that?     So if we go back to Witness 2’s affidavit.  Did you on this day, the 13 t h of July, did you go to 25 Cleveland Road?     Do you know anyone who stays at 25 Cleveland Road?     And he says at paragraph 30 that you later accused him of stealing some of the money from the bag.     And if you have a look at page 117 of Witness 2’s annexure.  You will see that it reflects that he then proceeds to 22 Algan(?) Road.     117.  Arrives at 19    I am sorry?    How do you know that you actually attended that meeting with the chairperson of the board?     Yes, but the diary, does that reflect that you attended it or does it reflect an appointment?     So Mr Gama, can you think of any reason why Witness 2, if he was not dropping you off at half-past seven on the evening of 13 July 2017, would have gone to 22 Algan Road for five minutes?     You cannot think of any reason?     Alright.  Let us then go back to page     Okay.  Mr Game, before we get to that.  Was there R 100 000,00 in the wheel compartment of your vehicle?     Oh.     Right.  You stay in Pony Lane in Midrand.     Alright.  And you were at a point driving a Mercedes-Benz SL63?    And would it be unusual for him to check on the condition of your vehicles whilst you are away?     When you were overseas, what did the CPO’s that were assigned to you, what would the typically do?     And if they do not take leave?     Then Witness 2 goes on under the     You will see there, Denel Dynamics,towards the middle of the page.  Nellmapius Drive, Irene,     Yes, DCJ.     When you say he was coached by who you think that happened?      Yes, thank you.  How does one explain then all the details?    How does one explain all the detail?    You see Mr Gama, I suppose it is something that we are going to unpack in more detail in time, but what you are doing, you are dealing with this what might be described as the ordinary course.  Evidence is going to be led in this commission shortly that at the Guptas they had a cash dispensing machine.    A cash dispensing machine, an ATM machine.     You have also heard evidence that Mr Singh for example had eight safety deposit boxes at Knox Volt.  Evidence is going to be heard in this commission that Mr Peter, his replacement and the your chief financial officer he had or his mother had seven safe deposit boxes at Knox Ville. Evidence has been led by drivers that cash was stored there.  This is not an ordinary situation we are dealing with.  One thing that it is not ...[intervenes]     Yes.     And this commission has heard a raft of evidence about there being lots and lots of cash used by many, many a senior executive.  So what it perhaps turns on is how many occasions you went to the Guptas.  You say you only went there once.     Let us deal then with having dealt with the red medical aid bag.  Let us deal with random collections of cash at page 97.  I recall occasions wherecash amounts were given to Gama at random places.  Cash collected at, is that [indistinct].      Perhaps we should deal with it now.      Chairperson if it is a convenient point.     Shedding light on your evidence.     Thank you.  Let us carry on at page 9011.At paragraph 39 under the heading random    Okay.  At 41   And you were driven there by witness 2?    You were driven there by witness 2.      And Giyane was there in his Mercedes Benz GL.    You had an impressive array of vehicles Mr Gama, I would have thought you would have been able to tell us.     You do not think there is such a thing?      Alright, and then under the heading     A new Mercedes Benz S65 as a test vehicle?    But you had then booked out, let me get the language right, a demo Mercedes Benz S65.      And you asked him to collect it in Midrand, not from your house?    I see.     43   Sorry   Alright.    Okay.    Paragraph 44   Paragraph 44    So could you just explain what actually did happen here?  So you test drove this S65 and at a point you then got out of it and got into your car which – let me understand what happened.     Right and then?     Alight.  And then under the heading    Yes, I would just like to take you to two last paragraphs please.  Page 100, paragraph 58,     And then finally paragraph 59    No, Mr Gama, I just want to point out something to you.  Can you go to page …[intervenes]     Yes, sure.     Yes.     I have got – on this score I have got literally two more questions or three more questions to ask Mr Gama to finish on this.    Mr Solomons just Whatsapped me to find out whether we are on for four o’clock.     The remote link is in the process of being established.     Fair enough.     Yes.     Mr Gama I just wanted to take you, if I may, to page 94 of Witness 2’s statement or affidavit.  From what I can see Witness 2 only ever uses three specific dates, he talks of the collection on the 13 t h of June 17, you see that, then over the page ...[intervenes]      94, red numbering.   He speaks of acollection on 13 June 2017, we have been over this, and over the page a collection on the 13 t h of July 2017 and then the third time that he uses a specific date is in paragraph 36 he speaks of you having been at a meeting at Denel on the 20 t h of April 2017, but we know that’s not contentious because you accept that.  So, the two dates, events in relation to the 13 t h of June and the 13 t h of July are contentious but, on both occasions, you have, via the information that has been provided to you by the Commission, been able to source minutes of meetings, a special meeting of the Board of Directors and then a meeting of the TNPA which, on your version establishes your defence, is that correct? MR     Your explanation, okay.     So, if you could then go, please to your affidavit and can I take you to paragraph 7 at page 250.2.6.4. paragraph 7 you say, “The legal team of the Commission – as the legalteam of the Commission is well aware, I entertained the thought of causing witness 2 to be cross-examined and in this context, I requested the Commission to provide me with my diaries spanning the period relevant to the testimony of witness 2.  To date such access has not been provided, sub-two, any attempt at causing the effect of cross-examination of witness 2 is dependent on and will be premised upon demonstrating that I was, physically, not in attendance and/or in the company of witness 2 when certain meetings transpired, and cash was conveyed as he alleges but rather that I was elsewhere and potentially in the company of other persons.  The Commission’s legal team’s failure to provide access to my diary has prejudicedme and deprives me of my ability to test the evidence of witness 2 through cross-examination”,Now, if necessary, we can put up an affidavit dealing with this but Mr Gama, you will know, and this has been placed on record before that what the Commission has provided you with is electronic data that would make up a diary, from January 2012 until September 2018, in fact there were over 14 000 records that were provided to you, we went through this last time, Mr Benjamin, in fact delivered this on a flash disk to your attorneys.  I wouldjust ask you, also, to confirm that when you gave evidence on the 11 t h of March my investigators actually sat with your attorney and demonstrated how you could recreate your diary with reference to that electronic information, would you confirm that, on the 11 t h of March?     Mr Gama only three specific dates are given and your case in respect of two of them lies in the minutes which you tracked using the data that was given to you and you’ve actually shown the Chairperson one of these schedules that none of us can read and you say, well that shows me, that I was in a meeting with the Chairperson of the Board.     I beg your pardon?     Yes, they have.     No, I do not wish to apportion blame, I know that the team has – all I say is that the Commission’s legal team has also failed to find it for me, but I know that they tried so maybe it’s just the manner and way in which we write it in English yes.     But Mr Gama that – I’m afraid I don’t understand why you can’t cross-examine the witness with reference to the minutes of the meeting on the 13 t h of June and the minutes of the meeting on the 13 t h of July, just as you’ve articulated your case here.     As I understand it, you in fact, with reference to the electronic information that the Commission provided you with, you were able to work out that on the 13 t h of June you were at the special Board meeting and on the 13 t h of July you were at a meeting on the – with the TNPA and that then caused you or your attorneys to ask the Commission to produce these two sets of minutes.  SG2 and 3 isn’t that correct?     Of course, the point of contention there is not your time of arrival at the meeting, it’s your time of departure and you say that can be determined with reference to the minutes.     And then just to complete this, so we gave you that demonstration on the 11 t h of March then on the 18 t h of March, and you’ve explained how this came about with reference to the information the Commissionhad given you, Mr Khan…[intervenes].     On the 11 t h of March we gave you a demonstration, on the 18 t h of March Mr Khan requested the Commission to provide you with these two sets of minutes and that – I’m sorry that was on the 17 t h on March and on the 18 t h of March Mr Benjamin provided them. You want to see the email string, or will you take my word for it, here it is?     Quite simple Mr Gama, the information that you gave it’s – the information that you were provided with you used it to establish that you were in these two meetings and you asked us to provide you with the minutes and we provided them to you within one day.     You accept that?     Fine.     Mr Gama I’d like to turn to a different topic, and I would like to…[intervenes].     I don’t think it’s necessary DCJ, if the chronology is accepted by Mr Gama, that on the 17 t h a request was made by his attorney for the two sets of minutes and on the 18 t h of March the Commission provided his attorney with the two sets and those are the minutes that then, are next to his affidavit.     Mr Gama, what I would like to do – because it becomes important for many of the topics thatwe’re going to address in due course is to look at your role in relation to the 1064 locomotives and perhaps you could assist us with working out exactly how you fitted in, what role you played from the beginning to the end.  Is it my understanding that in all of your interactions in relation to the 1064 locomotives, and there’s part of your affidavit that I’ll take you to, you were, at all times the Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail?    And then – in fact, let me correct myself right towards the end you took certain decisions, as I recall, you were at the helm for example when the relocation was dealt with and you were also at the helm when the club loan was secured, does that accord with your recollection?  So that would have been in 2015?     So, could you just explain to the Chairperson from the beginning, how this unfolded, the 64 locomotives, your role in it, your role in the business case, your role in the post tender negotiations, your role in the increase in the ETC, from the beginning to the end, to what you were members of sub-committees’ etcetera?     The difficulty with that is that it’sdealt with sort of pitted if you know what I mean, in a sense that, for example, if you look at page 250.1.33 you talk there, about the business case and the handing over of the business case.  Is that a convenient place to start or do you want to start earlier, dealing with the market demand strategy etcetera?    Yes.  So I just wanted to look then at the first phase as you call it – the business case or investment decision.  Could I just take you to certain parts of your affidavit please?  At page 250.133 and I am talking now of your third affidavit.      Bundle 7 Chairperson.  Are you there Mr Gama?    Now just to thrash out what you have    And then you go on to say   Then you say at 9.6   You say at 9.7   And then you say at 9.8   And then I just wanted you to confirm    And the relevance of those dates May 12 when the initial business case was presented and April 13 when the board confirmed it.    The significance of the date May 2012 to April 2013.   And then if I could take you Mr Gama because you – a lot of this is then repeated but gathered together are then quite usefully.  At page 250.169 – 169 under the heading Acquisition of the 1064 diesel and electric locomotives.   169 yes.  Paragraph 78 you confirm that you were then the Chief Executive Officer during the acquisition phase.  You talk about a team from TRF having been responsible.      So could you just perhaps expand upon those various different levels and the role of the Chief Executive, the role of BADC and then the role of the board in relation to the business case.    So I just wanted to ask you about this BADC as we call it the BADC.  That we know is a committee of the board, correct?    And typically who would – who would sit on the BADC?  How many members would it have?    Of the BADC?  So that would have been up until they went – they were seconded to Eskom would it be Mr Molefe and Mr Singh?    And how is the chairperson of theBADC appointed do you know?    So Mr Gama just picking up from that we were at 78.3 and explained that to us and then what youdeal with is the evolution of the business case.  If I could take you to page 171 you will see about seven lines down on    And then you go onto say at 78.6 and    Ja.  Now who was – you say that Mr Jiyane TFR was involved in that procurement process.   Well I do not know if the number is that important but I understood in your affidavit you talked about 40 but we will come to that.    Sure.    I think they referred to as cross – cross-functional.    Alright.    Now Mr Gama perhaps just before we end off for the day let me just ask you this.  Was the – would there then be a time where short – there would be a short list of bidders and that – that preliminary choice or assessment would have to be approved again by the BADC and the board before one entered the post-tender negotiation?   Now Mr Gama I understand that you would not have been involved yourself in the tender evaluation process but that you were involved in the post-tender negotiations, is that correct?    So who – who were the other members of the Locomotive Steering Committee?    And then what has also surfaced in evidence is a sub-committee of the Locomotive Steering Committee.  Do you recall such a body comprising yourself, Mr Molefe and Mr Singh?    Alright.  And so you deal with your role perhaps I could just take you so we can finish this off to    When you talk about the co-chair whowas the other – the other co-chair?    Mr Singh.  And who then you say you – you did not become involved in the negotiations who actually ran and conducted them?    Chairperson I see it is just after five if this is a convenient time to end the daytime session.    Only – the only thing that I can report back to you from my side is Mr Oldwadge will tell you of his position.    Is that apparently Mr ...[intervenes]     Molefe is flexible.    As you know he is scheduled for Thursday night.   He has indicated potentially – we haven’t taken it any further with him.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, I think he wants to address you on that.  As I understand that their positionremains.     It is either Thursday and no Friday.     Or it is Friday.     Then, of course, with the difficulty of Mr Oldwadge not being here but can I let you ...[intervenes]      ...can he address you?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     I think it should, Chair.    We just need to establish a remote link to Mr Solomon.     Thank you, Chair.     Chairperson, as you know, this is an application brought by Mr Gigaba.  You should have the file in front of you.It is – it bears the reference SEQ18/20/2021 and in essence it is an application for a determination that Ms Gigaba’s affidavit be find to be inadmissible.  In the alternative that Mr Gigaba’s statement of response to be admitted and that both his evidence and that of Ms Gigaba be heard in camera and not disclosed tothe public other than to the extent to which you referred to it in your final report and that Mr Gigaba is granted leave to cross-examine Ms Gigaba.     Mr Gigaba is represented by Mr Solomons who is remotely linked but you will see that he is there.  Oh, here he comes.       [No audible reply]      And with your direction and leave, Chairperson  I assume you would want Mr Solomon to address you on the application.     And that he would then respond.    Okay.  DCJ, may I ...[intervenes]      No, sorry.  I am terrible sorry to interrupt but I have been asked that Mr Solomons pleaseclean his camera if possible because the technical people say the picture is very fudged.     Chairperson, I think – well, certainly from the Legal Team’s point of view.  If this is a – if this is going to give rise to a delay because Mr Solomons wants to put in an affidavit, we would rather the matter be dealt with now.     It is not clear to me how this letter ultimately will assist Mr Gigaba.     But obviously, Mr Solomons wants to make his ...[intervenes]     No, Chairperson.  I do not think you do.     received the ...[intervenes]      ...the amended written submissions.     I do not think it is a difficulty if Mr Solomons ...[intervenes]     Yes, thank you Chairperson.  We have prepared some brief written submissions, if I couldhand them up to you.      They have been provided previously to Mr Solomon.    Chairperson, I take it that we also have ...[intervenes]     Ten, 15 minutes.     We will not take more than 15.    So at paragraph 17 we make the point Chairperson, that in general terms the witness’s evidence deals directly with matters that fall within the commission’s terms of reference, and also that the affidavit and the evidence falls within the mandate and area investigation of the commission.Then we set out in paragraph 19 and I am not going to deal with this on the record.    What the witness’s evidence includes and you would have seen that, and a lot of it is corroboratory.     At paragraph 20 we also mention that she presents important original evidence and then at 21 Chairperson, we pose the question then on what basis can this affidavit be found to be inadmissible, and when you look at Mr Gigaba’s affidavit as a whole, he deals withthree main points. Firstly that the affidavit it is alleged seeks to publicise private matters.  Secondly, that the admission of evidence is prejudicial to him and thirdly that the nature of the witness’s evidence, is largely irrelevant and of little probative value. We say the first contention is founded on the allegation that the witness’s approach to the commission is and I quote “an improper effort to advance her gender in our divorce proceedings.”  Well Chairperson, that is a matter for evidence, as motive often is. Then as for the balance of the applicant’s complaints under this head, about personal and matrimonial communications and as he puts it most disturbingly references to our children, they will withoutmerits and I would invite you Chairperson, to have regard to paragraph 16 of the papers and perhaps I could just take you there. This is at page 9, paragraph 16.  Thirdly and most disturbingly, Nomshula makes several references to our children and this is a point Chairperson that you put to Mr Solomon.  When you look at these five sub paragraphs, I mean they are completely innocuous.  They are contextual and I am not going to go into the detail for obvious reasons.  We go back to oursubmissions at paragraph 24, the second contention is premises on the hypothesis that the witness may assert marital communication privilege under cross-examination and thus avoid answering questions which would otherwise implicate her improper motive, and this will somehow cause procedural prejudice. Well, of course that is an hypothesis.  We do not know whether Ms Gigaba is going to do that.  But what is clear is that marital privilege does not apply in these proceedings and what we also know is that that privilege for the purposes of the affidavit was waved. Then the third contention is the weakest of all of them.  What is submitted is that large parts of the evidence are irrelevant and of little probative value.Now Chairperson, if I could take you please to paragraph 28.3of the affidavit at page 15 and I would invite you Chairperson to read through these various paragraphs and ask yourself how conceivably can these things that are listed here be irrelevant. In fact it is hard to imagine with respect a greater relevance to the work of this commission within some of the things that are listed in this paragraph.      Yes.  So ...[intervenes]     This is highly admissible.     All three legs that are relied upon are without merit.  We then come to the in camera part of things and really what I want to just direct your attention to if I may, is paragraphs 34 and 35 of our submissions. Of course Chairperson, what needs to be done here is there must be a comparable waiting of competing rights or interests.  That is what caused this.  As in the case of courts, one of the factors to be weighed in the balance, is the importance of retaining the trust and confidence of the public in the proceedings of the commission, and also in its eventual findings and recommendation.     Well, precisely.    DCJ, what we do is we sight some authorities at footnote 19.  If I could please take you to the flag that we have at the end of our heads.     Where we reproduce those three quotations, all judgments of the constitutional court.  Obviously all in different contexts.  But what strikes a particular cord with us, is Shinga at the bottom.  Paragraph25.  The section makes dangerous inroads into our system of justice, which ordinarily requires court proceedings that affect the rights of parties to be heard in public.   These were criminal appeals in chambers.  It provides that an appeal can be determined by a judge behind closed doors and we say that this is equally [indistinct] and particularly important.  No member of the public will know what transpired.Nobody can be present at the hearing.  Far from having any merit, the provisions is amicable to the rule of the law, to the constitutional mandate of transparency into justice itself, and the danger must not be underestimated.  Those court proceedings carry within them the seeds forserious potential damage to every pillar on which every constitutional democracy is based.And then if I could take you to paragraph 35 and this is the point that you were raising with our learned     Thank you.  So, Chairperson, the bottom line here is this is a highly relevant and admissible affidavit, it would do fundamental damage to the public perception of this Commission if we were to go literally behind doors. And then insofar as Ms Gigaba’s letter is concerned, I do not want to prejudge what Ms Gigaba’s counsel may or may not make of this letter but it is not clear to me that Ms Gigaba is saying that she is not cooperating with the Commission.     Yes.     Well, that is the point I want to make in conclusion, DCJ.  Paragraphs 10 and 11, the last     If there are errors in her affidavit well, those must be corrected.     Those are our submissions.     As you please, Chair.     Yes, I am, Chairperson.  With your leave I understood that my learned friend would like to address you.       Chairperson, subject to your direction I would prefer to lead Ms Gigaba’s evidence.     I certainly do intend to respond to this.     But I would not like that to interfere with the presentation of her evidence.     As you have mentioned there might be things here that we need to investigate and look at a bitmore carefully.     Yes thank you.   Ms Gigaba the practice in the Commission is that I am going to take youto your affidavit, take you to the last page where it was signed ...[intervenes]      Thank you.  Chairperson Ms Gigaba’s affidavits are Exhibit BB26, there are two of them.  Ms Gigaba could I take you please to page 999 when we refer to pages they are the black numbers on the left hand side, and we refer just to the last digits.     I understand so Mr Chairperson yes.     999.  Are you there Ms Gigaba?     Now there is an affidavit, it starts at page 999, perhaps I could ask you to go through my learned colleague reminds me Chairperson that Ms Gigaba hasn’t yet been sworn in as a witness.   I do apologise.    Yes I am told that the transcribers didn’t pick that up.     Yes thank you.  So at 999 if I can ask you then to turn to page 1016, you will see that’s the end of the affidavit.  1016 is the signature page Ms Gigaba and then – are you there, at 1016.     And then attached to that affidavit are four annexures, A, B, C and D, pictures of the bag.  Do you see that?       If I could ask you to go to page16, do I understand that you attested to this affidavit at Sandton on the 6 t h of March 2021.     And will you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit, subject to any corrections that you will make during the course of your testimony?     Would you confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit subject to any corrections that you may make during the course of your evidence thisevening?     Certainly.     Chairperson might I then ask that you admit Ms Gigaba’s affidavit dated the 6 t h of March commencing at page – Bundle 7, 999, as Exhibit BB26.1.   Thank you.  Ms Gigaba you will see that you then depose to another affidavit, it is a short one dealing with the threats.     You will find that at page 1021, and attached to that affidavit are – or is one annexure marked NS1, do you see that?    Can I ask you please to go to page 23 and would you confirm that you attested to this affidavit at Sandton also on the 6 t h of March 2021?     And would you similarly then subject to any corrections that you may make during the course of your evidence confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Chairperson if I could ask you to admit then Ms Gigaba’s affidavit dated the 6 t h of March commencing at bundle 7 page 1021 as Exhibit BB26.2     Alright, Ms Gigaba if I could ask you then to go back to your first affidavit at page 999, are you there?     Alright, perhaps I could just start out by asking you are you in a position to confirm that you were at all times when this affidavit was being prepared represented by Senior Counsel?     And in fact he procured your signature of this affidavit, is that correct?     I beg your pardon?     Alright, we will come to that.     So Ms Gigaba I wonder if I can just point this out to you.   I am going to ask you the questions because you speak quite faintly and you are more than entitled to do that, but I am going to ask you the questions, you need to direct your answers at the Chairperson, so you don’t need to – don’t feel you have to look at me when you are speaking, you must speak to the Chairperson, okay?     Alright, so let’s start at paragraph 1, it says that you are an adult female businessman, a businessperson sorry, and you reside in Pretoria, is that correct?     And when did you marry Mr Gigaba.     And are you still married?     In paragraph 4 it says that on the 21 s t and 22 n d of January the Commission interviewed you, is that correct?     How did you come to be interviewed by the Commission?    That’s Sakhile Masuku?     And was that after your ENCA interview?      Is it correct that you stated during the ENCA interview that you were prepared to assist theCommission?     You say at paragraph 5 at page 1000 that you are assisted by your counsel, we know that your senior counsel, Thembeka Ncetobe, withdrew as your counsel and has now been replaced, but have your attorneys throughout been RMT Attorneys?     Did they also assist you in the preparation of this affidavit?     Okay, so he attended without the attorney.     And you are quite right, on the 8 t h ofApril when we met your attorney came along.     Alright and then there are – there is a heading saying the government position is held by Malusi over the period from 2009 to 2019, and then they are listed, it says at paragraph 6 Mr Gigaba held positions tabled below over the years 2004 to 2018, do you confirm that he held those positions?     So presumably ...[intervenes]     So just to go through this you knew that at a certain point Mr Gigaba was the Deputy Ministerof the Department of Home Affairs, I think you go on to say in your affidavit that when you met him he occupied that position, isn’t that so?     Okay at that point he was the Deputy Minister of the Department of Home Affairs?     And then can you recall when he became the Minister of the Department of Public Enterprises, DPE, did he hold that position at a time?     And then after that he became the Minister of the Department of Home Affairs, is that correct?     Can you recall when that was?     Alright, and then what was his final ...[intervenes]    And you recall then that the final ministerial position that he held ...[intervenes]       What was his last position as a Minister?     And if you have a look at paragraph 7 did Mr Gigaba ever say anything to you about being involved in ANC elections?     What did he tell you?     Then you go on to deal with your relationship with Mr Gigaba and the Gigaba family, when did you meet Mr Gigaba for the first time?     Well when did you meet him?     Well I was actually getting at the year, I don’t need you to be more specific with the day.     Alright, so you say I met Mr Gigaba during 2009 and you have already told the Chairperson that at that time when you met him he was the Deputy Minister of the Department of Home Affairs, is that correct?     And was there a time when you moved in with him into his Pretoria home?     Can you remember when that was?     And were you expecting a child at that point?     Did Mr Gigaba provide you with any financial means when you moved in with him?     Can you explain that?     When were you then subsequently married, you have already told us that was on the 30 t h of August 2014, correct?     Whereabouts is Mr Gigaba’s familyhome situated?     Mr Gigaba, how many sisters does he have?     One of them Gugu Gigaba?     And do you know where she is employed?     Whereabouts?     And Mr Gigaba’s other sister, what is her name?     And do you know where she worked?     Alright, and was there a time where she lived together with you and Mr Gigaba?     Now the next heading deals with meeting the Guptas and visits to the Gupta residence and you will see that that’s a part of the affidavit that goes on for that page, the next page, page 1033 and 1044, quite a lengthy section.  So let us work our way through this.  You refer in paragraph 12 to the fact that from the time that you met Mr Gigaba, when he was the Deputy Minister of theDepartment of Home Affairs he would visit certain persons, is that correct?     And who did he refer to those persons as?       He referred to them as?     Advisors, and did he explain to you what he was doing in meeting with his advisors?     So at this point in time did you know who his advisors were?     And if I understand your evidence did you make a presumption, did you presume that he was talking about Thami Msomi?      And who was he.     You then go on to say – you talk about something having happened two or three months before Mr Gigaba took up the position of Minister of DPE, can you remember what happened?     At paragraph 13 you deal with something that occurred two or three months before he took up the position as the Minister of DPE.     What happened?     Did he tell you where he had received this, or from whom he had received this news that he was going to move to being the Minister of the DPE?     Ajay who?     And at that point in time had you met Mr Ajay Gupta?     And then perhaps you could tell us how often did Mr Gigaba visit his so-called advisors once he became the Minister of the DPE, can you remember?     Thank you Chairperson.  So you say when he became the Minister of the DPE he went there to meet his advisors more often, is that what you said?     And was there a time when you asked him about who are these advisors?     What was his response?     Did he tell you who these unofficial advisors were?     What did he say?     Did he tell you what they advised him about?     Did the frequency of Mr Gigaba’s visits to the Guptas ever cause you concern or unhappiness?     Can you explain that?    And when you raised that concern with him what was his response?     And did he tell you why he needed to meet these advisors?     I see.   Now in paragraph 16 you deal with Mr Gigaba’s visits to his advisors when it was sitting and then when Parliament was in recess perhaps you could just take the Chairperson through that.    So when Parliament – when Parliament was sitting now when would Mr Gigaba go to Cape Town in a typical week?    Monday evening or Tuesday morning?    And when would he come back?    And would he then when Parliament was sitting would he inform you as to when he was going to the Gupta’s?    So that would either on the Monday morning or the Friday evening?    And then when Parliament was in recess?    And how would these meetings come about?   Yes.  So how do you know that he went to the Gupta’s?    He would tell you?    When did you first meet Mr Gigaba’s advisors?    Yes.    Sorry.    And in what year was that?    2011.    And how did that meeting come about you deal with this at paragraph 17.1?    And did you agree then to go to the Gupta’s residence?    But you then did go there?    And who did you meet at the Gupta residence on this first visit?    And what happened during the course of that meeting?    Oh well what happened during thatvisit?    And did they give your son any gift of any sort?    Can you remember what it was?    What was the necklace made of?    Now that is in 2011 so that was your first visit.  What happened in 2012?    In terms of visiting the Saxonwold compound.  Did you go there in 2012?   How often did you go to the Saxonwold residence in 2012?    No I am asking you yourself how often did you go in 2012?    Thank you.  Now your second son when was he born?    Can you remember the month – I remember telling you that I noticed that your second son was born on Christmas day.    25t h of December.    Did you – did you then have occasion to visit the Gupta’s again?    And why did you go to the Gupta’s after your second son was born?    Now in 2013 did you attend the Gupta wedding?    Right.  Now you in paragraphs 19 anddeal with the Waterkloof Airforce Base do you want to just deal with that?    Did you go to the Waterkloof Airforce Base?    Did you go there before or after the wedding?    Was it the day before?   Can you remember what day of the week that was?    Now how did it come about that you went to Waterkloof?    And what did you do there?    Yes.    And then what….    Yes thank you and then on the day of the Gupta wedding did you accompany Mr Gigaba?    And this paragraph then and you have – you have indicated to me during our consultation that thereis an error and we pointed it out to you because it reflects paragraph 20. “That we packed and were escorted to attend the Waterkloof to receive the Gupta aircraft.  When we left Waterkloof there were many blue light vehicles and Metro police.” That is a sentence that could either be deleted or should find its way into paragraph 19, is that correct?    Alright but you only mention.    Thank you when you were at the…    Yes.    Thank you.  Did you meet any of the Gupta family whilst you were at the wedding?    Sorry you said Ms Gigaba?    It was?    Alright.    You refer in this paragraph 20 to a facebook photo what happened there?    Alright now after the Gupta wedding di you continue to go to the Gupta residence in Saxonwold?    How often would you go there?    Then what you do at paragraph 22 is you explain the procedure that would be followed each time you attended the Gupta residence.  Please explain that?  Tell us about the procedure?  How did it work practically?   So can I just ask you to…    Mr Gigaba do you mind.    I am actually struggling to hear youcan you speak a little bit louder.  I cannot see your …    Alright so you were saying that Ajay would arrive just explain how that would work?    When you went to the – the Gupta residence you gained access into the house or the residence.  You mentioned that Ajay would then arrive.   Okay and what will happen then?    And would you have your cell phone with you?    What happened with your cell phones when you went to the Gupta residence?    And who would you see when you went to the Gupta residence?    Who would you see?  Would you see other people – people you knew when you went to the Gupta residence?    So Mr Msomi you have told us about.  Mr Mahlangu who was he?    Who was Mr Mahlangu?    And where would these meetings be held between Ajay and Mr Gigaba?    Did you ever ask Mr Gigaba why you had to turn in your cell phone?    And what did he say?    Now you have mentioned to us that you saw Mr Ajay Gupta, Mr Mahlangu and Mr Msomi.    There did you see anybody else attending meetings?    And when you went to the residence did you sometimes find cars already parked there?    What sort of cars?    Okay how did you know they were state cars?   Now you have mentioned that when you went to the Gupta residence Ajay would meet with you and he would hold discussions with Mr Gigaba and then they would go off to the meeting room.  What sorts of things would be discussed in your presence between Mr Ajay Guptaand Mr Gigaba before they went for a meeting?    Alright.    And what was Mr – or what was Ajay Gupta briefing Mr Gigaba about?  What was the sorts of things that he briefed him about?    And can you remember what – what was discussed or what was briefed in relation to Transnet?    And what – what did you hear about SAA?    And during these briefing sessions did you ever hear any mention made of Eskom?    And what – what was said about Eskom?    Alright and then was there ever a time where Mr Gigaba held a discussion with you about Mr Dames?   What did he say?    Alright.  These visits to the Gupta residence how long would they last for usually?    An hour to two hours?    Then at page 1005 it deals –    Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Gigaba you then go on to deal with meetings held at our home.  Whereabouts was that?  Was that the ministerial home in Pretoria?    Alright.  And you start by dealing with meetings with the Gupta’s.    He came to your home?    You say that Ajay came to your home?   Right how many times?    And whereabouts – what did he do there?    And whereabouts in what room were the meetings held?   Alright.  And did Mr Gigaba tell you what he was meeting Ajay Gupta about?    So what Eskom project was giving Mr Gigaba sleepless nights?    Sorry.    Then you go on to deal with meetings with Mr Gigaba’s staff.  Was there a time where his staff visited your home?    Alright can I…    Thank you.  Now you go on at paragraph or in 30 and 30.1 you deal with a trip to Mumbai and New Delhi and what we identified during our consultation you will remember is that there is an error.  This is anotherarea where there is an error.    In the affidavit because it says at 30.1   Okay.  So we know from Mr Gigaba’s affidavit that he says it happened in 2015 do you accept that now?    Okay.      Alright so this is a part of your affidavit that I understand you would want to correct.   In a supplementary affidavit because it may very well be that the change of the date then has knock-on effect as these things often do.  But presently do you remember what happened in India, what was the purpose of this trip?     Alright.  And in India, who did you travel with?  Who did Mr Gigaba travel with?     Would that have included Mr Msomi?     And you say that they had attendedvarious meetings.   “I did not see with whom they met as I was out shopping when they attended the meetings.”  Is that correct?     And then you deal with the Johannesburg/Mumbai flight route.  What happened there?     Just whilst we are on this issue of a supplementary affidavit.  As I understand it, because it has been shared with me.  Mr Ngetobi(?), your counsel, actually prepared a draft supplementary affidavit.     After our consultation on the 8 t h of April, was it?     And this was – you would have seen, was one of the paragraphs that is addressed in there.     You confirm that?    No, absolutely, DCJ.  I mean, that the simple point.  I am not suggesting that the witness is bound by any affidavit and of course she can say what she wants to.     But the simple point is that during the consultation on the 8 t h of April, it was identified that there was a problem with this paragraph.    I alerted Mr Ngetobi(?)  [00    The reason that I highlight that is there is no point in me then taking this witness through every single line of all these paragraphs because it need to be amended.     Yes.     Please do.     Yes, thank you.  Then, Ms Gigaba, at     Paragraph 31.1.     You say after one of The New Age Breakfasts, Mr Gigaba then told you something.  What did he tell you?    Yes.     Okay.  So the heading to this section is Prior Knowledge of Appointments of State-owned Enterprises.  Was there a time when Mr Gigaba would tell     Were there occasions where he said X is going to happen and then it did happen?     Can you remember those instances?  To whom was he talking about?     And so he said to you that Brian Molefe would go to Eskom?     And I think you have mentioned ...[intervenes]     So he told you ...[intervenes]      Yes, certainly.     Thank you.  So that deals with Mr Molefe.  Did Mr Gigaba ever mention anything to youabout Mr Gama?     What did he tell you?     Be appointed as the CEO?    You see, Ms Gigaba, perhaps to be of some assistance to you.  This is another issue that we looked at during our consultation.  Because as the Chairperson has pointed out to you.  In 2011, Mr Gama wasreinstated as the Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail and that was at a time when Mr Gigaba was the DPE Minister.  He was then in 2015 made the Group Chief Executive of Transnet by which time Mr Gigaba was no longer the DPE Minister.  And as I recall, you talked about being put back into a position.  Do you remember that?     Thank you.  At paragraph 31.3, you also say something about Mr Gama.     Can you deal with that, please?     So was there – how – do you know how Gugu Gigaba came to be employed at Transnet?     Thank you.  Then Ms Gigaba, there is a heading, Tensions Rising.  Do you see that?     Now whilst Mr Gigaba was the Minister of the DPE, was there a time when you felt that the Guptas were putting pressure on him or did he mention that to you?    And what did he say?     So was there a time where you discussed this with Mr Gigaba, the pressure that you say was being put on him?     So was there ever a time in that context in that you suggested to Mr Gigaba that he might stop using these advices?     Did you – you say in the middle of     Was there a time – have a look at paragraph 33 – when the relationship between Mr Gigaba and the Guptas appeared to be strained?     And when was that?  Can youremember?     Now did Mr Gigaba often receive calls from Mr Ajay Gupta? MS     And why – what would cause him not to take the calls?    And what would happen if he ignored the Guptas calls?    Yes, thank you.  I just want to take you through paragraph 33.  Tell me if there is parts of it   Is that correct or is there something wrong with this paragraph?  Is there anything wrong with it?    Alright.  Then you go on to deal with Mr Gigaba’s relationship with Dudu Myeni.  Now was there a time where Mr Gigaba had a close working relationship with Ms Myeni?    When was that?    Paragraph 34 goes on to read thatMs Myeni facilitated our honeymoon trip to Mauritius.  What do you mean by that?    Yes.  So this was a trip to Mauritius if I understand correctly what you say.     That you took shortly before you got married.   And when you say Ms Myeni facilitated the trip, what do you mean by that?    So who paid for this trip to Mauritius?    Now can you remember where Mr Gigaba would meet, typically meet with Ms Myeni?    Alright.      Sorry?    She would come to your home?    And was there a time then where their relationship soured?    How did that come about, why?     Now you say at paragraph 37, let me ask you did Mr Gigaba ever mention anything to you about the SAA Johannesburg Mumbai flight route?    Was that an issue that was causingconcern?    Chairperson, I have a request that we take a short comfort break.  I see that it has just gone nineo’clock.    Yes.     No, I am fine.     Yes, I am keen I am sure like everyone to finish this evidence.    Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Gigaba, can I ask you to have a look at paragraph 37 at the bottom of page 1007.  You say that on Sundays Mr Gigaba and I would regularly have lunch in Sandton.  Is that correct?      You say at paragraph 37   37.    Sorry, page 1007.    So paragraph 37 is at the bottom.  Are you there?    “So on Sundays Mr Gigaba and I would regularly have lunch in Sandton.  While driving to return home I would overhear Mr Gigaba’s telephone discussions with Ms Myeni.  He would sometimes share the detail of these discussions with me and that would include.”What does the, if you go over the page, what was the sorts of things that he would tell you after holding these discussions with Ms Myeni?    Sorry?   Okay, and that is about following instructions, etcetera.     Was there a time where he said to you that he did not understand why she had been appointed as the Chair of SAA because he did not believe she was competent?    Yes, and did he say to you that shewould feed information to the former president?    Did he say to you that Ms Myeni would feed information to the former president without telling him about that?    He felt that?    And then paragraph 37.3, and these    “Ms Myeni would then pass on instructions from President Zuma to Mr Gigaba which would upset him.  Mr Gigaba believed that he should have a direct line of communication to the former president and not receive instructions via Ms Myeni, because he did not report to her.”Is that correct?    And then at 38, can you deal with that please?      What did Ms Myeni tell Mr Gigaba?    And was there a time when Mr Gigaba did return to the Department of Home Affairs?    Yes, thank you.  Then you have a heading, Mr Gigaba’s return to the Department of Home   Yes.     Because that date accords with the date in the schedule, in paragraph 6.  All the different positions that he held.     Yes.     That is actually Ms Gigaba what I am saying here, is that this is, you did not remember this date, you were assisted with the date.    Correct.  But you do remember him being transferred back to the Department of Home Affairs.     But I am not sure that is the right language perhaps, but he moved.     Did Mr Gigaba think that he would be moved back?    Why?    And what was Mr Gigaba’s reaction to being returned or to moving back as you put it, to the Department of Home Affairs?  How did he feel about it?    Did he tell you what had happened?   Did he tell you what the president told him?    And did he tell you why the president had said that he was going to be moved back?      Alright.     Thank you.  You then go on to deal with the Gupta’s application for South African citizenship.  What did Mr Gigaba tell you about this?    Sorry, for some reason I am not hearing you clearly.  What did you say?    Yes, but what did Mr Gigaba tell you?    Alright.     So is this a part of the affidavit that you want to correct?    Okay, well when it says at 42 that during Mr Gigaba’s turn of office as Minister of the Department of Home Affairs, he informed me that he was assisting some of the Gupta family members to obtaincitizenship in South Africa.     Well, perhaps we could ask you in your own words what happened in relation to the Guptas application for South African citizenship, that you know.  That you learnt from Mr Gigaba.     So if I understand you correctly, please correct me if I am wrong.  You have a particular    So you say ...[intervenes]     But if you take out that and we take out the date in 2015 you have any particular concerns in relation to paragraph 42 and 43, because it refers ...[intervenes]     We were, but what I am interested in is your own personal experience.      Yes, I think we are happy to move on, on that basis.     Chairperson.  So this is one of those areas that, like with the India trip you need to re-craft the passage.  Is that right?    Alright.     Absolutely.    Alright.      Alright.  Thank you.  Ms Gigaba, there is another heading then, Malusi Gigaba’s transfer from the Department of Home Affairs to the Department of Finance.  You remember that he moved from Home Affairs to the department of finance?    Remember that, and how did you come to learn about that?    And can you remember where you were at the time when he told you?   And were you at a function or something?    And what happened when, did he receive a telephone call?    After he received the call, what did he say to you?    Was he happy about that?      Why?    Sorry?    He is not the person the president wish to be the Minister of Finance?    Did he tell you who the president wanted to be the Minister of Finance?     Now after Mr Gigaba moved to the Department of Finance, did he continue to go to the Gupta residence?  You continued to go the Gupta residence?    After Mr Gigaba moved to the, became the Minister of Finance, did he carry on going to the Gupta residence?   So what we are dealing with here is Mr Gigaba transfers from the Department of Home Affairs to the Department of Finance.  He becomes the Minister of Finance.     When he was the Minister of Finance, did he carry on going to the Gupta residence?    So let us then deal with the next heading.  Gifts, cash and benefits received from the Guptas.  Now you have already told us about the gold necklace that he gave to your elder son, correct?      Let us deal with other gifts.  There isa heading that says the white three series BMW motor vehicle, the BMW.  Could you tell us about that?    Sorry?    Who is they?    And when you say they gave it to him, how do you know that?    Where about did you collect it?    Sahara computers?    And did you drive this car, this BMW?    Was it your private vehicle for a while?    And was it transferred into your name?    And then what happened to the car?    Thank you, and then what happened to this car?     Alright and then you deal with cash and benefits, there is …[intervenes]     Thank you.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Let us deal with wedding gifts of cash.  So we know that you married Mr Gigaba on the 30 August 2014.  Who did your weddingplanning and who did you invite to your wedding.  Did you invite the President?  Did you invite the Guptas.     I beg your pardon?     So where it says    Yes but is it wrong where it says we invited both the former President and the Guptas?     Okay.  Mr Molefe was invited and he did attend, is that correct?     Now did you get any wedding gift of any sort from the Guptas?     And what did he tell you about that?    And who paid for your honeymoon?     Who paid for your honeymoon?     Do you know how much money Mr Gigaba was given?     So the paragraph reads    But that paragraph, is it right?     Now how long did you go on honeymoon for?     And in what hotel did you stay?     The Waldorf?     In Dubai?     Now you go on to estimate how much your wedding cost.  How much was that?     And who paid the wedding expenses.     And how did you pay them?     And where did you receive this cashfrom?     Sorry?     Sorry, Ms Gigaba, I just received a request from some of the technical people, they haveasked again if you could just try and speak a little bit more clearly.  Apparently your voice is dipping in and out, I can imagine it makes transcription difficult.     So did you not find it strange that you have been given all this cash?  I mean, where did it come from as far as you were concerned?     Yes, I think perhaps we are speaking at cross-purposes, I am not suggesting that you found it strange that you could afford a wedding of this value, my question is more directed at why is everything being paid in cash?  As you say Mr Gigaba – the state paid a lot of his expenses, he had a good salary, he had a money market account but none of that explains why – just bear with me?  None of that explains why one would be going around with large bundles of cash.    Well, to the tune ultimately of R4 to R5 million.     It added up to that.     Can I perhaps ask you a question in another way?  I understand what you are saying but did you think in your mind that Mr Gigaba was going to, for example, First National Bank in Sandton City with his bodyguards and was drawing these bundles of cash to give you to pay for flowers?  Is that what you think was happening?     Thank you.  Let us then turn to     And you knew one of them, what was his name?     Point taken, DCJ, thank you.     Now let us have a look at paragraph 54 and perhaps you can explain to us what you saw happening in relation to the collection of cash at the Gupta residence.     What did you see happening about the collection of cash from the Gupta residence?     Okay.  Right, that is the heading.     Yes, tell us what you saw.     Yes.     Alright.     Okay.  Well, this is important so let us go through it.   “On several occasions that we attended the Gupta residence I personally observed Mr Gigaba leaving the adjacent meeting room.” Is that right?     So you were sitting there, as you have explained, he was having meetings in the private meeting room, is that right?     And what would happen after he left the meeting room?     Alright and would the bag then be brought?    Would it be given to Mr Gigaba?     By the CPO?     The close protection officer.     Right?  And what would Mr Gigaba then do with the bag once it was given to him?     And how many bags did Mr Gigabahave?     Now can I just ask you to have a look at these annexures, I think this is another thing that we might have identified in the consultations.  We are talking about leather bags here.     Now the annexures referred to paragraph 54 are A and B.  Is A and B the correct bag or is it C and D the correct bag?    So which bags – what are the correct photographs?  These bags that were brought to him at the Gupta residence that he would call for, are they the bags marked A and B or are they bags that looked like C and D?     Yes.     Yes.  I think what I am getting to, Ms Gigaba, if you go back to paragraph 54, do you confirm that instead of reading A and B it should actually read C and D?    Yes.     So let us just go back to paragraph 54.     So he would call his CPO to bring in a leather bag, kept in the boot of the vehicle, the bag would be brought to him, he would go into the private meeting room, he would come out with the bag, the bag would be placed in the boot.  Now what bag are we talking about there?   Are we talking about bags that look like A and B or are we looking at – talking about bags that look like C and D?     Sorry?     Yes.  So if you go back to 54, at the end, that A and B should change to C and D.  Is that what you say?     If you go to the end of paragraph 54.     Where it refers to annexures A and B should correctly read C and D.  It was the big bag.     Yes.     Ja.    Alright.     Yes.     Alright.  Did you come to learn of what was contained in these bags?     What did you come to learn was contained in them?    Alright.  So have a look at paragraph 55.1.  Did you and Mr Gigaba go to Sandton City together?     When did you do that?     Well, when you were at the Gupta residence were there times where you would go then toSandton City?     And what would happen when you went from the Guptas to Sandton City?  What would happen at Sandton City?     Yes, so what would happen at Sandton City, would he go shopping, would you go shopping?     What shop?     And what would he do there?     Please can you speak up, Ms Gigaba.    Please speak up.  Do you not want to lower the microphone a little bit?  Perhaps that will help.  Alright.  So you say he would go shopping at the HTK store?      He would go shopping at the HTK store?     Is that what you say?  Would he shop at other stores?     So if we go to paragraph 55.2, I think you have already told the Chairperson that Mr Gigaba would transfer money from one bag to the other bag, is that right?     Thank you.  So at 55.2 you say    Okay, so how many occasions?     So you saw him once transfer?     So this personal carry bag, is that picture A and B or C and D?  Have a look at the photos again?  We are almost finished.  So you are talking about the bag that he transferred money into.     Is it photographs A and B or C and D?    C and D?     Are you sure?     Oh, the smaller was A and B?     Alright.  Now did Mr Gigaba ever buy you anything in Sandton City?    Alright.  Now did Mr Gigaba ever buy you anything in Sandton City whilst shopping?     What he buy you?     Did he ever buy you anything else?     So at paragraph 55.3    55.3    How many times did you see Mr …[intervenes]     Thank you Chairperson.  At 55.3 after talking about the Louie Vittone handbag, you refer to the credit card that Mr Gigaba had given you, what was thelimit on that credit card?     What did he say you could use it up to how much?     Beyond 100 000,00?     And when you were shopping overseas?     How much money would he give you?    Thank you did Mr Gigaba want you to shop in Sandton City?     Why not?     Whenever.      I see, and then a paragraph 56 you say that about a week after the Gupta wedding held at Sun City during 2013.  Mr Gigaba now visited the Gupta residence and then you talk about what happened on yourreturn home.  Can you explain that please?     The paragraph, what happened once you returned home?     56.     Right, what you deal with at 56    And where had those bags come from?     And what did Mr Gigaba then do with those bags?     And did you then go into the study?    But on this particular day, did you enter the study?     And what did you see?     Packing money into what?     What was your reaction when you saw that?      Why?     And what did he tell you as to wherehe got the money from?     And did he tell you what it was for?     Yes and what was his response?     It was for the ANC elections?     Alright and then Ms Zizipho Gigabapayment of her bad debt and employment at Sahara Computers.  Now you speak about the fact that during 2013 Mr Gigaba’s father called us to a meeting at their family home.  Is that correct?     And what happened there?     And what did Mr Gigaba tell you, as to what had been discussed?     So had she been blacklisted?     And you say that Mr Gigaba’s father asked him to help her?     And do you know; what debts it is that she had?     And what did Mr Gigaba – did Mr Gigaba agree to help her?     Yes, sorry.      And what did he say in response?     Okay, so, he said he would ask Ajay?     Did he ever then tell you whether or not Ajay had agreed?    Did he tell you whether Ajay had agreed to give the money?     And was any arrangement made as to who would collect the money?     And what was that arrangement?     So Mr Mahlangu was to collect the money from Ajay and assist in clearing her name?     Now, Mzipho Gigaba you have already told the Chairperson that for a time she worked at Sahara Computers.     Alright and then we deal with cash for renovations to Mr Gigaba’s on The Family Plot.  Sowhereabouts is this in Kwazulu Natal?     Mandeni, and what happened?      Paragraph 60.     And can you remember when this happened? What position did Mr Gigaba hold whilst these renovations were undertaken?     And who did the building work?     And who paid for this?     Sorry?     Okay, and where did Mr Gigaba get the money from, did you come to learn of that?     So, paragraph 61 says    Were you ever present when Mr Gigaba paid the builder in cash?     Can you remember how many times?     Alright, now a paragraph 63 it says    Then we get to the next heading, wehave now only got two pages to go.  The Gupta money counter, can you explain to us about this Gupta money counter?     And what happened when you saw it?     And how did it work?     And how much money came out?     Alright, so 64 you say    “We were part of a small group of  people who were unknown to me, he showed us a room that had been converted into a small cinema and in another area I saw a sauna.”Is that right?     Paragraph 65, as you have already     Then we deal, you deal with the confiscation of my devices to destroy possible evidence.      You say    So 61 says    Then you say that    And what in what circumstances did he ask you for them, how did that happen?     And were there photographs of trips that he was also interested in?     Okay, photographs of what trips?     Okay and then paragraph 66.3, do you want to read that?     Paragraph 66.3 do you want to read that?     Okay, tell me if it is right or wrong, we have one page left, we will see whether you fall asleep before I fall down.     That is the last page, thank you, I think everyone is keeping it ...[indistinct].   Now Mr Gigaba also asked not to – sorry Mr Gigaba also asked me not tospeak to the Commission nor Law Enforcement Agencies about Gupta visits, the cash and the gifts, is that right?     Then you talk about a domestic incident that occurred, what happened there?     Okay, but we know that thatdomestic incident then gave rise to a high court judgment, which is referred to in the press and there is the citation given, is that correct?     It gave rise to a high court judgment in your favour.     Alright.   Do I understand correctly, I am terribly sorry but – do I understand that you do not wish to speak to this paragraph?      Alright.  And then the last thing deals with the loss of your personal passports, do you want to just deal with that quickly.   What happened to yourpassports?     So Chairperson we have no further questions for the witness.  I would like if I may – I know it is late, but to address you for the record on certain aspects of Ms Gigaba’s letter.   I don’t want to – I don’t want to become a witness in these proceedings and I don’t want to be seen to be cross-examining Ms Gigaba about these issues, obviously this is something that we as thelegal team take seriously and we are sympathetic to her plight, but there are some things that we need to correct.     So the first point which is overarching and important and something that Ms Gigaba has already accepted, is that throughout the production of her affidavit she was represented by a pre-eminent senior counsel, and that senior counsel was in fact responsible for procuring her signature of the final version of the affidavit.In paragraph 8 of Ms Gigaba’s letter, letter from her attorneys, she lists a number of concerns, as she is more than entitled to do.  Paragraph 8.1 and 8.2 relate to the change in evidence leaders, which you Chairperson have already addressed.  Then in paragraph 8.3 Ms Gigabarefers to the fact that the affidavit contained certain things that are not within her personal knowledge and that seems to be correct and a process has been put in place to resolve that.At paragraph 8.4 she mentions that during the consultation that I had with her on the 8 t h of April mention was made of why these errors had not been picked up before, and she is also correct when she says that I proposed that that could be clarified in a supplementary affidavit, so we went through this affidavit, we notedcertain errors, and remember we were preparing Ms Gigaba for evidence.  We hadn’t as the evidence leaders finalised this affidavit, procured the signature on it, that had been done by her senior counsel.  So after this meeting I made contact with her senior counsel and I simply said to him you may want to consider dealing with these issues.So it was a situation where we realised there were errors, and we put in place a mechanism to try and clarify    Alright well.    So just so that I make sure that what I am saying accords exactly with what I am instructed.  And if necessary Chairperson we can put up an affidavit to deal with this we do not want to get in a big debate.    About this issue because obviously we have an interest in ensuring the safety and security of Ms Gigaba insofar as we can.  But for example Mr Maseku instructs me that on the 20t h and the 21s t of January Ms Mngoma consulted with state capture for two days.  On both days Ms Mngoma was offered security if she feels that herlife is in danger.  Ms Mngoma indicated that she is not scared and will continue with her affidavit.Then on the 8t h of February Ms Mngoma alerted state capture commission on threatening calls she had received and shared screen shots of some of these.  Calls are from a no number caller.On the 8t h of February investigators alerted the state capture head of security about the above.  On the 28t h of February investigator returned Ms Magma’s call – Ms Mngoma indicated that she had received additionalthreatening calls with no name caller.  Ms Mngoma shared these with the investigators.On the 1s t of March investigator met with the state capture commission head of security and also shared screen shots of threatening calls.  Security options were discussed with the investigator which were later shared with Ms Mngoma.  She indicated that she was okay for now will advise once she has decided to take up the security option.On the 4t h of March Ms Mngoma called the investigator regarding additional threatening calls screen shot shares – screen shot shared.  March Ms Mngoma called the investigator she advised that she felt unsafe.  Investigator alerted her that state capture commission is awaiting her to advise when sheis ready to take up the security option.  She indicated that she will move and stay somewhere. March state capture commission consulted with Ms Mngoma and her legal advisors.  At the end of the consultation Ms Mngoma advised that she still needs to advise the state capture commission when she is ready to take up the security offer. She indicated that she will get back to the state capture commission.8 April state capture commission consulted with Ms Mngoma.  Ms Mngoma informed that she still needed toadvise state capture commission once she had decided to take up the security option.Now there may be different ways of viewing this but what you can see on these instructions is that investigations are undertaken.  A system was put in place that needed to be triggered so that is from what I am instructed.Then the next complaint is the client’s first affidavit was leaked to the media and the commission undertook to investigate the source of the leak and revert to her.  That investigation is at a – I am told a very advanced stage.  Not quite as simple as it might appear but action is being taken.Then the next concern and I am not saying they are unfounded or without merit but on each of these things you will see that there has been an attempt – there has been interaction – there has been work done by the commission.8.7 the complaint is our client also highlighted to the commission her discomfort about the commission sharing of her affidavit with Ajay Gupta without informing her or her legal team.Now I am told that that is wrong.  That there was in fact a discussion and Ms September will correct me if I have got this wrong because I am told this evening – there was in fact a discussion between Ms Nkobe and Mr Pretorius about the fact that her 3.3 had to be issued in relation to Ajay Gupta because he was so central – is so central to thisaffidavit and the 3.3 was then issued in that context.So it was done in consultation with her legal team.      It is that stick that has got to handed around.      And then at 8.8 the commission has wrongly suggested that our client volunteered to come to the commission when the correct version is that she was approached.  We accept entirely that – that she wasapproached by Sikele Maseku after ENCA intervened.So Chairperson that is – that is the position from our side.  It is not something that we want to enter into any sort of acrimonious discussion or debate but obviously we accept that Ms Mngoma and her counsel may very well have a different view that we must respect and then we must find out a way to get to the bottom of things with your – with your direction and advice.    Chairperson - I am sorry Chair.  I just have – I – I would like to correct something that I said as soon as I can?   I having listened to Mr Gigaba about Ajay Gupta receiving the affidavit I asked Ms September whether I was right in relation to what I had told you that there was a discussion between Mr Ngotome and Mr [Indistinct] about the affidavit being sent to Ajay Gupta.He tells me there was no discussion what I said to you was there was a discussion about the timing of the issuing of the 3.3’s it was not a discussion particularly around Ajay Gupta so Ms Gigaba may very well be right.  She tells me of course that who is implicated and to whom 3.3’s must issues clearly as a matter of law.  So there was not a – there was not a discussion expressly around (not speaking into mic).    Yes. 
MR GAMA:  Good morning DCJ.    Siyabonga Innocent Gama.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Thank you Chair.   Almost.  Yes I have got it.    Yes.    I confirm that.    Yes I do.    Yes I do.    That is fine Chair.    Thank you very much.  Thank you very much Chairperson.As you know I had started with my opening statement on the 11 t h of March.  It should not be construed that I have been reading it since then because then itmight become the longest opening statement.  I do not want to be in (talking over one another).    No thank you very much.  I think when we dealt with it I had indicated that there were various testimonies which were provided by witnesses who have sought to implicate me and to highlight some of the more glaring discrepancies, inconsistencies and improbabilities and falsities I then continue with my statement at page 6 of the statement under heading number 8.I start with the statement of Popo Molefe and his – his testimony.From Popo Molefe’s testimony the commission has learnt how my appointment at Transnet allegedly occurred.According to Molefe my appointment ostensibly occurred due to the influence of Gigaba.  This allegation I believe has been purposed to fit the state capture narrative.I would like to explain again that as indicated in my affidavit deposed to concerning my history at Transnet I have worked through the ranks and was ultimately appointed as CEO through hard work and dedication and not through the influence and hand of Gigaba as Mr Popo Molefe would have you to believe.Mr Gigaba was appointed as the Minister of Public Enterprises in 2010.  At that time I had already worked at Transnet for more than sixteen years.The Minister is only ever involved in board appointments and so it is hard to understand how Popo Molefe could reach the conclusion that Mr Gigaba had a hand in my appointment as a CEO at a division of Transnet which is below board level.It must therefore be recorded that this is false.Popo Molefe admitted in his oral testimony under oath that the contents of what he had stated was not within his own personal knowledge.  I am dealing there with the Transcript of his testimony to the state capture commission of the 7 t h of May 2019 at page 6.So his own viva voce testimony when he firstappeared at this commission when he was being led by Advocate Paul Pretorius he however went to great lengths Chair to claim that I was one of three architects of state capture at Transnet.He never defined or explained what an architect of state capture is or even worse the facts on which he relied for such a startling and I must say false allegation.The allegation that I am one of three architects of state capture has never been even remotely substantiated by credible evidence.On the topics of Regiments, Trillian and Nkonke I have been accused of colluding with the aforementioned entities.  The truth of the matter is that each of these entities contracts were terminated by me during my tenure at Transnet. Such terminations were based on objective evidence placed before me at that time that inter alia Transnet’s continued relationship with them would bring the reputation of the SOE into disrepute.Popo Molefe failed to make mention that the contracts with Regiments and Trillian were terminated by me with the concurrence of the board in October of 2016.This was approximately nine months before the emergence of the now and famous June 2017 Gupta email trolls that captivated the country for many months.Terminating contracts is hardly the conduct of a person who is colluding with those said parties.  Popo Molefe as non-executive Chairman of Transnet was at pains to point out to the media during October 2018 that Transnet had terminated my contract due to acts of alleged fraud, corruption and misconduct on my part.In the pleadings with reference to the arbitration that I am having with Transnet Popo Molefe denies that Transnet terminated my employment due to misconduct.The aforementioned arbitration proceedings havenot been commenced. Such a turnaround points to  a. The personal vendetta or incompetence on the part of the board and Popo Molefe or they are dishonest. Following my dismissal and in a bid to gather evidence that he ought to have collected before dismissing me Popo Molefe hired a retired bishop and offered amnesty to managers at Transnet if they came forward and indicted that I had asked them to perpetrate a fraud or corruption against the company.    That is correct.     Yes.     Ja.  Chairperson, all I am requesting isaccommodation on this matter and if you accommodate me, as you are suggesting, there is not even a need for me to address aspects of what I believe could be constitutional rights, you know, being infringed with.  So if I could then just deal with the issue of the Legal Team only.     So, all of us have to be accommodated.     ...accommodation that I am not getting from the Commission.  That is a problem.     Good morning, Mr Myburgh.     [No audible reply]      No.     No.  Sorry.  Am I too far from the mic?     Okay.     No.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     I do not know the date but it was the 24 t h of January.     Okay.  Oh, yes.     Ja, yes, ja.  It must be Sunday.     Yes.     It came about because I was stopping over in Dubai.  I think he must have called me.  I cannot remember whether he knew or that I was stopping over in Dubai but he must have called me because I intended to stop over in     Ja.     Sorry?     Yes.    I think in the course of my discussion, I had     No, I never stayed there before.     No, I had never.  I only went there once.     Yes.  I think from what he was indicating and I think that is where it truly and eventually came from, as I understood it later, was that he wanted to create a majority black owned management consultancy because most of the consulting houses that we have are largely international houses that are not owned by South African entities and his desire was that South Africa wanted to create amajority black owned management consultancy of which he thought that if he were able to collect people from different consultancies who were black they would then create that kind of capacity to take on large consultancy assignments in the South African corporate space.     I suspect that the – what do you call it – the evolution from Regiments to Trillian, I think I must have heard at some point that he may have been behind that Trillian as an owner but I do not really have any facts toadduce in terms of that.     He did not have a name.  Remember, he was from Regiments.  So, and he was talking about this evolution that he wanted to created this large black owned management consultancy.     No, no not by name.  Not by name.     No, I did not know.     At some point, I think towards the end of16.  Somebody, I think, in our Risk Department said to     She had heard it through certain people.     I think it was around 2016.  It was really around the time that we were now considering terminatingthe contract between Regiments and Trillian.  It must have been around September/October 2016.     September ...[intervenes]      October 2016, thereabouts.  There was that suspicion from some of our Risk people.     Ja, the object of the meeting is the latterwhere he was saying incorporates such as Transnet.  Would they be looking at majority black owned, black owned management consultancy with expertise, which would then alleviate the need to use multi-national or international entities that were probably domiciled in South Africa but registered elsewhere.       Well, he had undertaken to share with me his vision at a later date in terms of what is it that would transpire.  So he did not – I think it was a concept.  It wasconceptual at the time when we were discussing it.  He was sounding me out whether we would be, you know, we would as Transnet look at such a consultancy going forward.  So I had said to him when he has shaped his thoughts and his thinking around it he could come back to me.   But I also, I think, mentioned at the time that I did not really like having consultants as a general rule.  In fact, by the time I had left Transnet I had established an internal consulting capability which I believe still exist to this day because it was precisely for the reason that we had relied too much on and paid too much money to consultants, external consultants. I wanted us to really just bring in consultants for the – for short periods for capabilities and information that we did not have of which was specialised.      Yes, I think so.  Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     No, no, no.  There was no mention.  The predominant entity that had done some work at Transnet in that year or the years before was Regiments.      Yes.     [laughs] No, no Chair.  There is no convenience or anything to do with Saxonwold in relation to this meeting.  I met Mr Essa at Singh’s office and I asked him to give – I asked Sing to give Essa my number so that he could call me because he said that he wanted to have a meeting with me.  So that was the long and short of it.  So you never gave Mr Essa your number, he got it from Mr Singh, correct?  Ja.  And he subsequently called you, correct?  Mr Myburgh?     As I have said, I do not know the exact dates that is why I said either July/August.  So if he says it could not have been August, that is fine, and if he had already gone to Eskom at that time then it means it was July.     Ja.     Yes, no, I cannot be mistaken.     No, Chair, why would I?  No.     No, I do not see what kind of convenience would that be.     I did not go to that meeting because of Mr Singh it was because Mr Essa called me.     It has got nothing to do with Mr Singh.     Yes.     That is correct.     Over the…?     Yes.     Yes.    Ja, the difficulty I think that I have is that my bank could only go back 10 years, that is really the only difficulty that I have but I am aware that I paid it.  In fact I sold shares in order for me to be able to pay.  The difficulty is that the bank has indicated that they can only go back 10 years so it falls outside, I think it is on year 11 or 12 now.     You want to me to respond on – I think develop it, I am listening.       You mean from my personal account?     No, I think at that time I have not paid it.     Now I recall that that was the response that I have just placed on record.     Ja.  Maybe, Chair, just – is it really just a principle issue, the principle was that I would be paid 75% of the tax bill of [indistinct – dropping voice].  There wasno discussion or a clause in the actually settlement agreement that talked about okay, the fact that it must be reimbursed, you just had to present the bill and show what the bill was so whether I had already paid for it or not, the issue was that that was the agreement and that I should be paid that 75%.  So, I mean, the issue about the fact that some of it was reimbursement – remember, when you have a legal case you are paying all the time.  By the time we had the settlement I had paid close to 5 million of legal costs.  So I had been paying, it was not as if – I think the only one that I have not paid was the Bowmans.     Yes.     I have shared those documents with the Commission.    19?     No, I think it reads as it reads.  I think, as I have said, it was 75% of the legal costs at the High Court as well as the labour dispute.     Bundle 22?     Highlight as in emphasise?     No, I think in the interest of time...     No.     No.     No.     Yes.     No.     No.     250 point?    262.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Almost.       Yes I am.     I confirm number 2, not number 1.     That is correct.     Yes, I can comment on that.     That is correct.    I think we now use the black numbers?     So if we turn to …[intervenes]     Yes.  So that page, Chair, 260.265 (sic).     I record …[intervenes]     That is correct.     So if you look at 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.     That is correct, Chair.    It is just a bit far(?)     Ja.  It is closer, ja.     I wanted to refer Mr Myburgh in as far as the issue of the period of employment where he indicates that he was self-employed for the period of January 2018 to December 2019.     That my information is that he was employed at the firm that is recorded there in 9.2.     For the period 21 August 2018 to 31 Januarywhich I believe is a material and inexplicable omission in terms of what he indicates to you in point 3.     From the firm itself.  I was aware of it and Iconfirmed it.      No, I have no personal knowledge.     Yes in terms of the job description.     Okay, thank you, Chair.     No, nothing to add, I agree with that statement.     Yes, that is correct but maybe incomplete.     Yes also there would have been occasionswhere both of them would be in convoy but not necessarily in the same car.  If they needed to do some kind of reconnaissance for whatever reason, one would go ahead or be in convoy.     It is a CPO for who, Mr Myburgh?     I am just thinking in the record you did not – it should be Thamsanqa.     Ja.    Ja, I note it.     No, he was not responsible – he is not a mechanic, so I do not know when he says he looked after the maintenance of private vehicles.     No.    No, I never got to watch them and so on.  Ja, from time to time the vehicles were dirty then they would be taken to a car wash.     It could be or not be a picture of the car, I do not know, it is a side picture, so I …[intervenes]     I am saying it could be or not be.     Black.     Black.     Yes.    Ja, similar.     I agree.     No, nothing to add.     Nothing to add.     No, I think he is talking about cars that hemay have seen over the years.     Whether I owned them or not, I think ...[intervenes]      Ja, no, he has made that allegation on all the vehicles but it is not true.      He would see my daughter ’s car and then he says it is my car.     Like the X5 is my daughter ’s car.     The BMW X5 is my daughter ’s car.     No, it was hers.      I just sometimes used it because you could – it is a diesel you can go to Durban and then come back onit, on what it gives you.     I would not have to fill too much petrol.     The Lexus four by four, I did not own, the Land Cruiser I did not own, the Mini Cooper was also my daughters.     Sorry, the Mini Cooper?     I am saying it was my daughter's car.     No, no I have said to you the Lexus four by four I did not own, that is 952.     And also the Land Cruiser I did not own and the Mini Cooper I did not own.    It is on 952, it says an old Land Cruiser.     I am saying I did not own the cars.      I never owned them at the time when they were there.  A lot of these cars sometimes he would rightly point out they were there and then they were replaced by other cars but it is not like I have that fleet of cars maybe in - I do not have.      Ja, I think it is correct.     Ja, no none of that happened it is a fiction.     He may have.     Yes.      What he could say that is that on arrival at the residence, I went into the house and then I came outinstead of saying I would – as if it was a regular thing.     No, I cannot comment on that, I know nothing about that.     No, I know nothing about that, sir I deny any reference to any shady stuff but I do not know what he discussed with Jiyane but he says he discussed it with him, whether it happened or not I do not know.     Okay, I will get closer to the mic, Chair.    No, I have no knowledge.     Whether he drives an Audi S8, no I thought it was an A8, I am not sure I think he used to have a silver A8, I am not aware of S8, I think an S8 is a different make of car.     No, I am not aware.     Ja, I see.     Yes, I can comment it never happened, as I have testified to the Commission I did not know any people who stayed in the residence so I do not think they would have given me anything.  I have never seen the suitcase, as I have said to you I was there for about 10 to 15 minutes and went in with Mr Essa came out with him.  there was no such – this is fiction.       It was 2015.     I think according to his – there was something in the earlier paragraphs.     I suspect it would have been between 2013 and 2017.     Yes, I think he probably did.     It never happened.     It never happened.     It never happened Chair.      Yes, I have on occasion many occasions visited that hotel, Maslow.    No, it did not happen.     No.     No, I do not know that.     I can take a picture of DCJ is covered fairlyoften in the newspaper, it will have his picture and his name and I can say this is the person that is known as Justice Zondo.  I do not know what to make of it.     Yes, I know that as Salim Essa.     May I request that we take all of it.     That is correct, Chair.     Thank you.  So I will deal if 13 t h of June ne”.    So on this particular day that he refers to and it is even certain times and the Google Maps. I have attached for your reference what actually transpired on that day.  You will see that I was at a meeting in Pretoria and if you reference to my affidavit and I think I have attached minutes also of that meeting.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     So or if you can just finish it.     Those are the minutes I referred to Chair.    Good afternoon Mr Myburgh.    That is correct.    That is correct.    The other file?    Yes I was.    Probably around 18   Ja what I am basically indicating is that he makes assumptions that I may have been with him during all of these time periods but for me it is quite clear from the minutes of that meeting that – and I think that is also the problem that we have with not having the – the full diarywhich is one of the biggest problems Chair that we have been facing because as I have indicated I would like to have cross-examined Witness 2 and it would have been much clearer.  So I am – we are navigating almost at half …    Yes, yes.    Yes well the – I think it would be – it would have been much clearer so I tried to use the information at hand to indicate that I would not have been with him when he left one hour forty minutes after the meeting.  The meeting ended – I do not stick around when the meeting has ended I leave.  So if he had been there it is possible that he was in a different car and he was not with me.    No I do not remember.    I do not remember.  That is why I am saying he is showing something from his cell phone that he was there at a particular time.He may have been in the reconnaissance car arriving there very early and then leaving later but it does not mean that he was with me. Ja.    I may have been the minutes that I have indicated to you they indicate that there was a special    Because…    Because there would have been nothing for me to stay there for.    It may either be a fraud or he may have gone to those places but he was not with me.    Well you see – you say in all records?    Oh in the ordinary course?    Sorry.  Okay.  Ja he – he could have but fromwhat I can gather in terms of this navigation schedule it is just entirely impossible that at the end of the meeting I would stuck around on those premises – that is – that is not even our offices so these are not our offices so I could not you know have stayed there for an hour and forty minutes after we finished the meeting.    Yes sometimes – sometimes it would be my car – I am always in my car.    And then there could be…    Yes.      With one protector in my car.    Driving and then the other one being …    The one who is on the lookout yes.    We would always – Chair they would…   They would almost always be in front.    Almost always be in front or in convoy.    They would not…    When I have left there is no reason to be staying behind.    So I do not understand if he is claiming that he was with me or why at the meeting he stayed behind.  I doubt it that – it may be a day when he was off and maybe just decided that he was going to travel there because he – he knew that we were working there and then continued withwhatever else he was doing there.    Ja for a period yes.    Hm.    Yes.    I do not think he drove my car Chair.  This is what I am saying.    This is what I am saying that I do not think…     Ja, yes I do not think he drove my car or this is not in sync with reality.    That is correct.    So if there was a minute apart.    That is the normal.    Discrepancy I would not have a problem with it.    But an hour and forty minutes is just too much.    Yes.    Ja.   Yes it is supposed to be connected with workand Chair the whole concept of close protection…    Is that you would be very close to the principle.    And you do not wonder away.    And do other things.    And – so that is why I was saying.    Even if he was in his own car if it was made within a minute.    Or two I would then say look we were together.    But I do not know from this and I can say without fear of any contradiction Chair that he was not in the same car as me.    Hm and also if he is off Chair he may have gone to – to whatever was being done there.    But then stayed behind.    Because he was doing something else.    He would not be required.    To – to follow me what I left for home.    Ja.    Yes.  No it would not have happened Chair.  Letus say one was there from midday.    As an example.    By the time it is 18   There is no reason to – if it was you know my offices I would then say okay maybe I went back to the office.   And did some work maybe I had some files.    But this situation does not arise.    My one?    In fact if – if they say the meeting started 17   Because maybe it was 17   Where –    That is correct.    I do not know.      114.      No it is highly doubtful ja.    It is highly doubtful Chair.    Yes sometimes if they were driving – even when I am not there sometimes they would even be at my home waiting for me.  Let us say I just an example.  If I go to Cape Town and I am coming back on the same day they will drop me at the airport and then they will go to the office for a fewhours and sometimes they will go and wash the car and then go to my home and then an hour before the flight arrives then they will come through.  Sometimes he will go to his home and come back just before the – so there was a lot of carte blanche in terms of what people could do.  If somebody said okay maybe I needed to go and wait somewhere they would go and wait.  I would not know.  The biggest problem with this thing is that there are inconsistencies.  He talks for a – and I think the main thing he says no there was some money that was exchanged. There was money that got given to him.  But none of these things happened it is a fiction.    Sorry.    I am saying it is highly doubtful. It is highly doubtful because it does not look like he was actually working with me on that particular day and there is nobody who comes on the night shift.  You work the whole day and then – and then you finish.  Because if he was working why did he stay behind in Pretoria when I left?   Yes.    Because sometimes if – if a person is not working they will still go if the other one says look the – there are going to be a lot people that we do not know there and maybe during this time you could be there and then after    Yes.    No.   Well I mean – one of the things that I have indicated that he – he has not testified to which arose for instance is that he was seen at some point trespassing outside of that particular property. So the – the address could show that the person is there but he is not inside he is just on the verge.  He was caught in the cameras trespassing in that particular area at a point so you never know you knowwhat – what was his motive in some of these things.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.   I have indicated that this is his google map I do not have my own so this is the – this is the problem.  If I had the diary I would be able to say there are certain things in there that are just inconsistent and I do not understand – it is his Google Maps that is where he says he was it does notmean that is where I was.    Yes.    No it is a diary that remained at Transnet an electronic diary which would have been quite useful    Because it will tell you the day starts on such and such a time these are the meetings and this is what has happened.  You will see Chair that they have tried to givesome kind of reproduction which is SG4 but those things are nothing more than ..    Ja on the same bundle.    250.297.    297.    That is correct.     So if – if you look at that it is very difficult to see I probably cannot see.    The end of my options of seeing.    But in there it would show a person’s name like a meeting request – somebody who requested a meeting.  The people to whom that meeting requests was sent to and then it will have the heading in terms of what was that particular meeting.  And that is what assisted in some part to say there was a meeting in Pretoria – there was a board meeting in Pretoria and then therefore one was able to call for the minutes and – of that particular meeting. But I cannot say for instance that using that I cannot say was I there from   His affidavit the pictures there at – is it 114 that we were referring to?    So if we can go there Chair.      It says that before – if you look right at the beginning it says he was driving for three hours forty threeminutes in the morning.  So I do not know where if you going to Pretoria from Johannesburg you drive for three hours forty three minutes it does not say where that trip started.  It is one of those anomalies where I am saying if you look at this thing I do not know whether there is any reliance that you can place on this particular thing page 114 and 115.    It – I think if you – I do not know whether but it is miles – it is probably miles and says forty four miles – if it is miles for three hours forty three minutes and then parked    Or maybe around – let us say six o’clock and for three hours forty three minutes almost four hours you drivingfrom Midrand to Pretoria.  It does not – it does not make sense.  And it is all of those things Chair which makes one highly suspicious about whether you can place any kind of reliance on this.     Sorry, where do you see 17    Yes.     Oh, okay.  Ja, there is something that says     Ja ...[intervenes]      ...eight as well there.  I do not – ja.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     [No audible reply]      250 point...?     267.  Thank you.  Ja.  Once again, as I indicated Chair, I deny this version that he was with me and I have attached minutes of a whole-day meeting that I had attended at SG-3 at 250.278.  The minutes will show,     ...250.294. [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     When the meeting ended.     That is correct.     And then, Chair, if you then go back to 250.297 which is the page at the back.       [laughs] Yes.     It is always better on the computer.  You can...[intervenes]      You can make it a little bit bigger.     [Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear]  I am trying to use – glass(?) here.  The – on the computer it will indicate ...[intervenes]      [laughs]    What is in what.     ...explain ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So what is in here, Chair, is an indication that    Yes, at four o’clock.     It started at 16    So even if he had then said no he was with me to go to this Melrose Arch, if the meeting finished at     Ja.  I think that could happen.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct and I stayed until the end of the meeting.      Because I was there.     H’m.  Ja, there is no way where it says like that.  If I had left the meeting, I had intended to – it was a day when I had intended to be with them the whole day.  There was something that took my time early in the morning.  I think I only – I joined them an hour later than I ...[intervenes]      ...than I had intended to and I had stayed withthem the whole day which is why you will see in the – in the diaries the meeting between me and the chairperson was initially scheduled to start at two o’clock to four o’clock and then it was moved to four o’clock to six o’clock.       So that I could be with them.  So if I had left, the people would have recorded that I left before the end of the night.       Yes, that was for lunch.     [No audible reply]      I think my input – there are various names of people in terms of they needed to do what.     Yes?     At page?     Yes?     Yes, I can read that.  Yes.    So when I arrived, they gave me an opportunity to speak and I addressed them on a few things and I think I was giving them feedback on certain pertinent matters.  And then after that, we sat and they went through some of their normal issues.  And we sat through that afternoon with them.  Because I had set aside the whole day to be with them.     Well, I [laughs] I do not know whether I needed to say anything except that – all I am saying is that I was at the meeting and I can relate to everything that is in the minutes because it was discussed in my presence.       I do not know.  I can tell you that he did but I do not know.  I do not even know where 25 Cleveland Road is.       No, I do not.    No, that is fiction.  It is really fiction.  It is a lot of it that we are trying to deal with here.  I never accused him of stealing any money.  There is no money that he would have stolen.     I think he is just putting flavour, you know.  You put some Rajah and some Masala in so that your storylooks much more colourful and believable.       Chair, if ...[intervenes]      If I had occasion to accused him, he would not work for me the following day.       Because I just would not work with that kind of person if I thought that there was something that had happened.     So, and I do not know who is this manager ofhis or supervisor that he says I said that he ...[intervenes]      ...those are the people who would then – but there are many close protection officers.  If you have got one that steals, you ask the Security Department to change that.       And give you another one.       H’m.     Not off hand, Chair.     117.     Ja, he could have but I do not know this other address?     I am saying he could have but I do not know this other address that he says he took me too.  I have not been there.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, I am saying I could not have been there.     It says it is African Pride, Melrose Arch.     According to this.     I am saying I could not have been there and also be with the chairperson of the board at the same time at the Carlton.  These are the times that ...[intervenes]      ...that he was there.  So it is quite possible that on his off days he went to a number of places and then he then brings this in here and he says this is when he was with me.     He could not have been with me when I was with the chairperson of the board.     Because it is on the diary.     It reflects an appointment.  It even shows when it was moved from one time to the next time.  You donot have – when you have meetings with the chairperson of the board, you have meetings with the chairperson of the board.  They do not change.  If that meeting had changed for any reason as it showed that it moved from two o’clock to four o’clock, it would then go and show that it changed but it never changed.  It remained there.       I cannot think for him.  I do not know.       No.     Ja.  I think if anybody had found money in a     No, there was not.     Never ever. ADV MYBURGH     I do not know.     I think he would know where I stayed, yes.     Yes.     I not sure if I have asked him.  I do not remember asking him to check and the condition.  I do not think [laughs] it was necessary for him to check any condition.  Why would he travel when I am not there to go and check on the condition of the car when my children can start a car and switch if off it needed to be?    They normally take leave.     Then they would probably be assigned to someone else to work during that time.     121...       Ja.  My comment is as follows.  The – there could have been that meeting but if it was a meeting of state-owned enterprises, Chief Executives with the Minister and it was also normally between – with the Minister and the chairpersons of those SOE’s.  The presence of Jiyane is odd because Jiyane is not – or was not an SOE, Chief Executive.  He worked at Transnet but he was not the Headof Transnet.  So that on its own, I think for him it gives some kind of a flavour but he would not have been invited to those meetings.  So I do not know if there was such a meeting, why he thinks that Jiyane would have been present.  Again, R 200,00 notes, R 100 000,00.  It is like the earlier version.  He would always find R 200,00  notes and it is approximately R 100 000,00.  And he says he has estimated.  He had all the time.  He could have counted it instead of estimating and then he can tell you it was so much.  And if there was such     Yes.     Mr Collin, ja.     It is to clear.    I have a scenario here Chair, where somebody resigns from an entity, Transnet and he leaves inNovember of 2017.  So he writes a letter to his manager and he says I resign because I do not want to face a disciplinary hearing that I should be facing. He leaves, okay.  I do not know if he told you that he ran away from a disciplinary hearing from his manager, but anyway he leaves in November 2017.  He then comes back, he says no I resigned, no I was dismissed.  You do not hear, you do not understand.     I would not know the present for sure, but the City Press reports that he met with the non-executive Chairof Transnet, why is a close protection officer meeting with the non-executive Chair of Transnet, and then in there, it then says the non-executive Chair then refers him to Mr Mohammed Mohamedi to say no, he must reinstate this man. You reinstate somebody who appeals a dismissal.  If there was an appeal it would have happened within the 60 days after the dismissal.  So if he was dismissed as he claims, because he resigned anyway after I have mentioned that he, if he was dismissed it means that byJanuary 2018 he would have filed an appeal. Then we must discover that, that appeal and then when that appeal, then there must be a process, the bargaining council or where ever that it goes to and then it reinstates him.  This one, meets the non-executive Chair of Transnet as referred to the acting GCE of Transnet. From there it goes to the general manager that is dealing with labour issues and then he is re-employed which is, which are his words and then when he is re-employed, it is as if okay, we have these particular issues.  If you can give me a believable story around the person of Mr Gama, then maybe we can hire you. Then he proceeds to write a lot of this fiction that we see here today.     That is correct.    Yes, I am saying that is a possibility.     Because what I do not understand when I read the newspaper and I see what is happening and these people have confirmed it according to the newspaper tosay this is what has happened.  Mohammed says this fellow was referred to me by the Chairperson of the board, and then I was asked to deal with this man. I am then saying was he reinstated as an inducement?  There was something in there, in the newspaper that says he has been reinstated because that was long before these statements were made to the commission. It says he has been reinstated because he has been asked to say that Gama has been bribing policemen, money laundering and something very close to that then happens.  So it is not, I am not painting a story that did not happen. Some of the things that were said there, were predicted in that article and then they happened.    Sorry?    How does one explain the detail?  Well, here there is a motive.  There is an intent and person has got time.  I mean people who write movies, like Steven Spielberg, they sit and they conceive these things.  It does not mean that everything that we see in the movies everhappened or is the truth. So somebody will have those kinds of things where they sit and they say okay, this is what we could say.  They try to do a story that is believable.  For instance, witness 2 says to the Chairperson that I gave R50 000-00 but I never said anything. I never said what is the repayment period.  He says he assumed that that is his money, that he can take it.  It is all fiction Chair.  Who gives you money and never says anything?      Ja, but who gives money, does not say and hemakes the assumption okay no, this is my money.  As you say money is no problem.  Let me take it.  If indeed such has happened and then I said one day okay, can I have my money back.  What was he going to do. If he is somebody who is used to being given money to do things.     Money was not a problem.    So you get given money, you ask no questions.      You take the money.     And you go to [indistinct]    Cash?    Oh, okay.    Sorry, you say there was an ATM machine?    Okay.     That is correct.     Well Chair, the statements that witness 2 wrote would indicate those issues.  That there were issues yes.    Yes, that is correct Chair, but it was not about money.     No.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes Chair.    Let me just move a little bit Chair.     Yes, there are.    Yes.    Ja, it is just ...[intervenes]    Yes.  Chair, I think witness 2 is aggrieved.  He is aggrieved because he believes that if it was not because of me he would not have resigned.  He claims that I made life unbearable for him and that caused him to resign from the company.But what we are dealing with here Chair, is somebody who committed acts of dishonesty.  You are dealing with someone, if it was in the army, someone whocould have been court marshalled, because if somebody is assigned to protect their principle, and goes and does something which is counter to that, it is like when you do not follow the code. When your principle is threatened, you should be the first person who goes to your principle and say there is a threat and this is what we are going to deal with.  This is a person Chair, who when the threat came through did not go to the principle to say there is a threat. It was when I subsequently discovered throughcamera footage that certain things had happened.  I then asked his manager.  I said look, this is what has happened and I see this fellow doing one, two, three.  Can you find out?  It was only after that, that he then came out and he said to the, to his manager yes, it did happen.  It happened like this and like this and like this, but in that statement that he wrote, he still lied about it.  He still made it as if he volunteered the information when he did not. But also I would not have seen it if he actually had not committed.  If there was no commission of that act, but he committed that act which is why I was able to then ask his manager and then it was on that basis that his manager had then said look, your integrity is questionable. It would appear that you did not take the steps thatyou ought to have taken to protect the principle and then he moved him from me pending an investigation and then subsequent to that, you will see it comes through in his statement. He then had this grudge that he claims that his life was made miserable.  Because of what he had done and therefore he had to leave and I think in his own words he then says this was the culmination of somebody that I had worked for, very well for many years, but after that after that incident Chair, then the dishonesty, the lack ofintegrity was then covered and the falsities, the lies that he then made to cover that event, because he had been given the opportunity to come clean. All that he was supposed to have done was supposed to be able to come clean and say this is what happened, but still even in that statement, he tried to mislead and misrepresent what had actually happened and as a result of that, I then felt that look, I cannot have this person. So whatever it is that his manager then did was an enquiry that tried to deal with that issue because he was saying as a protection officer your first duty is to protect your principle, but in terms of what you did, you actually conspired with other people against your principle. So this is the kind of person that we are dealingwith and therefore yes, he holds a grudge that he was going to be disciplined and he decided to resign although he claims also that he was dismissed.  His story, but what I do know is that I was told that he resigned and left and that was prior to whatever disciplinary hearing that he was supposed to have had. Therefore, as a result of that, when I even talk about the inducement, is to then say we can reinstate you but we want you to tell these kinds of tails, ja.     Yes.     Ja, first and foremost I mean there was nosuch box that I met with Giyane about, and if he says there was a box and it contained money and then he says it was very heavy, I do not know what is heavy between bottles and pieces of paper which is money. If he says it was very heavy, I do not think that bottles with wine in them would be lighted but there was no such thing that happened.  What happened in Buli College, Giyane used to work in Pretoria.  There was a re-organisation at Transnet. I was able to meet each and every one of the executives face to face and there was a letter that I needed to hand over to him and he had asked that after hours, because he was not available, that if I could give him the letter, he will come and meet me on my way home, and that is what happened.I actually gave him that letter.  So and there was not a box that Giyane gave me.  There was a letter, an official letter that I gave to Giyane at Buli College in 2016.  I think it would have been around May of 2016 when this re-organisation took place.     Sorry?    Yes, I was going home.    I do not know.  I do not know the kind of car.  I need to pay attention to these kind of things.     No, I think Mr Myburgh you may be getting it wrong.  People will say you have an impressive array of cars.  They are old cars, they are 12, 13, 14 years old.  So when I have a car, I do not sell car.  I will have my instalment sale agreement for five years.  Then unless I need to buy another car I keep the car.  I even have a 30 year old car that I have been driving.  It is not, it is not a flashy life style or anything ofthat nature, but a GL to me is like an ML, and I have not seen Giyane drive a GL, but maybe he does have. I do not know.  I thought I have seen him drive a car, maybe a C something.  So, a GL, I think a GL is like an ML.  It is these big cars.  I do not know.  I do not think there is such a thing.      The car that he was driving, but maybe he was, but I have seen him drive a Mercedes, but a privatecar, a sedan.  Four, five seater.     No, he did not.  He did not go to my residence.   ADV MYBURGH    To collect such a car.  It is not true.  ADV MYBURGH    No.     Well, the first thing is they do not give you a new car.  A demo car is a demo, it is not new.  But he did not fetch it from home.  I asked him to pick it up in Woodmead.  So it is not true.     Yes, I wanted to test drive it.     No.    Here in Woodmead.    Where he says he proceeded to Woodmead is where he picked the car.     I think it is easier if you just ...[intervenes]     Went through all of it, so that we do not ...[intervenes]    Because it is, it can be tiring and the water isgetting finished.     No, no I still have.      Thank you.  So this is a very simple thing where I needed to test drive this vehicle and I was going to KZN, so we met there.  So again, real events but with flavour.  I do not recall Jiyane there.  I do not recall – I donot know about this Jiyane’s driver, I am going to have to maybe try and – maybe they should give an affidavit in terms of whether they were there.So there would not have been any big packets that was – so let us assume there was a packet of money that somebody needed to give me, why would you convoy bring two, three cars and then you give the person there?  It does not make sense.  But there was not any of that, there was no packet of money that as being given.  He says there were two cars that arrived, one was witness 1 andthe other one was Jiyane.   I do not recall a lot of these intricate things that happened but what I do know is there was no packet of money or he says he assumed it contained cash.  There was no such.  We exchanged cars, I had to travel and I travelled.     No, no, no, the test driving was going to take place after he brought the car.  He brought the car.      To where we met, it was next to the tollgate, very close to the tollgate from the N17, I cannot remember,I think it is called Rifles something.  He brought the car because I was in a meeting elsewhere.   Witness 1, as he calls him, brought me to that place so that I could get onto the car and then I would have thought that he then got into the car with witness 1 and where his car was that he says someone else came to pick him up.  It was not such an intricate thing as it is now being painted, it was really just to say go and fetch this car, do not come back on the N1 because it is going to be traffic and I want to travel when there is still a bit of light.Witness 1 is going to bring me from the meeting that I was at and then I can take the car and drive.  It was not all of these intricate things that the flavour demands that they should...     Chair, probably this is at the nub of why we are having this discussion today.  At paragraph 49 there is a whole lot of lies, there was no such that took place but he is prefacing it in this fashion so that there seems to have been something untoward that had happened.  Hethen says at paragraph …[intervenes]     That is correct, Chair.     So paragraph 50 where he says it reached breakpoint, the breakpoint is not in November, Chair, it is in August when it happened.     That is correct.  Where I observed these things on the camera.  I then approached his manager tosay this is what I have observed, can you find out from him what is it exactly that he was doing?  And then he wrote a statement to say this had been given to him by someone that I knew to sprinkle …[intervenes]     Yes, that is what I observed, yes.     Yes.    It was a brown powder in terms of the statement that he wrote.     That he had been given this brown powder.     But he then says no, he never came with it to the house, that he threw it away in the freeway but I observed him sprinkling this there.     On the cameras.     And then …[intervenes]     Night.     It was at night.     Yes.     And then I had not been aware that he was there, it was one of these things that I talk about, that …[intervenes]    He was not supposed to be there.  Ja, he came there [indistinct].     [indistinct] at night.     By cover of night and hoping that…     Yes.  So then he writes the statement to say who gave it to him but then in his statement he then says no, he never – he was asked to go and sprinkle it but he never sprinkled it.  So I am saying then if he never sprinkled why then did I see in the cameras because I would never have asked him, I would have never asked forthe investigation to say there is something with this fellow and there are these things that are happening.  I would not have known if he threw in the freeway as he claims because he wrote a statement, Chair, where he says no, I threw it away in the  - on the freeway.  But then I see this thing and it was a vicious thing, you know, to have many prayers to deal with that.     So this is where the dishonesty is, Chair.  So I raise this issue because of what I have observed.  He then denied that it happened, that he sprinkled anything.  He then says no, he did have something that he was sent …[intervenes]     To sprinkle.     In the statement, ja, he says but he did not sprinkle.  But if he had not sprinkled it, I would not have seen him sprinkling, I would not have asked the question.  If he had received and really thrown away this thing on thefreeway, I was not with him when he was on the freeway when he was supposed to have thrown it away but because he did not throw it away, he then captured – he gets captured by the camera doing this thing.  So he writes about it to say no, so and so gave it to me and said this is what I must do and then he then claims no, but I did not do it.  Then why would I ask if he had not done it?  So that is the other thing.  So I then say to his manager look, just do not assign him to me because as you can see, he admits that something like this happened but he now tries -  hecreates another flavour of it to say no, it did not happen in this way.     Yes, so if I then move to 51, Chair.  He says he resigned because he could not tolerate my accusations.   The accusation happened once, he admitted to it in a statement.  You know, he talks about an attitude.  He was no longer working with me so I do not know what he talks about but I think that then becomes the source of – so you now have somebody with a grudge against you, somebody that used to work with you very closely that you no longer trust, that now has a grudge against you and has become an enemy because he now things that he lost his job because of you.  That is really what we are dealing withhere. I am not terribly familiar with all of those issues but the betrayal of trust, that is actually what it was and the putting me into danger also because this was a very toxic thing that I really do not understand but you cross that area you [indistinct].     Well, I did not have to suspect, he told me.     It is in her statement, Chair.     Oh, I have got it, I have got it.       Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Then you can read it, Chair.     I have no reason to threaten witness 1 or – I mean, witness 2.  I do not know how to procure drones to – I just suspect that his citing of drones is also a figment of his imagination.  I am not behind any attempts to intimidate him, I do not do that, I pray for him every day but I do not – I have no reason to hire drones or try to intimidate or threaten him.  He knows himself where he is, he knows the truth.     Innuendo, conjecture, there is nothing that I can say to those kinds of things, it is his belief system.  I am not there, there is no such but I think the issue of whether he would be seen to be trustworthy or loyaltowards his principals by other colleagues in the security industry is something that he should himself think about because where somebody can be creative and make lies about their principals, I think everybody – it is something that he should have thought about before he starts the inventions and the flavour.     Perhaps before you do, Chair?     I do not know if it would be – I do not know what time it is, I do not keep a watch but …[intervenes]     If we could take a short …[intervenes]     Yes.     Page 94?     Yes.     Yes, except that it doesn’t recreate a diary and I think I’ve been at pains to explain to Mr Myburgh, and I think I explained earlier this morning that what this does, I think you call it electronic data, I’m looking for a diary I don’t have a diary.  The electronic data gives you 50 to 60% of information that you would ordinarily find in the proper diary.  So, we have used the information that we have been given to the extent that we can.  So, it doesn’t give us the kind of information that we wanted and that’s why we have sought to resort, now, to meeting minutes andthose kinds of things just to show and demonstrate that some of these things, when they are alleged to have happened, that I was not even at the places where witness 2 says that I have been.  so, I know from the interaction between myself and my legal team and the legal team and the Commission’s legal team that the 14 000 records, as it were, provide electronic data but they don’t provide a diary.  So, I think it’s something which we’ve gradually had to accept that, that’s what it is, it’s not the diary as we would know it because we believe that, if it was actuallythe diary itself, I think it would have been much, much better.  For instance, there are these two or three dates that have been given but we don’t have any of the other dates where he says certain things could have happened or that could have been useful…[intervenes].     Yes, and I’ve indicated to you what it shows, it’s the meeting requests.  So, it says so and so need a meeting request for these people, for a meeting to takeplace at such and such a day.  The way that it works, you have to go into a specific date, look for those things but sometimes it doesn’t tell you where the meetings were and the only reason you are able to get the meetings and find out where they were is if there’s minutes that took place.  Certain times you can have a meeting somewhere and there are no minutes that were taken because it was not a formal, you know, meeting.  So, I think that is the issue…[intervenes].     I’m trying to remember what this thing was called on the diary, it’s a Microsoft, exchange is it…[intervenes].     They are unable to procure it Chair.     They’ve tried.     So, I’m not saying that it’s because of a lack of trying.     And so, I’m saying, what we have gives us something.     Yes, but it doesn’t give us everything it gives us 50 to 60% of what diaries would have been used for.    Ja, I’m not asking the Commission to still continue trying, I think they’ve tried, so we are saying – we’re just lamenting the fact that what we intended to do.     We wanted to cross-examine the witness.     I think we could argue this ad infinitum Chair,I have no intention to – I can’t take it further.     Yes, but it might not be – it may not havereflected everything that happened on that particular day. For instance, with what we have, I couldn’t be able to tell you why I was delayed for two hours at the meeting of the TNPA, but my diary probably would have done that. So, this is something – it’s a useful tool but it doesn’t achieve, completely, the objectives for which I wanted the diary for.     Yes.     Sorry, can you repeat that, sorry.     Well, I don’t know where we are going to withthis.     And?     Yes.     I’m sorry the document that has been given tohim must he slot it in somewhere in the bundle or?     Yes.     Yes.     Okay, do you have a reference that we can use like my affidavit to deal with that issue?     That’s fine, I could give you a broad brush and maybe what – what could assist the Commission on these matters is an understanding of the decision making process and then we can go into – I think there are three things that we need to understand about any – of these decisions.  Whether it’s the 1064, the 100, 95 any investment decision.  The first thing is that there is an investment case that is made which is a business case for the investment to be made which is called the investingdecision and that investing decision is normally taken in a context where a number the  of assumptions must be made and what I’ve seen a lot here happen is that there then became a marriage between the assumptions and the investing decision in terms of what then happened and then when people wanted to make certain comparisons they failed to get out of the post in terms of the investing decision and the investment case, Chair.   So, as with the case with the 1064 – so there was an investment decision that was made that the 1064locomotive that must be purchased but even that, before you got to it, as Mr Myburgh indicates, Transnet had a locomotive lead plan, there was a market demand strategy which gave the context to it.  The market demand strategy said, how do we meet the demands of the market without looking at the constraints that we as Transnet have in terms of how to finance a capital investment programme. So, I’ll come back to that, the second decision is the procurement decision.  The procurement decision is when you go out to the market and you start the process to find bidders that can supply you with this equipment. So, in this case, we are talking about locomotives.   That process is a very separate process from the investment decision and typically the procurement decision takes place after the investment decision has been madeor simultaneously in terms of long lead procurement processes such as – for infrastructure or for locomotive.  The procurement decision is then premised on how you call for proposals, how you adjudicate, how you qualify and disqualify, what are the financial, technical, commercial criteria that are measured in order to arrive at an adjudicated decision and then the third decision is the financing decision.  The financing decision talks to how are you going to finance the capital investment programme.  The programme is the whole programme so if you have theMTS, you have the whole programme but the projects within the programme and the capital programme. So, there are various projects, and they are closely intertwined because for certain of these things if you do certain things here you must also do certain things there so that you have a complete picture in terms of the – what Mr …[indistinct – dropped voice]. The financing decision talks to whether you are going to finance in-house, from your own cash flow, all of the capital or whether you are going to borrow some of the money, and it also takes into account the period within which you are going to …[indistinct] the assets.  So, for instance you cannot go for a bank overdraft if you are going to finance an asset that has an asset lifecycle of 20 or 30 years, so then you try to match your asset that youare acquiring with the financial instrument that is commiserate with that.  There is a delineation in Transnet in terms of who does what. So, for me as a lowly railway man who is just trying to – my job in Transnet was to meet customer expectations.  Customers want to move a product from point A to point B.  What we found was, the assets were too old, locomotives were more than 35 years old, they failed all the time, a trip to Durban which could ordinarily by train take 12 hours would take 35 hours.  You can’t run an economy when producers and consumerscannot not, within reason – with reasonable expectation know what time their cargo will be there because people are chasing just in time principles, their production – there are factories that need certain raw materials to go into a process in order for them to run. So, as a result, even though railways are cheaper than trucks or road, people ended up transporting a vast number of tonnages via the road because of the lack of the reliability of the rail.  What had triggered is, there was a serious under investment which had happened over a period of time in the railway, in fact the last locomotives that had been acquired were around 1972 which was a problem and that’s why you were now having a process and a system where you had locomotives that failed because they were too old.  They had gone through midlife refitsand some of the parts that were required were no longer there.  Some of these locomotives are no longer even in manufacture but Transnet was still running them. So, what ended up happening is that if you had 20 locomotives running you would park 2 locomotives from which you would take some parts to use on the others because there’s nowhere else that you are going to find these parts, they are now obsolete.  So, that was the situation that we were in, but we were also saying that if we wanted to create a world class, competitive logisticsystem for our country, reliability is at the top end of the system that you need to create and in order to be reliable you need locomotives that have fewer faults per 100 000 ton kilometres as much as possible.  Ours was just simply out of the range that you could have your clients to have any form of confidence in the system that you had and as a result, therefore, the railway was just not reliable and we found that more and more trucks were on the road and that causes also, untold issues. So, we as the people who then, had to deal with the clients, we required to have these assets that would give a measure of respectability to the promise that we made to customers.  So, we, the lowly railway people were only really interested in acquiring these assets so that we could put them into operations and run them.  The group had tofund and finance this, they have treasury operations and finance people who are hired to do this.  Then the other thing that we were then doing was to then be involved in the procurement process. The procurement process has got its own procedures manual in terms of how it works.  So you’re looking at the interplay of these three processes.  The investing decision we could not make at our division because what we needed to buy was just simply too large for our delegated authority or anything so this was probably I think Transnet had a R300 billion market demand strategy Icannot remember the actual number I think it went to about 350 and these locomotives that we wanted to acquire were estimated at roughly about 40 billion of that which was about 15 to 18% of the – the total of Transnet.   So Transnet had to look at this very closely so the investment decision therefore also had to take place at board level in fact it took place at ministerial level because of the – the size of it and there were PFMA issues.  So I think that is the context within which these key decisions had to be made.   So Transnet Freight Rail worked on the investment case up to a certain point and the Transnet said okay thank you very much we think we like what you want to achieve however it is too big for you so we run with it on your behalf.  We would like your input from time to time so give us somesupport people that we can liaise with that will deal with these issues but we will also get external people to assist us because it is just simply too big.   And so that is what they did.  So that was the investment decision until the time when it went to board from the board it went to the ministers and then it was approved.  So that was the aspect that we dealt with at TFR.  So we came up with a business case up to a particular level when we presented it to what is called the Group Capital Investment Committee.  After the Group Capital Investment Committee then the Group CFO then had to take this and run with it and do all of the different things that had to be done like the capital assurance, the risk management framework etcetera around it leading to the board the decisions to hatch all of those things.  But then the second decision that we were involved in as TFR was the pre-payment.  So our chief procurement officer then was given the authority via the board also just to go to the board first to say now you can initiate and you can start the process.  And then we had to go back to the board and say these are the committees that we will put in place in order for us to be able to deliver.Then TFR also ran with the procurement process.  We then have high value tender teams which is an auditfunction and a compliance function that looks at every step of the way as you deal with this and ticks an say okay you can go to the next step you have fulfilled satisfactory these particular steps.The third one which is the financing one which involved how you finance it that is way over our league at the – that is what the Group function and finance and treasury typically dealt with although they would ask us for input in terms of if we produce so many per year how much money would you need in that year to – in order to be able tofinance and pay? So I think that provides context Chair and then we can then go into the actual…    The actual specific things but then I think once we have understood that – I think specifically when you do the investment decision you – you make all kinds of assumption from a clean slate or from certain things that you know.  You might find that by the time you get to the end of the process that which you thought you know you find that you only know –knew 50 or 60% of it and then you have to deal with it so you end up with what is called an estimate of the investment in terms of what it is going to cost.And then once you do the procurement decision theprocurement decision is the one that gives you the actual cost that you are going to deal with and then the final step will then come in because I can give you an actual today to say if we bought all of them today it is going to cost us so much we knew that out of the – out of the procurement process.  But then you need the clever finance people to then say to you okay if it is going to be delivered over a seven year period and you have to borrow money what does that mean; what is it that we will have to do?   Then they talk about the net present value or thefuture value of the present cash flows and it gets – it gets complicate we never really got too involved in it.  They would tell us what it was and we would accept what they tell us because that is what they do every day – that is – that is their job.    Yes I am.   Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Sorry where are you now?    Yes the significance of that date is that in May 12 is when we basically took the investment case to the Transnet Capital Investment Committee and after May 2012 when they the group office then accepted the business case they then said look we need to evaluate and assess this business case.  It took them then the better part of the next twelve months to do exactly that.  And then in April 2013 the board approved the business case. That is the significance of those dates.    169?    Yes.    So if – if we use 78.3 as a – as a pillar.  So the Capital Investment Committee is charged with looking at the investment case.  The people at Group Finance would then look at it they assess and evaluate under the leadership ofthe Group Chief Financial Officer.  Once they are satisfied with it they do many tests financial and risk framework tests.  Once they are satisfied with it then it moves upstairs to the Group Executive Committee for approval or recommendation. The Group Executive Committee is the highest decision making audi amongst the executives and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer.  Once the Group Executive Committee has then dealt with it then the GCE has to engage the board committees.  So in this case it had to go to the board Acquisition And Disposals Committee.  And once the board Acquisition And Disposals Committee has approved or got it recommended to it then that chairperson of that committee or that sub-committee of the board would then recommend the investment case to the board itself.   And in this case after the board has approved it also needed to go to the – to the Minister because it exceeded the delegated framework within which the board could approve. I think the board could approve around R4 billion so anything above the R4 billion has to go to the Minister.    That is correct.   Probably four or five non-executive board members would sit in there and then the GCFO and the GCE were ex-official members of that committee.    Yes.    I do not know probably by the chairperson of the board.  I am not sure.  I have seen in certain instances where I think there were two separate processes that get followed in this type of thing.   Amongst the non-executives they would sit and they will say we have five committees in the board we need a chairperson of each and then they would decide amongst themselves who was going to chair this one.  But I know that two committees which is the HR and Remuneration Committee even after they have agreed they have to send that to the Minister to approve.   So that – that is the HR and RAMCO as well as the Audit and Risk Committee I think those ones the Minister then gives final approval of who will chair that.  So thechairperson of the board will then provide the Minister to say these are the people who will be the members and this is the person who will be the chairman and then in terms of corporate governance we will also share a very brief CV of each of the members.  But most of the time the – because in Transnet the board members are all appointed by the Minister so the Minister would have had some of the CV’s of these people before they were appointed.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Mr Jiyane was the overseer of the procurement process.  Within the procurement process I think they were close to I might be wrong maybe 120 who dealt with the approving.  And each of these in – maybe there were six or seven different committees each of them had a chairperson.   So there would be a chairperson for the commercial stream and so that educate they have got certain things that they are looking for.  There is a chairperson for the financial stream.  There would be a chairperson for the technical stream.  There would be a chairperson for the supplier development stream.  There were also BBBEE and equity sort of requirements that were required in that.   So I do not know if I have done justice to the different committees but then those chairpersons constitutedwhat was called the tender evaluation team.  And each of those then reported to Jiyane.   Alongside that was the high value tender evaluation team which is the independent team of experts and people that have got audit and compliance skills and they will look at the procedures manual.  They will look at the entire RFP to say what does it say and how do certain things happen.  They will look at any deviation that needs to be made and they will make recommendations and they will say okay this deviation you can make but go back to whoever is thedelegated authority to give you the proper delegation to do it etcetera, etcetera.   So in total I think roughly let me just say between 60 and maybe 120 different people I have seen their names in one of the documents that shows the different committees.    Ja I am – I am not sure.    That is why I am saying.    Yes cross-functional team there is one for finance, commercial etcetera some were smaller some werebigger.    Ja.    It depends on the delegation that was made at the time that the investment decision is made.  So the board would give the GCE a delegation they will say we give you delegation to go out on tender which is the procurement process.  If they want the GCE to shortlist they would also say that.   And then they will say after you have shortlisted come back to us for further delegation – share with us who you have shortlisted etcetera and we can then make a decision in terms of what the next steps ought to be.  So that is normally the process.   Sometimes they will say GCE we give you the authority to go out on tender, shortlist, approve a supplier and come and share with us who the chosen supplier is based on your PPM.   Yes I was chosen or nominated as it were to be part of the post-tender negotiations.  I had a very fancy title of them the co-chair of the negotiating committee and what it really meant was that if during the negotiations there was anything that the negotiating teams needed clarity on or if there were deadlocks with suppliers etcetera they couldcome to me and explain the problem and I could then sit with them and say okay go about it this way, look at it in different ways.   As it turned out I was never approached at any point by the teams to say we have deadlocked somewhere we need your input or counsel or certain amount of wisdom.  It did not really happen there.   I think at each stage they came back and said we are now at this stage this is what we are doing.  They – it was more – it became just more of an information sharing thing.  I never found myself having to get stuck in any kind of negotiation.    The Locomotive Steering Committee waschaired by the GCE.  I was a member, the GCFO was a member.   I think legal and compliance was a member.  Probably internal audit and I think Jiyani was an ex-official.    Ja I would not say it is a sub-committee but I think that was the committee and then some of the people who were ad-hoc members.   I confirm that.    It was Mr Singh.    In the main Mr Singh was actually based at the place where the negotiations took place but I think he would be the one who would indicate whether he was ever approached in terms of the negotiation process but Jiyane oversaw aspects of it.  At the negotiation there were variousteams.   There was I know that there was a team that looked after the Transnet Engineering sub-contract.  There were financial teams but in the main it was a lot of the same people who were at the adjudication who were also negotiating.

ADV OLDWADGE SC:   Mr Chairman…     I think it is only fair to Mr Gamathat he present it – is it now for Mr Myburgh to even look at the document?  What about Mr Gama, he should have sight of this document, Mr Chair.    Chair, sorry, that is not correct.  The evidence of those two witnesses just named by Mr Myburgh is very clear, their interpretation …[intervenes]    They were involved – those two persons, Mr Mkwanazi and Mr Mapoma were involved in the process, unlike Mr Molefe.  It is clear what their evidence was in relation to the repayment to Mr Gama of those fees.  It is not correct to say that they were at loss, they were part and parcel of that negotiation process so they had firsthand knowledge of what had transpired.  I think it isimportant to put that to Mr Gama.

ADV S LEBAGENG:   Thank you very much, Chair.  We do place ourselves on record.  My name is Simbati(?) Lebageng(?).     I am from ...[indistinct].      I am with my attorney, Ms Quali(?) and indeed Ms Gigaba is here with us.       And insofar as the application is concerned by Ms Gigaba.  I am informed - I have a letter that was sent prior to the Commission and to their Legal Team indicating that Ms Gigaba will not oppose and will simply abide by the decision of ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chairperson. 
ADV SOLOMONS:   Good evening, Chair.  I appear in this matter together with my learned friend, Mr Gumby(?)     For the applicant in the application.     Chair, we will also refer just shortly before the commencement of these proceedings with a letter which was apparently addressed to the Commission from Ms Gigaba’s legal representative.     We were also aware that on the last occasion when our application was due to be heard andMs Gigaba was due to lead evidence, that another letter was read out by her attorney on her behalf, setting out that she did not wish to participate further in the proceedings.  So certain of the allegations that are contained in our application and certain of the submissions have, to some extent, been superseded and we would submit Chair, bolstered by the attitude of Ms Gigaba as set out in the two letters that have been presented to you.  We have done ...[intervenes]      ...further ...[intervenes]      Yes?     [Indistinct]      Yes, Chair ...[intervenes]      I heard.  I will try and ask for someone assistance.     Can I address you?     Thank you.  Chair, what you have justplaced on record creates some difficulty for me and my client.     In this sense.     We do believe that the letter that we just received now is important.  It was just, literally, sent to us a few moments ago.  We do believe it is important because it not only bolsters my client’s application but it, in a sense, the supports the needs for the relief that we seek.  And if I preclude it from referring to it, it will certainly hamper my client in presenting his application in the most favourable manner and we would hope in the most informative manner for the benefit of the Commission.  ButI do not ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I understand it.  I am appreciative of it.     Of that difficulty.  But Chair, then there are different ways to deal with it.  If you are happy for me to address you on aspects of the letter in the absence of you having not considered it in its entirety, I would be happy to do so.  If you require my client to place the letter more formally before you by way of an affidavit then that may mean that this application cannot be heard now.       ...falls flat.  If facts are placed before the Commission, not by my client, then we would be – andwhen I say before the Commission and placed on record before the Commission, then my client, with respect, should be able to rely upon those facts insofar as he deems any of those facts of what has been placed on record to be supportive of his application and hopefully also to bring those particular facts placed on record to the attention of the Chair.     ...to allow the Chair.     [Indistinct]      That is quite fine, Chair.  What I would perhaps recommend, subject to you, Chair, is that Ms Gigaba’s legal representative perhaps read into the record and place as she did on the last occasion.     [Indistinct]      [Indistinct]      I would be guided by your Chair.     Have you – I imagine you would have had the opportunity.  Have you had the opportunity ofseeing our submissions which was sent today sometime to the Commission?     That is fine.     Well, Chair I will try and stay within the 15-minutes.     [Indistinct]      Can I just at the outside then, tick(?) where we - without necessarily reading of the sake of time saving.     Perhaps to start with Ms Gigaba’s letter.  We want to just make the following points where we think what she has set out in the letter supports our contentions.  The one is, she appears to take the point that she is not a compatible witness although she does not want to be a contentions witness.  So she respects the subpoena received by her but it would seem to us she wishes to exercise a martial privilege which is part of what we have argued in our application and in our initial submissions and supplementary submissions.  So that is the first point.  And Chair, if you want to make a note of that.  That is paragraph 4 of the letter.The second point that we wish to make which we submit is the supportive of our contentions is.  She says in paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4 of her letter...  Chair, if you would also just bear in mind.  I only had a very quick glance at the letter.     But she says – thank you, Chairperson.  She says that there are certain facts that are not within herpersonal knowledge.  She also place it on record that what is in her statement or affidavit is not in all respects, it would appear to be, accurate.  That is the third thing.The fourth thing.  In paragraph 8.5 she raises security concerns which we say supports the alternative relief that we seek if she is to give evidence that it should be in camera.  We have raised that in our application as an alternative.And then refrain from, a concern, she has got a concern relating to public disclosure which again feeds intoour submission in regard to the alternative relief.  Chair, I am going to just try and share our amended submission with you.     [No audible reply]      I am trying now.  I just hope it will... Is the document on your screen, Chair?     Yes.  Chair ...[intervenes]      Certainly.     That is not a problem.  But perhaps we could – it was sent to the Commission and perhaps for the purposes of your ruling that our learned friend ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct]      ...whilst I proceed.     Ja, we ...[intervenes]      Ja ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Yes, Chair.  Well, that involves two aspects.  One is our application that she should not testify in relation to the contents of her affidavit that had been shared with us.  And then, in the alternative, if she is, it should be held in camera.      ...and we make our submissions in our application why that should be.       Chair ...[intervenes]      ...the basis for this is – there are a number but I will just try to deal with them in turn.     The main thrust is that these are parties who are married, who are going through an acrimonious divorce and a large portion and perhaps the majority of her evidence contained in the affidavit constitutes communications that took place between ahusband and wife which would ordinarily be protected by the marital privilege.  So that is the first point.We say that communications that took place between Mr and Mrs Gigaba within the marital privilege context should not be aired in public.  Secondly, we say that because of the acrimonious nature of their divorce proceedings, there is an inherent risk in the evidence and the veracity of the evidence that she is going to give and that will impact upon questions of credibility, et cetera.And that fear has been exacerbated by the two letters that she has addressed to the Commission and it seems to us that the Commission should not be used as a platform for evidence of this nature where the parties are in engaged in an acrimonious divorce to bring about the end of their matrimonial regime.  And we submit that it sets a dangerous and perhaps distasteful president that the Commission’s work which we all endorse as extremely important for our democracy but it should not be used as a forum for the area of domestic grievances but that is not the reason why we say ...[intervenes]      Yes, it is just...  Can you not see me, Chair?     I will stop the sharing then and – is that better then?     Yes.     Certainly, Chair.     Certainly, Chair.     So Chair, the other concern that we raised is the question of the minor children born from the marriage.  There are numerous references which we have highlighted in our application where they are implicated in the evidence and we need not overemphasise that the rights of those minor children would need to be protected.And to have this type of evidence presented in so a public a forum which concerns the relationship between the parents who are going through this divorce, we submit it is another factor to be taken into account.  So Chair, why we say ...[intervenes]      Correct.     Chair, if – certainly we accept you are not a criminal court.  The question of being willing to give evidence, we have a concern with.  We do emphasise that recent events have superseded our initial application and we would invite you Chair not to ignore what has been submitted to the Commission through Ms Gigaba’s attorney’s letters.     To say ...[intervenes]      We have.  We have.     In our heads ...[intervenes]      Well, what we say is.  Spousal testimonial privilege – we are talking now in a criminal context – does not exist.  We have to protect the rights of the accused.  It exists for public policy reasons and to protect the right of privacy.  So ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct]      We ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.  We ...[intervenes]      Well, of course we recognise that we made the point in our amended submissions that the Commission stands in a slightly different position but whatwe are inviting you Chair to hold, that the underline public policy reasons would apply to a commission because spousal – and we referred to a case of the – sorry – we referred to the authors in ...[indistinct], S J van Niekerk and S C Van der Merwe.   We have got the reference.  It is at 14.1 of our amended submissions.  If you can just make a note, Chair?      Well ...[intervenes]      Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Quite so Chair, what we are saying is that there is spells or testimonial privilege and in that context the non-compellability argument that we have raised should apply and we say that really distinguishes itself from the judgment in the constitutional court in State versus Zuma regarding compellability of witnesses. So what we are saying Chair is that where you have Ms Gigaba who now appears to be a reluctant witness, isno longer a voluntary participant in the commission’s proceedings, we say that in terms of Section 34 of the Act she should not and cannot be compelled to testify against Mr Gigaba, because all the protections that one would normally have, are no longer there. Because her evidence on her own version is now inherently unreliable and in this context one should not allow the airing of spousal grievances against one another in the public forum of the commission.  So we are asking you Chair to exercise a discretion in terms of Rule 1(1) sothat her evidence is ruled inadmissible and her compellability which she now relies upon and which we have also relied upon is such that she should not be compelled to give that evidence today before the commissioner.  Really we also rely Chair on the procedural prejudice which we say outweighs the minimal probative value if any, of Ms Gigaba’s evidence which it offers.  So when you look at the totality, when you look at the position that Ms Gigaba has now adopted, the procedural privilege, the prejudice is such that you should exercise that discretion and find that that compellability issue would apply to the work of the commission.Where you have got in the context of the spouses relationship a high likelihood that the evidence would beunreliable, fabricated, highly subjected, emotive and possibly vindictively motivated.  Chair, the other problem we have and I know you have said we should separate the question of cross-examination and I am not going to go there, because in the interest of time and we agree with what is behind the Chair ’s ruling in that regard, but we do say that were she to give evidence, we would be compelled to have, to request you Chair to have an opportunity to tease out the collateral issues which give rise to portions of the evidence contained in her statement, which we againsubmit respectfully to you Chair is outside of the commission’s mandate, and should not be allowed to be aired in this forum. We have made the point and we just want to emphasise that the admission of evidence of this nature, we submit makes [indistinct] on Mr Gigaba and his children’s rights to dignity and privacy and we would submit Chair, that you have the right in terms of Regulation 15 to determine your own procedures. Rule 6 allows you to receive evidence that you consider relevant and that you need not follow the strict rules of evidence regarding admissibility and we would submit that exercising that broad discretion that you have, this evidence should not be accepted. Chair, we make the point that whilst Rule 6 saysthat the ordinary rules of the admissibility of evidence in courts of law need not be strictly applied to determine admissibility, we submit that the time tested norms of admissibility in court proceedings would find relevance to the commission’s determinations, and this is because those norms with respect have been developed to take into account issues such as reliability, probative value, fairness in assessing evidence, all of which are concerns which ought similarly to be valued in the commission’s assessment. Sorry Chair.    Yes.  Certainly Chair.  We just, you asked me about where the privilege arises in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act.  I am not going to read it, Section 198 and 199.  They are to be found at, if you could make a note paragraph 29.10 at page 15 of our amended submissions, and I am just going to make this lastsubmission.    And then move on to the second leg, but what we submit is that Section 198 of the Criminal Procedure Act, means that a witness in Ms Gigaba’s position may refuse to disclose marital communications with her husband, and she could also refuse to disclose communications which she has made. So we would say that she would be entitled to evoke that privilege.  We say she should not be compelledto give evidence, and our amended submissions set out very clearly why we say this and we would urge you Chair, before you make any ruling, would have regard to that. Then just moving to the ...[intervenes]     I think we have Chair, in respect of the first ...[intervenes]     The first relief.  It is just there is no time to refer you to all the authorities we rely upon, but they are in our ...[intervenes]    Written submissions.     In regard to the in camera element.     We submit to you Chair, that if you do decide to have her evidence led and if she is to give evidence, the proceedings should be held in camera.  The reason we say you have that discretion in terms of Section 4 of the Act and Regulation 2 also as read with Regulation9, gives you that, those powers. 4.2 specifically says you can make an order to be held in camera, as she has now elaborated upon in the latest letter that was placed on record before the commencement this afternoon, and as elaborated upon by Ms Gigaba in his statement, the evidence is acutely intimate and personal, and it relates not only to the spouses romantic and marital relationships, but also to their children’s private lives. Many of these impact upon the divorce proceedings which are presently sub judice and pending.  We have dealt with in quite some detail in our submissions ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, well Chair, we have said and we agree with you that concealing the person’s face in these, in this situation, is not what would meet the potential harmthat we have described in our application and in our amended submissions. What we are saying is that where you have evidence of an acutely intimate and personal nature that relates not only to the spouses romantic and marital relationship but also to the children’s private lives.  It is inappropriate to have that evidence in a public forum and perhaps the answer to our alternate relief that we seek, is that reinforces the need for that evidence not to be led, because if the later of these proceedings are such that arrangements cannot be made to afford that protection, that really reinforces the need to exclude this evidence in all the circumstances that we have described between a spouse and a husband who may or may not be implicated in some wrongdoing. So it really just reinforces the need to exclude her evidence, because if you cannot and it is no criticism of the commission, but if one cannot provide that type of anonymity and confidentiality and protection because of the nature of the proceedings, then we submit that really reinforces the point why Ms Gigaba should not be compelled to give evidence against her husband in the manner suggested.     We have ...[intervenes]     A lot of these, I would not necessarily want to go through the list ...[intervenes]     Because it is in a sense self-defeating.    Evidence should not, sorry Chair.     That is fine Chair.     We are grateful for the indulgence.     What we would just submit on the question of the children, that the references to the children are not simply passing references.  Ms Gigaba’s claims intertwine the children’s lives, their health, their positions, their relationship with their parents, into the allegationsagainst Mr Gigaba.So there is really a cross-pollicisation which would be very difficult to untangle and those references are just contextualised amongst other details about immediate family and extended family’s homes and relationships.  So the silver thread that underpins the entire affidavit of Ms Gigaba runs deeply into the family relationship, the extended family relationship, the children. That evidence of course cannot be heard least of all tested Chair, without intimate aspects of the children’slives being disclosed.  So in doing so, regardless of the outcome of the findings, the Gigaba children who are now only eight and nine years old, will invariably be tainted with links of allegations of State Capture and the acrimonious divorce proceedings between their parents being aired in so public a forum. We say that such disclosure does not serve the public confidence in a manner that is proportionate to the harm occasioned to the children’s best interests.     And we furthermore oppose the compellability of Ms Gigaba for the reasons we have stated, but our concerns have been certainly exacerbated by the recent events and what she has placed on record before you.   And really the legal teams who oppose our applications, suggesting that the evidence will be protected from public disclosure on the basis of the identity of witnesses, does not assist us really to meet these requirements. So we would submit Chair, that this is a case for the extension of the compellability argument, that given the unique facts that you are now presented with, particularly Ms Gigaba’s changed attitude, she is no longer a witnesswho has simply come to the commission, and we just wanted to make this point which really concerns us and this is our final point.     Is that we understood she had approached the commission, but it seems from the letter that we received this afternoon, that the commission approached her and when you look at the way her statement reads with the headings and the flow of the statement, it engenders quite a lot of concern on the part of my client as to how the entire narrative was structured and whether that was indeed the [indistinct] of Ms Gigaba in the sense of she says now placing on record that there are aspects of the statement that she is unhappy about. What we say sets a dangerous president is that ifthe commission is prepared to go and seek out witnesses who are involved in divorce proceedings which are pending between spouses to give evidence against a notionally implicated spouse, it really would set a very dangerous president.     We will submit Chair ...[intervenes]     No Chair, we accept that but in circumstances where the witness now says that there are aspects of that affidavit she does not agree with ...[intervenes]     That is what we are saying.  Not as ageneral proposition.    Those are our submissions Chair.     I can indeed Chair, I thought just to [indistinct] and ...[intervenes]     Thank you Chair.      That should suffice, Chair.     Chair, we do not agree with our learned friend’s characterisation of our application asbased on the three legs that he has argued.  We say that our application deals with spousal testimonial privilege, which is the compellability issue, which he has not deal with.   We say that we have raised that issue and we say that on a proper reading of her letter she has raised the compellability issue and where someone has a witness who is not disrespectful of the Commission in the sense that she refuses to come to the Commission – she says she is cooperating with the Commission but, as we read it, she isexercising her spousal testimonial privilege concerning compellability and in that sense she should not be compelled to testify.Second point we have relied up is the marital communications privilege and that is Sections 198 and 199 of the Criminal Procedure Act and we make the point, which our learned friend, with respect, has not addressed, that spousal testimony of privilege means a spouse cannot be compelled to give evidence in criminal proceedings against their spouse at all and we say there is no reason why that should not apply in these particular circumstances to the Commission and the work of the Commission and insofar as this particular application is concerned and we submit that it applies for two reasons.  The discretion that you have in terms of Section3(4) of the Commissions Act and secondly, it is principally to protect the institution of marriage, not just an accused, so it is far beyond the narrow argument that our learned friend is evoking and we submit that Mrs Gigaba is both not a compellable witness and is also entitled to raise marital communication privilege in response to questions arising out of the marital relationship.  And the mere fact that she mentions issues relevant to the mandate does not afford the nature of her evidence, probative weight or render her compellable in the sense that our learned friend althoughhas not argued but by implication.And of course, Chair, we make the point strongly that if the state capture legal team accepts that her evidence may be tainted by improper motive and that this is a matter for evidence, that point only really bolsters our argument that credibility needs to be tested and this is not the forum to descend into marital disputes and go and test credibility.So, Chair, in regard to the first leg of our application we submit that our learned friend has not put up any compelling reason why any of the arguments that we have advanced should not be accepted.Insofar as the question of in camera hearings, we have made our submissions, we stand by the concern we have that where in circumstances such as this, given thestance now adopted by Mrs Gigaba it would be extremely prejudicial particularly to the children born of the marriage and we do not agree with our learned friend’s characterisation of the evidence and how it may or may not impact upon for that evidence to be aired fully in the full glare of the public eye.  We would then again ask you Chair to uphold our application that the affidavit be found inadmissible and that she should not be allowed to give evidence, as we have submitted, but in the alternative, is she is, that that should be done in a total protectedconfidential in camera manner.  Thank you, Chair.     I am trying to unmute myself.     Yes, that …[intervenes]     That is for later we would submit.     Chair, you need not rule on that now.     Yes.     It goes together with B.     I think it would be – it would go – it would be for now, Chair, because if you agree that it should be held in camera you will need to …[intervenes]     I think so, Chair, I think it is just belts and braces but I think you are correct.     No, I do not think there would be much left of C in those circumstances.     And then D we have left open.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     As it pleases you, Chair. 
ADV QOFA:   Thank you, Chairperson, I was told the mic is in proper working order.     Through you, Chair, we have been requested specifically by Ms Gigaba that it is important before she is called to address you that the contents of the letter be placed on record so that whatever references she has to make or whatever address she has to make would be premises upon us having placed this letter on record.     Thank you very much, Chairperson.  I will therefore just try and go and swiftly as possible through     Chairperson, I will steal your words, actuallyyou summed it quite well.     Alright, Chair, I think you have summed it quite well.     Chairperson, maybe I should start from theonset by saying first of all, Ms Gigaba feels it is of paramount importance that if she can assist the Commission in any way she will be happy to do so.  The only grave concerns that she had, Chairperson, is that the affidavit before you does not demonstrate – first it contains information that – certain information that is not within knowledge, certain information that she has disputed and certain information that she does not agree with and she says, Chairperson, that unless that is brought clearly and explicitly to the Commission so that the Chair is aware, amongst others, that for instance Ms Gigaba is not happy with paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 1, 2, 3 and she says unless that is made clear to the Commission then the Chairperson and the Republic will be under the understanding that what is contained in that affidavit is what Ms Gigaba is saying. Hence she is saying, Chairperson, through you, I am happy to file an affidavit to identify for the Chairperson all the aspects that I say do not reflect that which I would want to communicate to the Chairperson.     I do also need to emphasise that she does [indistinct], Chairperson, that indeed she is not a compellable witness, she says so and she says, Chairperson, she believes that she enjoys the privilege – the long discussions that was had earlier, Chairperson, notonly the privilege that falls under marital privilege, Chairperson, further the privilege against self-incrimination and, Chairperson, what is critical …[intervenes]     Indeed.  Indeed, Chairperson.     Indeed, Chairperson, absolutely, I agree.  So, Chairperson, what she is just simply saying is, it is important for her to demonstrate to the Chair that she will not disrespect the direction of this Commission.  She expresses her reluctance in this letter not only on the basis that she feels she is uncompellable[sic] witness but she raises a plethora of issues that she feels have causedher even further discomfort for participating further in the Commission.  Now, Chairperson, that …[intervenes]     Chairperson, I was going to point two.     So, I am sorry, Chairperson, maybe I am probably tripping over myself in the process, I do apologise.     But that is the first part to say I am unhappy with aspects of my affidavit for the reasons I will be advancing.  Then she goes further, she says I come here with absolute respect for the Commission and a civic duty that I take very seriously and she said that being the case,I am married to Mr Gigaba still.  She said I believe for that reason alone, I am not a compellable witness.     If I have a choice I would rather not be here.     No, she is not here by choice.     Indeed, Chairperson.    Not only the summons but she raised that very issue, Chairperson, in the last paragraph of the letter where she says I am concerned with the fact that an impression has been created out there that I have volunteered to come to the Commission when in fact I was called by the Commission on this particular date and so on and so on.     Chairperson, to quote her specifically – and I hope I quote it as verbatim as she said it.  The response tothe question of whether or not she would be willing to come to the Commission was, if I am requested by the Commission to come through, I will be happy to assist my husband in issues where he needs me to help him remember.  I will not go further than that.     But that is the response that she gave specifically to that question.     Indeed, Chairperson.     Indeed, Chairperson.     Indeed, Chairperson, I agree totally.     Indeed so, Chairperson.  In fact, that is the very reason why Ms Gigaba actually said – I think it is important, I think to some extent the Chair is not aware of the concerns that I keep raising.     And if I do not let the Chair into the pictureof my concerns…     Then it means I would have not only been unfair to the Commission but at all times the Chair would believe that everything is going perfectly well and that there is no reason why I am not presenting myself as I should.     Indeed, Chairperson, I think Ms Gigaba is therefore right.     Thank you very much, Chairperson.     Indeed, Chairperson, and I think she definitely understands that.    And in all honesty the schedule of the Commission has been quite hectic.     And I do not think anybody is not aware of that.     Thank you very much, Chairperson.     Thank you, I thought to indicate, Chair, that when …[intervenes]     I would absolutely probably request that it may be helpful, Chair, that she files a supplementary affidavit first and I say this, Chair, for numerous reasons because you will see, Chair, when we filed the supplementary affidavit that not only does Ms Mngoma query the nature and the character of the evidence in addition to that which I have already indicated below but Ithink rather, Chair, it would be helpful to the Commission to not have her go through the affidavit and correct it as she goes along.  I think it will be more helpful to the Commission that she highlights those areas that – and which she is going to indicate clearly why she is highlighting and why she is – her objections to those aspects and I truly think that for purposes of the Commission that may truly be a better approach.     Chair, we did make that suggestion [indistinct – dropping voice]     And I know indeed – I must say that it was very clear that of course [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Indeed, indeed, Chairperson.    Very recently, Chair.      Chair and I do apologise for that, I do appreciate that.  Unfortunately  Chair, and I will speak for myself in this regard, I came into this matter onWednesday last week, and unfortunately I had a family issue to attend to over the weekend, which I could not get out of.     And so I did say that if it wasn’t for that we would have finalised the application, in fact we had started ...[indistinct]      It is just that the client feels that that affidavit must not only be in the draft format that we have now, it must be specific enough to identify why she is unhappy with paragraph 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.     But otherwise what we have done was to globalise the issues so as to say we are not happy with theaffidavit because of the following, but her feeling is that no it must go specifically to paragraph as to why she disputes this and why she is not happy.     I apologise – I apologise Chairperson I am getting a note here from my attorney that says it will be critical to highlight, and I apologise for missing this point, that Ms Gigaba feels that the affidavit which she is being sought to be led on does not represent what she says, so far as to say, and I know that is not going to be a step by step, paragraph by paragraph evidence here you know, but it ought to be placed on record that he effectively says that the majority of that affidavit does not represent that which she says and even though she is the – the Chair says it is okay she must be left on that affidavit it should be brought to the attention of the Commission that it is primarily what she feels is not heard.Thank you Chair.     Chairperson, if I may?     I would like to – I have had this discussion earlier.  We have concerns about affidavits that the client says have to be specific to her.  She must have read them and she has made it clear that she will not give any evidence on drafts that she has not particularly commissioned.  And therefore I request that the issue on the draft affidavit not be led, Mr Chair.    Chairperson, if I understood correctly and maybe I did not.     What Mr Myburgh is suggesting to the witness is that there is a draft supplementary affidavit that he is in possession of which he says corrects some of the issues that have been dealt with.    And what I have indicated, even prior to the sitting to Mr Myburgh is that the draft affidavit which he has been furnished with is but a drop(?), according to the witness.  There is – the witness has been clear.  Nothing should be discussed in the Commission until I have personally commissioned an affidavit.       To do so would be premature because whatever draft supplementary affidavit that is before himand not before this Commission ...[intervenes]      ...is not ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, maybe he can clarify it?    Apologies Chairperson.    I think it would be proper maybe if I do interject and clarify.      I think it would be important that we do clarifybecause we have consulted with Mr …    Okay.  Thanks Chairperson.    Chairperson I think 00   Indeed. 
MS GIGABA:   Yes.     [No audible response]     No.     Yes.    So help me God.     I am Nomachule Gigaba.    No.     Yes.     So help me God.     Yes.    Yes.       Yes.     Can you please repeat that?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.      Can you please rephrase that?     On this part everything is correct yes.      Yes.      Yes I am.     Yes.     Yes, but I have concerns on that.     Yes, but I have concerns on that.    Okay.     Okay.    Yes.     20 August 2014.     Yes we are still married.    Yes it is correct.      Sakhile called me and he told me that the Commission wants to interview me.     Yes.     Yes I received the call the day after the interview.     I said if the Commission calls me I will come and assist the Commission where Malusi does not remember, so according to me I wanted Malusi to come and give his evidence and then where he doesn’t remember or he doesn’t recall anything then I will say what I know.     Yes.     My attorney was – never attended any ofthis – when we were preparing for the evidence, he only attended once, the last one, where you were telling me that I need to come to the Commission, it was the first day I also saw you, and it was her first day as well.  So during the entire preparation of the evidence she never attended, I was only there with the Advocate ...[indistinct].     Yes.     Yes.     That is the first information that I didn’t put, all this information was collected by the Commission, and I raised that with them, because I never paid attention which Department he is working on, what does he do, which year, so I never pay attention on that so the Commission put that, it is not me.     I know that he held those positions but I am not sure about the times.     Yes, the years.     That is correct. ADV MYBURGH     It was 2010, 2009 to 2010 when we met, because we met in 2009.     Yes.     Yes that time we were already together, itwas in 2010 if I am not mistaken.     It is correct.     Not exactly, because I never pay attention to the dates and everything, and I raised that during our consultation.       Yes I said that Chair.     I know the positions but I don’t know anything about the dates and I don’t want to be held accountable for the dates.     In case Malusi comes and says at that date I was not because I am not sure about that.     Say that again?     He was the Minister of Finance.     Yes.    I know at some point, I am not sure which day it was, then he said to me he was the head of elections.     I don’t remember meeting him for the first time?     I don’t remember exactly, but I know that it was in 2009.     Okay.    Yes it is correct.     Yes.     I think it was the – it was in 2010.    Yes.     Yes he did.     He gave me his card that he said I must use or if I want to go to the doctor or if I buy anything for the house.     Yes.     In Mandeni ...[indistinct].     He has two sisters.     Yes.     Yes.    Transnet in Jo’burg.     It is Nosipho.     Last time I know she worked for Sahara, I am not sure about the name properly but it was the company for the Guptas, the one in Midrand, the Sahara one.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.      That time as his advisors.      Advisors.     So there are times I will be confused when he talks about advisors, because sometimes he will be with Thami Msomi because he introduced Thami to me as a friend and an advisor but then later stage he will say I am going to see an advisor and then I already saw Thami thenI will ask who are the advisors, then he will ...[indistinct] them.     Not exactly.     Yes.     I think at that time Thami was the Chief of Staff at Home Affairs.     Can you please rephrase that?     Yes.     He told me that he will move to the Department of DPE and I asked him what is DPE because I didn’t know what is DPE at that time.    Malusi said he heard it from Ajay.     Ajay Gupta.     Yes.     Yes.     I think it was two to three months before he moved.     Not yet.     I don’t remember exactly how many times but what I know when he was at DPE he will go more often.     He was excited about it, that’s why I even asked what is DPE, so then he explained to me what is it.     Yes.    Yes.     Then he told me that his official, unofficial advisors, people who are advising him about certain decisions, about his work then he differentiate them from the advisors that he had at DPE which I know of them, which is his legal advisor and Thami Msomi as well.    Yes he told me.      It was the Guptas, Ajay and his brothers which I don’t know all of them by names, because I onlyhear from Ajay more than the other ones.     He said they were advising him about work, about things that he was supposed to do.     Yes.     I was not comfortable with that because we have a young child at home, which I don’t want to talk more about that, I don’t want to involve my kids on this.     Then he said he will introduce me to them so that I can be comfortable with them.     The reason is that he needs to – sort of I can understand when he is with them who are they.    Can you please repeat your question?   Most of the time he will go on Monday evenings or he would leave on Tuesday mornings.    Yes.    He will come back on Thursday evenings orFriday mornings.    Sometimes he will go before he flies to Cape Town or sometimes he will go when he comes back from Cape Town.    Yes.    He will go anytime.    What do you mean by that question could please ask the question again?    Oh because he will tell me.    Yes.    You mean the Gupta’s?   Oh when our son was born.    When our first son was born.    It was in 2011.    Yes.    Because Ajay wanted to meet our son so he told me like a few times that he wants to meet our son.    Not on the first time he told me but eventuallyI agreed after a certain time.    Yes I went there.    Ajay, his wife, her son ja.    It was not a meeting it was a visit.    He greeted me, my son we spoke but it was like a – any visit that you will have when you visit someone you welcome them.  But it was not a formal meeting.    Yes.    Ajay gave – Ajay gave my son a necklace but Malusi took it so he never had it.  He never used it.    Okay I am saying Ajay gave him a necklace which Malusi took it then he kept it.  So he never ever gaveit to my son.    It was a gold necklace.    In terms of visiting or in terms of (talking over one another)    Yes we did go visit.    Sometimes he will go with me, sometimes he will go with his protectors.    We would go often but not every day or weekly.  It will depend on him.    Yes.    Yes.   2012.    Yes he wa.    Yes.   Not then but we went after a few months was gone.    They wanted to meet my second born.    They wanted – they wanted to meet my second born.    Yes I did.    And the question again.    Yes I did.    I only went before the wedding.    It was the day before.    I do not remember because I do not remember what day was their wedding but it was a day before the wedding.    Malusi asked me to accompany him to go welcome the Gupta family at Waterkloof Airforce.    What did I do?    I went there with him.  We waited for them so – but I sat inside the airport with my – with my son so hewent out to fetch them.    Yes.    Welcome the …    Yes.    Yes.    Not sons we only took the older one.    Yes.    Yes to the wedding.    I prefer to – to repeat as I repeated again when I was raising the concern about it.  I prefer to say it in my own words because what I saw.   Sorry.    We only went once at the airport at the Waterkloof Airforce it was the day before in the evening when the Gupta aircraft landed.  Then I stayed inside the airport in that room and then Malusi went out to fetch them.  Then after that all the members were escorted to the cars and then we were taken by our protectors to go to our car. So when we left the airport we went home and then I saw a lot of blue lights escorting the members of he Gupta’s when they were leaving at the airport.  So we did not go again because here somewhere it mentions like we went there twice which we were never there twice.  It was the daybefore then on the day of the wedding I was at work and Malusi called me that we have to go to the wedding and I was shocked why – I cannot just attend a wedding like that because I wanted to do my hair, I needed to buy some things but he said we need to go someone else to go to the wedding and then I had to leave work and then we home and we packed we went to the wedding.    But it was not something was planned to go to the wedding according to my knowledge.   Yes we –     Okay.    I was saying yes we met but it was a lot of them.   It was a lot of them.    But I was not familiar with them because most of them they were coming from India.    When we at the wedding so a lot of ladies were doing something called Henna it was like a design that they do it in the hand and I asked to join to do it as well. And then later because it was my first time doing it I posted it on my facebook and then I think it was later at night Malusi told me because we were supposed to sleep there because they booked for us. So Malusi told me that we need to go home we cannot sleep and because there were already something on the media that we attended the wedding and that Malusi was complaining that that is why he did not even want to attend the wedding so we need to go home. So then after that he said I need to delete someone called him.  So I do not know who called him to tell me that I must delete the picture that I posted on the wedding of that Henna design.  So I went on my facebook I deleted it.  So the following day I wanted to remove it but I did not even know that it does not – can be removed so it was – I think it stayed there for the whole week but I deleted on facebook.   Yes we did.    We will go maybe during the week or weekend it will depend.    So every time when you come in there is security which is our protectors.  So they will tell their protectors because there were a lot of protectors outside who will be there and they will tell them that we here and they will open.  And one of them will take us in the house and then someone will come and call – will go and call Ajay and then someone will come maybe offer us some drinks or something then later Ajay will come and talk to us.  Then mostly it was like that all the time.    Because we gave exhaustedly – so I am so tired.      Say that again.    Yes.    Then he will greet us.  If we are just there went there for a visit so we would sit with him – we talk but if it is a meeting he will come brief Malusi about something they will go in the meeting then I will stay in the room at the lounge.    No.  But sometimes I will go fetch my cell phone.    They always ask us to leave them at the – I think it is like a foyer and then we will go leave them there. And then later I will go take my phone when I am bored – if I am bored.    Say that again.    The only people I saw it was Ajay, his wife, his brother, his son, Thami Msomi and Siyabonga Mahlangu. They are the only people that I saw.    Say that again.    He was Malusi’s legal advisor.    They will be in the opposite room from the lounge.    Yes I did.    Because he said some of the information wasconfidential so we had to leave our phones. But it was not something was strange for him because most of the time when I call him his phone will be answered maybe when he is at work his phone will be answered by his PA or maybe when they are in the NEC they will leave – for him was their nature but for me I did not understand why must I leave my phone.    Yes.   No.  But I knew that they were inside because you can hear voices of people in the room and when Ajay will come and brief him I know that there will be people but I do not want to say who was there because I have never seen them.    Yes there were a lot of cars.    Cars similar to our cars which is like state cars.    Because of the blue lights at the front and I also the body guards because most of them they dress the same and the car they most similar.  It is either the – I do not know how to explain the nature of the cars but it is a bit similar most of the cars.    It was not discussing it was like briefs.    He was briefing him not like discussion.    So sometime he will brief him about the SAA or he will brief him about Transnet or he sets a meeting that they will talk about so that he is aware before he goes to the meeting.    Most of the time in Transnet it will be the people that Ajay feels like they need to be appointed or needto leave or maybe they are restricting and maybe they will just argue a little bit about it because Malusi had his own favourites of people and Ajay has his own favourites of people.    SAA most of the time they will – they will – when he is with Ajay they will be talking about the board so he will be asking him about the board or maybe Kalawe because there was a lot of discomfort between Malusi andthe chairperson of SAA. So sometimes they will discuss that.    That time Nomwabisi Kalawe was the CEO then Dudu Myeni was the chairperson and I think Malusi liked Nomwabisi Kalawe and Dudu did not like him and they will have those arguments most of the time.    Yes.    There was a time Mr Brian Dames was the CEO of Eskom and what I remember Malusi liked BrianDames and there was a certain time then the Gupta’s did not like him especially Ajay let me not say Gupta’s because it was most of the time it was Ajay and Ajay did not like him. So he will say Brain Dames needs to resign he was uncomfortable about certain things but he will be talking to him not to me and then Malusi liked Brian Dames.  I think even myself I liked him.    Yes.    He told me that the Gupta’s do not like him and he does not understand why they do not like him.  And I think they told him that there will be a new restructuring someone else will move to Eskom and then Brian Dames will leave but I did not know how the process is going to happen which a few months later it happened.    Hour to two hours but not more than that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    It was not a lot of meetings. I think Ajay only    Sorry.    Yes.    I only remember twice.    Mainly meetings but he it was the two of them in the meetings so I was not a part of the meetings but I saw him because I went to greet him.    So the way the house is structured there is an upstairs because when I said it was underground they questioned me. So let me not say it was underground it was a downstairs.  So all of us are staying upstairs and when you go down with the steps there is a room that is under which Malusi used as his study or meeting room – ja so Ajay was there.    I think that time there was this – there was some projects at Eskom it was called Kusile Projects.  I think that project was giving Malusi a lot of sleepless nights and then he was – then he said no Ajay was here to give him – they were discussing Eskom Kusile but he did not give me all the details about it.   I only remember Kusile Projects.    I only remember Kusile Projects.    It was a Ministerial staff.  So there is a staff of the department and there is a Minister of Staff. So Ministerof Staff it is people that he travels with wherever he - it is either he goes to Cape Town he comes back then the department.  But most of the time if it is a Minister of Staff maybe one person will come from the department maybe    Yes.    So they used to talk about maybe renewing contracts maybe Ajay will ask Malusi no there is a project needs to be renewed or maybe someone needs to sign a certain project but I do not know exactly who needs to sign it but they will talk about it.    Yes.    I said to people who were leading because you were not there to people who were leading this part I said to them I do not want to say exactly which year because I do not have my passport with me.  I remember there was a trip to India but I do not remember exactly when was it.  And then when the affidavit came it was written this year and I even mentioned to say okay that I do not want to beaccountable for the year exactly but I remember we went to India to Mumbai.    If he says so.    Because I do not have my passport because after – on that day we were talking about this I said to the commission team I will go check my passport at home sowhat I have done on my way when I was leaving where we had the meeting with the commission team I called his former PA then I asked her about my passport – the state passport because we do not keep those passports with us.  And then – because I wanted to know exactly when did we go then she said she is going to come back to me.  By the time I arrived at home because my passport was there before – when – before I left because I wanted to remember certain trips because we were travelling a lot because I had two separate passports.  I have the normal passports then we have the diplomat passports.  So when I got home on that day after calling his PA my passport was not there and my two kids passport was still there.      Yes.     I do not remember exactly but what I heard what Malusi was talking about.  They were talking about to meet some – what is it – the Gupta family members, some people who were working – who were going to assist inworking and the Mumbai trip because there was an airline that they used to talk about when he was at DPE.  So there were people who used to come working, their permits.  So most of the times they would talk about the permits of – from Gupta family.  So I do not know how that was facilitated because I remember when Malusi was saying it is not easy for him to go to India when it is not a state trip because everyone will question.  So, then – I do not know how it ended up, it was a state trip.       With his staff.     Yes.     Yes.     What I know about it.  It is - when he was still at DPE, they used to talk about the Mumbai Route that – I think it was South African Airlines that they need toconsole(?) and under(?) the route from Mumbai need to take over.  So they used to have a lot of discussions about that.  That is what I only can remember.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Yes.     Can I say something on that?     I think what ...[indistinct] is trying to highlight because if we corrected this because I raised these issues before even ...[indistinct] was given in my affidavit.  And when Malusi heard my affidavit, he was given my affidavit.  On their response on my affidavit they went for those errors and they were given an upper hand like it looks like I was lying.     A certain nature(?) [00    But if the Commission have listened when we were consulting because I raised those issues.     Because I think some of the things, when we wrote them they did not put it in my words and now when Malusi lawyers and himself responded to them, now they are just questioning most of all those errors because they know it did not happen like that because in the ...[indistinct] happened ...[intervenes]      ...that the fact remains but now the only part is the year(?) or what happened.  So now we have been choosing the words.    Because they know it is not exactly like that.     But if we have addressed those issues before we will not be faced by this.     And also, I will be comfortable to answer this question and hence I said I did not come to give my evidence the time when I was supposed to come because Idid not want to say things because they are written and then one day someone will hold me accountable to say I have said this and I did not say it.       So, because I think the way it is written ...[intervenes]      Things that she said.  And what they highlighted, all of them, which is the affidavit of     It is ...[intervenes]    Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Can you please repeat the question?     Yes?     About the TNA Breakfast?     The only thing I know at TNA they used to discussed who sits on which table.  Ja, that is what I know about them.     Yes.     Yes.     I remember when he said Brian Dames will leave at Eskom and then Brian Molefe will go to Eskom.  So I knew that it would happen and it happened.       Yes.     I think even Gama also.  I knew before he even – ja.  I mean, before ...[indistinct]     Yes.     Yes.     No, I do not remember.  What I know.  He was the Minister of DPE at that time.     Yes.     And it was during the time where they usedto host a lot of TNA Breakfasts meetings on SABC 2.     I am saying it was around the time they used to host a lot of TNA meetings at SABC 2 on – in live in the morning.     Yes.     Yes.     I do not remember exactly which time.     Yes.     Yes, I remember.     I think it was – there was a time he was – he had a position at Eskom – not at Eskom, sorry about that.  At Transnet.  And then he left but when he was appointed again.  So I do not which sector he was moving from, to another sector, then he told me that Gama will be appointed as a CEO.     Yes.     Because what I know.     Siyabonga was already at Transnet.     So he was - when he was appointed as the CEO, he was not arriving as a new person.     Yes, because I remember that.     Ja.     Of Transnet.     Yes, I only remember that last part of him because I was ...[intervenes]      ....because I was from with him in 2011 and ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Ja, it was – because during the time, Malusi was ...[intervenes]     He was ...[intervenes]      He was the DPE.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     I am not sure about the year.     Yes.     He was.     Yes.    Because we went in Cape Town.  So I do not – sometimes he needed to attended Eskom functions.     But Gama was not there but Brian Molefe was there.       So and I remember Malusi was still the Minister of ...[intervenes]      Yes.       But in this - I do not remember exactly about the years.     And I said that to the Commission that I am not sure about the years.     Because I was not keeping track of everything that he was doing.     Because - what happened is.  Let us say ...[indistinct].  I do not put times on certain issues.  What I wanted to highlight is, like, every time when something happens, he will say before.  So he will come and say it. And when I or giving my consultation, I said I do not want to put exact times with what he was talking about.  What I wanted to highlight is, like, each and all those times when they were appointed we knew before because he will tell me about it maybe two or three months before that so and so will go to this one or this one will move.  Some he will be sad about it.  Some because there is nothing you can do.  So it was those kind of subjects.  So I knew that Mr Gama will be brought back to the position.  He was just like I do not know him.  [Speaker not clear]  But I knew also about – also Brian, that Brian will move to Eskom before he was appointed to Eskom.     Yes?    I think maybe the mistake is there.     Because I do not remember exactly what he was – what position he was holding.  But I know that – at some point when Malusi was at DPE, Siyabonga was in aposition that he was appointed.     And he  – because he said that at home(?).     Then I said – what I do not know because I was not keeping tracks of their movements.     Because I was not tracking this one is doing this and this.     But I knew that at some point.  Because if I remember correctly, when Siyabonga was appointed in that position, there was like a little(?) bit of a noise.  I think it was in the media about him moving and he needs to come back.    So and then Siyabonga, Mahlangu and Malusi they had some discussion at home, talking about it that Siyabonga must come back.     Yes.     Because I do not know his position properly.     Because I have never done that research.     That is ...[intervenes]      ...what I do not know.     Yes.     ...was still DPE.     Yes, I remember that.    Yes.     Yes.     That is what I am talking about.     Yes.     Yes, that is what I was talking about.     Yes, that is what I was talking about.     Yes.     Because that time I remember Malusi was at DPE.     No.  Gama has never been at my home.    But we – we are like – they were like friends of some sorts because ...[intervenes]      ...Athol called.  We attended the wedding. I think it was his daughter ’s wedding.  And also, they were close.     Ja, they were close.     So as I remember, Malusi would talk – will have that kind of discussion with Siyabonga, Mahlangu.  He would discuss how they need to assist Siyabonga Gama to come back.     Because there was some business(?) still that happens.     So I remember that.  Those discussions.  It is just like I was not part of them but I remember them.     It was him and Msomi, Thami.  Thami Msomi.  They were talking.      Yes, but Gama was not in the meeting.     Yes.     No, it was a meeting.  It was Thami Msomi and Malusi, they were talking about that.     And then later, Malusi was telling me because I think he did not like how Siyabonga Gama wasdismissed.  I think.     Yes.     Yes.     Can you please say that again?     I have a little knowledge about it.  What I know is, when Gogotso(?) Malusi at SAPI(?), they want him to take the package because he was very sick and then     Okay.  So what I know.  Gugu was working in KZN at SAPI.     But just because he was often very sick atwork.  So SAPI offered her(?) the boarding package.  So Malusi said no she must take it and she must move to Joburg to stay with us.  So which she came to stay with us.  And he explained to me that his sister has come to stay with us but he will speak to Siyabonga Gama to find her a job at Transnet.  Then once he finds a job, he(?) will leave our home and find his(?) place to stay and that happened.     Yes.     He mentioned that to me.     There were times where Malusi will have his own diary from his department and then while he is sitting at home maybe he will say Ajay is calling him.  He needs to go.  Or he will have to leave the department.  So he will     Ja, a lot of times because it will – most of the calls they will make him uncomfortable.  It is either when maybe he talks to Dudu Myeni.  Maybe they are discussing SAA and then after that he will talk to me and say he is not okay because I think it was more of he wanted me to give him support.  And also, there are certain people that he – he really enjoyed to work with them.  Andthen he felt the Guptas, they also want to change things around and he was comfortable with those people.       Can you please repeat that?     Oh, I asked him that because I felt like – because these people are stressing him.  So why do you not just cut communication with them?  So he said he cannot.      I do not remember.     No.     Yes.     Firstly, I noticed every time when they will talk about ...[indistinct].  Malusi, he did not like those.  And also I remember when they were talking about ...[indistinct].  He really did not like ...[indistinct] to be removed.  And I remember at the time it was more when they talk about – because he has called Dudu Myeni – in the beginning they used to be very friendly and later when he was at the DPE they used to argue a lot about the board and the decisions of the board and also how SAA is operating.  So Malusi was very uncomfortable how – I think she – he felt that Dudu was just in everything.  He wanted to be hands on where he is not supposed to be hands on.  So it was more of that most of the time.      I think it was at the later stage where these calls because knew that he will tell him something that is going to upset him or he will tell him something about acertain individual that needs to  be moved, because every time when there is someone, AJ wants him to be appointed, he would just put pressure on him and Malusi would hate that. So and at some point, sometimes he would, then he would [indistinct]    I only remember one instance where AJ said Malusi must remember why he was appointed as a minister.      He said he needs to remember why he was appointed as a minister.      Public enterprises.    Malusi told me.     Yes, but I was there when he was talking to him on the phone.  But also he told me.     Yes.     There is nothing wrong.     Yes.     I think when he was appointed in the beginning at DPE, they were close.  They were like a sister and a brother.  Although they were colleagues as well.      Well, let me say a honeymoon, because it was not the exact honeymoon, and I raised that on the consultation.    Yes.     Yes.     So he arranged the whole trip for us.  They booked for us to go to Mauritius.  We went to meet him, meet her at the Sheraton Hotel.  Then she sent us the whole itinerary about travelling and I remember when we were in Mauritius we were stuck, because I think [indistinct  was not so familiar with travelling by himself. So when we were there we did not know where to pick up the car, what happened.  So we were calling her when we were there because she is the one who arranged the trip.  So he did that because he said he wanted him to go to rest, because while we were arranging my wedding, Malusi was not part of the wedding arrangements becausehe was working, and if I remember properly, that time Malusi was the head of elections. So he was forever out with the door to door, doing the preparations of the elections and also give us the time we were preparing for our wedding.     Dudu paid for it.  Malusi told me that he paid for it, but what I remember she is the one who gave us the whole artillery, our flights and when we get there, where we must sleep.  Who must we call, who needs to pick us upat the airport and everything.     At Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria.     But sometimes she would come at home.     There was sometimes she would come at our home.     Ja.    Yes.     They used to, because they started and they had a sisterly and a brotherly relationship and also as colleagues, but then it became sour when Dudu used to tell Malusi that you need to do a certain thing, and Malusi will be like he does not want Dudu to tell her the kind of job that he needs to do. Also I remember on the Monalusi and Galawaya saga, Dudu did not like Monalusi and Malusi did and also Malusi was not happy when Dudu was interfering with the board decisions.  So he will call her and say like why sheis always involved in things. I remember they will have like a lot of arguments.  Then Dudu will be like Malusi will go back to, he will be taken back to Home Affairs and Malusi is like no one will take me back to Home Affairs.  So they will just fight about that and Malusi or sometimes he will come and say the president said you need to do this, and then Malusi was like president, if you want to tell me something, he will come to me.  He must not go to you and tell me something. So they had that kind of a relationship where it became, they did not want to meet, because I remember there was a certain time where Malusi did not want to talk to her anymore, but it was more of how she runs SAA.  Malusi felt like he was not supposed to be appointed as theChairperson of SAA. He felt like he did not know how to do the job.  Sometimes he interferes.  So they had that kind of a strained relationship.  But in the beginning they were very close.     Yes.     It was their topic, because I think Malusi was not interested in this thing of Mumbai route, SAA has to be cancelled, but it was a business thing and then he would say they will discuss it with Malusi and every time they talk about that, Malusi will be very angry like why he is telling her what to do. Why she is interfering because sometimes he would just switch off the phone and he will tell me like I do not know why she was just appointed.  So every time Malusi used to question why he was holding the position of the new Chairperson because he felt like he was just interfering everywhere.     That is 37 point what?    Oh, okay.      Okay.    Yes.     That is what I already mentioned before.     It is what I have already mentioned before.     Yes.     He said that to me, not to her.     Can you please ask the question again?    Malusi felt like that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    What do you want me to do about 38?    He said if he does not want to do something, he will be taken back to Home Affairs.     Yes.     Yes.     The same thing that you just said.     Yes.     They both said it, yes.     Yes, I am sure.     I did not assist with the dates, I think the commission put the dates.     But I said Malusi was taken back.  I remember when he was taken back.     Remember, all those dates are the datesthey were not put by me.     They were put by the commission.    Yes.     Yes, I do.   Yes, he moved back.    No.    Because he had a very close relationship with the president.     He was shocked and also I think he was hurt.     In terms of?    He said he told him that he will be taken back to, you need to go back to Home Affairs.     He said he need to tighten the boarders at the Home Affairs.     He thought he was taken back because he was already threatened that he will be taken back.  So he thought [indistinct but the president did not say those words.     I am not supposed to talk about this, because I never work at the department.  So what I will say is [indistinct].  So I am not comfortable with ...[intervenes]    I am saying I am not comfortable to talk about the application citizenship of the Guptas, because I have never worked for the department.     So maybe you will ask something, then he will respond to that because most of everything I have said here, is the questions that ... the questions that I was asked on the consultation.  Then I will respond to what Iknow.     Based on the questions [indistinct].    Ja, because I do not want to say certain things because they are here and I do not want to say those words because I do not want to be accountable for a certain yes, because most of the information that is pertained, the commission summarised.  Maybe it is their own interpretation and I do not want to be part of that.     Yes, that is what I meant.    Okay.  So what I said to him, I am not comfortable to answer this part because there is a year that is mentioned, which I never I do not talk about years,because I never kept the years recording everything what happened.     And also even the summary at the end.     Okay, because what makes me comfortable is if I said something, because part of the paragraph, there is something that I say.  But now the way that it is summarised ...[intervenes]     It has so much of the information that hasgot nothing to do with me.     Especially 44.  It is something that was collected by the commission.    And it makes it difficult for me to be held accountable for the whole paragraph and to select certain parts.  So I wish they have put my words ...[intervenes]     I will not remember a long part of it, that he said he was assisting them.    But I just want to express myself on the publically [indistinct] because I do not want to go in terms of what happens in the department because I have never worked for the department.  So I do not want to use a certain word and then when the department comes back hesays no we never done that.     Because I have never worked for the Department of Home Affairs.     And here it is already, the answer is broad.  This whole information it is not my words.     It is you that commissioner to that, not me.     I never done any investigation about what public says about him.  Everything that is given here it is what I heard from him, it is what I have seen, but I did not go do an investigation when happened when and how the public views him.    And that what Malusi was challenging on hisaffidavit.     Yes.     Ja, but you are making my life so difficult, because I so wish you did not mix my words because now I have to select what is my words out of that whole paragraph, because all this it is what you know of him.  It is the investigation that you have done.  It is what the public think of him and then now I have to find myself in between and that is the reason I said I do not want to come to the commission before everything is corrected because now I have to tick pieces and pieces of what I said.     Yes.     That is what yes, we propose.    In my own words.    So that I can say what I have seen and what I know.     Because I do not want to agree with the statement that has got nothing to do with me.     That is the thing that I did not want to do, and I do not want you to force me to do it, because when you force me to do it now, I have to look and try to select.     And I did not want to do that.  I preferred, that is what I propose to my lawyers and to thecommission.  I preferred to stick to my words, so that I can give the information what I know.     Because now it is to select the bits and pieces ...[intervenes]     That is difficult because some here, on 43 I know what I have said.     And now ...[intervenes]     And now it is mixed with the whole overall of the investigation of the commission.    Yes.     Okay.    Okay.    Also can I say something on that?    When it comes to the signing of the affidavit,  because I remember on our last consultation one of the evidence leaders were saying but you signed it.  So when it came to this, and me signing it, it was a day because during those days when we were about to wrap up this, there were a lot of threats, people threatening me about coming here and I was receiving a lot of calls. I felt like my life was so threatened.  So it was more of the security concern, so on that day we were signing this, it was the day we received the news that there was someone, they tried to kill someone or something.  So when Paul gave the affidavit to my senior counsel, so then he was like we only have ten minutes. We need to sign it quickly.  I do not want it on me because these people, what if these people they you know,because we were so scared to have the affidavit within us, because the media was calling me, wanted the affidavit.  Certain people, they wanted the affidavit from me and I did not have it. So when I was answering people, telling them especially the media to say I do not have the affidavit and I was not lying.  I did not have my affidavit with me, and that is what we proposed with the evidence leader.  That I do not want to have it, because I felt like having this affidavit will put my life more in danger, because a lot of peoplewanted my affidavit and my life was so under threat during the time. So when on the day we were signing it, we were only given certain few minutes.  So we sign it quickly and then the senior counsel went to drop it off to the evidence leader, but it was the nature of both of us we were so scared of our lives. Myself, I was scared of my life and I raised that and we were discussing the security, the threat.  How I am going to be protected which I was not protected by the commission and it promised to protect me.  So every time when now they are saying I signed it, I did not sign it in my comfort.I sign it under pressure.  We did not go through it because of there was that on that day.    Okay.    Okay.     Yes.     Because he told me.      We were in Cape Town.     Yes.     Yes.     He told me that [indistinct].   So he told me about his appointment as the Minister of Finance.      He was not.     What he mentioned, he said he knows that he was not the person which, for him to be a Minister of Finance.     He said he knew that he was not the person which to be, for him to be a Minister of Finance.     Yes.    He said he wanted [indistinct].    Can you please repeat the question?    After when he was at finance.     Oh, okay.    Their relationship was not good by that time.     Yes.     They give him that car as a gift.     They gave him that car as a gift.     Guptas, AJ.    Because he went to collect it.   At Sahara.     Yes.     Yes, I did.    Yes.     Yes.      Say that again?    It was white.    Yes.     Yes.     But I am not sure it was new new or it wassecond hand, but it was new.     Yes, they did at some stage.     Yes.     He gave it to, we took it to his friend to fix the lights.  It never came back.       It was his – again that time - I am the one who was using the car.     I am the one who was using the car.     It was a gift to him.    It was a gift to him.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     It never came back, ja.     I took it there.     I kept on asking about it until I decided to buy myself a car.     Both.     Yes.     It is a friend.     Yes.     He said he will take it somewhere so that they fix the light for me.     Yes.    So he kept on telling me that when I come back, so at a certain stage I went to buy a car.     Yes.     I stopped asking him about it, so I decided to buy a car for myself.    I do not want to say exactly the year but I can check.     I do not remember the position but it was I think around 2015, there.     Ja, but I am not sure but I can check because at certain point the car was under my name.     We invited a lot of people but I did not have an access to invite Guptas or the President.     I did not have an access to invite the President or Guptas so Malusi was inviting his friends, I was inviting my friends.  He was inviting his family, I was inviting my family.     Yes, they did not attend.     Yes, they were invited but they did not come.     Yes, he did attend.     Not me, but Malusi said he did.     There was a certain time when he told – because we knew about the Guptas prior the wedding that they were not coming, only President Zuma I think two days before the wedding that they were not coming.  So they gave him – so he said they will give him money as a gift as a compensation of their attending the wedding.     Say that again?     Ajay did.    No, I do not know.     Because he told me when someone pays.     Malusi told me.     Yes.     I do not know.     Yes.     I think we were there for a week.    I think it was a hotel called Waldorf.     Yes.     Yes but I have to check exactly the name but I think it is something like that.     It was 4 million to 5 million.     It is me.     I always paid them cash.     He gave me because he was busy with his work.     Because that time it was during elections so he was busy with the work, so I was dealing with the wedding arrangements.     It was not even on the consultation I raisedthat, it was not like he came to me with 4 million, said here is 4 million, 65 million, it was not like that.     So my wedding was planned from 2013 because I wanted to get married on my birthday which is in April 2014 and then it was not approved by parliament because that time it was during elections, most of the government ministers were busy so then we have to move the wedding date to Malusi’s birthday so it took like almost three years, so the payments were happening like that, it was not like there was a 4 million or 5 million came at once.     Because all the …[intervenes]     It is the estimation, not like a specific figure.     No, it was not I was using the money that is available it was because of the – each and every personwho was part of the wedding preparation, like the caterer, they will send me their bill, flowers, people were preparing because my wedding was in Durban.  So each and every person – and my wedding happened two days, so it was not only for the white wedding, it was two weddings because it happened in two days.     So prepared two weddings at the same time.     So it was like two caterers, one for the white wedding, one for the traditional wedding.     So it was like that, this venue and thatvenue, this tent and that tent.       So it was like in bits and pieces, not like we have a million, have never had a million at hand but it was more of maybe the caterer for the white wedding will send like 600 000, then they want a deposit then maybe I will go pay a certain amount and this one is for the venue at a certain -, so it was more of bits and pieces through the entire whole year and year and a half.     Yes, I paid cash.     The one that I remember was paid in cash.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     As I mentioned on the – unfortunately you were not there, so I did not find it strange because Malusi has been a minister for a very long time and also he toldme that he has savings with this money market that he saved monies from and most of the expenses we do not pay for them because it is paid by the state so most of the time his salary and my salary, we were using it to pay our stuff.  So to have a lot of cash, it was not something that was strange to me.     When you say large you are talking about how much?     But I never said he walked around with R5 million at once.     Ja, adding up to that, it is in bits in piece in a year and a half so if you break it down that – it is not that large.  It can be large to you but it was not large tohim and maybe to us, as a family because of how our expenses, we spend them because maybe the way you are just comparing, you are comparing by maybe a certain individual who have a salary and that salary, you have to pay for everything.  So our life was different from that.  So he has his salary, I have my salary and we hardly paid for anything in the house.     Because most of the time, every January heused to take the money that he is paid for the whole year from his  - what is this thing, market something, so …[intervenes]     Ja, his money market because he used to pay for his – school fees was cash because he would say I save the money for the whole year, so he does that.  So sometimes he will sit with his financial adviser about his money.  Then end of the year or beginning of the year he will take out the money and then he will use his ownthings.  So when there is extra money – so I do not know this one was coming from where it was, was it from him or from  - but – because I found it like that, so…     Ja.     Because to me what people do, will be shocked that oh, you have kind of money, for me it was normal.     Maybe 50 000, 100 000, for me it was normal.     But maybe to other people it was not.     Yes.     I do not want to mention his name.     Can you please repeat the question?    I never(?) see collection of cash at the Gupta residence.     So I can say what I saw?     Sorry, on the cash?     I think you have to ask the question in adifferent way.     Because I do not want to give the whole thing that you do not need.     Yes.     Yes.    Well, sometimes he will ask his bodyguards to bring the bag.     He will ask his bodyguards to bring the bag from the car.     Yes.     Yes.     What is CPO?     Oh, okay.     It looked like this was happening all the time, but the times that I remember.  So sometimes he will go in, in that room, and then when he will have tea he will leave with the bag, go to the room, but not like I saw the money.     He had two big ones then one small one.     Yes.     Just give me a second?  Sorry, repeat the question?     That A, that leather bag, is more [indistinct] bag.     The A, C and D because he had two bags like this, that were different.     It is A and D, the small bag and the big bag but now when you look at D, it is the brown bag.  He has the brown bag.     He also have a black bag of a similar nature and also A and B is something similar, which he has a bag like that but it is one bag, but yes.     Okay.    The one goes in the boot, C and D.     C and D is the one that goes in the boot.     Say that again?    Yes.     The big bag, is from C and D.     And that is what I said because you guys, you asked this for a lot times at the consultation and I said the same thing and I am saying it again.     C and D, either it is those two bags, so I do not want to say only this bag because he has a black one.     Sometimes he will carry this.  Also at D, it is a brown bag, he has this bag, similarly, Chair.  So sometimes he will take this back, he goes to the boot, he goes in with it but now A and B is the small bag that he always has with him.     Yes.     Yes.     It was not all the time I saw what is in the bag but once we were in Sandton then I saw what was in the bag.     Yes.     What do you mean when?     Sometimes we leave from [indistinct – dropping voice] or sometimes we will just leave from home.     Ja.     So there was this one time then he opened the boot, then he got the money and he put it on this small bag, the small one that he carries it around his shoulder.     He always carries bag.     He will go to the shop, the HTK shop.     HTK.     Then they will give him clothes or suits,then he will …[intervenes]     Sorry?     Say that again?     Yes.     Once in a while he go [indistinct], it was notoften.     Yes he did that once in Sandton.     So most of the time he will give the money of the protectors.    Yes.     Yes because when he got to the shop he never take the money and give it to them.  So he will take the money and give it to the protector and then he will go the restaurant, so the protector is the one who has paid.     He will take it from his bag.  So the other time he took him from the bigger bag, then he put on the smaller bag.     And then he will give to the protector to pay.    So I did not say on several occasionsbecause several means many times, which I never said that.     So I saw him once in Sandton and the other time I saw the money it was at home which the instance that I mentioned here somewhere.     Yes.     Yes.     C and D.     Yes.     Then he will transfer the money to a smaller one which is A and B.     Yes.     Say that again?     Yes.     I think it was a bag.     We never shopped together, like do my shopping [indistinct – dropping voice].  Because even with him he never go around do shopping at Sandton, so when he used to go to that certain shop they used to put the clothes aside for him.  So what he will go to – when he gets there he will just fit the clothes.  If they fit him he will take them and then maybe he will send the bodyguards to pay later or if they do not fit he will just give them – their tailor will fixthem for him, so he never goes around and do shopping.      Yes.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, say that again?  I am sorry, sorry, repeat?     Yes.     Yes.     I am saying that on the basis of – it was thesame bag that [indistinct – dropping voice].     It was the same bag that the protector took aside.     When he called him, he got it in and he took it outside and when we got to Sandton he went with a similar bag then he took money – and when he opened the boot, it was me and the bodyguards and when he opened, so all of us were just shocked because it was me and the bodyguard.    Yes.     Ja.     The bag was in the boot.     Yes.     Yes.     He took out the money.     And he put it in the...[intervene]      Yes.     No, I do not want to assume.     I do not know what was the limit, what I know is he said I must not use it up to a specific amount, so I do not know what was the limit.     That I must not use it up to 100 000,00.     Yes, but I never use it even closer to that.     Ja, when I got to overseas, he will give me money to buy stuff.     Sometimes 100 or 150 because overseas is expensive and I never stay there for like normally just travelled to overseas for one day.  So I need to be able to spend money for a whole week when I am there.     Most of the time I would travel alone without him.     Yes.     Yeah, because sometimes I will use the cash and also I will use my own card as well from work.     No.      Because - when I am with him or when I am alone?     No, when we together he never wants to do shopping because also he is not that kind of a person whojust walks around the mall.  So if we leave home we would just go to the restaurant or he goes and purchase clothes.  So he said, he does not want to walk around and do shopping because he is a public servant and also he does not want to walk around with cash, so when I will do that, I will do that when I am alone not with him.      What must I talk about?     Oh, okay we went to Saxon.     Yes.     It was the same bags that he takes in andout when he is there.     Yes.     Yes.     He will put them in the study.     Sometimes.     Yes.     I saw him packing money.     Into the safe.     I was shocked.     Because he was just packing a lot of money from the bag.     He said he got it from Ajay.     It is me who asked him what it was for.     He said it was for the elections because at that time he was the head of elections.     Yes.     Yes.     I was not part of the meeting, I only asked him when we were on the way back t0 Joburg.     He said his father asked him to assist to pay the credit bureau money that was owing on the credit bureau.      Yes.    Yes.     So he told me that she was owing 850 000,00.     Yes, he agreed but it was, I asked him likewhere he is going to get that kind of a money.      I asked him where he is going to get that kind of money.    He said he will go raise it with – he will go ask Ajay and he will go raise it for his sister.     Yes.     Say that again?     Ja, a few weeks later he told me that they will give him half, not all of it at once.     Yes.     He said to me, he spoke to SiyabongaMahlangu then he will assist his sister to clear her name on credit bureau and he will go collect the money from Ajay.     Yes, because they said it was a better process to clear her name.    Yes, she worked there.     It is in Mandeni.      Where are you, on 61?     Okay, what is the question? ADV MYBURGH     It was a renovation an extension and extension of the house.    He was the DPE at the time.     It was his brother in law.    It is him.     Malusi did.     So most of the time he will pay them cash and there was a certain time, he said he will go take themoney from Ajay and then you will fly to KZN so that time he flew there alone.     Yes.     Sometimes.     Maybe two or three times.     Yes.     I do not like that part although it is not you but it is before the Commission so – it is not every time I will see that, I only saw it one, it was a function and this – that was the second function that I attended because this was the first one, and that was the second. And then we were taking a tour around the house and all of a sudden we saw this cash counter, but I thought it was an ATM becauseI have never seen a case counter before.     When Ajay was demonstrating how it works?     So you just press - I do not know how the money was put in because I did not see when the money was put in but you just press maybe the amount of money then it takes the money out.  So that's the only thing I saw.     It was a lot of money but maybe 10 000,00 but not like, a lot of money in terms of like 100 000,00 or something because he was just demonstrating.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So he told me I must give him time becausehe was dealing with - because that time he was busy doing his affidavit to come to the Commission, and also he was busy with his PhD.  So he said I must give him time because right now he is not in a state of doing the divorce and the Commission and his PhD at the same time.     Yes.     Yes.     He came to my room, he asked me to give him my phones and my laptop, then I asked him why.     He said there was someone at home who was an IT expert who was at home to assist us to delete some information so I asked him why our information must be deleted.  I think on that day he didn’t explain a lot ofthings why and then there was a second time the person came then he asked for my information and then I refused to give him my gadgets so then he sat down he explained to me that the reason he wants my gadgets he wanted to get some information because he is about to wrap up his evidence, because of the Commission.  The problem why he wants my devices so then he made an example about when giving to the ...[indistinct] the time when there was that investigation about Brian Molefe so when Brian said he was at the Guptas, I don’t know if he said once or two times, and then the investigation showed that he was there so many times, so he used that example to me, he said he is about to wrap up his testimony, his evidence but now he already said he went to the Guptas two or three times, but now he is worried about my phone in case someone doesan investigation then they will see that we were there more than so many times, so I said to him why don’t you go to the Commission and tell the truth that you were there so many times, so he said he doesn’t want, then I refused to him my gadgets.     Yes.     Even trips that we took together and tripsthat I took by myself and the trips that we took with the State visits.     Say that again?     I am so tired, can please read it.     Yes.     This one I do not want to talk about it because it involves my kids, the domestic incident that happened, so for the safety of my kids I do not want to talk about it, but something happened on 18 t h of June.     Say that again?     I don’t understand the question.     No that was another incident.     Yes.     Ja, for the sake of my kids.     So last month when we were doing our consultation with the Commission team then because I wanted to be specific about dates because I don’t know the trips that we took when they happened, and also I don’t remember the personal trips and the State trips because I have two passports.  So my entire staying with him we were not allowed to keep our diplomatic passports so each and every trip when we go overseas the PA takes it and the Department keeps it for us, so we are only allowed to keep our personal passports.  So what happened, because the Commission were asking me about certain trips and I didn’t want to give dates from the head, I wanted to be specific based on how those trips happened, so what happened onthat day in the evening I called his former PA, then I asked her do you have our travelling history or do you know what is the process of me getting my passport from the department.  Then she said she has the whole history and she will call me in five minutes.At that time I was driving from Sandton.   Then when I was about to get to Pretoria then I called her that I am still waiting then she said, but her tone changed, because when I called her in the first place she was like oh no, I  have everything, I will go through the system now, Iwill send you everything and I can get you, I don’t remember who she said who will get my passport, because I don’t know who keeps it and she said I will get your passport right now.So then now 25 minutes later when I called her then she answered the phone she was like, then her tone already changed, she was like oh no, I don’t have the records, I cannot give you the passports, she doesn’t know how I am going to get my passports, but now she is the one who used to keep all my stuff and – but when I called before she said she has everything and she knows how I am going to get it, and then when I got home I was – let me just go on the personal one, because I made the copies in the morning on the day, then I forgot them when I was going to the Commission, so I wanted to balance with thetrips that I took with the State, with the trips that I took as personal trips and I wanted to put all of them.So I made copies in the morning and I put them in my passport.   I went to the Commission, so when I came back home after calling – because I was talking to the PA, so I was like I will call in the morning to check how to get, because now she was just totally blank.So when I got home my passport was not there, the copies were not there, so where I keep my passport it is closer to my bed, so it is my passport and my kidspassports, I keep them, all of them at the same place, so when I opened there I only found the cover of my passport, the pouch, then my passport was not there and my kids passport was not there as well, and then I was shocked, because they were there in the morning and I called someone – I called someone else who worked at Home Affairs, but he does not work there anymore, he was an official, then I asked him how do I get passports and the records, so then he told me the process, which I – he gave me an email of someone how do I get my trips from the immigration which I did, I wrote an email, because that’s  how he told me what to do, and I did that, but in the morning – so the same day I sent the message to the Commission then I was like I got home and my passport is not here and in the morning I met the caucus, and also Isent them the picture of the pouch and then I said I don’t have my passports anymore, can you please assist me to get the trips, because now I didn’t even know how do I get them.So then in the morning I sent an email to the Department, so they wanted – there is a lot of process for me to get past securities with it, but they said they will give me all the records from the immigration, so then after that I went to him, and I said Malusi where is my passport, because it was here yesterday and I have been keeping mypassport my whole life, so where is my passport.  So he said your passport, I didn’t see it, I was like okay where are the kids passports, he said I didn’t see them, then I was like that is very strange because passports were here, and I always keep them, so – but I am not saying I am saying a conclusion but what I think had happened, I think when I called the PA the PA called him, she told him, and that is why my passport was taken, so I only applied two weeks ago for a new one, so I haven’t go there to collect it, so where I am standing right now I don’t have my passport, and the one that, the diplomatic passport, I haven’t received the records but the Department said they can give me the whole trips, but I need to write a letter because there is a portion where they said I need to write a letter why they need to give me the trips, because I saidto them can they send them from 2009 to 2018, so I think anytime if I were to get them I will get them, so that is how my passport got lost.    That is not true at all.  It is not true at all.   It is true.  I can say what happened.    That is not true.    And then…    No I rather talk.    No I was saying I think it is only fair that she expresses herself Chairperson.    Yes.    About the – the changing of the leaders if youtook that decision.    So when Paul Pretorius was leading this whole consultation we took like three to four hours in a day preparing and we got comfortable with him leading it then he knows and he promised that he would be one – he will be the one who will be leading the evidence.  Then only two weeks    And most of the things he was not aware –okay there is errors here there was errors there because the team was aware of the errors.  And he was not aware because he was new to the team.  I only saw him once and I was so uncomfortable to come that he must come and lead my evidence because I did not prepare with him the entire preparation he was not there it was someone else.  So – and also my senior counsel did not even know as well when he was changed so both of us were shocked or – because he promised us that he is the one who will lead so why they changed and why were we not told.  That was one concern.So when it comes to the security every time I will tell Sikele here is this and there was not one point when Sikele was showing the threats what was happening even himself he was – he said to me this is so scary this is getting out of hand.  He is the man he was even scared himself.  Whatabout me as the woman? And then he said to me I will talk to the head of the security I will come back we need to do something and on that day he did not come back.  And then when we were having our second consultation then those issues were raised by my senior counsel and in the meeting all of us were so cool because they said no they explained how the security works and then I have to choose to be taken in a place of safety or they would – I will be given a security.  But they said each and every meeting so and so will contact you.So no-one has ever contacted me after the meeting. The last consultation where the threats were so bad and then – then they said oh he said the head of the security says show us the proof.  Then I took all the proof I show it to them.   And then what happened he – so the head of the security came to the meeting.  So they said we heard your concerns here is the head of security he will take care of your concerns because we can see – and I think they were    But the situation – I am very failed because I even said it that I felt like the commission did not protect me and I was cooperating with them and what I do not understand it was that day they said I did not appear on the commission I agreed on a Friday.  On that Friday I said everything.  They said to me when I land in Cape Town I will be taken somewhere to give my evidence.  Then I said I am not going to do that because the – how the commission islinking everything I do not want – because I have done everything to cooperate with the commission and the commission will say something and then they would never met everything that they promised me.  Or when it comes to this the leaking of my affidavit so the commission said to me everything is confidential.  Hence I did not even have time to read and read my affidavit a lot because we were not allowed to be – they said they cannot send this electronically – my affidavit because everything needs to be treated confidential.  And they promised me that there are a very few people in the commission who will have my affidavit.  So my senior – former senior counsel he did not know that my affidavit was shared with Ajay.  How it came about?  So I received a call from Sunday Times.  Sunday Times said to me we have your entire affidavit.  Then I was shockedbecause how can they have my entire affidavit when the commission said to me my affidavit would be treated with – confidential until I appear to the commission.  And then I called them and I was very angry I even called the former    Okay can I ask something?   So since you have heard all my concerns and also I think you are aware I have been cooperating with the commission and I feel for you to summon me it was a bit harsh because I just did not – not just come to the commission.  So now in terms of this summons where do we stand?    That is – now are you aware that I am not just did not come to the commission?    Well I am aware that you have certain concerns I think at that time it was said that you did have certain concerns but I think we – it was made clear eventhen I think I must have said that even if you had – you had concerns you needed to come to the commission and articulate your concerns here rather than say I am not going there because of whatever concerns.If you had come here and articulated your concerns then that would have been different.  Okay.  We – this is the longest session that we have had.  It is now about twelve minutes past eleven.  I think we need to adjourn and we do need to adjourn because although it is a public holiday tomorrow some of us will be working.  So the commission will be sitting tomorrow this is for the benefit of the public.  I will be hearing the evidence of Mr Mosebenzi Zwane former Minister of Mineral Resources tomorrow.So we – we will continue with evidence to try and finish our work within time.  I take this opportunity to thankeverybody for their cooperation for us to have been able to sit until this time.  Thank you to the staff and the technicians, thank you to you Mr Myburgh and your team.  Thank you to Ms Gigaba – thank you to her team for their cooperation.  Thank you very much to everybody for having cooperated so that we could sit late and finish Ms Gigaba’s evidence.  If her team wishes to re-examine arrangements can be made for the re-examination to happen at another date – another time but then they would have to communicate that.Thank you very much – we adjourn. 
QOFA:Because that is a concern for us ...[intervenes]  
GIGABA:Ja, sometimes Ajay will call him.  Sometimes he will take the calls, sometimes he will not take his calls.   
MR SOLOMON:  Okay.  
ADV OLDWAGE SC:  Chairperson, through you.  The witness is making it very clear that she does not intend to deal with the contents of paragraph 42, 43 and 44.  She says she does not intend to do so, because one the information there was provided to her by the commission.Secondly because she does not have personal knowledge of these facts.  Now referring her to this information for her to confirm, does not take cognisance of the fact that she is saying I am not comfortable, thatinformation is not within my personal knowledge.     Chair I apologise.     Once again, the witness is saying I do not know this information.    It was put by the ...[intervenes]     Chairperson, my objection was merely because the witness specifically said this information was put here by the commission and therefore Ido not have knowledge of that.    As the Chair pleases.     Chairperson, if I may?   I do need to indicate that my original concern was that as Ms Gigaba is being led on aspects of this affidavit, at a later stage she then furnishes an affidavit to try and explain this I did not say, this I did not say.The reason why this has been a concern is purely because at some point or the other, when we come to deal and I am just giving a simple example.  When we come to deal with paragraph 45 or 43 of this original affidavit, thequestion then becomes you agreed to certain aspects of it and now you are now refusing. Hence the concern Chairperson was that we try and we make the exercise simple for the commission.  Not only for the credibility and making sure that the proper information before this commission is exactly that which ...[intervenes]     Chairperson, as I had already submitted before, we raised concerns and Chairperson, one of the reasons why she feels it is critical that she explains the circumstances under which she signs this affidavit, we saw that this affidavit does not get placed on her.  Because she is specifically saying the contents of this affidavit contain information that is not mine.     As the Chair pleases.
