CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Ja.  No that is fine.    Okay.  Good morning Ms K are you there?  Ms K are you there?    Can you hear me?    Okay good morning.  The oath you took yesterday will continue to apply today you understand?    Okay thank you; you may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Oh okay.  No I apologise – I apologise.  There are many Counsel and I am not able to keep their names – all of them at the same time.  But thank you.    I am – we apologise for that error.      I am sorry Ms K did you say that somebody said the CDSO after Nazrec did not – was not allocated money or budget, is that what you said?    Please repeat what you said?    Yes, yes.    I am sorry …    When 00    I am sorry I –     Hang on Ms K.  You say the CDSO was closed in 2016 when something or somebody arrived.  I did not hear what you said would you repeat that?    Oh.    So the individuals you are talking about were they individuals who were members of CDIS or what unit were they members of?    So you were…    Yes.    Yes okay.    Okay.    Okay alright .  So this member said that I guess he or she and others in CDIS when they requested money for travelling or other such monies in order to do what they believed was their work they were not given or those requests were not approved and when they asked why they were told that it was because Mr Jacob Zuma was no longer President.  Is that what you were told?    Okay.  After the CDSO had been closed in 2016 may I find out whether its activities continued under some other unit or did they cease in regarding of the aeroplane, of the Presidential Aircraft?     Yes.     But now when these activities continued after the CDSO had been closed, under what unit were they being continued?  Do you know?     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.     [Indistinct]      I am sorry.  Ms K, I take it that you would not agree completely paragraph 6.1, particularly the first line insofar as it suggests that CDSO continued beyond 2016     Yes, but what I am suggesting to you is that. If you are correct in saying CDSO was closed down in 16, it cannot be correct to say in 2017/2018 CDSO continued to undertake projects.  It could be that after it was closed down it was individuals who used to fall under CDSO who continued those projects or another unit or office took over the activities of CDSO.  Would you agree with that?     Yes.     Yes, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.     When you say which took over the projects, you mean which took over the CDSO projects?     Okay let us get that clear.  Are you saying that this unit...  What did you call it?  Cover Unit?     Ja, the Cover Support Unit, as you say, was created.  Are you saying it took – it basically took over the work that was done by CDSO or are you saying over some of the projects that CDSO had been carry on or carrying out?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no.  I understand.  You are saying the CSU which means – which refers to the Cover Support Unit that you say was established after Mr Fraser’s arrival, took over some of the projects that had been under CDSO but you are not able to say he took over all of them.  Is that right?     Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.     Thank you Mr Pretorius.       That sentence Ms K, the sentence starting with the covert nature of the project... “The covert nature of the project is intended to protect identification of personnel, resources and intelligence gathering...” I am not sure I understand what it means but maybe you do.  I would ...[intervenes]      I would have thought that it is the activities that will be engaged that dictate whether the project should be a covert one or not and not that it will be the protection of the identities.  Do you understand what I am saying?     You did not hear me?     Okay.  I am saying.  I would have thought that what determines whether a project will be a covert one, would be the activities that will be undertaken rather than – the sentence seems to say, we have made this project, a covert project in order to protect the identities of personnel and so on.  Do I misunderstand how these things work?     Yes.     H’m.     Well, the reason why I am attracted to it because I do not understand what it says or I am not sure that I follow its reasoning.   And I am linking that with the point – with a point which maybe is a point that may be made from what you have said, namely that when they sought to establish the certain projects, the motivation would be very vague and so on.   And I wonder whether the motivation here might well reflect maybe a certain lack of understanding of certain issues.  But you said you also do not understand it.  Is that right?     H’m.  Do you struggle to hear me Ms K?     Ms K?     Do you struggle to hear me when I am speaking?     Oh.     Yes.  I am going to ask the technicians to try and do something about it and maybe during the tea break so that you can hear me clearly when I am speaking.  Thank you.  Continue Mr Pretorius      What page?     Of Bundle 1?     356?     Hang on, just for the record your first reference to democratic I heard you correctly Ms K, it should have been domestic environment in the second line of 1.2, so just for the transcribers, okay, continue Mr Pretorius.     Sorry Mr Pretorius I think we should take the tea break, it is just after quarter past.     We will take the tea break and we will resume at twenty to.     We adjourn.     Yes, you may proceed, Mr Pretorius.     Before you go to the next paragraph, Mr Pretorius.  Ms K, in the two letters that Mr Pretorius referred you to before the tea break which motivated for certain projects, I realise that although they were written prior to 2016 there is a reference or there are references to them to the cover support unit.  I may have been wrong, I thought that you were saying – you had said the cover support unit was established after Mr Faizal’s arrival in 16 but I may have been wrong.  I just want you to clarify. MS     So the CSU cover support unit existed before 2016 as a unit under …[intervenes]     Within CDSO, is that right?     And then you say when CDSO was closed in 2016 the support – the cover support unit was moved or retained but then it fell under the office of the Director General, is that right?     Yes but it was still referred as the CSU.     And, as far as you know, it was still doing the same – performing the same function as it had performed before 2016 or is that something you are not sure about?     Yes.     Okay, alright.     No, that is fine, that is fine.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius?     Yes?     Yes.  Were you not provided with the whole statement?  You were provided with …[intervenes]     With extracts.     That were deemed to refer to your client.     And these were not one of the – these were not some of them.     Oh, okay.     Mr Pretorius?     Okay, I think what Mr Pretorius is saying is that they will need to ascertain exactly what was sent and what was not sent.  In other words, they might not at this stage be able to say it is true, it was not sent and extend an apology but they will investigate and they will talk to you and at a certain stage I am sure I will be told what the position is.     Okay, but as I understand it, as you stand there you are not able to say one of those 3.3 notices that was sent, or one or more, included this paragraph.     Yes, ja.     Yes.     And I guess that counsel for Mr Mahlobo will accept that it would not have been a deliberate decision to say let us not show him this …[intervenes]      I would imagine that would have been an oversight, if indeed it was not sent.  But they will talk to you and at some stage I will be informed also as to what it was …[intervenes]     Hang on, hang on, hang on, I think counsel might still want to say something.     No, no, no, nobody has an issue with you placing it on record, I think.  It is just that he is not able to answer definitively.     And whether these particular paragraphs were sent as part of the 3.3 notice.  They will investigate and they will come back.     Yes.     Ja. ADV PRETORIUS     Ja, okay.     Yes but obviously the point is if these paragraphs were contained in 3.3 notices that relate to other notices, his point would be they were not notified that this witness, Mr Y, would also make the same …[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja, ja, ja.     Yes.  I think counsel wants to say something?     No, no, do not give suggestions about how we should resolve, they will sort it out.     It is going to waste our time.     Have you got something else or is it the same?  If it is the same thing please sit down, do not give us a …[intervenes] UNKNOWN     No, no, not on this one.  It is his matter and ja, we have dealt with it, he has no further complaints, you will wait for the process.     Well, if you raise a point about your client and not the same point about his client then you can raise [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]    Ja, what is your point about your client?     Which matter?  Which matter?     No, no, please sit down, let us proceed, let us proceed.  Mr Pretorius, continue.     Hang on, let me get there Mr Pretorius.  307?     Yes?     I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Do you have an idea how regularly you will be referring to SSA Bundle 01 will it be regular?     It will be, okay so I cannot say they must take it away.     Okay alright.     Okay, no that is alright.     I am sorry, paragraph 6.10 Ms K says on a conservative estimate, a total of R1billion was expended on these CDSO projects during the period 2012 to 2018.  Are you happy to be that conservative or would you put it the minimum higher than that?     Yes, that is per year or over the period?     Yes.     Yes, so I guess the answer to my question is that you would rather stay with that conservative estimate of R1Billion from 2012 to 1218.?     Okay, alright.     Okay, thank you.      Okay.     Ja.     We will just have to make sure, Mr Pretorius, that we are consistent how we refer to Bundle 1, otherwise, somebody's reading the transcript later will think it is a different document where it is a bundle, SSA Bundle 1, and what page?     Thank you.     Sorry Mr Pretorius, I think you might have to repeat that for quite some time the two of you are talking at the same time.     I think that transcribers will have a problem transcribing.      So maybe repeat that.     Ms K.     Ms K, if one were to go to motivations or projects done by other units within SSA, let us say the official structures, are you saying that we will find that there is much more information they would put in their own request for funding than was being done by the Special Operations Unit?       In other words, you cannot criticise these for not including enough information in their motivations if that is what the official structures in other units of SSA were doing, it was a practice, everybody was not putting in a lot of information in the letters maybe because of the sensitivity of the projects.  So, my question is, if we were to go to letters motivating for funding done by official structures or units of SSA, are we going to find that they normally provided much more information than these?     Let me repeat so that you can answer knowing exactly what the question is.  If we were to go to SSA and say give us motivation letters that are normally written by different units, official units of SAA, official structures whenever they request funding for projects, are we going to find that they normally provide more information than was being done by these units?     No, thank you.  I think, Mr Pretorius it would help if one got an idea as to how motivation letters are done by the official structures just so that we know whether these ones were not following what everyone does.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no, that is fine, you do your best and see what happens.  I get – I got the impression or I get the impression that the Acting DG wants to operate and help the Commission as much as possible but obviously he will not want to – and he should not act in breach of the law but …[intervenes]     Yes.     Well, the ones that I saw this morning, if those are the ones you are talking about, I was under the impression that they fall under either CDSO or some of the units that are said to have operated outside the normal structures of SSA.     So what I would very much like to see, if possible, is motivation letters that were done by official structures of SSA.     Ja.     Remember to look at the black numbers, Ms K, not the red numbers.     I am sorry, where is the second invoice that is for R8 million?     Okay, let get there.  272.     Oh yes, thank you.     I am sorry, Ms K, I thought you said dated 23 r d, I see 28.  Maybe you said 28 February 2015 at page 271.     Sorry?     Oh, you cannot hear me well again?     Okay, I am saying that I thought when you referred to the date that appears at page 271, I thought you said 23 February or 23 r d.  I seem to see 28 but I do not know, maybe you did say 28.  I just want to make …[intervenes]     Okay, I just wanted to make sure we are looking at the same document.     Okay, alright.     Hang on.  Did you understand that, Ms K?     Okay.  Before Mr Pretorius moves further, I just want to ask you this question.  You know when you look at these motivation letters, the last paragraph I think under Regulatory Compliance…     Seems always to point out to the person who is required to approve the – or to make the authorisation.  It always out that that person has got power under some ministerial delegation of powers and direction of payment to approve such an expense or something like that.  Now what it does not do, almost invariably, is to indicate what the requirements are that the approving authority should satisfy himself or herself about before he or she can approve.  Do you know whether the instruments to which these letters refers, the ministerial delegation of powers and direction of payment of 2013, for example, I am looking at the one at page 269, do you know whether there is prescribed requirements to say if before you can approve or authorise an expense for a project, this is what you must satisfy yourself about and the request must contain the following information so that we know whether such requirements were complied with or not.     Ja.     You think you need to be a lawyer to say bundle.  Bundle 1 is the one that we have going to whenever we needed to see these motivational letters.     The other one is think is bundle 2 that has got your affidavit and Mr Y’s affidavit.      Which one do you want us to go to?     Ja.     Ja, what page?     Look at the black numbers at the top left if you want to tell us what page.     Yes.     Oh, but apart from the limitation with regard to up to how much the maximum a particular person may approve.     Does it have any other requirements?     Does it prescribe any other requirements such as how much the person who must authorise must be told about how the money will be used?  In other words …[intervenes]     In other words, Ms K, you have been saying in regard to these motivation letters that they are vague and they do not have adequate information that should be included.     If the request were to be approved properly.     So my question is, is there somewhere where we can go where we will be told these are the requirements that a motivation letter should cover or that or let us say or the DG or Deputy DG to approve funds for a project, he or she must be satisfied, for example, that what they are going to be used for is a matter that falls within the mandate of SSA, what they are, the actual activities are lawful or something like that and that they will be – after the funds have been used, there will be a reconciliation to try to show how the funds were used.  Do you know whether there is an instrument that sets out like that so that we are able to say the official position at SSA is that if a leader of a project asks for the authorisation of funds for a project, this is what the motivation should disclose about the project and these ones did not meet that requirement or is it discretionary to the leader of a project as to how much they disclose in their motivation letter?     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     No, no, that is fine, thank you.  I think it is a convenient time to take the lunch break, Mr Pretorius.     We are at five past  one.  We are going to take the lunch break and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I am sorry.  We are starting a bit later.  There was some urgent matter that I needed to attend to.     Yes.  Okay.  Let us continue.     Ja.     No, that is fine.  That is fine.     Ja.     Well, while Mr Pretorius is conferring with a member of his team.  I note that in – at page 22, Ms K.  That it looks like the DG is not restricted to any amount when he enters things, a member of the Foreign Intelligent Service whereas other officials are restricted to R 100 000,0, R 30 000,00, R 20 000,00 and so on.  Am I understanding this document correctly?     Oh, so ...[intervenes]      At page 22.     Ja, can you see that?     Yes.     [laughs]  That is classified information Mr Pretorius.     [laughs]     [laughs]     [Indistinct] [Microphone muted]     Repeat that page, Mr Pretorius?       Just repeat the page number?     Yes.     I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Should there be an amendment here?     Whoever uses the pseudonym of Sharon [indistinct – dropping voice]     Ja.     Ja, okay.     Ja, that is fine.  It is just important that I want to see if what – whether I have the same document as you have.     So when you read something that is different from what I have, that is why I want to check.     Okay.     Mr Pretorius did you say my file has already been subdivided?     No, it is fine if it has not, I just wanted to make sure that I heard you correctly because I did not think it has been …[intervenes]     Well, does not look like.  I have got some pink dividers that have been put in but there is nothing written on them to indicate this is supposed to represent file 1 or what.     Yes and there are two of them and not three, so I do not know.     So that in writing is the motivation for the renewal and funding of cover project under Project Mayibuye in that letter date 20 July 2015.     In case it makes any difference, Mr Pretorius, where you said control of the judiciary, it says control over.     Ja, on the letter.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, this letter is annexure M4 according to what is written here and it is a letter date 20 July 2015, it has got State Security letterheads and does that indicate the same thing that you have or not?     Are you at page 380?     Oh, you were only given …[intervenes]     Oh, okay.     Yes, okay.     Ja, okay.     Okay, Mr Pretorius can address that.     Yes and …[intervenes]     Yes.  If – well, I do not know what the guiding principles were in terms of who was given what but maybe since it is declassified, maybe if one of your team members has got a spare copy they could give it to him.     Ja.     No, no, no, what you have raised seems to be a legitimate issue so …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, ja.  No, no, no, it is important that if there is something that relates to your client you should have it.  Mr Pretorius, I …[intervenes]     Yes.     Okay.     Well, the concern which he raised, and I think it is legitimate, is that he is sitting there but it is no use him sitting there if he cannot follow the evidence because he does not have certain documents.  That is the concern.  Should I adjourn for ten minutes to see …[intervenes]     Yes but the question is whether it can be given to him immediately or …[intervenes]     Okay.  Okay, so that will be given to him then.     Okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes but do not repeat the point, you have made the point.     You have made the point, ja.  They will give you a copy of the document.     Okay, alright, let us proceed.     Were you done with the document at page 380?     Oh, okay.     What page is M15?     Sorry, sorry please start afresh.     Well…[intervene]     Hang on. Just remind me what the question is which you are objecting?     Why do you not let him finish the question then we can address your concern if you do have any properly.      Yes, but I do not know what he wants to say.     No, no…[intervene]     No, let us just not proceed, you have withdrawn the objection…[intervene]     Mr Pretorius has made his points, let him continue.     Thank you.     No, that is true.      What is interviewing of, what is the interviewing of assets, what does that refer to?     That is on paragraph 6.40 last sentence, or second line from the bottom.  It is part of what that company…[intervene]    Hang on Ms K do not speak while I am speaking.      It is part of what that paragraph says the company mentioned there was paid for doing.  So I am asking what does that refer to, interviewing of assets? I have to ask because you said there was nothing wrong with what they were doing but SSA could do the same so maybe you know, what is.     No I know what assets are I want to find out what are they talking about when they say interviewing of assets.  Unless the word assets…[intervene]     …has a particular meaning within SSA. You did not know what this refers to?     Well, we have to keep, you have to remain alive for a situation where what some of this entities might have been paid for us doing things that nobody can explain. So we need to understand exactly what is that they do with taxpayer ’s money and whether it something.      Is that a yes?     Okay.     Ja.      ...[Indistinct – microphone faulty] let’s talk about the way forward ...[indistinct] sit longer ...[indistinct]       Yes.     Yes.     Yes, well obviously we want to use as much time as possible and if it means going beyond four o’clock I am happy to do that, but there is no point in doing that if tomorrow is unlikely and would not end up being used fully because certain issues have to be sorted out [indistinct – mic off] so if it looks like there is no ...[indistinct] sitting longer today ...[indistinct]       Subject to certain matters there may be a possibility from my side to sit for some hours on Saturdays if we need to use Saturdays and going forward I am of the view that there may be quite a few Saturdays that we might use because we need to use as much time as possible, but obviously sometimes ...[indistinct] for using a Saturday needs a bit more time, but I am mentioning that so that you can take that into account.     Yes, okay we will then adjourn now because it looks like tomorrow the witness will continue.   ...[Indistinct – mic off].   Okay we are going to adjourn for the day and we will start normal time tomorrow.     We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.  Our apologies for the late start.  We had to deal in chambers with a particular matter that required immediate attention.    And it will be dealt with again in due course.    Just to – I have been asked to place on housekeeping matter on record.  Chair yesterday Counsel for a witness addressed you and was referred to as Counsel for SSA that particular Counsel represented a witness who is unnamed but not SSA.    Thank you Chair.    Ms K you have before you your statement Exhibit YY9 and we had reached paragraph 5.16    Yes of Mr Y’s statement annexed to your statement.    If you go to paragraph…    Thank you.  If you go to paragraph 5.16 I do not intend to make you responsible for the maths    It continues to read   Okay thank you.      Alright.  Let us go then to paragraph 5.17.      The affidavit of Mr Y states   Alright.  And the last sentence    Yes and that has already been dealt with to a limited extent in other evidence and perhaps will be dealt with further. Under the head A shift in Intelligence Philosophy the affidavit of Mr Y continues in paragraph 5.18.  I will read the conclusion in 5.18 and then ask you to comment Ms K.   “In conclusion the constitution together with legislative and policy prescripts including the Presidential handbook clearly set out the mandates of the various security cluster stakeholders. The extension of the mandate of the SSA through internal reconfiguring of the CDSO and the external usurpation of the functions of the South African Military and Health Services and the SAPS – SAPS Presidential Protection Unit breached this architecture.  The irregular establishment and implementation of Presidential Security Support Services this Toxicology Unit and a Static Security Force for the protection of the Presidential aircraft disrupted the reporting lines for duly assigned functions and thereby undermined accountability.” Do you have a comment in relation to that Ms K?    Thank you.  Paragraph 5.9 reads   Thank you.  Then in 5.20 several further observations are made and again I will read them to you.   “The cost of this increase in security not only lies in the actual rand value expenditure but also the cost of weakened state functioning with the eroding of legitimate structures.  The duplication of services strained relations between stakeholders and inadvertently led to a paralysis of the legitimate functionaries whose responsibility the security of the President actually is.  This duplication also led to a disabling of legitimate SSA resources by under capacitating crucial functions within the Agency where the SSA does have a role to play in the protection of the President such as irregular – such as regular intelligence assessments these were functions that would ordinarily be carried out by legitimate SSA operational arms such as the Special Events Unit, Operational Support, the Chief Directorate Intelligence Management and the Foreign branch.” Do you have any comment on the observations made in that paragraph?    Do I understand it correctly in order to clarify not only did the SANDF and the SAPS have security functions and capacity for Protection Services of the nature that you have dealt with or have been dealt with but also the State Security Agency itself had units that could have dealt with some or all of these security functions that the CDSO dealt with?    Paragraph 5.21 makes a further and    What is an APP?    Thank you.  What is an APP?    Alright.  Of course if one looks at the deployment of the persons who were deployed for security purposes for the then President and others.  If their role was to defend and protect the comments made in paragraph 5.21 you say – well it may be argued are appropriate. But if they had another role what one might term an offensive or activist role would your comment be the same?    One understands the comments made in paragraph 5.21 where one assesses the functions of the CDSO in terms.    Defending or protecting the persons they were directed to defend or protect.  But is the role was different – if the role of those who were deployed under the CDSO was an offensive or aggressive or a different type of activist role would your comment be the same?    Alright.  Can we just confirm and I know it is very difficult for you because you are asked questions in relation to your confirmation of allegations but any additional allegations.    If we could leave those for your supplementary affidavit.  If we could just exercise some caution there.    But …    Perhaps we should confirmed that    It continues.    Thank you.  It continues   That is a fair comment insofar as the security cluster deals with a range of organisations or entities including SANDF, SAPS and the like.     Perhaps if ..    And I – what I understand you to say that if though security cluster was replaced by SSA you would have more comfort with that statement, am I correct?    Right thank you for that.    Thank you for that clarification.     Right.       Thank you, Chair.  Ms K, paragraph     Do you agree with it?     [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Yes.     I ...[intervenes]      I understand.  You are saying that the mandate is there.  It is in law.  It is in the policies and procedures.  It is what is done within the SSA that you would focus on it.  Do I understand you correctly?     Let us then move to a different topic and that is the particular operations of the CDSO that was the subject or that were the subject of the Veza Investigation.  Before we get to the particular topics, the affidavit deals with a number of a general matters and I will put these to you from paragraph 6.1 onwards.     Right.  And there follow in paragraph 6.2 ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.  Paragraph 6.2.       Do you wish to add anything Ms K?     Thank you, Chair.  Ms K, if we can go to paragraph 6.2.     Which contains at least four general observations about the CDSO’s operational activities.  These are general conclusions which will be detailed in due course.       Right.     Thank you.  6.2.2.2 reads    6.2. ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  I interrupted you.  You said Ms K?     6.2.3 reads    6.3.4 reads    Paragraph 6.3. reads    Paragraph 6.3.3 continues    Could I ask this in clarification of what is said here?  The real purpose of the project was that stated in the motivation always or sometimes or never?     Right.     Let us then deal with paragraph 6.4 which gives an example of what you are testifying about and what Mr Y has stated in the affidavit.       Annexure CO appears in SSA-01 at page 248.       On page 249 is a declassified document dated 12 December 2014.  What is this document?     Just go to paragraph 2.1 on that page.  Well, what is this document, firstly?     Alright.  I just – I do not want to go into too much detail but if you look at paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 which appear to contain the motivation for the establishment of the projects.     Those are general statements which deal with the Special Operations mandate or activities.  Do you see that?     In other words ...[intervenes]      Yes.     No, please answer.     There is no specific ...[intervenes]      Okay good.  There is no specific reference in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 to exactly what it is intended the project to do.  Is that correct?     And 2.1 and 2.2 are statements of a high-level and general nature.  Is that correct?     So in this motivation, do you see anywhere an explanation to those who are asked to approve the project to exactly what the project is going to do?  You have described what the project entailed?     Does that appear here?     Thank you, Chair.  In your answers to the Chair, Ms K.  You highlighted an aspect of the evidence of Mr Y and your comments in relation thereto, in relation to these motivations that we are dealing with now.  And you mentioned that, if you look at the motivation and you compare it to your knowledge of what the project actually entailed, there seems to be a gap.  Is that correct?     In other words.  Let me put the question in another way.     If you take into account what you learnt what Project Construção actually did, provided security to named individuals as the evidence has been.  Is that anywhere made clear in this motivation?     And by way of a further example.  If you go to page 356.       That is Annexure MO referred to in the paragraph.     356 Chair.     Bundle 1, yes.  Apologies Chair.    356.        That is a motivation for the establishment of a covert project and payment of expenses for Project Mayibuye.  Do you see that?     It is dated the 20t h of January 2015.  There are similar general ...[intervenes]      ...statements made in paragraph 2.1 and 2.2.  In part, word for word the same, in fact, as those in the previous document that we referred to in relation to Project Construção.  Do you see that?     Given what you know of the activities of Project Mayibuye.  Are these projects and the nature of these projects clearly set out in this motivation?     The detail of ...[intervenes]       Yes, in part it is the same, in part it is different, correct?        The detailed nature of the projects conducted under the Project Mayibuye is that set out or are those set out clearly in this motivation for the establishment of the project?      Do you know if ...[intervenes]         I’m sorry.     I’m sorry, I interrupted you, you said but in this case?     Yes, page 316 operational plan for Project Mayibuye, paragraph 1.2?     Yes, and it talks of intelligence gathering ...[intervenes]      Again the detailed nature of the project that was actually carried out under the head “Project Mayibuye” is that specified in this operational plan, let’s leave aside the motivation for a moment.      Yes thank you.       Well that observation ...[intervenes]        Right.      Thank you Chair.     Paragraph 6.5, Ms K.     Reads    Alright, thank you for that qualification.  The commentary continues in paragraph 6.5,     The last statement in paragraph     Paragraph 6.6 …[intervenes]     Paragraph 6.6, Ms K, reads    Alright.  Yes.  You have told the Chair that the investigations were informed by access to documentary information and evidence as well as what you were told by persons you interviewed, am I correct?     And the statement in the last – the penultimate and final sentences of paragraph 6.6, if you would look at page 30 of bundle SSA1 please?  Is that the document on which those statements in paragraph 6..6 or is that the documents which you rely on for making or the deponent relies on for making the statements in paragraph 6.6?     Annexure C and it is at page 30.     Yes, I do not want to go through the whole document but if you go over the page to page 31?     You see the table that appears in the middle of the page.  You will see under the sub    If we go then to paragraph 6.7, a general observation is made here which I think has been the subject matter of other evidence already given but, for the record, let us deal with it. “This evidence of executive overreach underscores the importance of maintaining a balance between political authority and operational authority in the security services.  Without political restraint and operational independence, there is a risk that the intelligence services will be pressured to provide intelligence that serves the narrow political interests of the political authority rather than the national security interests of the country.” That sentiment or view has been expressed earlier, it is here expressed by Mr Y.  Do you have any comment?     Thank you.  Paragraph point 8     Alright.  The paragraph 6.8     Right    The paragraph continues    And then paragraph 6.9 gives an example.   “A representative example of the irregularities referenced above is a submission dated 22 March 16 requesting authorisation for the “payment” of related expenses as per the approved project[s] Mayibuye, Wave and Construcao.  This submission sets out the estimated financial implications for the various CDSO projects and operations totalling 9.9 million.  This submission is contained in file 2 of the SSA bundle and is marked as annexure C8.” Would you go there please?  It is at page …[intervenes]     Yes, if may just make the observation, we can check what was provided and what was not provided because several Rule 3.3s were issued and we are still uncertain and we have asked for come cooperation from the representatives of Minister Mahlobo as to exactly what was received and what was not received, there appears to have been certain 3.3 notices that were sent but were not received, certain notices that were sent and were received and we are still trying to establish the precise position there because it also affects a further witness who has to come.  We might have to redact a large amount of a witness’ statement for that very same reason.  So I trust my learned friend will cooperate in giving us the information that we require in that regard. The second point I would like to make is that the paragraph 6.6 does in fact directly mention Minister Mahlobo.  The latter part is a more generic reference to the position of Minister.     Yes.  Chair, if I may just comment?  A number of Rule 3.3 notices were sent but – a number of Rule 3.3 notices were sent.  We are uncertain as to how many were received and it is that information that we are trying to establish.       Yes.     I am not – we would have to check that and respond, Chair, but I trust my learned friend and any other representative that we approach will cooperate in giving us the information of what was actually received.     Despite being sent and what was not received despite being sent.     No, no, certainly, Chair.     Yes, within a short space of time, Chair, over a …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.  I must make it clear that the legal team and the investigating team with the assistance of the secretariat in a short space of time sent out, as I understood it, well over a hundred Rule 3.3s.     And the intention and the instruction was always that every allegation implicating a person should be dealt with.     And, in fact, the passage there is contained – or the issues raised in paragraph 6.6 are contained in other 3.3s.  So they are repeated in the evidence of other persons in respect of which 3.3s would have been given.  So the Minister would have been alerted to the fact that that allegation was made even if it is correct that paragraph 6.6 was not placed before you.     And they should have been.     There is no doubt about it, they should have been.     But we will check as to whether they were on not.     Thank you, Chair.  We were at 7      This is a document where names have been redacted …[intervenes]     Yes.     If you would go to the document – and we only need refer to page 307 and 308.     Particularly the table at page 308, paragraph 3.1.  Do you see that?     This is a document that seeks to justify the payment of a total of R8 900 000.  What does this document illustrate as set out in paragraph 6.9?     Well, let me put this to you because this is said in paragraph 6.9 where reference is made to the irregularities referenced above, is this type of reporting sufficient firstly to comply with the prescripts in the SSA and secondly, to allow proper control of the expenditure of funds?     Right.     No, no, I am sorry to interrupt, please continue.     Matthew is a pseudonym, but continue.     Thank you.  Let us move to 6.10,     Yes it will be Chair.    Afraid not.     The red stickers in my bundle proliferate from now on.     Thank you Chair.   Paragraph 6.10     It continues ...[intervenes]      Let us continue then in paragraph     We move now to the particular projects and what these projects involve.  We have seen some examples of the motivations for some of the projects that we now go to actually what was done, much of what you say here is contained in evidence already given, although there are one or two additions.  Let us start with Project Construcao which is dealt     You must just bear with me a moment Chair.     I just want to be careful about what documentary evidence we place before you.     If I could ask you to go to page 251, please of SSA1.     251.       This is a declassified document; it is a request for authorisation for Project Construcao.  So you see that on a 249 of SSA1.     If one goes over the page in that document to paragraph 3.1.      You will see there the financial implications as reflected below are estimated and might vary.  Nature of expense Project Construcao, estimated amount R30million and then there is a cost allocation.  Do you have any comment on the sufficiency of the detail contained in that paragraph?     Right if you go to page 253 you will see there, there is indeed an operational plan for Project Construcao, do you see that?      I have looked at this operational plan and I am subject to correction but it does not seem to me that there is a description of what we have learnt was exactly part of Project Construcao activities, namely the provision of personal security to a number of named individuals.  Can you comment?     Alright, so the first thing you say is that your investigation was unable to establish the precise nature and scope of the activities conducted under any particular project head.  Is that correct?     And if you…[intervene]     And you also indicate in your most recent answer, that you could not establish precisely what activities were conducted under a particular project head in a particular financial period, despite learning that funds were expended, is that correct?     Alright.  Let us go to paragraph 6.12.      “Project Construcao involved the further recruitment and training of co-workers for the CDSO.  This should not be confused with the earlier recruitment and training of individuals at Ambassador Dlomo’s direction in 08/2009 who were subsequently deployed into personal protection units, and the Directorate for Presidential Security support in particular.”  Do you agree with those two statements?     Alright.      I am sorry.     Yes, you raised the issue as to whether it was consistent with the operational plan, that can be established by looking at the documents in Exhibit SSA1.     Yes.     Yes, sure.     Let me take a step back Ms K, do you want to finish your answer and I will ask the question?     Alright.  Let me then ask the first two sentences in paragraph 6.12.  Do you agree with those, or the content of those?     Yes, you stress that this is what you were told, by amongst others the project manager or by the project manager and this is what is being related here.  You do make the point that what you were told of the activities of the project was not consistent with the documentation, justifying or motivating the project and motivating withdrawals of money for the project.  Do I understand you correctly?     But you say you were told or you received evidence that under the head of this project, private security entities were employed.  Am I correct?     If we continue in paragraph 6.12 it     Right.     It continues to say, that is paragraph 6.12.  “During the graduation ceremony of the recruits, they were allegedly instructed by Ambassador Dlomo – and I take it that is Thulani Dlomo, that upon return to South Africa, they would report only to him.” Is that what the investigation was told?     Alright.      Right, thank you. Paragraph 6.13     Right, according to and there is a pseudonym Lily, and I am not going to ask you, well I am going to ask you not to deal with a position there.   “According to Lily, one of the reasons for launching the project was that former President Zuma wanted younger VIP protectors to be trained.” Is that the correct statement or were you told that by lily?     Alright, the paragraph continues    Finally, in paragraph 6.13    Yes, we can erase that.     Yes, so I am going to raise with you the issue surely senior officials within the SSA are entitled, as a matter of course to protection using the resources of the SSA.     The question might be which resources, is that correct?     Yes, then paragraph 6.14 reads    In that document, let me just ask you at a general level.  If you want to look at it, it is at page 320 of SSA1.  Is there a sufficiently detailed description of the activities that were being funded by the grant of a further R24million that enables proper controls to be implemented?     320.     Is there sufficient description of the activities, justifying the expenditure or allocation of a further R24million to enable proper financial controls to be implemented?  If you cannot comment…[intervene]     Yes.  That would have to be accompanied by suitable redactions because one of the motivations for the declassification of these documents is the rule that – or the law that classification cannot be used to conceal irregularities.     So that is but one of the motivations for declassification and that is why we can see it.     To produce documents of regular operations, it would involve a different set of considerations but we will try and answer that question in a way which does not compromise certain …[intervenes]     Yes, we will explore that issue.     And deal with it.  We have put before you, Chair, motivational documents and project plans and the witness has commented on the detail contained in those documents.     Yes, Chair, yes.     Yes, yes.  No, point taken, Chair.  We will look.     Another example of the financial detail is contained in paragraph 6.15 and reference is made here to three invoices issued by the pseudonym, Carrot Export Company during February and March 2015 totalling R20 million, thus using almost all the allocated budget within three months of the project’s establishment.  And these invoices, if I can refer you to the invoices, please?     If you go to page 266 of EXHIBIT SSA01.     It is annexure C1 but I am asking, if you look at the invoice …[intervenes]     At page 266.     266.     266.    Yes, black numbers, top left hand corner, Ms K.     You will see there an invoice issued by – and the name of the company has been redacted.     Another invoice in similar terms appears at page 272 of SSA01.  Do you see that?     That is for R8 200 000.     272.     272, it is annexure C2.     Yes in fact you point out that the invoice is actually for R10 million.     Yes.     R10 million and if you go to the third one, annexure C3, page 274.     You will see a rounded figure of R5 million including VAT.     Leave aside the coincidence in relation to the amounts charged by what appears to be a service provider.  These three invoices reflect a total expenditure during the period February to March 2015, an amount of R20 million, is that correct?     The description of the services rendered, in your view would that allow financial controls of an adequate nature to be implemented?     Is the weather creating a problem …[intervenes]     Right.  In fact you raise another point related to what is contained in paragraph 6.15 but I think it is fair to go there because we are no implicating anybody further or anybody else but if you look at page 271, this is receipt of money presumably pursuant to the invoice or one of the invoices that we have just referred o.     And it talks about R10 million received by a pseudonym Addo, who may give evidence.     That R10 million was received for the purpose of ops Construcao on the 28 February and no further information is given and presumably would that have been R10 million in cash?      Right, now I know that it is necessary sometimes to use cash as we have been told so that it cannot be traced but what do you say about the reporting adequacy and the financial control adequacy of this documentation.     Pseudonym Lilly.     Yes, I understand Ms K that in order to give a full answer to questions, both placed before by myself and the Chair, you have to give a full description of what you see, particularly in relation to documents placed before you but if we can just try and adhere to the principle that if you name a person, that person’s name should appear in the document. Okay?  If we can …[intervenes]     Thanks, Ms K.     Yes, thank you, Chair.     Thank you.  Noted Chair.     Now Ms K, are you with us?     Thank you.  Ms K, I would like to go back a little to evidence given this morning just before the long adjournment and yesterday to try and clarify the extent to which the regulatory instruments governing the management of projects, both in their execution and their motivation, are dealt with. Quickly go back to page 369 of SSA-02.  Well, perhaps first, before that.  We should go to page 351, paragraph 3.7.2.  And perhaps even earlier, to paragraph 3.7 on page 350. Let us start at paragraph 3.7 at page 350.     Three, five, o of SSA-02.  That is Mr Y’s statement at para 3.7.       Alright.  This is by way of background to the questions which will follow.     We will come back to that in a moment. We looked at that just before the long adjournment.  Then let us go to the paragraph 3.7.2.  It     Now this statement has been cleared by the SSA and to the extent that the operational directives broadly cover a number of topics.  We can put that before the Chair in paragraph 3.7.2.  But I understand that the SSA’s operational directives are classified.  Is that correct?     And for the purposes of the evidence of Mr Y and accordingly for your purposes as well, they have not been declassified.  So we cannot place their detail before the Chair.  Is that correct?     Yes, it does.  So while we can look – while we can draw some general conclusions, as you do, about whether the documentation placed before the Veza Inquiry, shows sufficient detail to enable management controls to take place.  What we cannot do is compare those documents to the detailed provisions of the operational directives.  Is that correct?     What we can do, we can ask the Director-General, the acting Director-General to provide an affidavit or intend to give evidence if necessary but to provide an affidavit to the Chair dealing with these issues under whatever rubric may be advisable, whether an in-camera affidavit or an open affidavit but that is a matter for further consideration.  Do you understand that?     But insofar as the ministerial delegation of powers and direction of payment is concerned, we can look at that.  Safe that sections of that too have been redacted for security reasons and have not been declassified to the extent that they can be disclosed in the public.       Similarly to the extent that what actually happened in relation to the detail of each project, its execution and financing should be rather dealt with in an affidavit provided by SSA by or under the authority of the Director-General.  Do you follow that?     So for the moment I will confine my questions to you to general observations which you have already made, rather than go to the detail of the prescripts that clearly would interest and concern the Chair which we will deal with in due course.  If that is permissible Chair?  I do not want to put this in a position where ...[intervenes]      ...she has to stray into ...[intervenes]      ...territory which she may not.     You do, however, make certain general observations.  If you look at SSA-1 at page 22.     This is a page of the Ministerial Delegation of Powers and Direction of Payment, the MPD, which has been declassified only to a certain extent.     So have you got page 21 which is the title page, cover page?  Do you see that?     It is the Ministerial Delegation of Powers and Direction of Payment.  It deals with the authority at various levels of management within the SSA who authorise that payments be made and certain categories of activity.  Am I correct?     If you go to paragraph 5.2 which appears on page SSA-1, page 22.  You will see paragraph 5.2.       It refers to cover structures.       It deals with the establishment of and closure of a cover structure/cover project and the amounts under that head, paragraph 5.2.1 have been redacted.  Do you see that?     They do not appear there.     No amounts appear there and there is no reference to any other document.     Well, then you have an unredacted version.  We do not have.     May I ask what paragraph you are referring to Chair?     Yes, the DG’s restricted.     Yes.     Well, let us put it this way.  Whether it was redacted by hand or redacted in the version set out before us or simply is not contained in this document, there is no information that we have as to the limitation under 5.2.1, the establishment of an enclosure of cover structure/cover project.  Do you see that?       Whether it has been hand redacted, it is just not there.     And in relation to ...[intervenes]      I am sorry?     Yes, yes.  So we do not have that information.     Yes, yes.  Which has a Y there.     And if one goes over the page.  There are certain categories of payment authorised which are included but most of them that deal with amounts up to R 2 million.  I do not see any amount here in the region of R 10 million for example.  If one goes through the whole document.  Do you see that/     In any event, I do not think it is entirely fair on you in those circumstances to deal in much more detail with the allegations in the paragraphs.  Safe to confirm the allegations you have made already which fall into two categories.   Firstly, you said in regard to the motivation for documents, as I understand your evidence, even in regard to operational plans, insufficient information was given to enable proper controls.  Do you stand by that evidence?     And secondly, in regard to finances.  As the DG, Mr Jafta said, the paper trail and the control documents contained insufficient information to ensure proper financial controls being implemented in relation to projects within the CDSO.  Would you agree with that proposition?     What is clear and perhaps you can assist the Chair in this regard.  The Project Veza which has conducted this investigation about which you testifying, has been in existence for approximately two years.     Has the team worked continuously on its investigations during this period?     Right.  And if you would please just give the Chair an estimate of the burden and scope of your investigation project.  Approximately how many persons would you have interviewed?     A rough estimate.     Yes ...[intervenes]      So you would not interview ...[intervenes]      Is it in the hundreds?     Would it be more than 50?     More than a hundred?     Alright.  Maybe I am being unfair now.  And ...[intervenes]      My profuse apologies Ms K.  And in relation to the documents, to be even more unfair, I suppose it would be quite unfair of us to ask you as to the volume of documentation that you had to deal with?     Something like the study of the Chair.     [laughs]     [laughs]     Which are neatly piled up.     Ms K, what I would just remark onto you and what we would say to the Judge in due course is that for a complete and proper investigation to be done into the affairs of the CDSO in the period under review.   You would require a considerable capacity to complete the work.  And I am talking about manpower.   You would require unlimited access to classified documents and you would require the cooperation of persons and perhaps the opportunity to compel persons from the lowest operative level or the operative level right through to the most senior personnel including ministers.  Is that a fair assumption?     In your investigation, did you have powers of compulsion?     Good.  Well, not good.  I understand.  If we can go then please back to the statement of Mr Y?     At paragraph 6.16.  There reference is made to additional invoices submitted under Project Construção by external companies, PR(?) Cedemans, Napa     Again, did these invoices to your recollection, to your knowledge adequately reflect the nature of the services rendered and work done to enable proper controls to be implemented?     Now that will be the sum total of – or not the sum total.  That will be the documentation which would be used to justify, firstly, payment and secondly receipt of cash.  Am I correct?     Alright.  If we can go then paragraph     I think it is important to summarise below and if you have a need to look at the document to support what is said below, please just say so Ms K.  It     There is reference there to the principle client.     I do not want to ask you who that client was but is that client an individual or an institution or do you not know?     Right.     Perhaps we can get other evidence to that effect.       The paragraph continues    Alright.  Let us go on to deal with Project Mayibuye.  As I understand it and it appears from what is set out below, Project Mayibuye was a collective name for several projects.  Am I correct?     Okay.       7.18 says    Paragraph 6.19 quotes from the     Well ...[intervenes]      Yes, it does and ...[intervenes]      Right.  It is there for anybody ...[intervenes]      Paragraph 6.2.0 reads    But let us go to paragraph 6.2.1.  It     M15 is at page ...[intervenes]      ...453 of SSA-1.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Right.       If you just bear with me a moment Ms K.     If you could go then to page 458.     458.     Well, perhaps we should – a lot of that is illegible, perhaps we should go to the certificate of receiving cash on page 464.  That is the type of document that Mr Jafta referred to as a raising concern.  453 and 454 are certificates of receiving cash.  Do you see that?     So let us look at the invoice which gave rise to that.     It is on page 462 of SSA1.  Do you see that?     Sorry.     Page 462, SSA1.     It says in an invoice    Quantity 1, unit price R4.4 million, amount R4.4 million.  Do you see that?     And that is all that is said and then in relation to the receipt of cash there are several certificates.     But each of them says underneath     And over the page 1.4 million again, all that is said is Ops Gustus as the reason for giving cash.  Do you see that?     Yes, Mayibuye in brackets.     That again by way of example you have made the general conclusions in relation to documents of that nature and as has DG Jafta.  Paragraph     And that is based on what you could locate, is that correct?     Is it necessarily the full amount?     And then if one goes to 6.23, it     Let us deal then with Operation Commitment which is an operation, as you have said,     Yes, there will have to be and that will be made in due course, as soon as we can.     Yes, ignore that name.     Not involved.     But there will – I am sorry, I should have made it clear before getting to that paragraph that after discussions with a particular counsel a particular name – I hope I am being vague enough.     Yes, Chair.     I will alert you to it beforehand.     It reads    The paragraph continues    “In his interview with our investigation team, Frank confirmed that he dropped off monthly withdrawals of R2.5 million to Minister Mahlobo’s office under Operation Commitment and indicated he had heard that these payments were going to “the project of the President” but could not confirm that this was indeed the case.  It should be noted that the Project Veza investigation team has not found any proof that President Zuma in fact received these payments nor is there any acknowledgement of such receipt by him.” Is that the correct position?     Did you happen to ask Minister Mahlobo about these allegations?     Well, perhaps we should not go any further that because we are dealing with a specific individual, so let me not take that any further, all we know is that the investigation team made an effort.  Evidence regarding the conduct of Minister Mahlobo will be dealt with elsewhere.  Hopefully we will have an opportunity to speak to him.  So can – is that okay?     Alright, let us …[intervenes]     Yes, let us leave that there for the moment, Ms K, if we may.  Paragraph 6.25 – well, let me put it this way.  Leave Mr – Minister Mahlobo out of the equation for the moment.     Has the investigation team attempted to investigate fully by reference to all implicated and concerned whether these amounts actually reached President Zuma as appears to have been intended by the project?     Right, so what you know is that an operation was conceived, the operation involved the withdrawals of cash on a monthly basis.  You were told that these amounts were delivered or amounts were delivered on more than one occasion to Minister Mahlobo and you cannot take it any further insofar as your investigations have gone despite an effort to investigate further.       Is that a fair summary/     Alright.  Paragraph 6.25 reads    Right.  The next sentence reads    Let us deal with the next operation, Operation Justice and Simunye.  6.26 reads? “Operation Justice concerned the alleged influencing, recruiting and handling of sources within the judiciary.” We have learnt from previous evidence that sources there meant member of the judiciary, am I correct?     The second sentence reads    Did you ask these questions of persons involved in execution of the project?     Right.     These written responses, the documentary evidence and the recorded oral evidence are a matter of record, is that correct?     Paragraph 6.27 reads    This submission is included in file 2 of the SSA bundle and is marked as annexure M4.  File 2 is the subdivision, Chair.  I hope your file has been subdivided into the three files.     But SSA1 is the file that we need to look at for annexure M4.     Let me get it for you, hold on, please?   I cannot say [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Is it not there?     My apologies, I will see to that personally after the adjournment.     If you would go to page 380 of SSA1.     That is annexure M4.  It is a letter addressed to the Director General SSA dated 20 July 2015, it has been declassified.     And it is a letter whose purpose is to renew and fund a cover project and payment of related expenses for Project Mayibuye.  Do you see that?     If you would just bear with me for a     Control over the judiciary, yes.     My apologies, Chair.     That statement that the project was intended to influence state power and exercise control over the judiciary, is that consistent with your knowledge of what you were told about Project Justice which later [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Right.     Well, I do not have sight of precisely at this stage what was given.  In fact we can – I can arrange to have one of the members of the legal team to speak to counsel in due course.     I am in no position to answer the question.     Yes, no problem with that.     Chair, the one option would be to hand the whole bundle over to my learned friend.     But I do not want to do it at this stage until it is placed on record and until I am convinced or satisfied that all the necessary redactions have been made.     And I am not satisfied on that score at the moment.  We have been told by the legal representatives at the SSA that we may put this whole before the witnesses but there are still aspects about which I am not satisfied and ultimately we take the responsibility not the SSA for what we place before you.   So there are a number of issues arising, and I am still coming across them, that require further redactions as a precaution and they are being – that is being done.  Once that has been done then we can hand the whole file over to my learned friend.     Well, Chair, let me put it this way. Where a statement implicates a person directly or perhaps even indirectly, that information is placed before the person by way of 3.3 notice.  To say that everything that a witness says in relation to a particular project must also be placed is task which is just not capable of reasonable execution. If a problem is raised, however, we can meet that problem and I am happy to do so.  So what we can do, on your suggestion, is give that document, which has been declassified to my learned friend and he can read it and follow the evidence.     Yes it can.     Thank you, Chair.     Let us got to the document referred to in paragraph 6.29 please.     It is annexure M15.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, 6.29, I am just getting the page.  Page 453.  If you go to page 454, a description of Project Mayibuye and particularly Project Justice and Operation Sesikona, Operation Justice and Operation Sesikona is dealt with.  Would you go there please?       It is in paragraph A of 2.4.     It reads    If you look at the following page      “In the same breath CDSO contributed largely to the rise in confidence in the justice by the public through its influential role in the media reporting, utilising well placed media personnel.  Operation Sesikhona is another of such success here the project aimed at stabilising the nature public practice by the group in Cape Town, but also ensure that the nature of protests do not undermine the integrity of the State, nor do they cause a negative impression to investors.”   Apparently, the influence of the CDSO operations has forced the organisation to adopt a much more moderate approach in the form of protest.  We will come to that in due course. But do you confirm that that extract that I have just read to you is contained in an official declassified SSA document?     We go to paragraph 8.30 please,     Said to the investigation team during the course of its investigations?     Right, paragraph 6.31 reads    Right, and then paragraph 6.32    DG Jafta gave evidence that the investigations were ongoing.  Do you know of that?     Director General Jafta or Acting Director General Jafta, gave evidence this week.     That the investigations into Operation Justice were continuing.  Is that correct, can you confirm that as part of the investigation team?     Yes, thank you for that caution. Let us go on then to deal with Operation Lock.  If you could just bear with me a moment, please.  There is another document that I would wish to show you in relation to Operation Justice, we are just looking for it.   But let us move on to paragraph 8.33, Operation Lock, 8.33 I am sorry 6.33. Operation Lock, says the     How did you establish that or how was that established, do you know or can you confirm this at all?     Thank you if you just bear with me a moment.     I am sorry, I interrupted you.     Thank you. If you look then at paragraph 6.34, can you…[intervene]     Can you comment on paragraph 6.34, still under Operation Lock?     Can you make any comment in relation to the contents of that paragraph?     Alright, well as a precaution and because certain names are mentioned there, let us just move on to Operation Sesikhona, can we do that?       Paragraph 6.35.  Paragraph 6.35     Well in paragraph 6.36 it refers to interviews with former members of the CDSO outlining or outlined their activities and Operations Sesikhona as covering the following.     Well I have not finished my question Chair, so my learned colleague does not know what I am going to ask, really Chair this is really unacceptable Chair to be interrupted in the middle of the question.     I am not going to read the paragraph here.  Chair it is really interesting…[intervene]     I am talking now.  No Chair I am sorry that I must draw the line somewhere.  There have been continual attempts to interfere with the leading of evidence and the presentation of evidence throughout the last few days. It is really objectionable when a colleague professional colleague gets up to interrupt a question before the question is finished.  He does not know what question I am going to ask.  I respect and I know what the witness has said, and I am not attempting to undermine that at all.  My question is directed at an entirely different object, and would render quite unnecessary the quite uncalled for, and rude interruption by my learned friend.     In paragraph 6.3.6 there is mention of interviews with former members of the CDSO.  Do you know who conducted these interviews?     Right and I take it from your previous answers that you were not one of those investigators?     That report in 6.37 to the extent that it deals with further activities, and the above activities we are attempting to obtain Annexure O is not in the bundle and it should read Annexure N I am instructed not Annexure O.     Alright, let us then move on if we may.  Chair if I was a little harsh and direct to my learned friend, apologies.     Thank you, so we are not best of friends but once more best of colleagues.     As we should be Chair.     As colleagues we should never raise our voices against one another and I apologise.  Project Hollywood is dealt with in paragraph 6.38. Project Hollywood, are you able to comment on this?     Right, let us just deal with it.   “Project Hollywood was established on 16 November 15 to commence in April 16 renewable every three months.” This admission for the establishment of Project Hollywood is included as Annexure HO, we will get there if we need to. “The stated objective of the project was conducting surveillance and monitoring, and involved the illegal interception of high profile politically prominent or connected individuals and government officials. Monthly withdrawals of R800 000,00 cash were made to pay - and there is a name of a company, which I do not want to put on record as yet, purportedly for the provision of intelligence and security services, including the remuneration of operatives, surveillance, platform setting and encrypted communication hire.” These invoices are reflected in the index to Project Hollywood, contained in file three.  What do you say about the contents of that paragraph, and let us not mention the company for the present?     6.39 goes on to say    Yes, because service providers did not exist or did the service provider exist?     Right.     That the service provider did not exist, and you had to refer to details provided by the service provider.  But for the moment, let us leave the name be.     That purported to come from a service provider.     Thank you.  Alright, let us move on     Presumably assets that would mean people capable of being interviewed who might provide useful information.  Am I correct or not?     We cannot be talking about fixed assets.     Because although strange things happen in security, that clearly would not happen.     Do you have any comment following what the Chair has just said, Ms K?     Paragraph 6.41 reads    Paragraph 6.4.2 says    Chair, I just need consult briefly about the next section if you would bear with me a minute.     Let us move on Ms K to paragraph 6.43 where the statement deals with Project     Alright.  You confirm the contents of that paragraph.  Is that correct?       Paragraph 6.4.5    Alright.  Is it just the incorrect allocation of expenditure between projects?     Alright.  Let us go ...[intervenes]      6.4.6 reads    It goes on to say ...[intervenes]      Yes, thank you. “These discrepancies are borne out in the accounts of those involved in the project.”     Alright.  And 6.4.7 repeats what we have dealt with earlier particularly in relation to the failure of the Toxicology Unit and the operational expenditure of Project Crescella and its implementation failing to detect the alleged poisoning of the former President.  Those remarks are made in that paragraph.  Do you agree with them?     Paragraph 6.8 deals with Project Tin Roof.  You will be aware of the evidence that is given in this regard.  It involves the provision of a safe house and monies, maintenance monies to the wife MaNthuli of the former President Zuma.   I am not sure that there is anything here that requires repetition.  Safe to confirm what was said by acting Director-General Jafta in the last two sentences of paragraph 6.4.8     Right.  And prior to that but perhaps we should put the whole paragraph on record so that we do     Right.  Well, let us just highlight a few aspects of the project that perhaps raised concern.  The first is in paragraph 6.4.9.   “The Project Tin Roof entailed approximately 40 persons drawn from different directorate within the SSA as well externally in the following fields, Administration and Investigation, Vetting, Polygraph Testing, Surveillance, Counter Espionage, Toxicology and Physical Security.” Do you know of that?     Alright. “It is alleged that investigations were conducted and some arrests were even affected but the main perpetrator is alleged to have fled the country.” Do you know – is that what you were told?     You do say in paragraph...  Oh, sorry     Right.  Let us move on to paragraph     It goes on to read at paragraph     And then paragraph 6.25 and following deal with Project Academia, again evidence has     Do you know of that?     I am sorry?     When you say you don’t have any comment do you confirm that that’s what the investigation learnt, or are you saying you don’t have any knowledge of it?     Alright, as I understand it while you could confirm what is said here it is not useful because the full extent of the project could only be presented to the Commission on full evidence, do I understand you correctly?     Alright.  Let us leave it then to a later statement on – for a later stage, but as I understand it the basis for the issues you now raise is not that you don’t know anything about the project, but you know more than what is here, is that correct?     Alright.  Well I think then it is fair to ask you what of this – these two paragraphs you can confirm and I am not going to direct you to any particular paragraph, what facts can you confirm here, if you feel that you cannot confirm them without being misleading then you please tell me and we won’t go any further.     Thank you for that offer.   Let us go on then to paragraph 6.54, Operation EThekwini, are you able to comment on these two paragraphs under this heading?      The information contained in paragraph 6.54 and 6.55 are you saying that that is contained in a report but you haven’t seen – have you seen that report?     But then I don’t understand why you can’t testify to it, you have testified throughout to reports that you have received, what is different about this?     Are you saying that all the evidence that you have placed before the Chair qualifies under all those conditions that you have just enumerated and this one does not?     So the reports referred to in 6.54 and 6.55 are they in possession of members of the investigation team, the Veza Investigation Team?     And those members of the investigation team or other members would they have interviewed the persons who gave the report, or the reports?     You have told us that there had been reports about the matters in 6.54 and 6.55, made to members of the investigation team.     Correct?     You have seen those reports, am I correct, but you don’t have corroborating evidence?     What I want to understand to assist our investigators in relation to this matter is whether you know that interviews have been conducted in relation to these matters.     They have?     Alright.   Let’s move on then to Project Wave.       Paragraph 6.56 reads     Paragraph 6.57 reads     Chair we have three witnesses potentially to come for this week.     But it appears that there is some more work to be done whether it is by way of affidavit or otherwise arising out of questions and answers today at least.     The issues related to tomorrow’s evidence that we had planned a particular witness, 33’s were sent out and on the face of it were not received and that was an issue I raised this morning for clarification, I personally have not yet received that clarification but if that witness was to be called tomorrow it would require his affidavit or his evidence to be truncated, it is not really desirable. The other two witnesses would require applications to be placed before you for protected identity evidence, which we would submit would be dealt with in accordance with the way they have been dealt with before but they haven’t yet been done.    We are at page 45 of 77 pages, although it will go quicker tomorrow I would respectfully suggest that we adjourn and conclude the evidence of this witness tomorrow, but if you wish we can continue and arrange for a witness to come tomorrow on the reduced basis.     Yes Chair and I think we are at the stage of the day, I think the stage of the week that I don’t want to bite the head off any of my colleagues.     Thank you Chair, that may assist us at – after a certain interval to wrap up on expeditious basis whatever evidence we have in this stream.     Thanks Chair. 
MS K:  Yes Chair yes.  Yes Chairperson.    Good morning.    Yes I do understand Chair.    Was it my statement or Mr Y’s statement?    Yes.    I have it.    Yes I do.  I do.    I – I agree in – with what is contained in that paragraph even with in terms of the amounts because that was obtained directly from a report that was compiled by Johan.    In response to our questions.  Yes so I can – I have no problems to question that.    Yes.    I agree with it 100% there is also accounts on statements and everything.  So that has happened; that has been the impact.    Yes it did happen and we did get input from Johan himself on this in detail and this was confirmed by him as well that the people were – are within his unit but those people remain there currently.    I agree with the conclusion.  Ja that is all I am saying for now.    My comment is that I agree with everything that is    I agree with the observations.    Yes.    I agree fully with the paragraph in as far as it goes    Was raised and the issue of – so based on that the – I could go – I could cite other examples.  I cannot say that nothing was done to curb the risk from within.  There were instances I just want to make one last example on    It is an Annual Performance Plan.    Could you please repeat the last part of your question?    Yes.    Yes either way whether – in which whatever way you work if you were working in a regulated environment so my comments would still be the same.  Maybe I should also make an example in terms of the first line where we talk about unskilled, unvetted persons in relation to the co-workers.  What I can say is that I have seen several CV’s of some of the co-workers and most of those people – some of those people actually do not even have matric but they were getting R40 000.00 a month cash.  And the unvetted part is linked to the parallel vetting structure that Mr Dlomo established in his office as the – the DDG Counter Intelligence and in this process there are several – the co-workers were vetted including some senior managers and irregularly so and they were issued with fake security clearance certificates which were signed by Mr Dlomo.  So based on all of that I do agree with that part that they were working in a haphazard way.  All of the acting senior managers that I have – in terms of the implicated individuals that the team has interviewed none of them could point me to an Annual Performance Plan.  So without an Annual Performance Plan how is the budget then allocated to CDSO?  How is CDSO able to expend all of the money – the millions that they have expended without an APP and a loaded budget?  So I actually align myself with all that.  The only issue that I have in that paragraph is what I already covered in terms of nothing was done.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes I do.    I agree with that Sir.    I would not agree with the part of the security cluster.  I do not have information that would confirm that the security cluster was – they shifted their focus to that.  But I could say that the SSA resources were reallocated sort of because just for the benefit of President Zuma.  But in as far as it extends to the security cluster I will not align myself with that statement.    Yes.    Yes.    I would not want to say the SSA because it is not the entire SSA that was doing this.  It is elements within the SSA.  So I would rather say of the SSA some of the SSA resources were redirected or CDSO clearly.    But I cannot say it is the entire SSA.    I think it is – it is true.  It is an accurate observation because it is drawn from an actual interview with one of the people that was involved in one of – in some of these activities who indicated that when – after Nazrec their submissions were not approved for guarding the Presidential plane and when they asked for reasons they were told that it is because President Zuma is no longer President.  So based on that statement which is on record elsewhere I would align myself with this conclusion.    No that is not what I said Chair.    The CDSO was – maybe a bit of background if I am allowed Chair?    By the CDSO was “closed” in 2016 when Mr Arthur Fraser arrived.  But the projects continued.    Continued to run.    So there was still money…    Mr Arthur Fraser.    When DG – former DG Fraser arrived.    He closed down CDSO.  It was said that he closed down CDSO however some of the functions that were under CDSO continued including the guarding of the Presidential plane and the protection side to a limited extent I think.  But on the fire – the aircraft issue the individuals that we interviewed indicated that they wanted – they were applying as usual.  They submitted a submission for approval for travel as usual and that was turned down and when they asked because it fell under IS the project when they asked whoever was responsible for IS at the time they were told that there is now – it is now a new President; President Zuma has left office.  So that is when the project ended.    It is members of the CDIS.    Because you remember Chair there is a paragraph that – remember Chair there is a paragraph that – 5.16 that talks about the funding of the project of the – of guarding the Presidential plane from the CDIS.    Budget.  So it was a member from CDIS.     Who was doing that.  So at some point there was collaboration between CDIS and CDSO.    On certain matters.    Yes, yes Chair.     Well, we are told by some of the implicated individuals and members of CDSO that they were – when they were closed down, they were instructed to hand over all of their documents to Mr Arthur Fraser’s office.     I think that these are the documents that we have managed to find now.  However, the projects continued running because there was still money expended in the 17/2018 under CDSO’s budget.       It was under the DG’s office.     That is the impression I got.  They were now reporting to the DG’s office.  In fact, a lot of the – said she was sort of like a representative for CDSO in that office.  But the person who was running the guarding of the Presidential plane said they had explained the project to Mr Fraser but he then said they must report to him on that.       So that continued.     I have no comment.     I have a challenge with the issue of the – as the same mandate.  I do not know whether the mandate needs to be reviewed or its – what needs to be reviewed is how they uphold that mandate and how to execute that mandate.     So I am finding myself in a difficult position where, if you say in broad interpretation it must be reviewed.  I guess they base that on something but for me I think the mandate is clear.  It is about how not to abuse it.     That is my understanding.     Yes, sir.     Yes, it is.  It is Chair.     I also did indicate Chair that those operations still continued although CDSO purportedly closed.  Some of the operations continues.  Hence there were funds expended in the 2017/2018 financial year.  So and this is also the period within which we, the project, the scope of the project was focussing.       Yes, I do agree Chair.  That is actually accurate.     That is accurate.  Sorry.     [Indistinct] [Break in transmission]     Yes, on the issue that Judge just raised which I agree with.  I just wanted to indicate that some of the submissions to which cash for projects like that may be used, that happened after the closure of CDSO.   Actually, when we received the submission, they still quote CDSO in the motivation and background.  And some of these projects were then moved to CSU because the Cover Support Unit when Mr Fraser arrived, established the Cover Support Unit in his office which then took over these projects.  I just wanted to clarify that.     Yes.  Some.  Yes.     The Cover Support Unit.     I think for accuracy purposes Chair.  I should just say that.  Remember when we dealt with the architecture yesterday?     Is that it appears she was moved into ESCO.     So with the closure of ESCO and the arrival of Mr Fraser, he then established CSU in his office.  So they were reporting to him.  So I cannot CDSO was fully continuing with all the work because some of the admin staff in that office was involved in the same operation.  So it was under that umbrella, DG’s office, CSU that some of the projects of CDSO still continued.  I do not know if I am clear.     Yes.     Yes, sir.     Yes.     I do not have a comment except to say I accept that observation.     I agree with it.     That is true.     6.2.2 is accurate.     No, I was just saying 6.2.2. is accurate.  I agree with it.     That is true.     I agree with that statement.     I agree with that.  That that was our finding.     That is also accurate.     It was sometimes.     No such submissions actually required or requested that the projects be established.  We were being basically given generic kind of statements, you know, referring to that counterintelligence mandate.   It is only in certain instances where maybe there is an operational plan that is attached or just a one-liner in the submission itself that indicates somehow what that project is about.  Note that it for these kind of projects it is not necessarily required that you give all of the detail but at least in the operational plan as it is – you have to also justify whatever expenditure, you know.  There needs to be some moment in it.     Yes, sir.  I am there.     Yes.  I have got it.     It is a request - it is a submission and a request for authorisation of the establishment of the Cover Project and payment of the later expenses for Project Construção.       It is a submission requesting establishment of Cover Project which is Project Construção.  But what I do not understand is, it talks about payment of related expenses but I think that is not here not there.  So when – in terms of our operational directives.   You are supposed to have an operational claim which is attached here as you will see on page 253.  But that document should then go through the – with its budget.   Go through the CFO first for certification.  And then once that is done the strategic under the submission for a project to be established will then be compiled and with the operational claim attached.  So this is the submission for that purpose.       Yes.     I see that.       But also ...[intervenes]      Yes?     No, continue.     Now let me listen first.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, sir.     Well ...[intervenes]      On 2.2 I think the second paragraph it starts with    Neither do I Chair.     Chair, I can hardly hear you.  I apologise.     [No audible reply]      Chair, I do not even understand what the intent is here.     So these are the kinds of motivations that would be given.     And when you look at the activities that were disclosed to us by several members of CDSO, including the project manager of this project, it is more like it was training.  It ends up being portrayed as a training exercise.   But how do you train people for a whole entire year?  And if it gives about training on – in terms of gathering whatever.  Then it should have been done maybe – we do have an academy that could have done that, I think.   So this is what we were saying.  In terms of those observations that we read out, the pictures give a general thing.     Yes, Chair.     [No audible reply]      Excuse me Chair?     Yes.       Yes, Chairperson.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     No, it is not.  Not in my view.     Yes.     Yes, I am there.     Yes.  Yes, I see that.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     I think partly.  If you look at 2.2.  It says    So this is – this is a bit different from what they wrote in ...[indistinct]      Yes.     No, they are not Chair and I must also point out that it can be common practice not to go into detail in the submission itself because the submission to – for a covert project to be established will also be seen by maybe people in Finance, you know throughout the chain of command so that is why there is that part of the operational plan that it is supposed to maybe get more linked in terms of what the project aims to do.     But in this case ...[intervenes]      Pardon?     In this case when they looked at the operational plan in page 316 for Mayibuye in terms of the aims it says in 1.2  ...[intervenes]      Yes.  It reads    In the submission ...[intervenes]       No it is not, but what I am trying to point out is the word for word, it is a copy and paste of this line it is what Judge was asking about whether I understand, intended to protect identification of personnel, resources, in terms of gathering any environmental scanning.   This is now written  under Mayibuye. On the other hand in the submission of Mayibuye that is not carried, instead the same wording is contained in Project ...[indistinct] on the submission, that is the point I am trying to make.      Just to point out how it – this it actually supports what we are saying that they will show, they will purport to be complying, they will do certain things to give an impression that they are complying to the OD, yet they weren’t.        ...[Indistinct – parties talking over one another]     Yes, sir?     Yes but it does not apply to all the projects in terms of the motivations that are advanced.     Yes, I support that statement.     Yes I do.     Within SO.     Yes, Judge.     Yes with the new appointed person to lead it.     Yes, sir.     I would like to maybe reserve on comment on that.     Because I do believe that in this affidavit further down that is dealt with.     So I do not want to now testify on it currently.     It is accurate.  It is accurate presented there, so I agree with what – with the paragraph.     Yes, Chair.     Which document?  Annexure C?     Yes, it is a document like that.  There is more than one of these, but this is definitely an example of [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] practices.     Yes.     Yes, I see that.     I agree with his sentiment and [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I agree, I just do not understand that part of to facilitate funding for another.  Maybe it is my English. “Blurring of lines between projects…” That is true.  “…CDSO structure utilising projects ostensibly created for one purpose to facilitate funding for another.” That is true.  I agree with that statement.     Yes, I think we could maybe add suspected double-dipping.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     I am there, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, I see.  I see that, Chair.     Firstly it illustrates a breach of financial prescripts in the sense that yes, it says nature of expense, it is Project Mayibuye and then there are operations under Project Mayibuye or it says Operation Justice, Operation Law, Operation Siskona(?), Operation Safe Return.   So when you look at the estimate amount it does not give a breakdown of the money that is being requested here.  For example, if you look at Project Mayibuye, it says estimated amount 2.5 million, Operation Justice 1.8 million, Operation Law 0 000, Operation Siskona 0 000, Operation Safe Return, 300 000. Now if you are requesting money to – even if the TA, there on the submission, that 2.5 million should have been broken down into line items as to how it is going to be expended. So instead of having global figures appearing like that and it also says Project Wave, which is R2 million and Project Construcao, R2 million.   So because there was – I think this was – okay, maybe I should not add my thoughts on that.     It is not, Chair.  It is not because it starts with the – some – I do not whether I should say, it is the route or it is the fruit of the poison tree.  Firstly, if there is no APP and the budget cannot be loaded against that unit and for all of these projects, how are you going to justify these line items and actually the cost allocation, the code because global figures are written there.  I think the financial people will be better placed to discuss and clarify that. So if you have one submission that just outlines – just gives – that just telling different projects and just as global amount and you do not know how that is going to work because the other thing is, they take this - for instance, this submission, you find that sometimes it skips the  - what – the budget controller because if the budget controller is there they would have demanded that that be broken down but there was this tendency of bypassing budget controllers. So I think we will deal with financial irregularities further down because I do not want to add the other aspect they were able to keep on drawing money without having had even an APP.     Another – yes, Chair?     I think if you page to 309, if you look at the recommendations by Mathhew …[intervenes]     It says - the condition that he is writing there, it     Yes I do.     Chair when we looked at the official financial records of the SSA in terms of a budget and expenditure, when we looked at the period that is covered there, and CDSO on its own as a chief directorate spent just below a billion, it was 900 and something. I cannot even pronounce that number because ja, I would rather say just under a billion.     Over the period, but this is one - it has to be seen in the context of it's a chief directorate it is not higher, it is a chief directorate - I do not know how to explain it.  It is not even the counter intelligence in its entirety, it is just one element under them.     You know, just one unit spending that amount of money on and the cost driver was the covert projects, the contract payments and all of that and without proper accounting.     Yes.     Yes, Judge.      I agree with the sentences.     I agree with what the paragraph is communicating and we have already gone through this annexure but I think when we get to the issue of contracts, it will make sense why we are highlighting these dates in this in this paragraph but for now, I am fine with the paragraph as it is, I agree.     Yes, Chair I am there.     Yes, I see it Judge.     Yes.     My comment is similar to what I had earlier on Mayibuye that you cannot have a global amount in this way when you are talking about financial implications, because that R30million that would have been broken down into whether there is travel, whether there is operational expenses and other expenditures.  So if you request – or because this one is for the establishment it would be, I do not know if it would be appropriate to make it like this because they have had a breakdown in the operational plan. But if it was a submission to withdraw funds from the budget that is allocated, then they would still need to have the line items for it.     Yes.      As a person who has seen and gone through most of the documentation during this investigation and analyse the info and including whatever we got from finance, and having interviewed the individuals involved I still cannot sit here and claim that I know, what was the full extent of the activities that were undertaken.  Maybe VIP Protection was part of it and the training was part of it, but there is no full disclosure as yet in my view, in terms of the full extent of the activities of those individuals.  For instance, if I can make an example of -  there is a submission where there is motivation for getting, retaining funds for Construcao and Wave and whatever and I think it amounts to R54million under Mayibuye and the other projects as well.  In that when they say what the purpose of the projects are, they indicated that the same officials that would be co-workers or resources that would be used in Construcao will also be used in Project Wave.  So - but when we asked the project manager of both those projects, what was happening in May?  He said, no we did nothing the entire year but money was expended.  So based on that, I cannot - I do not think there has been full disclosure on the part of members of CDSO on what exactly were the activities.     Yes, we could not confirm with the individuals.      Especially if when they start, when their submissions are general and broad, when you talk to the person it is still actually it is not clear, but money was expended.     Yes, funds they expended and people went over budget.  For instance, for Construcao the budget was R30million in its entirety, for the financial year or for a period of a year and of that R30million, only R5million was allocated for operational expenses.   However, when the project was approved in January, at the end of January by April, the money for that whole project the entire R30million had been withdrawn and all of it for operational expenses.  So you would wonder how one approved - maybe for the first withdrawal of the funds from the project budget.  If the person withdraws R10million, a budget Construcao was going to pick up that no actually for operational expenses you only have R5million for the year, yet it was allowed for people to take R10million and then R7million, automatically R30million is gone and then they want more money.  And then they keep spending and they say extend, extend, extend when money is finished, and then it goes back into rotate to keep the projects going.     Yes.     I do but I would like to maybe indicate that the entire 6.12 is basically based on information on the account of the project manager, what they told us the project was about.     And yes there is proof that the people went for training, but it does not necessarily tie in with what was in the operational plan.  So, I cannot…[intervene]     …say that this is exactly what was done so that is what I am trying to say.     I think I finished my answer for now.      Yes, I do agree, yes I do.     Yes, and one of the things if I may just it is fundamental, what is more confusing is that when you look at Construcao and the receipts of moneys withdrawn or dispersed and the supporting documentation there in terms of invoices.  They were actually procuring VIP Protection services from companies.  So the team was confused as to if you have changed these people for VIP Protection, and you are already funding that through Construcao.  How, why, what would necessitate you getting a private security company for VIP Protection again, and then withdrawing funds for that.  That is why I am saying we do not know the full extent of what exactly was being done here.     Yes, that was at the final interview.  However, we had seen documents that showed that there are private companies, security companies that were, whose services were procured for VIP Protection and those, those people were paid.     Yes, that is what we were told.  In a…[intervene]     It was actually information that was gathered during momentum.  Remember that period from June 2018 to 22 December when this was established. So all of that information had already been gathered from the various people.  So that is what we were told.     On this one, there was actually a statement by one of the co-workers who indicated that but I cannot remember if that statement was signed, because we did not obtain that statement from the individual.      But that is what was indicated but what I can confirm is that during momentum time, the investigating team, did go to the country where these people went, particularly went for training and they actually confirmed according to them, that they spoke to the head of station, from SSA, and those people were not even aware that there was such training being provided there.  So that is why we say it was outside the available diplomatic channels.  But we cannot, we could not - they could not obtain a statement from the Police attaché there in terms of whether they knew, but that is the information that we were working with, as you would understand this investigation was still ongoing before we got here.      I would align myself with that yes, because there was a parallel vetting unit.     No.  This is one of the statements that we obtained before – it predated, they were obtained during momentum. In fact, I have never met Lily, because ja I do not want to say what happened.  So I have not interviewed her in this regard. So I cannot say that statement is correct or inaccurate.     Yes, this one ja, we interviewed him and that is what he said and then so I can confirm that.     It is a correct statement, but I do not know what would be wrong with that.     Maybe it is because of my limits, maybe it is because of my limited knowledge of the environment, but I thought in IS we do have VIP Protection there you know, but it is for the senior managers of SSA.  So I think, Ambassador Thulani Dlomo was entitled to that.     Yes.     Yes, so I cannot tell from this, because if there are resources that are meant for that then it cannot be anything irregular.     I can look at it if you have questions on it.  But I do align myself with this paragraph, we did look at that.     What page is that again, Sir?  What page are we referring to?     320, What is the question Sir, again, sorry.     No, I do not think proper financial controls were implemented here because under financial implications     We – you know – so that was in contravention of the prescripts.  And then I also – okay.     I have not look at …[intervenes]     Chair, I did not catch that last part but I will try to answer.     My answer to that would be that I cannot say in the sense that based on the fact that I have not looked at other units and how they have compiled their submissions but I doubt that they would have too much detail in terms of what the covert operation is but in the operational plan you would have found at least a bit of more detail, so that will be attached to the submission.  But what I am definitely sure of is the issue of the financial implications and how the budgets are outlined because even when you travel there is a standard way of how the financial implications can be – I do not know, delineated in the submissions.  So those are just the standard practices.  I have not looked at other units’ project plan because we are still busy with CDSO.     Yes.     Annexure C?     I cannot find it, Chair.     Page?     366?     266.     Okay, yes.     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, I see that.     Yes.     Yes, excluding VAT.     Yes, it is for R10 million.  The first one we went through is actually 5 million when you include VAT, total.     And the second one is 10 million.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No.  It would not because apart from the fact that is it called just professional fees and it is just an invoice, it would be – if this is a deep cover project as Construcao, and the invoice is issued for Constructao from this service provider it would not be addressed to State Security Agency if you look at that invoice and also seeing that the acknowledgement of receipt of the – dated the – I think it is page 271, it is dated 23 February 2015, it is actually a disbursement of funds, the entire R10 million given to – I do not know.     Yes, Chair, could you repeat that?  I think the weather is affecting…     I did not hear what the question was.     Yes, now I can hear you, Chair.     I think it is my glasses, I am sorry, it is 28.     Yes.     Yes, that is a – so for me that would not suffice as sufficient documentation to justify settlement of this claim.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is it.     If you look at page 269 – okay, page 268 and page 269, in 268 the subject of the submission is withdrawals on Project Construcao for payments of operational expenses for the project and then obviously it talks about – it gives some kind of motivation but when you get to the final implication it just says operational expenses, 10 million, and that is it.   So another concern with this submission – so it does not say how the R10 million will be expended and the invoice itself does not also assist to say what this was for and if you look at the compilation of this – if you look at the compiler, is Lilly and Lilly …[intervenes]     And Lilly is the compiler and the recommender.  Another thing that is apparent here is that then Themba signs and the ultimate signatory on this is Ambassador Dlomo and this is above the MPD limitation.  A DDG can never be able to sign off on a R10 million submission and just withdrawal of funds. So if you look at the individuals that are featured here they were all within SO and that one should not be completed in that way and then they would bring the green forms to HQ, get the R10 million cash and create this acknowledge of receipt as proof that that money was expended for the intended purpose.     Yes I did.     Yes?     Chair, I think that is why most of the submissions are accompanied by an attached MPD.  In the bundle – I do not know if I am authorised to be calling bundles.     In that as I say bundle, annexure B.  I do not know because it is has been evidence leader so I was thinking I do not want to take over his job.     Yes.     Yes.     As I say, bundle 1.     I feel like an evidence leader now.  SSA bundle 1 and …[intervenes]     What is this?  A?     It is page 21, 021.     So if you look at  - that is the MPD and if you look at cover structures on 5.2, that is the section that deals with the work of – mostly of CDSO, they are always covert projects.  So it does indicate the delegation and limits in terms of what people can approve.     Yes.     Pardon, Chair?     That is what …[intervenes]3     Yes.     Yes.     I will try to answer to the best of my ability, Chair.     I think we must draw a distinction between a submission to establish a cover project because that one would probably give a timeframe, maybe of a year, and it will also have an overall budget accompanies by an operational plan with a breakdown of how the money – you know, the budget for that project.  And then that operational plan usually has more detail, so – and it is attached to the submission which could not – in certain instances I do not think it did cover project it would be divulging everything there but at least the accounting officer who is going to ultimately sign off on that project, should have signed off that operational plan and understand.  That is my view.     And then there is a submission – once that is approved, there is a submission that people write just to withdraw funds from that approved project budget.  So what we were looking at on that company and that invoice was a transaction to withdraw funds from an already approved project budget.  But when you withdrew funds, when you look at the MPD, as I have said in page 23, you     That is the point that we are trying to make.  I do not know if I am answering sufficiently.     Yes, I am sir.     350?       I am there.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, they are classified.     I guess so because it follows the ...[indistinct]     Yes.     Yes, I understand.     Correct.     Yes, I do follow.     Yes, sir.     Chair, I think I am lost.  Okay I got it now.     Yes.  Yes, I am there now.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     No, it is not redacted.     Yes.     Yes, you are Chair.     Yes, I can.     Yes.     It is that ...[intervenes]      It is just has ...[indistinct] [00    Apart from the DG’s one.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  Yes, I do.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, we have.  A dedicated team working full time on this project.     I do not have that offhand but ...[intervenes]      I will have to consult on that because the transcript will assist me.     [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     No, I am saying.  I will ask a colleague of mine just to check the transcripts because all of the interviews were recorded.  So if we can just count the number of transcripts I will be able to give you, even an estimation.  I do not have an estimation now.  An estimate figure.     Definitely?     I do not know.     Yes.     If you look at a walk-in safe in a room, you can just imagine boxes and boxes that it would be like three quarters of that room.  It is boxes of this information that we got.     [laughs]     [laughs]     Yes.     No.  We do not have any powers of compulsion.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     No.  In fact, the invoices looked – at face value when you look at them, when we analysed them.  It is the same paper and both invoices from the different companies basically said payment in accordance to existing contract.  So it was insufficient in that regard.   And the other thing that I remember is that the – that Squash was a foreign company that was providing whatever services.   But it was – it would not be something that would     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.     I do not know whether – I do not know who they were referring to ...[intervenes]      ...with regards to – ja.     Yes.     Yes.     It was a project with operations within that project.     Yes.     Yes.     I cannot confirm ...[intervenes]      ...the motivation. ADV PRETORIUS     But because it is quoted, I am assuming it comes from the original documents.     Because it is a deportation.  So I cannot oppose that.     But...  Yes.  And then the part of the approval of     Yes.     Yes.  M15.       Yes, I am...     453?     Yes, I am there.     I have got it Chair.     [No audible reply]      Page?     458.  Okay.  Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, thank you.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, I see that.     Yes and Mayibuye in brackets.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I do not think so, sir.  I do not think so.     Yes.  I do agree with the paragraph as it stands.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, I can.     Yes, that is what we were told.     Yes, that is correct.     There was an intent to ask.  When he was still member of parliament before he was appointed Deputy Minister Water Affairs, we were engaging with Minister – form Minister Letsatsi-Dube’s office and we crafted letters with certain questions and we asked that via the Minister ’s office this be disseminated because this – it was not just him, it also included another former Minister and other senior officials that had left the organisation. Now we thought that the ministry would the process that …[intervenes]     I get that but I have to point out that ultimately the letter was delivered back to the team to be delivered to Minister Mahlobo and when he was contacted he actually scolded a member of the team and said the member of the team must tell the former Minister that he will expose her.     That is where it ended.     Yes.     We did not have the capacity to investigate fully.  When we hear allegations and we see that people in terms of the TAs, the financial system, we can see that people withdrew money for that project and they indicated that we delivered it wherever.  We did not get an opportunity to – if we – had we engaged him, I think we would have tried to – that was our effort to try and establish if indeed he did receive and whether – because we were going to put these allegations to him.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     That is what I am told, Chair.  I have never met Lilly and by the time the Veza team started, I think she was interviewed and submitted a statement before I joined the team.     Yes.     Yes.     That is what we were told, that is why we say purported aim.  I cannot remember whether we were told – ja, we asked questions, we sent written questions to certain individuals and that is the response that we got and apart from that I think it will also be addressed in 6.27.     Yes, specifically those who had taken TAs for Mayibuye because in Mayibuye you had all of these operations, so we had to pose that question in writing and we got written responses where before we even had a face-to-face interview with some.  So that was – we did get written responses that were explaining what this was about.     From certain implicated individuals.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it is.     Page?     Yes, I am there.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     Yes.     No.  No, not verbally, we were not told that.  We just discovered it in the submissions, the documentation.     Yes?     Yes, I am at M15.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     [laughing]     Yes, I can confirm that.     I can confirm that that what was said.     Yes, also in writing from the implicated individual.     Yes, we had a – it was through an interview with Frank.      I agree with that statement fully.     Pardon?     Yes.     The investigation is ongoing.  However, I think I have to postpone my response to this and include that in my statement.     No, Sir.     I can confirm that I saw her affidavit that was stating this.  No, I think it was in the report that was written by another, the previous project manager of momentum.  So I am not certain of this because I did not have an opportunity to send questions to Lily or interviewed Lily because she had left the organisation ADV PRETORIUS     It was in terms of people that were implicated. However, it was also possible for us to request information from other law enforcement agencies, for instance, when we cited to lifestyle audience, we would involve the FIC.   So - but mostly, the investigation team did not have powers to be going beyond the people that remained members of SSA, unless you went through maybe the Ministry or something.  So that is one of the hurdles.     But…[intervene]     I do not know if I should add what we tried to do in terms of Lily.  We wrote, DJ wrote a letter to the current employer to indicate that there is this issue and can he be alerted, but we never got a response that was a year ago. And then what we could do is just to include her in the list of implicated individuals in the A1 statement that was submitted to the DPCI.     Yes, Sir.     Yes.     I can only make comments in relation to the last part, the latter part there, Frank informed the investigation team, because that is when we had the interview.  The other part I cannot.  But I have to underline that Mr Y and I have different responsibilities and access to information. So because his position he would have had more information on some of these operations compared to what we had, because what we had was basically, we were relying on what the documents that we found and whether - how a person responds to written questions or verbal questions.     Yes.     Let me just say, paragraph 3.6.5 and paragraph 6.36 up to 6.36.3, I cannot comment on those because I do not have direct knowledge of that information.     These interviews were conducted by investigators who are part of the team of the Project Veza team.     No, I was not present and I think if you check 6.37 it does say a feedback report was provided on the operations undertaken.   So all of that, from 6.35, 6.36 and all of that, that is under Sesikhona and whatever happened up to it I did not -up to 6.36.3, we do not have first-hand and confirmed information on that except that report that they compiled. Unfortunately, when there was no sworn statement.  I cannot say that I can confirm what is expressed here.     Okay.     Yes, I am able to comment on it.     It is accurate.     Just on the first sentence where it says, it is the details provided by the service provider.  I do not think we could say provided by them, we could just say, details contained on the invoice of the service provider.     It does not exist really, we checked.  So there is no way they could - maybe they provided I do not know but they do not exist, according to our records.      So apart from that, I agree with everything that is in there. ADV PRETORIUS     And I also…[intervene]     No, that is why I was saying details are not that were on the invoice that we saw…[intervene]     Yes, from that service provider.  That is what I am trying to communicate.     There is nothing wrong if it is done by SSA, you cannot outsource that just collecting financial statements from banks and company ownership analysis that can be done internally compiling reports.  So those services are not something that we needed to outsource.     Assets, where is this?     Assets could be…[intervene]     Sorry.     Assets could be a sources, agents whatever.     I do not know.     I do not know, because let me say I do not know what they are referring to but what is reflected here is exactly what is reflected on the invoices.  So it is taken verbatim, from the invoices.     That is what I concluded was meant.     No.     No, I have no comments, Sir.     I agree with the paragraph?     Yes, yes.     Yes, it is.     I can confirm both paragraphs.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct Chair.     Yes.  One cannot withdraw money for one project when they are using a submission for a different project.     So Project Crescella submission – if it is a submission to withdraw R 1.8 million what is attached in terms of the operational plan, it cannot be Project Mayibuye Operational Plan.  So that is what is meant in general.     No.     Yes.     Yes, I would just like to confirm that I have seen these – the affidavits that she deposed to.  So I agree with what is reflected there and the conclusion drawn.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I can confirm that I guess.  There is nothing that I can change about that.     In terms of the investigation, we actually interviewed the project leader of this end what really – I could add because I do not want to refer to media reports and I do not want to quantify the media reports but I know for sure is that the person involved in the project indicated that they were just called to stand by Ms MaNthuli Zuma.   So and then they were involved in this project but he – I did ask – put the question to the President whether the intention of keeping MaNthuli in different safe houses, it was not just one because it - we incurred a lot of costs because of the moving around and VIP protection.   I asked whether that was a – that was she under protection or was – had she been detained.  And I could say that she ended up almost, although not verbatim by coming out clearly, that the person was detained.   But when the facts were put to her in terms of the conditions, it seems – I do not know whether – she did not outright say yes she was detained but did admit that MaNthuli was kept in different safe houses and there was – the case on – there was no SAP forensics – Forensics was not involved in the investigation.   It was various SSA members involved.  And that is all I can say on this.  But what is there in terms of seeking legal counsel and former Minister Mahlobo, I cannot comment on that one.      Yes, that is what we were told by the individual involved.     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.  Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I agree with that statement.     Yes, that is what we were told by the person who was involved.     Yes, we did the analysis of all of those – the invoices.  So I can confirm that.     No I don’t have any comment.     This is ...[intervenes]      Pardon?     I don’t want to comment on this project because it is going to lead me to actually end up testifying more on t things that should be in my statement, so I can confirm to a certain extent these issues but I feel that it is not extensive, it is not sufficient to actually describe this project.     Yes, which we have collated and collected, so that is a separate, ja, so I would rather no cover that project.     Yes, yes sir.     I request that I don’t get into the detail and comment and ja, I will give that full account in a separate statement.     No I cannot comment on it, it is the same situation, it was contained in the same report that the investigators compiled, as I indicated under this corner or something, so it is the same situation where I don’t have the actual documentation and the team did not really get statements from these people, as much as they have met with them, so I don’t want to – I cannot confirm or deny but I can say this was contained in a investigate feedback report.     Yes, it was submitted to me.     What is different is that on this one we don’t have – I was not present in that interview.  We have not transcribed the interview as much as it was, although it was recorded because of capacity issues.  Thirdly we didn’t get sworn affidavits and fourthly I didn’t see any documentary evidence of what is alleged in this so that is why I would opt not to confirm or deny something that I don’t know, because a report from the investigators from what some people say to them I cannot vouch for it, if it is not supported and corroborated by other – through other means.        Yes, yes, everything that I can speak on with authority those projects we actually went through the documentation and I can – that is why we can say – refer to whatever annexure, so I would rather support things that I have seen in evidence and not just rumours, especially because I am trying ...[indistinct - distorted] the safety for the country when you want them to commit.     Yes they are members of the investigation team.     Please repeat that sir.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes it is only one report and it contains the various projects that you were talking about.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes sir.     Yes.     Yes, we conducted the interview and that is what he indicated so I can confirm that. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS   INQUIRY RESUMES 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I am sorry, may I just point to the record because otherwise if I leave it, it will be injustice.     I know that I have been engaging with a contact person from there but I need to raise this first.  On the notice that we have been provided and consciously as I have also warned yesterday, the paragraphs that my learned colleague has referred to and the witness to an extent confirms to be accurate, in reference paragraphs 27, 28 and 29, that mentions – detailing my client administers the project were not provided in the notice that I have received.  Just for noting of the record.     Extracts.     Yes.     That is correct and …[intervenes]     That is correct, Chair, you have it right.     Thank you.     Chair, I think there is to an agree an acceptance of my correctness insofar as placing this on record and what – and I note what my learned colleague is saying and that will [indistinct – dropping voice] but I needed to place that on record.     Yes.     Definitely, Chair.  I think it is an easy thing to resolve, we should not really be wasting time on it.     Chair, let me just …[intervenes]     No …[intervenes]     Chair, the reality is that at some point my client was mentioned.  And we kept quiet.     Well, it is not about his client but …[intervenes]     Well, Chair, it is actually a suggestion of resolving this matter.  The reality is that …[intervenes]     Where certain people will be mentioned when the notices at least at this point …[intervenes]     Can I just – sorry?     This might assist me on the following, Chair, there is documents that were given to us as annexures referencing with these particular paragraphs and as I have been following evidence, this implicate my client, then they were given to us as declassified annexures to be used in particular for this notice 3.3. in respect of my client.     I just want to check with the counsel for the Commission because I have annexure M and I thought he was introducing and then he was referring to M4.  To me it was just MM, marked as M, maybe I am just confusing and I do not have M4 or it was not intended to be given to me.  If I may complete, M refers annexure something different.  Just for clarity, so that I do not confuse…     No, Chair, hence I am trying to clarify.     Chair, Chair will remember that we do not have the bundle as you are [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     We would have been extracts of certain things and in between.     So now hence I am also looking at this annexure.     Because these annexures were give to me in an attempt to reference certain notice that we were given.     So that is why I am trying to …[intervenes]     Without really disrupting, I know my learned colleague yesterday said he will only progress when the right(?) is not disturbing him.  I had no intention waking up this morning to disruptive.     However, I am sitting here with a headache because – and you can imagine me having a headache with this big head.  So …[intervenes]     Yes.  So I have always been, Chair, with the direction of the Chair being told that no, we will stop, please stop disrupting.     But I think this pervasive of an injustice if I may use those words.     Because I am not really following and these are declassified information that were intended to be given to me.     If we are – do then continue under that vein, I will always be left in the dark and I will always intervene as if I am being disruptive to the proceedings.     Thank you, Chair.     But maybe my learned colleague is misunderstanding my argument.     And I have not by any chance said that I be given everything.     And I am quite aware of evidence is presented here.     What I am raising today of, and I have been consistent since Monday, is what has been disclosed to me purporting to be a particular document in reference to an annexure on a paragraph that has been disclosed to me, so these are documents that I am already in possession either when they were given with a 3.3 or as they were declassified progressively to me and disclosed. Now I am sitting with a document here that refers to M.     And in reference to a particular paragraph that now he is tendering evidence on.     Okay, thank you, Chair.  I …[intervenes]     No, my learned…[intervene]     Yes, Chair hence I stood and say cautiously before I attempted to address it.  Chair, it could not be correct that you will want to attempt to read a paragraph…[intervene]     How would…[intervene]     I have avoided to get into a battle with my learned colleague on personalities and with respect Chair I was not rude about this.  Let me tell you what indications gave me because he was saying to the witness…[intervene]     Can I just finish my…[intervene]     Maybe on that basis.     Apology accepted. 
COUNSEL: Chair, can I be allowed …[intervenes] 
UNKOWN COUNSEL:   I would need to object, it cannot be correct, my learned colleague what he is attempting to do.  The witness becomes specific and we must consciously remember that this witness is…[intervene]     Okay.  I must object to what my learned colleague is trying to and attempting to do.  More specifically relating to this paragraph, this witness becomes very specific and direct my learned colleague and say 6.35 and 3.6 I cannot comment because I was not direct, I do not even have this personal knowledge.  More so she has filed almost a disclaimer again before that and said remember me and Mr Y are not familiarised in the same or we are not vested with the same powers.  He might have had more information than I  have and we must also cautiously thread with her evidence because she is supposed to be a confirmatory affidavit if one can use it colloquially.      Now…[intervene]
