DOROTHY:  Chair the first witness to testify this morning is Dorothy.  She has taken the oath before you in chambers and an application has been granted by yourself in chambers under Application Number SEQ27/2021.  The order should be on your desk before you.  So when this submission was developed(?), I was acting General Manager.     That is my signature.     476?     It looks like my signature.  It is my signature, Chair.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     Chair, when this submission was done I was acting general manager  then and Darryl was acting – I think Darryl was Acting DDG, if I am not mistaken.  Yes.  And it would seem that he took the money and then came to me to sign off his settlement.     Which I did.     No, Chair.     Darryl would be better suited than me.     Yes, it was only for project Mayibuye, but what specifically, no.     It was not normal practice but I assume because I was acting general manager then that he would have come to me, not looking that he is a senior personthan me, I would rather my acting capacity at that point.     Chair the money …[intervenes]     You got cut, I did not hear that.  I am sorry, you got cut, I did not hear the last part.     No, I am saying the environment that I worked in, we worked on a need to know basis.  So as long as there is a submission that is approved for the project I would not question as to what the money is for because it was not in my place to know that.  So the need to know principle was always applied within my environment.    True, Chair.     It would be the same as the M16.     Where I say that I signed the settlement for Darryl at the time because I was acting GM but have no knowledge as to where or who or what the money wasmeant for.     I am relying on the documentation and that is what it says, Chair, so…     I am assuming that that is the amount.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Is that – that is M18, am I correct?     I signed the settlement as Mr Fraser had approved the withdrawal of the cash.  Darryl was my seniorat the time as I as acting GM at that point.     Okay, I am there.     506?     Under compiler?     That is Lilly.     Yes.     That is my signature.     Yes.     That is my signature.     Yes.     That is my signature.     Yes.     Mr Fraser’s signature.     No, I do not see that.     There is a receipt?     510?     Oh yes, I see that.     Yes, I see that.     Yes.     That is my signature.     Yes.    In my comments, this is one of the …[intervenes]     I must not mention?     Okay.     Yes, I am there.     Okay.  Okay    Yes, okay.  It appears that I initially took 470 000 and then the balance later as sometimes there was insufficient cash available.     I do not remember very well the specific transaction how – whether I took the 470, waited and then there must have been a delivery on that same day and then I took the balance.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Are you saying did I specifically put the cash in the bag?     Yes, Chair.    I took the money to Minister Mahlobo’s official residence.      I gave it to him personally.     In the study.    When I walked into the study I then informedthat I brought the money, would take it out, I would count it so that he is satisfied that it is the specific amount and then I put it back in the bag and leave.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Darryl.     I do not remember the specific date when he informed me that I am going to having to do that.  He informed me – when he was Acting DDG he informed me that I would have to take over the role of taking the moneybecause he has been doing it prior to me.  So it could not have been that specific day when I took the money.  The specific day would have been that this is the day when I (sic) said you need to take the money, go and take it but he had informed me beforehand.    Chair, the date of withdrawal of the money would be the same date that the money is delivered.       Immediately I withdraw the money I would immediately take it to him.     2016.     Yes, according to the documents.     Yes, Chair.     In Pretoria.     Chair, since he – when I arrive at this house, the protectors would obviously be outside.     So that was my first point of contact.     And they would then inform that I am there.     They would not have told me to go into hisstudy, they would have said he says that I must come in.  They would not come into the house with me because obviously when I enter the door he would be there waiting for me.     Yes, the protectors would have informed him that I am here to see him.     Then I would wait for them to come back tome to tell me that I could go in an see him.     No, Chair, I do not recall.     I do not recall – yes, ja, I do not recall our conversation.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, I am here, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.  Yes?     Yes.     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    The green form?     Yes, I do.     Mr Arthur Fraser.    Yes.    Chair, I do not recall but no funds can be withdrawn from a particular project without having theproject being approved in the first instance because this submission is to withdraw funds but there would have been a submission to establish the project.  So I am assuming this is what Dwayne was talking about.     It is the bigger submission, the principal submission.     Excuse me?    Yes.     I am not sure.  I am not sure, Chair, I cannot hundred percent confirm that it is correct, I do not know.     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Fraser.  Mr Fraser.    It is my signature.     Yes.     Yes.     No, I did not say that.     Can I clarify?     I said I would have taken that 470 and waited for the difference which would have been the same particular day and then took the whole amount.     No.     Fully.    Yes.     Which bundle is that?     Which one is that?     522.13..?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I see that, yes.     Yes, will go to 4.1.     Yes, it is, exactly.     Yes.      “I can confirm that I have on three occasions withdrew 4.5 million by instruction of Mr Darryl tohand the money over to Minister Mahlobo.”     Yes, I delivered the money personally and I was accompanied by Lilly.     As excluding it, the 1.5, it is excluding that.     Yes.     Yes.  The same would happen, we would get to the residence, inform the protectors that we are there and then we will wait until we get the green light to go into the house.  We went in and we went his study, with Lilly …[intervenes]     He came, we counted the money and …[intervenes]     Okay.     Okay.  Okay, I spoke about the first occasion. The second occasion, it is the same scenario, where I would get to the gate, inform the protectors to inform the Minister that I have arrived.     I would wait in my car and then …[intervenes]     Yes.    I understand, Chair.  The instruction to withdraw the second amount of 4.5 was given by Darryl.  I withdrew the money in my name, went to the cashiers with Lilly, the money was counted there by the cashier, packedinto the bags and we would call – I would call Minister Mahlobo to say I will be coming.  When I get to the house I would then inform the protectors to inform him that we have arrived.  We would wait in the care and then we would then get the green light to say we can come in.  We wouldcome in and he would usher us to the study where the money is counted, put back into the bags and we leave.The second time I was with Lilly.  The first time when I went I was alone.And the third time the same applies, Darryl gave me the instruction to take the money to Minister Mahlobo.  I would call him to say that I am coming, then get to the gate, speak to the protectors who then in turn inform him.  They would come back to me, if I would wait – I would wait if he has got meetings.  They would then come back andsay I could come in and then Minister Mahlobo would usher me into his study.  The same applies, we would count the money and I would put it back into the bags and leave.On both occasions – on the last two occasions I was with Lilly.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Chair, the money was in my name, I withdrew in my name.  So from the cashiers it is counted and put into bags.  I am there, I sign for it.  From there we get tothe house, I then take the money out, count it again to make sure that it is the money that he is expecting, then I leave.     It was – no, it is just greeting and that webrought the money and then we would count and then say thank you and we would leave.     I am sorry, that must have been a – yes, I am sorry, Chair, it must have been a typing error, it is 4.51.     When I dropped the money off I did not make Minister Mahlobo sign anything.    So I would drop the money off and leave.     Yes, I am confirming that it is 4.51 million.     Yes, Chair.     Which one?     Okay.  Chair, when I deliver the money Mr Mahlobo does not sign for it.  I would deliver it and leave.  A week or two an envelope would come which I would give to Lilly but I cannot confirm that it is receipt based on themoney that he received or receipts in terms of whatever activities that money was intended for.     But it was in an envelope, (indistinct – recording distorted)     No.    Yes, Chair, that is what I was saying.     Okay.   “Lilly together with Frank requested me to take out cash in the amount of 7 million under my name but nevertheless utilising the name of this project.  The reason for the request was that Frank could not take the money as he had an amount that he needed to clear at finance before he could take further monies.”     Chair, I do not recall but I am assuming it would have been under Mayibuye.  Without the documents I cannot really ascertain exactly but the documents wouldhave reflected my signature in terms of the green and the attachment would have been related to Frank’s activities.     423 and 424?  Which bundle?     423.     Okay, yes, I see, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     No.     No.     Darryl.     When Darryl asked me to assist in taking the money when he was acting as a DDG he said to me he was the one that was taking the money before, since I am acting in his position I should now be the one taking it but I do not know how many times he took it.     Chair, I do not have proof that the monies were indeed delivered after my three occasions so I cannot honestly and with confidence say that it indeed is true that he was receiving the monies after my three deliveries to him.     I would have to have proof to show that hewas receiving still.     I bear no knowledge what the money was intended for or to whom he was giving the money to.     Yes Chair.    Yes, Chair.    Yes Chair.     No, I did not deliver the money anyway, at the cashiers once it was signed off by my name, it was taken there.     Chair, I – Chair.     Lily and Frank were there.     Lilly and Frank, were there.     Yes, Chair.      That is correct, Chair.     I was agreeing to what the Chair was saying that it is correct to what he said.      Yes, Chair.     Chair you got cut, Chair you got cut I did not hear a word.  Just the last part, I did not hear anything.     Yes.     I do.     107 thousand?    You said 107 million?     Okay, yes.     Yes, Chair.      Yes, Chair.      No, Chair.      Except for Construcao and the toxicology salaries, that is all.     Yes, Chair.      Yes, Chair, as I have indicated, I said my role was limited to recommending the submission.      When you say I must exercise caution in terms of names?    Okay, in December 2017, I was asked by a gentleman…[intervene]     Can I mention the name?     Or just the title?     Okay.     No, Chair.      Yes, okay.  In December 2017 I was asked by Paula the head of the ANC security to assist him at NASREC.  I then advised him to seek permission from my seniors to utilise me.  Mr Langer informed me that he hadobtained consent from Mr Fraser to utilise my services at NASREC.  To protect myself I wrote a submission to SSA management who gave me permission to assist the ANC.     Money was for SNT and accommodation for myself.     No, Chair.      No, I was assisting the ANC in monitoring the movement of buses that were coming from the provinces, coordinating that movement and checking if there are any glitches along the way and reporting back to them.     Okay, Chair by then when the conference started, I was not doing anything else, I was sitting athome since the activities of SO were stopped by the former Director General, so I was not doing anything at home. Hence, Mr Langer then called me to request me to come and assist them because they had a shortage, but because I am an employee of SSA, I felt it necessary that I should have authorisation to be there.     No, Chair.      Yes, Chair.  I was coordinating, assisting in the coordinating of the movement of buses should there be any glitches along the way, the busses that are coming from the different provinces.  So I was asked to monitor that there is no glitches along the way, until they reach Johannesburg.     So we were providing alerts.     No, Chair.      Is everybody on board and so forth.     Yes, Chair so I worked with the transport unit.     Yes, Chair.     No.      No, I was not going to be paid by the ANC Chair.     Yes.       Yes.      Yes.     No, 467 is my signature not 68?     Yes.      Yes.      “I have never told Mr Lloyd Mhlanga that I had  given the alleged cash withdrawals to Mr Mahlobo.”    Yes, Chair.      So I must start from 2.3?     “In the absence of schedules of the cash  withdrawals of R4.51million, I am only able to recall having done so on three occasions.”ADV PRETORIUS     “For all material times I made the” -  okay.     Yes, yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.      “At all material times, I have made the  Temporary advancements in my name. The documents for settlement and preparation for settlement of each temporary an advancement was done by my colleague known as Lily in the State Capture Commission.  I would sign off the request with the temporary advance in my name, though prepared by Lily and also sign off the settlement documents in my name, though prepared by Lilytoo. I would then go to finance section with Lily and the cashier would count the money in front of me and Lily, Lily always brought the bag where the money would be packed by myself and Lili.  The money would then be taken to the official resident in Waterkloof of former Minister Mahlobo.  On the first occasion, I delivered it alone.  On the second and third occasion I was accompanied by Lily. I got involved in the cash withdrawal, because I was told by Mr Darrell that I should do so because I amacting in his position and he used to do the same and take the money to former Minister Mahlobo.  I was acting in the position of Mr Darryl because he was acting in another senior position.”     “I was made to inherit all that he used to do  and continue to do it.  I was specifically instructed by Darryl to agree that my name be used and also to collect and deliver to Minister Mahlobo.  At no stage did Darryl or Minister Mahlobo inform me of the purpose and objective of the withdrawal and delivery of the cash.  At no stage did Mr Mahlobo asked me to make the temporary advance withdrawal.  At no stage did Darryl or Minister inform me of the objective and ultimate destinationof the cash I had to deliver and as an intelligence officer, one of the cornerstone values of intelligence is always working on a need to know basis, only on the need to know principle.  The environment in which I was working in is covert operations and offices were unknown to many SSA members.  On the delivery of the money I would be ushered by them to his home office where I would remove the money and count it, having countered it in front of him and having satisfied himself that it isR4.51million I would leave the money and the suitcase with him.”     Yes, yes.     Okay, I received a call from a colleague, which I cannot name for obviously operational reasons, on the 28 t h of January 2015, that I need to come and collect arms and ammunition.  I was not aware because nobody had for warned me that I am going to be collecting arms.  I then called a late colleague of mine, which also I cannot divulge his name for security reasons, asking him if itindeed it is true that I have to collect arms at Musanda.  He then confirmed that yes, I am the one that needs to collect, my instruction of Mr Thulani Dlomo.  The letter that I have also states, a letter that came from Mr Thulani Dlomo to the security chief director at requesting for these for these guns.  I then drove to Musanda for collection of those arms and ammunition.     Yes, yes.    I was informed by the late colleague that the VIP protector of Mr Dlomo would come to my house to collect the arms.  So I drove home, parked the car in the garage and waited until he came, I sent him a code toaccess the place where I stay.  He came, opened the boot, assisted him to carry the steel suitcase and he left.     It's definitely not normal Chair.  Hence, I wrote here that driving from Musanda to my home was the longest trip ever because I had never been involved in carrying any firearms.  So it was the longest trip that I had to take to ensure that the safety of the States guns aresecured at all times until I reach my destination.  So it was a bit weird, hence I called my late colleague to say, I received a call saying I must fetch guns but nobody forewarned me about this and then he responded back to say no Mr Thulani Dlomo is the one that instructed that I need to fetch those firearms.     Yes, Mr Thulani Dlomo’s protector came that same – within - I do not remember the time but I knowbecause I sent him a code to access where I stayed to come in and collect.      No, Chair, I had no idea.    I raised the issue of the firearms with the former DG Mr Fraser and why I did that was word was circulating that Mr Dlomo is leaving and I was worried that there were firearms that were taken out of Musanda in my name.  So I then informed him that there are firearms that are out in my name, and I am very worried about it and he instructed that all SO firearms are to be returned.    All they were returned except for I discovered I think, early this year or late that there are three still outstanding from the batch that I took.     Yes.     Yes.      I do not know but in February this year, I went to a specific police station to do a statement.  So there is a case opened in relation to this missing firearms.     Yes, I learned that from the police station.     No, Chair.      I have no idea, Chair.    It's I think it's when SO’s activities or SO was closed when we were told that Mr Fraser's SO.     522?     Yes.      Yes.      Yes, Chair.      I am talking about the President and the Deputy President, those are the principals, that is what we call them.      Chair, the Deputy President and the Presidentattend meetings at Luthuli at a specific day on that specific day.  On that specific day the hash tag Luthuli, people who were going to occupy the building as an inside, and that posed a danger for the two principals, hence, we call them principals there.  So I am talking about both President andDeputy.     Chair, as previously said, Mr Dlomo as I have previously stated that Mr Dlomo would be the best person to answer this question since he is the person that instructed that these people be activated.     If you can recall earlier you asked me this question and I said to you, I cannot 100% confirm thatsomebody else was taking the 4.5 to Minister Mahlobo.  If you can see the conversation there he does not say, what was brought to him.  He just said to me, I do not see you anymore.  I see they sent Helen to come, so I do not know, what was Helen doing there.     Chair, earlier on we were talking about sorry, receipts that the Minister would have signed and I said to you I have not seen those, sorry for that.    We were talking about receipts that the Minister would have signed, and I said to you I have not seen any receipts that bear the Minister ’s signature and when I talk about Lily submitting and me going through it is the invoices or receipts that are related to this company that I would not be able to name.     So from my understanding and so on - excuseme Chair?     Mr Mahlobo has never showed me anyreceipts.     Yes.      Yes, yes.    Yes.      Thank you so much, Chair.     Thank you, Mr Pretorius.
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just for the benefit of the public we are starting late because the witnesses who are going to give evidence today are witnesses whose identity needs to be protected and the delay is connected with the logisticsthat needed to be attended to in order to make sure that they have taken the oath and are able to testify.  I have considered an application for an order aimed at protecting the identity of the witnesses concerned in regard to each witness and I have been satisfied that in each case a proper case has been made out for an order protecting their identity.I am going to read out one order and not all three because they are basically the same except for the names.  That is correct Mr Pretorius.   Yes.      Yes.  Yes I see that one is under the number that you gave earlier plus 01.  Another one – are they all under 01 – that gave their applications.    Okay alright.   I am going to deal with the one for Frank.  The order I grant in respect of Frank is the following. 1. The application – this application may be heard in camera and without notice to affected parties.2. The witness – the witness referred to in this application and who is scheduled to testify today is to be referred to as Frank during his testimony before the commission and thereafter insofar as matters relating to the commission are concerned. 3. The witness identity all not be disclosed or published in any manner. 4. The names and initials of the witness shall be redacted from all affidavits and documentation presented in evidence – presented in evidence.5. When the  witness testifies before the commission  5.1 No photograph or video or other image of the witness may be taken or published or broadcast. 5.2 No person may photograph or publish any photograph or other image of any personengaged in and or responsible for the protection of the witness when he gives evidence. 5.3 The witness need not be present at the commission’s hearing venue – that is the hearing venue and give evidence but he may instead give his evidence from a separate and undisclosed location – the protected witness location. 5.4 No camera will be permitted in the protected witness location. 5.5 No person other than the Chairperson, membersof the commission’s legal team, the commission’s safety and security advisor those necessary to assist or protect the witness when he give evidence or another person specifically designated by the Chairperson will be permitted to enter the protected witness location without the prior written permission of the Chairperson. 5.6 The oath or affirmation 5.6 is to be deleted. So 5.7 becomes  5.6. 5.6 An audio link from the protected witness locationwill be provided so that the witness evidence can be heard in the commission’s hearing venue when such evidence is given. 5.7 Subject to the usual rules applicable to the conduct of the commission’s proceedings.5.8.1 Members of the public including the media may be present in the hearing venue in such numbers as may be directed by the Chairperson. 5.8.2 Sound reaching the hearing venue via the audio link from the protected witness location may be broadcast and proceedings in the hearing    Ja.  Ja.  Okay. And then to the old 7 becomes 6. 6. This order may be amended or supplemented by the Chairperson at any time if in his opinion that is necessary to protect the witness or any person in connection with the witness evidence or to ensure then as to any implicated person. That is the order and that order is also granted in relation to witness referred to as Dorothy and where in this order it says Frank it will say Dorothy in the case of the orderrelating to Dorothy.  And the same order is granted in regard to – in relation to a witness to be referred to as     Stephen and where reference is made toFrank the reference in the case of the order relating to Stephen will be a reference to Stephen.So all those orders have been granted.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes please.    Ja.    Well are you appearing for Dorothy?    Because if you are appearing you are theone who must address me on behalf of the whole team.    Ja.    With the secretary of the commission.    Ja.    Okay no that is fine.  I do not know what the issue is but I probably do not need to know as long as you confirm you are appearing for Dorothy you have – you have been instructed by attorneys that is – that is fine.    Okay alright.     Good morning.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You have appeared before.    Yes.    Frank.    Okay no that is fine.    Okay no thank you.    Okay alright.  I – I take it there is no conflict there Mr Pretorius – I do not know.    There are conflicts.   Yes.  I do not know – are you aware – are you aware or what is the position.    Ja.    Yes.   Ja.    Ja.    Okay alright.   Okay.      Ja how it goes ja.   Yes.  Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  Okay.      Yes.    Yes it has been.    Oh.    Okay.      Okay – no, okay that is fine.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Her picture does not appear we just see her name.    We just see her – oh no her picture is not supposed to appear.  No, no that is alright I forgot that she – her picture is not supposed to appear.  Dorothy are you ready?  I understand that you would like to address mebefore you start giving your evidence.    Yes please.    Oh please go ahead.    Thank you very much Dorothy.  I have already expressed the commission’s appreciation when you were taking the oath privately for your making yourself available to the commission to assist it.  We understand from what I read in the affidavits that it is not easy but I appreciate that nevertheless you – you and others are making yourselves available to assist this commission.  So I just want you to repeat that publicly that we appreciate that you have availed yourself to assist the commission.    Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    You may proceed.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja.    Yes that is fine.    Do – there are – there are two or more affidavits by Dorothy.    Is that right?    ja.    Yes. 419.2    Hang on one second.  Now to the extent that any document or affidavit is an annexure to the main affidavit they would fall under the main affidavit as an exhibit.  But to the extent that there are affidavits that are standalone then they would need to be separate exhibits we can admit them as and when we get to them.   Is that fine?    12 to     Okay ja I think – I think if you use the bundle number or the pagination of the bundle that will make life – my life easier.    431.    Ja 431 that is where it starts.   Okay you want her to identify that affidavit and…    Ja let us do that so that I can admit it.    Properly.    It will be Exhibit YY    12.1    Ja okay.  The affidavit of Dorothy that starts at page 431 will be admitted as an Exhibit and will bemarked as Exhibit YY12.1.    It looks like there is a delay in whenever anybody speaks then she takes long to respond. Dorothy can you hear me?    Yes I can hear you.  Do you hear us quickly when we speak    Or does it take time before you hear what we are saying?    Delay.  Oh. That was the evidence leader speaking to you.  It is the Chairperson speaking to you now. So I am just checking whether there is a delay in you hearing what we are saying.  I see you do take a little bit of time before responding so I do not know whether it is the delay or what.    Yes.    Do you feel like there is a delay or you do not think there is a delay?    Do you feel like there is a delay or you do not feel that there is any delay before you can hear us?    Yes.  It is not long but if it – if thetechnicians can attend to it that would help.  I will assume that they can attend to it while we are – we continue.  So let us continue.  Yes Mr Pretorius had asked you to confirm whether the source or the service provider or the final destination of the cash would be required to sign the receipt.  That was his last question.    Okay.   Is it by way of the signature of the line manager – the approval.    Okay.      I am sorry Mr Pretorius just before you go – or let me just get clarification. Dorothy so the process of obtaining cash which you have described it starts with the member who feels that he needs or she needs cash, is thatcorrect?    And that member must prepare what is referred to or must prepare a memorandum that you say is referred to as a submission, is that correct?   And in that memorandum or submission he or she will state how much they need and for what purpose and they will motivate for the grant of that cash, is that correct?    And who does he or she submit that memorandum to?  Is it their line manager or is it somebody who may not be their line manager but who has certain responsibilities?   Do they submit it to two places?    Of the member.    And the chief directorate of finance.    Okay please just repeat that   Just repeat your answer.    Ja.   Oh will he – will he or she submit the memorandum to two people?    Okay but in terms of the person to whom the member submits the memorandum is it to one person who must then escalate it if to various people must allrecommend or the member must go from one office to another to submit it?    Oh okay.    Yes.  And – but ultimately did say the – the final person is – is a finance person who must give approval?   And is it the CFO or is it somebody else?    Yes okay the – we only talking about a member who – who wants cash. So are you saying that in all cases where a member requires cash the CFO must approve before cash can be withdrawn?    Okay.  Alright. And is the CFO the final authority to approve?    Yes.  There is a portion for the CFO.    Okay alright.  Okay Mr Pretorius.    I just announce Mr Pretorius that we will not be taking the tea break because of the time we lost earlier.    So ja.      So I think that – so are you confirming that you used – or R1 million was used to pay MK veterans at the rally held by the ANC on 8 January 2016 and that this was done on the instruction of Mr Dlomo. Are youconfirming that Dorothy?    Correct.  Okay and Mr Dlomo referred to here is…    And Mr Dlomo that you referred to here is Mr Thulani Dlomo or not?    Okay alright.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Subject obviously to ensuring that her identity is not indirectlydisclosed I am not sure that the – her evidence or her answer indicates how she gets to know about this. Whether she was involved.    In this.    Oh okay.    Okay.   Okay do you have an idea more or less how much this stipend was that was given to them per individual is that something you do not know?    Yes okay.      Okay.      Okay Dorothy are you referring to a time when Mr Zuma was the President and Mr Ramaphosa was the Deputy President?    Okay alright.    And you confirm that you were involved in the withdrawal of that amount of R1 850 000.00?    Okay.    The question was whether you were in involved in the withdrawal of R1.5 million in February 2017 allegedly used for SONA related expenses and which was transported to Cape Town by a SAA member and handed to you which you allegedly handed to Minister Mahlobo at his official residence in Cape Town.  It may be that you were not involved in the withdrawal but it was handed over toyou, you can clarify what you know about this.    Yes.    Yes.     Right.     Well, you give ...[intervenes]      Do you remember?  Were you given a bag by the member?     Did you get a chance to see whether there was money in the bag?     Okay but you were told that it was money that was in the bag?     When you handed the ...[intervenes]      When you handed the money or bag to Minister Mahlobo, did he open the bag in your presence?     And you cannot recall whether you ever saw that there was indeed money in the bag?     Just try and remember as far as you can what Mr Fraser said to you and just try and repeat the gist of what he said to you in regard to this issue.     Yes, was he speaking to you over the phone or were you with him when he gave the instruction?     Ja.  And where was this?     Where was this?     Uhm ...[intervenes]      Oh, at an office or not in an office?    Oh.     Okay.     Was it just the two of you?     Oh, okay.  So he said a certain member, and I assume he mentioned the name, would come – would bring money to you about R 1.5 million that he said youshould take ...[intervenes]      ...to the Minister.  I just want you to tell me how your conversation with him went.  I just want you to try as far as you can remember, to say this is how our conversation went.     Oh, so he did not tell you who the member is who was going to bring the money to you?     He just said you were going to receive a call and he did not say from whom and that after that call you would then be given money which you should take to Minister Mahlobo.     Did he specifically say you would be given money or did he say you would – somebody wouldbring you a bag and you must take that bag to Minister Mahlobo and you assumed that in the bag there was cash?     He told you it was money?     Did he tell you the amount?     What amount did he tell you?     Alright.  And when you – had you been to Minister Mahlobo’s official residence in Cape Town at the time before that or was this your first time?     You had been?    Okay.  And ...[intervenes]      Tell me how the conversation between you and Minister Mahlobo went when you came to his residence.     Do you remember ...[intervenes]      Do you remember whether you just gave him the bag and he took the bag or whether you told him that you had been asked by Mr Fraser to bring this money and it was supposed to be R 1.5 million or whether you did not mention that?  Can you recall whether you mentioned that?     Okay.  So in the conversation between you and Minister Mahlobo there was not any mention of cash or money or was there?     Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     Ja.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     Or maybe before you do so, Mr \ Pretorius.  With regard to the earlier amount that you testified about of one million rand.  So that one you know quite well because you withdrew that amount.  Is that right?     The one relating to the MK Veterans in Rustenburg.     But after you had withdrawn it, how do you know that it ultimately was paid to the MK Veterans?  Obviously, I do not want you to say anything that might directly or indirectly disclose your identity but obviously somebody listening to this.  Yes, you saw you withdrew it. Yes, you say it was used for the MK Veterans.  But were you involved in the actual handing over of cash to the MK Veterans or did you give the money to somebody else who you understood would be giving it to the MK Veterans?     You were involved?     In actually giving the money to the MK Veterans?     Okay alright.  And was the handing – was the actual giving of the money to the veterans, did it take place in Rustenburg?     On the day of the event or after or before?     Yes.     Yes.  For how long were they there, the MK Veterans in Rustenburg in connection with the event of the 8 t h of January?    Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.     Okay alright.     Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.     The name Lilly, of course, that you used     The safe house.     This was in 2020 – November 2020, is that right?  Well, I thought that is what ...[intervenes]      I was saying I see that you say    Yes.  The R 500 000,00 had been deposited into your account.  Is that right?     Before the – who had deposited that amount into your account if you are able to say?     Where was that money coming from?     From SSA?    And what were you supposed to do with that amount?     Oh.     Was there a safe house that was to be obtained or rented and you were to pay the rent and to pay for furniture for that safe house?  Yes.Well, Mr Pretorius, I can understand the previous transactions but I am not sure – it is not apparent to me whether there would be somethingirregular about this one?     Ja.     Ja.     Okay alright. ADV PRETORIUS     Ja.     Okay.     10.3 says – asks for your explanation, rather, in relation to the withdrawal of cash for Project Construção referred to in the documentation attached, marked Annexure C10 including details of to whom and for such purpose the cash was provided.  Chair, if I may just say?  The annexures that are referred to here are all collated in Bundle 1 which is before you and they will be referred to only when necessary.Your explanation ...[intervenes]     That is fine.     Yes.     Dorothy.  Okay, maybe Mr Pretorius, you can put the question.  Let her answer.     Put the question and let her answer.    Okay.     Well, Mr Pretorius, I had said we would not take the tea break but maybe we should have five minutes or ten minutes break.    Perhaps – I...  Okay, we will take a ten minutes break.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Okay let us continue.     Sorry.     I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Is S T Dlomo the same person as Thulani Dlomo or is it somebody else?    Okay.     Was that the case in regard to thistransaction?  Why did you on this occasion ...[intervenes]      So, let me repeat.     Okay let us start again.  Let me put thequestion.  Why did you on this occasion sign for the amount and allowed the amount to be taken out in your name?     And in that situation, why would it beright to take – to allow somebody else to take money in your name?  Should they not settle their TA’s timeously if they have taken cash out of SSA for legitimate projects for operations?     And why would the person who must authorise, if the money is taken out in that member ’s namein those circumstances, not understand that?  In other words, if I have unsettled TA’s in my name and I need cash for legitimate purposes.  Why should I not follow the normal process with a view to taking money out in my name even if I have TA’s that have not been settled but on thebasis that the explanation that I will provide will be acceptable to the person who must approve?     So does that mean that the relevant authorities would not accept any explanation and give an approved withdrawal of cash in favour of a member whohas got a TA that has not been settled?     You see, I am asking because I am hearing evidence of a lot of irregularities that were happening at the agency, SSA, and some of it seems to be criminal and so on.  So if, as I understand the position, the     Ja, you see, what comes to my mind is that if you have a valid reason as to why you have a TA that has not been settled that is in your name.  If you put that advance to the authorities, one, they should accept and then should approve that you get cash for a legitimate purpose.  Or, if they do not approve, then they should accept that you cannot work with the cash until that TA has been settled.Once you have a situation where a member who is in that situation goes to another member and ask that that member should take the money out in their name, that seems to be me to be irregular.  That seems to me as if that member seeks to get that money for an illegitimate purpose because if it is for a legitimate purpose, there is no reason why it should not – the authority should not approve that the cash be given to him or her even if he has got a TA in his name because they are satisfied that there is a good reason for the fact that the TA has not beensettled and they are satisfied that it is for a legitimate purpose.  You understand that/     Yes.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     Ja, your line seems to be breaking but just try again.     Well, are you saying there is nothing wrong in a person – in a member who is, as I understand the position, disqualified from receiving cash,    What was the page, Mr Pretorius, page number?     Mr Pretorius, is that the one under Section 1 that you were asking about?     Okay.     That is first of the two signatures, hey?  It looks like there are two signatures or is it one, Mr Pretorius?     Ja, okay.     It is written in where it is …[intervenes]     Ja.     That is page …[intervenes]     Just one second, Mr Pretorius, for the transcript, it is page 440 of the bundle, bundle 2.     Is that 440 of the affidavit?  Okay, alright.    Did you take this money to him on somebody’s instruction?    On whose instruction?     Okay and when was this?  Was it November 2016?  I am looking at your document here.  When was this?     Oh but are you tell which year it was when you took the money to Minister Mahlobo on this occasion?     Oh.     Yes but are you able to say whether that was 2016 or 2017 or when it was?    2016.  Towards the end of the year?     Yes.  You withdrew the money and you put it into a bag and then on the same day you delivered it to Minister Mahlobo’s residence, is that right?     This particular residence to which you delivered it, was it in Pretoria, was it in Cape Town or where was it?    Yes.  And when you arrived at his residence was he the only person that you interacted with or did you first have to speak to somebody else who then told you where he – in which room he was an you wentthere?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And would they have then told you to go into the study?     Oh, he was waiting for you when you entered the door?     Yes.     Was there a conversation that took place between you and Minister Mahlobo other than you saying I have brought you money, this money or something to that effect?  Did he say anything himself?    He did not say anything or you cannot recall whether he said anything?     Yes but you counted the money in his presence and when you were done you then left?     Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?  I see we are at five past one.    Yes, okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Ja, okay, alright.     Okay.  No, that is alright.     We will take the lunch adjournment then and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES     Let us continue.     Mr Pretorius, I am sorry, I notice that these two bundles that we are using or we were using just before lunch, they both have numbers that are more or lessthe same, so it is important to say which bundle each time we refer to a page otherwise somebody reading the transcript might go to a wrong bundle for a particular reference.  Dorothy, the question is whether …[intervenes]     Is it the last document on bundle 2.     Maybe let us just for clarification get thisright, Dorothy.  You are not including in the three occasions the occasion you talked about earlier where you delivered a bag to Minister Mahlobo but you had not checked whether there was money inside.  You are not including that one, is that correct, or are you including it?    You are excluding that one.  Okay, alright.  So you have told us about another one where you withdrew the cash yourself and you delivered it to Minister Mahlobo.     And you said you found him in his study.  So that is the one.  So you will tell us about the other two.  Mr Pretorius?     Hang on, hang on, Dorothy.     Hang on, Dorothy, hang on, Dorothy,take one at a time.  Tell us about one of the two occasions.     And then you will tell about another one.  Tell us about one at a time.     No, hang on.     Sorry, Dorothy, sorry, sorry.  You see, the earlier one you told me somebody instructed you to go and withdraw the cash, how much you – you told us you withdrew the cash.     How much it was and that you then proceeded on the same day to Minister Mahlobo’s residence.  Start at the beginning.  Whose decision was it, were you carrying out somebody’s instruction, was it your own decision and did you withdraw it yourself, how did you carry it, was it in a bag and so on.  Okay, start.     Okay, on the first occasion you were alone.       On the two occasions you were with Lilly, is that right?    And was the amount the same on each of these occasions?     And on each occasion you had beeninstructed by Darryl.  Is that right?     Okay on each …[intervenes]     And on each of the three occasions when you delivered – when you say delivered money to Minister Mahlobo you did see the money?     Yes.  And on each occasion – well, you told us about the first occasion, that there was not much conversation between yourself and Minister Mahlobo.  On the other two occasions was there a conversation of any kind or it was just greeting and saying you brought the money or whatever?  How did the conversation go?     Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?     I am sorry, just to make sure I understand the clarification …[intervenes]     Just to make sure I understand the clarification in relation to paragraph 13.2, Dorothy, did you say that where it says R7 million in paragraph 13.2 at bundle 2, page 441, it should be R4,5 million or how should it read?     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay, not …[intervenes]     Yes.    Oh, okay, okay.     Okay, no, that is [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Oh.     Yes, okay, we can clarify.  I understood her to say ja – I think, I do not know whether a week or two, but an envelope would come from, as I understood it,from Minister Mahlobo to Darryl but she would not have seen whether it contained receipts or not for the money that she would have delivered.  Dorothy, is that what you were saying?     Okay.     Okay.     That amount of R7million Dorothy referred to in paragraph 13.2.     Did you deliver that money deliver thatmoney, anywhere?     It was taken by who or too where, do you know?     Yes, yes.     Oh.    Oh, so okay, I was under the impression that they sent you there.  So they were there when the money was withdrawn, it was just withdrawn in your name, but they were the ones who were going to need it, is that right?     Okay, alright.  ADV PRETORIUS     Ja, know that is fine, can I ask you thisquestion Dorothy, you say that you were asked by the head of the ANC security, Mr Paul Langer to assist him at NASREC and you asked him to seek permission from your seniors to utilise you and you subsequently wrote a submission to SSA management who gave you permission to assist the ANC.  Was this about assisting the ANC or doing some work for the ANC or the benefit of the ANC as opposed to doing your normal work as part of SSA?     What I am trying to establish is whether the work you were doing whatever it is, you were doing that you regarded as assisting the ANC was not SSA work.  You were not performing – were you performing SSAduties?     You were performing none SSA duties to assist the ANC?     What actually were you were you doing?     Yes, you were not…[intervene]     Was it some kind of intelligence kind ofduty?      No, was it like what traffic cops would     So it is the position…[intervene]     So you were doing what a member of the ANC would have done to make sure that the busesdeparted on time and that all that had departed where they were supposed to depart from that kind of thing.     Transport unit of the ANC?     Okay, alright Mr Pretorius.  Were you going to be paid by the ANC for that or what was the position?      You were not going to be paid by the ANC?     Okay, alright Mr Pretorius.     Okay, she confirmed the correctness of the contents?     Okay, alright.  The affidavit of Dorothy that starts at page 460 will be admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit YY 12.2.     That does that also apply to the amount in paragraph 2 at page 460?     Okay.      That is fine.     Is that in Bundle 2?     Mr Pretorius?    So it was for his protection was it, that you got MK people there, is that right?     522.62, Mr Pretorius?     Yes, you said that.     Okay, Mr Pretorius was saying to you, do you remember that he showed you those receipts?     Thank you very much, Dorothy we have come to the end of your evidence. Once again, we appreciate you availing yourself to try and assist the Commission.  Thank you very much, you are now excused.     Yes, Mr Pretorius?     Ja.     Ja.     Do you want me to adjourn or you want to talk?      Oh, okay act alright, we will adjourn for five minutes, we adjourned. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES  You have taken instructions Mr Pretorius?     Okay, we will adjourn for the day then today and I cannot remember which work stream is on Monday but the public will be notified in due course or over the weekend.       We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct Chair.    And if I may just place on record the orders that you have granted in chambers and will announce now are in respect of Dorothy, Frank and Steven.   The other one is SEQ26 and the third one is SEQ04/2021 just for the record.    Not necessary Chair.   Stephen.    Thank you Chair.  Chair as you are aware Dorothy is now available.    To begin her testimony.  She is legally represented.    And may her representative placehimself on record?    Chair they will emerge there are conflicts.    Yes.    Well we will see how matters turn out.    Chair.  I am glad to hear there is no conflict.    According to my learned friend but when we get to the detail it may turn out differently.    Hopefully not.    Chair the documentation relevant to Dorothy’s evidence appears in Exhibit YY12 in BundleSSA02(a).    Dorothy are you there?   Do you wish to say anything to the Chair before you commence your evidence?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Chair the exhibit which contains all the documents relevant to Dorothy’s evidence is Exhibit YY12.    There are a number of documents including more than one affidavit attested to by Dorothy.    Over a period of time.    I – with your leave may I ask the witness to identify each relevant document when we get to it?   Thank you Chair.  But for the moment may the documentation contained in Exhibit YY12 be put before you?    Yes.    Yes Chair they are all – referred to in the index.   Which is at page 419.2.    SSA04.    Yes Chair.    That is fine Chair.  The affidavit that we will commence with is the affidavit that appears at page 12 to 26.   Of the exhibit but of the bundle black number 431 to 445.    We use the black numbers.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes perhaps we should start there Chair.    Dorothy…    Would you please go to page 431 of the bundle – SSA02.   Is that the first page of your affidavit in that bundle?    And if you could go please to page445 whose signature…    Is that your signature?    Right and you attested to this before a Commissioner of Oaths on the 2 n d of March 2021 is that correct?    Right.  And as far as you are concerned are the contents of this affidavit to the best ofknowledge true and correct?    Chair may this affidavit then be admitted?    12.    12.1 yes Chair.    Dorothy if you could go to page 420 please and we at all times referring to the numbers in the top left hand corner of each page.      Is it correct that on the 20 t h January 21 the commission addressed to yourself a request for an affidavit to deal with various matters and that is the document that appears – appears at page 420 and following?    And the affidavit that has just been admitted by the Chair is the affidavit that you provided to the commission in response to that request for an affidavit, is that correct?   So – so what we are going to do is to go through your affidavit and at times refer back to the questions that were asked giving rise to your answer in the affidavit.  If we could just do it that way please.  The questions are set out in Annexure A to the request for affidavit at page 422 to 424 can you just confirm that please?    Alright so if we go now to page 431which is your affidavit I am not going to refer to your previous positions at the request of your legal representatives to avoid ease of identity of yourself. So if we can go – your background is however set out there.  You have a long experience of employment within the SSA, isthat correct?    Alright we will leave the detail in the written affidavit.  But if we could go briefly to describe the system of dealing with cash because it becomes relevant later in your testimony and in the testimony of other witnesses. There is a process that you set out in paragraph 4 that applies when cash is withdrawn from the SSA for special operations through the use of temporary advances.  You set that out in paragraph 4.  You see that?   No it at para 3.    Paragraph number 4 on page 432.    AT para 3.    If you could just briefly describe step by step please the various steps you set out in paragraph 4.   You can …    Sorry just before you go on.    Dorothy before you go on I would like to just ask you one question.  When you say in line 3 of the second part of the paragraph which required that he/sheprovide the finance chief directorate with a signed receipt of the funds or an invoice when services were rendered the receipt of the funds would be signed – would that be by the for example a source who received the funds?  Who would sign the receipt of the funds?    Alright it could be a source?    Yes or it could be a source I presume.  In other words the final recipient of the funds.    Would sign the receipt is that correct?    Alright presumably when cash is withdrawn and goes out.    Of the SSA to its final destination.    It is the final destination whether that be a service provider or a source or any other destination that would sign the receipt, is that correct?    Alright.    Thank you Dorothy if you would then go.  That receipt then would establish that the funds had been utilised as contemplated in the submission.  You say then at the end of that sentence. If you could just continue then settling an advance.   Right.    Alright.    Now if you could just explain I understand that when the temporary advance is removed from the member ’s name the member would no longer be responsible for that amount and will therefore not be required to repay it if called upon to do so. Do I understand that correctly?    Alright.  If you could on then to paragraph 5.  You continue with the process that is required.    Right if you could just read the first sentence again please of paragraph 5.  There was aninterruption in the transmission.    Okay if we could…    Alright.  Now Dorothy there has been substantial evidence in regard to the required procedureswithin SSA for the use of cash and in respect of the use of temporary advances.  I am not going to take you to all that evidence I just want to highlight one issue and that is where a member has not settled a temporary advance in accordance with this procedure or at all that member is not allowed to withdraw further monies.  That is what you say here, is that correct?    But that system can be circumvented avoided if that member says look I do not have authoritynow to withdraw money or cash but I can ask someone else to do it for me.  There is evidence that that happened. Do you know of that?    Right. If we could then go on please to…    Right.  Thank you.  If we could go over the page please to paragraph 6.  There was in the SSA a directorate responsible for ensuring the protection of the then President Mr Jacob Zuma and the then Deputy President Mr Ramaphosa.  Is that correct?    Right and you set out the duties of the directorate within the SSA in that regard in paragraph 6but I would like to go onto paragraph 7 please on page 435.  You refer there to two groups of individuals referred to as co-workers.    Who were recruited and trained tobe utilised by the SSA.  Would you tell the Chair about those two groups please?    Alright so you have left out some words there if I can just fill them in.    The first group was recruited by Mr T Dlomo when he was General Manager at SO. The second group was recruited by Mr T Dlomo after his appointment as the DGG upon his request for Curricula Vitae of the potential recruits.  These were not SSA members however to my knowledge there were contracts between them andSSA.  Have I read you affidavit correctly?    Yes if you could go onto the next paragraph please or the next sub-paragraph.    Ja I think leave out the next paragraph because it refers to your office but read the paragraph begging with the words “About fourteen members” please.   Or tell the Chair about that.    Alright now the point that you are making here I think and this evidence must be regarded or had regard to in connection with other evidence that has been given but co-workers recruited and trained to be utilised by the SSA in various tasks were not members ofthe SSA but were paid by the SSA salaries to do their work.  Is that correct?    Right.  If we could go then to paragraph 10 over the page please on page 436.     Sure thank you Chair.    Would you go please to paragraphon page 436.    Alright.  Now you will see there a spreadsheet format of references to the questions in therequest for affidavit that we referred to earlier and your comments in relation to those question in the box on the right hand side.      Now if we can deal with the first box. It says in the left hand column ad para 9a. That is a reference to the request for an affidavit sent to you on thet h of January and if we could go to annexure A and look at paragraph 9 on page 422 please.  Paragraph 9 says and I am going to read it.   And you can confirm to me if I have read it correctly. “It is pointed out that the electronic TA record provided to the commission by SSA reflects that you were involved inthe withdrawal of R38.5 million in cash over the period March 2014 to September 2016.  You are required to provide a full account of the aforementioned withdrawals including the amount of – and then we get to  a. R1 million allegedly used to pay MK veterans at the rally held by the ANC on 8 January 16 in Rustenburg.” And in answer to a request for an explanation in relation to that expenditure you make a comment.  What is that comment and we are back at page 436?   Alright.      If I may just ask Dorothy you cananswer the following questions as a general rule one would assume that the ANC would be responsible for its own security or that would be the responsibility of the South African Police.   Why was it decided to use MK veterans to deal with the issues here to identify and report on potential disruptive behaviour?  Firstly they would not be trained.  Secondly one would assume that the duty should rest upon trained persons if anyone at all as members of the SSA – why was this outsourced to MK veterans?   Alright.  You – you have no explanation for why MK veterans were used rather than the ANC’s own security, the police or members of the SSA.   And what we do know however that is that funds from the SSA were used to transport MK veterans to the Royal Bafokeng Stadium for the rally and their transport fees, accommodation and meals were paid for by the SSA.  Is that correct?    Right.  If we could go then please…    Yes.     She withdrew the money so that is apparent from the introductory part of the question.    At paragraph 9.    In other words you were involved in the withdrawal of that R1million is that correct?    And you would have known what it was for?   Yes.      Alright.  Let us go then back to page422 if you will and look at page – well paragraph rather 9b which refers to another question put to you by the    Yes that was the former President.    Yes and you referring to the former President and the former Deputy President, is that correct?    Yes so the current in his capacity as Deputy President at the time, is that correct?    In other words Mr Zuma and Mr Ramaphosa.    Right.  So there was a plan Isuppose you could put it that way that certain individuals wanted to occupy Luthili House at that time or on that occasion and what were the funds referred to that is the amount of R1 850 000.00 – what were those funds used for?    Right.  Now what…   Now what – why were the MK veterans deployed as you say at Luthili House on funds paid for or funds provided by SSA. Was that to defend Luthuli House?    Right.  But the MK members whose transport fees, accommodation, meals and a stipend were paid for by the SSA they were not the persons going to occupy Luthuli House I presume?   Alright.  Let us then go to paragraph 9c if I can take you back please to page 423.    R1.5 million withdrawn in February 17 allegedly used for the State of Nation Address related expenses and which was transported to Cape Town by a SSA member and handed to you – that is Dorothy which you allegedly handed to Minister Mahlobo at his official residence in Cape Town.  That is the question.  It is referredto at the top of page 437 in the table.  What is your comment?    And you deal with it Dorothy at the top of page 437 in the right hand column – the top of the page under the head comment.    Right.  Where was this residence? Was it in Cape Town or Pretoria?    Okay.  Alright but you say you have no knowledge of what this money was intended for and youcannot say that is was a SONA related expense.    Is that correct.    Yes.  And you say that you were instructed by Mr Fraser to receive a bag of money from one security of employ of SSA and to take the same to Minister Mahlobo. What that instruction given verbally, in writing,how was it given?    Right an you then met the SSA member.  Was this a SSA member referred to by Mr Fraser in his instruction to you?    Right.      So money – when you say bag ofmoney how do you know there – it was a bag of money?     When you handed ...[intervenes]      ...it to minister – when you handed the bag to Minister Mahlobo, you actually say here in your     Sorry, I did not hear the answer.     Alright.  From all the circumstances ...[intervenes]      Sorry.  When you handed, as you say here the money to the Minister Mahlobo personally athis official residence, did you hand it to Minister Mahlobo himself?     And from all that you were told then, the instructions that you were given and the circumstances of the receipt and transfer of the money to Minister Mahlobo, are you satisfied that you handed R 1.5 million, as mentioned, to Minister Mahlobo?     Alright.  Are you satisfied from all the circumstances that you were handing money ...[intervenes]      ...if not the exact amount.  Is that – can we assume that from your evidence?     Thank you.  If we can move on tothe next issue.     Thank you.     Then in paragraph (small) “d” on page 423, another topic is drawn to your attention and you were requested to provide an explanation of certain     Yes.     Do not give the address.     No, I am sorry.  I came too late to say you should not mention the address but be that as itmay.     The last paragraph.     Was that claim settled and the expenditure of that amount settled by way of receipts ...[intervenes]      ...as you set out in your affidavit?     He is the investigator concerned,Chair.     No, Chair.     No.  She was asked to explain and an explanation was given.     And her evidence says that it was done in accordance with proper procedure.     ...by the Legal Team on that issue.     If we could go on, please, toparagraph 10 which appears on page 423 of Bundle SSA-02.  If you could go back to page 423, please, Dorothy.  You were asked certain questions about Project Construção.  That project has been detailed in evidence that has been given before the Chair before but essentially you say that you were not aware of co-workers who performed protection services and were part of Project Construção.  That is apart from what you have already told the Chair in relation to the two groups of co-workers that you referred to earlier.  Is that correct?    ...for comment, Dorothy, appear on page 438 at the bottom of the page.  Did you sign an omission in respect of funds to be utilised for Project Construção and do you have any comment in that regard?    Alright.  And ...[intervenes]  MS     Alright.  And you say in the second     Alright.  Let us go on to paragraph 11, please.  You are asked to comment on the following     It is of course to what is said below.     Right.     Paragraph 11.1 asks for – or let us go – start again so that it is clear.  On page 423 in paragraph 11, you are asked of your knowledge of certain operations and your answer is at page 439, paragraph 11.1.  What is that answer?  So go to paragraph...[intervenes]      Ja.     Dorothy, where you are sitting, have they provided you with water or tea or something tohelp you?     Alright.  Well, if you need anything ...[intervenes]      Yes, perhaps Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Dorothy, can you hear us?     Thank you.  Let us then move to the question which appears on page 423 in paragraph 11.2.  You were asked in that question to give detail or explanation in relation to the withdrawal of cash for Project Mayibuye reflected in Annexures M5, M16, M17, M18 and M19, indicating in each instance for what purpose thefunds were withdrawn and to whom payment was made.  Now those annexures appear in a bundle which should be before you, Bundle 1, and I am going to ask you to turn now to page 439 where your comments in relation to those documents are contained, okay?     So do you have Bundle 1 in front of you?     If you could go to page 384 ofBundle 1, please?     [No audible reply]      That is Annexure M5 which is oneof the documents referred to in the question put to you.     and if you could go, please, just briefly through, from page 385 to 386.  The signature at the bottom of page 385 above the date 15 November 2015, whose signature is that?     And if you go to page 386, there is another signature next to the date 15 September 2015, whose signature is that?    Alright.  The approval by line management appears to be a S T Dlomo.  Do you confirm that?     Yes ...[intervenes]      ...a page.     And then if you go over the page,     “...received R 5 million, an  amount(?) [background noise interference] R 5 million only for the purpose of...”    Alright.     Want do you know about thesetransactions?     Alright.  let us take a few questions step by step, please.  The receipt in Lilly’s handwriting, on what page does that appear in Bundle 1?  Is that ...[intervenes]      387?  You say that is Lilly’s handwriting?     Correct.     And you say that that transaction was outside your scope of work but your name could have been assist in taking money.  Is that correct?     Why would your signature appear on those documents?     But you are taking it for someoneelse who is actually dealing with the project, is that right?     Would that be necessitated, for example, if Lilly had outstanding TA’s which had not been settled?  Would that be a circumstance which would require this?     Is that right?     Thank you, Chair.  Just insummary, Dorothy.  It seems that two issues arise out of the evidence you have given and what you are about to tell the Chair.  The first is that a member of the SSA may have not settled a temporary advance.  That person then, in terms of the rules, would not be authorised to withdraw further cash but that system or that rule was avoided by asking someone else who was authorised to do it for the person who was not authorised.  Is that correct?     Of course.  Yes, I am taking a general point to you, Dorothy.  And that general point is that, at times, the rule that a person who has not settled a temporary advance may be evaded or avoided by asking someone else to do it for them.  That is all I am putting toyou.  That has happened and you confirmed that.     Correct?     You agree that that has happened as opposed to just noting what I am saying?     Alright.  And the second issue that arises is that it seems that the documents authorising withdrawals of cash and documents confirming that cashhas been expended by way of a receipt or other documents are often signed by people who do not know what was done with the money.  Is that correct, generally, not to a specific case here?     You have said that there is a trail of documentation ...[intervenes]      ...which authorises the withdrawal of cash, the expenditure of cash and the accounting for theexpenditure of cash.  You described that earlier in your evidence.  Do you recall that?     Now that process requires various persons at various stages to sign authorisation or receipt,correct?     Right?     But on occasion, and it seems ...[intervenes]      ...on more than isolated occasions, persons would sign without knowing what the money was for or how the money was spent.     Alright.  Let us then go to the next box which is M16.  I am not sure if it is necessary for us to go to the document, but M16 is a submission dated5 September 2016, requesting authorisation to pay the related expenses for Project Mayibuye for the months April to August 2016.  It was recommended by Dorothy.  Part B of the temporary advance that R 13.15 million was taken by Darryl and the claimsettlement was approved by Dorothy and certain invoices are attached and they – it goes over the page and a company called Nay-washer-ways(?) [phonetically] is mentioned.  Now, perhaps it is better that you go to SSA Bundle 1 at page 468, please.     468 of Bundle 1 but you can start at page 469.  And if you could just go, please, to page 472.     Alright.  And if you go to page 476.     Yes, in the middle of that page,this is one of the green forms, Section 1, Approval of Incurred Expenses by Line Management.  Whose signature is that there?     Yes, Chair.     Then there are further documents which refer to a company whose pseudonym is Napa, N-a-p-a, they are appear on page 478, 479 and 480.  Do you see that?  These are documents in relation to these expenditures provided by the SSA about which you were asked questions, but I just want to draw your attention tothe fact that on page 478 it is indicated the professional fees as per the approved contract were paid in relation to project Mayibuye, do you see that?  R5 300 000.       And then over the page. 479, R5 million, again professional fees for Mayibuye.  Do you see that?     And on page 480, professional fees as per the approved contract project Mayibuye, R2.850million.  Do you see all those documents?     Right.  What do you know about this documentation?  You will see that your signature appears in respect of that documentation on some pages.    Right.     Did you know anything about the services to be provided or provided that appear in this documentation?    But you signed as part of the authorised …[intervenes]     Yes, Darryl would know, Darryl brought it to you but he did not tell you what the money was for, as I understand your answer.     Right.  But was it normal practicefor someone in a senior position to sign without knowing what the money was for?     Okay, it would seem unusual, to put it at its lowest, for someone to authorise expenditure in these amounts of several million rands without knowing what the money was to be used for or what the money was used for.  Do you agree with that?  In fact it would be irregular.       And I am talking about what happened in practice.  I am sorry, I interrupted you.    Yes I stopped myself because I was interrupting you.  Please answer.     Alright, so someone may authorise the expenditure of funds but because of the application of the need to know principle in these circumstances that person would not know whether the money was going to be spent in accordance with the submission, whether it wasgoing to be spent properly, whether it was going to be spent at all.  Is that how the need to know principle works in these circumstances?     Alright.  Let us then go to – well, there are further examples in relation to reference document M17 and M18.  The circumstances are similar but let us go to M18, if we could.  Well, perhaps for the sake of completeness we should just mention M17.  That document appears in SSA bundle 1, page 481.  The documentation is    Right.     Alright.  Can you confirm, though, that R4.51 million was withdrawn or taken by Darryl in cash for the purposes at least as appeared on the documentation of the execution of project Mayibuye?      Alright.     Yes.  Well, it is the documentationyou signed, correct?  Or you signed the settlement at least.  Correct?     M18.     Is a similar circumstance, the document appears in SSA bundle 1, page 494 but I am just     Right.  And your explanation in the right hand column, what is that?     Correct.     Alright, let us go to M19 because you do know about that.  M19 appears at page 504 of B1.  If we could go there please?     On page 505 is a request for authorisation payment of related expenses as per the approved project Mayibuye and at the bottom of page 506 is a signature.  Do you know whose signature that is?  Can you recognise it?  It is cut off slightly.  Do you recognisethat signature?     Page 506.     Yes.    Is that Lilly’s signature.  Okay.  You will see that under the head, paragraph 3, Financial Implications, that same amount, covert action expenses, R4,510 million.  Do you see that?  Same amount as the previous two months.  Do you see that?     And on page 4 of that document, which is at page 508, there is a signature against the date 1 December 2016.  Whose signature is that?    Alright.  And on page 509 at the bottom of the page under cost implications.  It is very     And at the bottom of that section isa signature above the date 5 December 2016.  Whose signature is that?     The amount appears clearly in the right hand column, R4 510 000.  Do you see that?    And then, over the page, page 510, there is another signature.  Whose signature is that in the middle of the page?     There is one signature next to the date 5 December 2016.    That Dorothy confirms, as I understand it, as her signature.  Underneath that, there is the name A J, and you cannot read the initial, Fraser and the date 2/12/2016.  Do you recognise that signature?     Whose signature is it?  Are you able to identify …[intervenes]     Mr Fraser’s signature.  And thenthere is receipt – and we will explain this in a moment, R470 000.  Do you see that?     Alright.  Do you see at the bottom of page 510?    Receipt, yes.  The words four hundred and seventy thousand rand appear.  Do you see that?     Yes, bottom of page 510.     Alright.    And then on page 512 at the top of the page in handwriting above the green print is a word settlement, do you see that?     And in the middle of the page, Signature by Claimant.  Whose signature is that?     And then on page 513 is an     Right.  That document then is described in the left hand column at page 440 of your affidavit and your comment is on the right hand side.  What is your comment?     And please do not mention the …[intervenes]     Sorry, can I stop you there for amoment?     The name of the company.     Yes, I apologise, did I not mention it?     Are you there, Dorothy?     The bottom of page 440, you provide an explanation for the contents of the documentation that you have just been shown, M19.  Whatis your explanation?  But please do not mention the name of the company in the last line.     Right.  And then there is an explanation for why the amount of R470 000 appears thatwe have just referred to.  What is the explanation for that?     Right.  Now did you withdraw R4.51 million in cash or R470 000 in cash?     But did you have money in your possession on that day?  Leave aside the amount for the moment.     Cash?    Was it in a bag?  Did you put it in a bag?     Right, did you push the cash in the bag?     Yes.     Alright and what did you do, where did you go?     Right and to whom did you give the money?     Right, in which room in the residence, can you remember?     Alright.  And what happened in the study, if you would just tell the Chair please what you recollect of what happened when you walked into the study?     Alright.  So is it correct that in his presence you counted out the cash in the amounts, whatever amount was specified and supposed to have been handed to him?  Is that correct?     It is a convenient time, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Dorothy, are you there?  Can you hear us?     Thank you.  I would like to go back to margin number M18 on page 440 please?     Yes, Chair, you are correct because bundle 2 is bundle 2(a) and bundle 2(b).  so if you could go to bundle 2(a) the bundle we have been referring to, Dorothy, at page 440.     Against the exhibit number in themargin M18.       If I could just take you to SSA bundle 1.  The documents that form part of M18 on contained there and I just want to take you to specificpages please.  If you go to page 494.     Oh, that is the cover page, so 495 is the request for authorisation.  It is for project Mayibuye, do you see that?     And it is dated the 28 October 16.  Sorry, the 26 October 2016 and on page 496, the signature that you have identified or a similar one which you have identified is that of Lilly.  Do you see that?    Now we know from other evidence and you have referred to a written entry on a document earlier this morning that project Mayibuye involves Operation Justice, Operation Lock and OperationCommitment.  Do you recall that?     Now if you go please to page 498 of bundle 1.     There is a series of signatures related to the request for authorisation, all recommended.  At the bottom of page 497, do you recognise that signature, right at the bottom?     No, page 497, it is not a green form, page 497, before the green form.     Whose signature is that?       Right.  And then on page 498 at     Did you know that to be correct that the Minister had approved the project or the funding for the project?     Right, that is Dwayne’s signature?     Yes, but he is saying funding of the project was approved by the Minister …[intervenes]     Do you know whether that is correct or not?     It is correct?     If you will go to page 500 please?  There is a signature below the words – on the green formnow.     Approval by line management.  Whose signature is that?  You have identified it before.     Thank you.  And on page 502     And then there is an invoice on the next page 503.   “Professional fees per approved contract, R4 510 000.”Do you see that?     Right, if we could go back please to page 441 of bundle 2A.     You will recall that there was documentation reflecting the approval for withdrawal of R4.51 million and you said a first delivery of cash would have been in the amount of R470 000 and you said you would have made up the difference via delivery at a latertime.  Do you recall that evidence?     What did you say?     Yes, please.    Alright, so you did not take the amount in two batches, you say you would have taken the amount drawn …[intervenes]     You said you would have taken the full amount of R4.51 million.     Is that correct?     Okay.  Sorry, I misunderstood you, but I just do, in any event, want to take you to a document provided to the investigators by the SSA.  It appears at the back of bundle SSA02, page number is 522.137.  If you could go there please?  It is a schedule of expenses or it is a schedule …[intervenes]     Bundle 2, the same bundle inwhich your affidavit appears but at the end of the file, back of the file.  Do you see there is a schedule …[intervenes]     It is page 522.137 but it is not the large document, it is a single spreadsheet, it is the firstdocument with that number on it.  Do you see it?     7.     This is a schedule prepared by the investigators or by the SSA, I am not sure which, but it is a summary of the temporary advance records of the SSA and if you look at the dates in the left hand column and you go down to 8 December 2016.    You will see two entries on 8 December 2016.     For – and you look at the right hand column, for project Mayibuye.  Do you see that?     And the two amounts of R470 000 and R4 040 000 which would total the amount that we have spoken about.    4.1, 510, yes.  So that seems to …[intervenes]     …coincide with your evidence thatthere would have been two withdrawals on the same day. Correct?     Okay.  Now if we can go onto paragraph 13 of your statement on page 441 please?  You say in paragraph – well, what do you say in paragraph 13.1 regarding deliveries to any person, deliveries of cash?     Now you gave a description of the first occasion next to the entry M19 on page 440 that you delivered cash to Minister Mahlobo.On the other occasions, what did you do, did you deliver the money personally?     Right and …[intervenes]     Yes.  Please describe whathappened on the other two occasions?     Thank you, Chair.  Dorothy, two questions.  In paragraph 13.1 your mention an amount ofR4.5 million and on page 440 against the exhibit number M19 you mentioned 4.51 million.  Is the amount of R4.5 million in paragraph 13.1 correct?     And secondly, on any of these three occasions was any receipt given to you for having received the money?     If I may just explain the question, Chair?  The amount of R4.51 million appears on page 440.    And in the documentation.     But in 13.1 it is R4.5 million.     That is the correction.     So if you could confirm that, Dorothy, please?     And that is the amount that should appear in paragraph 13.1.Do we understand you correctly?    Right and then 13.2 you refer to another occasion.  What is that occasion?     Well, before we go there, I would need to ask you just one more question.  You say that Mr Mahlobo did not give you a receipt for the money or you did not request a receipt for the money on any of the three occasions that you have now referred to.  Did anybody else give you a receipt, a protector or anyone in Mr Mahlobo’shouse or anyone else?     So do I understand you correctly, you have not …[intervenes]     Do I understand your correctly that you have not seen a receipt for those three amounts of R4.51 million that you delivered?     Then 13.2 you mention another incident.  What was that?     Right, if we could get 13.2.  What is the incident there described, if you could tell the Chairplease?     Alright, what – do you know whatthe project was that was the name of the project justifying the amount of the withdrawal of the amount of R7 million?     Yes, the question at least – and that appears at page 423 and 424, seems to indicate at least form the investigator’s point of view – and this we could clarify later, reflects the amount of R7 million as being related to project Mayibuye.  Do you see that on page 423 and 424?     Yes, if you look at the top of page424.     The bottom of the page, you see there is question 12?     And at the top of page 424.    You do not – you have no reason to think that that is incorrect, do you, as I understand from your answer?    Alright.     Now before you delivered the R4.51 million on three occasions to Minister Mahlobo, doyou know whether such deliveries were made and if so, who would have made them?     So what did Darryl do?     And after your three occasions thatyou delivered money, as you have said?  Do you know whether the deliveries continued and if so, by whom?     Okay, we may come back …[intervenes]     Yes.  We may return to that issue later in relation to another document but let us go then to page 424.  Once again the questions that were put to you.      And does the same apply to the amount of R7million, the two amounts of R6million and R1million respectively.     Right.     I am sorry, I interrupted you.     Okay, and the reason for thatarrangement Dorothy, as I understand your statement, was that Frank could not draw money because he still had to account or clear money at finance before he could take further monies.  Is that correct?     Alright, in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 of your affidavit, you refer to amounts relating to Project Hollywood, Project Accurate/Construcao and Project Tin Roof, right.  You say in respect of Project Hollywood, that you cannot recall this advance and youcannot respond meaningfully in the absence of receipts. Is that – do I understand it correctly? Even though you approved it according to the documentation.     I am so sorry, alright.  If you go to page 442 of Bundle SSA 2A, paragraph 16.      There is documentation referred to there in relation to Project Hollywood and it appears thatyou approved a settlement of R 107,766, 96.  Do you see that?      Approved by yourself.     Yes, 766 96.  Do you see that, the figure that appears in the box?     Yes, I know but I was wrong.  So I have corrected myself maybe that had got cut out.  It is R107,766,00.     Alright. Now according to the documentation, you approved the settlement but you say you cannot recall that advance and in the absence ofreceipts, you cannot respond meaningfully.  Is that correct?     And then in paragraph 17 there is an amount referred to in the documentation of R16,370,000 recommended by Dorothy - we can go to the documents if you like, but you say that you cannot recall what Project Accurate was about that is the project for which the amount was approved or Project Construcao, correct you say you were neither project manager nor a participant of Project Construcao?    Alright, so you cannot really assist in respect of that amount and that project, it is safe to say that you really did not know much about the use of the monies or for what the use for which the money wereintended, is that correct?     Alright.      Okay, so you were involved in the chain of authorisation for the withdrawal of the money in relation to Project Hollywood and Project Accurate and Construcao but you have, as I understand it, very limited knowledge of how that money was used.  Is that correct?    And does the same apply to the statements made in regard to Project Tin Roof on page 443, where you say in relation to the amount of R3,677,200,00 that amount you have limited knowledge of its use, except that it was for Project Tin Roof.  Am I correct?     Right, then in paragraph 19 I wouldlike to ask you to exercise some caution here in the first five lines of paragraph 19.  What do you what do you wish to say to the Chair?     You need not mention any names, but just deal with the first five lines, please, in paragraph 19.     Well, it does not matter you can mention his name.  I am sorry, I am interrupting you, you can mention that name.     Yes, you can.    Both.      That person is not – sorry before you go on Dorothy sorry perhaps I had better check.  The person whose name is mentioned in the first line of paragraph 19.  He is not an operative or a member of the SSA, is he?      Alright, so you can mention hisname.     Now without going any further in your document, and I will explain to the Chair why in a moment.  Did you withdraw any money for these purposes?     And was there any other money withdrawn by yourself for the purposes of assisting theANC at the conference?     And what did you do, can you say that or is that something you should not say?     Alright, the remainder of the paragraph deals with an allegation which I have asked ourinvestigators about.  It is an allegation Chair, which is hearsay upon hearsay, and we have absolutely no confirmation that this was contemplated or done, I do not feel it appropriate to put it before you.     If you go please to page 460 ofBundle SSA 2A, please, Dorothy.      This is another affidavit which appears to have been attested by you.  Is it correct that you attested to more than one affidavit for the purposes of the Commission?     And if you go to page 468, is that your signature?     As far as you are concerned are the …[intervene]     Yes, you are quite correct, my apologies, 467 is your signature and the signature of theCommissioner of oaths appears on page 468, is that     Good, as far as you are concerned, are the contents of this affidavit true and correct?     This will be Exhibit YY 12.2, Chair.     Yes and she's drawn my attention to the precise - is on page 467, where her signatureappears.     Now, as I understand it Dorothy this affidavit was prepared in response to a Rule 33 notice that you received in respect of the statement to affidavit of Lloyd Mhlanga, is that correct?     Now, we are not going to deal indetail with its content save that I would like you please to refer to paragraph 2.2.  What do you say there?     Alight, and if you could then just read on to the record, please or just - yes, I think it is important that you read the detail from paragraph 2.3 to paragraph 2.21.     Yes, please.     I am sorry, Dorothy, for interrupting you.  That R4.5million, do I understand that should read R4.51million?     And while we are about it, paragraph 2.21?     Alright, apologies for interrupting,if you could continue, please.     Please continue.    Alright, you go on in the statement, Dorothy to talk of an occasion when you were asked to collect arms, firearms from the Musanda Armoury that isthe SSA Armoury, is that correct?     Who gave you that instruction?     Did you collect the arms and ammunition?      And where did you take them?     Right.  Is this normal practice for an operative such as yourself to be told to go and collect arms for someone else?     Were the arms collected from you, the arms and ammunition?     Did - after this, well, did you have any idea of what the firearms were to be used for?     Did you later raise this event or the facts related to this event to anybody at SSA, anyone in authority at SSA?     Right and were all or some returned?     Is that in paragraph 3.19 on page 465?     So you say there    So, what happened in relation to these missing rifles and pistols?     You say in your affidavit that you saw a document indicating that two more pistols had been recovered and that outstanding was one pistol and two R4rifles, you say that in paragraph 3.26.  Is that correct?      And then you refer to evidence of Ms K but you need not go there we can get the evidence directly from her.  Do you have any training or competency qualification in relation to the handling of firearms?     Do you know why you were asked to do this collection and delivery?     Chair, if you would just bear with me one moment please to check that I have dealt with everything.      You have spoken Dorothy of threeoccasions on which you delivered R4.51million relation to Project Mayibuye to Minister Mahlobo.  Do you know why you stopped taking the money, whether money was taken after you did it?     If I could ask you please to go to page 522.     Bundle SSA 02A, Chair.  Thisappears to be…[intervene]     Yes, point 2, SSA 02A 522.2.  This is a transcript obtained from the SSA of an interview you had with investigators in an internal investigation at the SSA on the 3 r d of July 2019.  Do you recognise this just have a look at the names and the first page?     Did you conduct an interview in the internal investigation at SSA?    I do not want to go into too much detail about that but if you could go to 522.68, please.      Chair, I am just checking I am not sure that I need to go to this, is there any detail here about the Luthuli House incident that would help you recollect the expenditure of monies in relation to the Luthuli House hash tag occupy Luthuli House incident?  Have a look at those pages, I do not think there is.  In fact, if you go to page 522.70, we see that you were questioned about the Luthuli House matter and you appear to have said, yes, they signed for this money. We settled and gave finance, and finance takes all our things.So the reason for that operation was because the President was there or the Deputy President was there, yes.  Or was it for the ANC question, and say no, no, no, it was for the principal, who was the principal?     Yes, but the question, I suppose really is not whether those two persons did not deserve protection.  The question is, whether it was appropriate to pay MK veterans to do so, what do you say about that?     Yes, and you do confirm that onpage 71.  Right, if you just bear with me a further moment, Chair. In the same document, would you go to page 522.62 please?     Yes, 522.62.  Right, at the top of page 522.62 on the fourth line, in the same interview, internal investigation at SSA next to the name, Dorothy agreed, that is the part I forgot to ask. “But I can get December, January, she said March remember, I do not remember how long hence Icalled her and I asked, are you sure about February?  She said no.  She said no, February looks like I did not. Then it was March I think last, but then after that, I think it was this girl taking it.  What's her name?”And the name Helen is typed in there, that is not her real name, it is a pseudonym.  “I met the Minister one time and he was like, I do not see you anymore.  I said, Minister, I am busy.  He said, I see they sent Helen to come, I do not see you anymore. I said everything is now with Mr Fraser.” What was being said there, can you explain to the Chair?     Okay, good thank you and then I must just point out something to you on page 522.63 where the question of receipts is discussed and the envelope that you said in your evidence came after the delivery, if you could just refer please to a third down the page of 522.63.     I see, and do you remember that I showed you those receipts?     Kay, let me not interrupt.     Yeah, you say you did not see any receipt signed by Mr Mahlobo but you may have been referring and I think you are now referring to a documents such as the one on page SSA 01503.  Can you confirm that?    So is it that you were telling them about on page 522.63?      Thank you that clarifies that.      Thank you Chair.     Thank you, Dorothy.     Chair, it is decision making time I am not sure that any purpose would be served by calling a witness for the 20 minutes that we had planned would remain but may I consult with the investigator.     They may say that it is worthwhile to spend, say, 15 minutes from half past or quarter to...[intervene]     …on the next witness.     Well, would you adjourn, please Chair because the witness would be a witness who wouldneed to take the oath, they did not take the oath.     Yes, Chair because the witness whom we intended to call next would be required to give some detail in his evidence it would not be advisable tobreak it up.  So if we may Chair, adjourn and reschedule the other witness.     Thank you, Chair. 
ADV RENDANI: Chair Advocate Vumbe Rendani.  Chair I must just note that previously I have been appearing under instruction of P G Maseko.  I must just note the Chair that there have been some change.  I am formally now on instruction from the State Attorney.    However I must note that Ms Palesa Maseko is here. She will also note appearance on behalf ofDorothy and with that regard she will further address the Chair.    Yes.    Okay.    Chair Ms Palesa Maseko will continue to receive correspondence on behalf of Dorothy and she will also be communicating with Chair.  Also with the employer of Dorothy.    With the secretary of the commission correct.   Myself I will be on brief from the State Attorney officially from today.  The issue has been on the pipeline but it has been resolved and I can confirm that I have got instruction formally from the State Attorney.    Thank you Chair.   Chair I am sorry to interfere.      Chair if I am correct I think Mr Pretorius did mention the fact that the oath has already been taken.     Yes and my client just asked me to humbly request that she would like to address the Chair.     Before anything else.   Yes.     No, Chair, maybe I will take the opportunity to, during the break to discuss with the legal team.     It is around the evidence in particular the annexures.     I will address it with the evidence leader.    Thank you, Chair.     Chair, sorry to disrupt.  Chair, can I ask – my learned colleague had asked, even though we will have record, there was a question and answer and the answer was almost not completed or at least my understanding, if I may seek clarity.  She testified that a week or two an envelope will come from Lilly.     That statement was incomplete when mylearned colleague interrupted.  I did not get that.  If we may…     Thank you, Chair.  
ADV ADONIS: Chair I know my colleague I am 00   Chair.   Chair I am – should I just take this opportunity to place myself on record?    I will be representing Dave – obviously – my name is Lehlohonolo Peter Adonis.    As I appeared previously.    I am still on record for the former MinisterDavid Mahlobo    And now I also act on the instruction of the witness pseudo name Frank.    That is correct.    So I am appearing for both.    Chair thank you.   Chair I – obviously with my ethical rules have enquired insofar as the client is concerned and the documentary evidence that was presented to me.    From where I am sitting Chair but obviously I would not engage with the legal team.     We have not in actual fact I have confirmed this with my initial client being the former Minister.    And at looking at the documents as I was briefed.   There is no conflict from where I am sitting at.  But obviously with caution we will thread Chair moving forward.    Thank you. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes I am here.    Yes I would.    Yes.      Yes I am ready Chair thank you.    Okay.  Thank you for allowing me – okay thank you for allowing me to put my version forward and speak out against the old allegations that have in the course of the commission been said against me.I have over the years served my country with greatpride and joy.  Never at once with any malicious or personal saving intent.  Taking into account the nature of the work that I did I have further had to compromise on my personal life because the code of conduct that all served by was that the safety of the state and those under our care was alwaysabove our own personal lives.This led to me suffering a great deal and compromising much of what being human encompasses.As I sit here today I can confirm that I carried out all my duties to the best of my ability.  Following all the rules, procedures and observed protocols that were set in place and never serving my own personal interests.Given the nature of the sector that I worked for I would like to point out that in keeping in line with the one principle that governs our behaviour that beingconfidentiality.I carried out every single one of my duties on a need to know basis careful to never cross lines or go beyond my scope of which – of work which was a doctrine that I understood from day 1.Any questions asked were always only in line with gaining and understanding of what I was being tasked to do and thus subsequently coming out – carrying out that task.  It is safe to say that I was always careful not to ask for more.It is my intention in sitting here today and participating in this commission to testify to the best of my ability and work through with the commission to ensure that all questions are answered and endeavours of today are met.  I thank you.     Thank you Chair.   Okay I am there.    Yes.    Yes I confirm that is me.    That is mine.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes I agree.    Yes it is correct.    I confirm true.    Correct Chair.    Is that at para 4?    Or 3?    Okay.    Okay at para 3 okay.    Okay.      Cash was withdrawn from the SSA for CDSO through the temporary advance system.  A TA required that the member taking the advance to compile amemorandum known as a submission requesting the advance and motivating the use of the funds for the specified operation of project.Once a submission has been approved by the person with the delegation of authority to do so which was dependent on the amount requested the member would then make an application on a green TA form and hand this to the finance chief directorate with the authorised submission to process the payment.The chief directorate finance would then issue a TAnumber to enable the member to withdraw the agreed amount of funds in the form of cash and or electronic funds transfer.After the funds had been withdrawn and used the member was then required to settle that advance which required that he or she provide the finance directorate with a signed receipt of funds and or invoice when services were rendered.Establishing that the funds been utilised as contemplated in the submission settlement advance…   Also required that part A – okay.     It would be the service – it would vary.  It would either be the service provider, it could be anybody because when you signed receipt it varies whatever service that that member was going to provide – whatever project that – so it would vary.  It cannot – I cannot specifically sayit is a source or it is – it could be anyone.    It could be a service provider to a company.    Yes.    Excuse me Chair I did not hear that part.   Yes.    Yes.   Chair.  Hello.    Oh okay.   No there was a slight – there was a slight     Interference just little bit but I heard what he said.  I think you said that the signed receipt would be signed by the – by the source.  I did not – can you please just repeat it one more time for me.    I heard you now Chair.   Clearly.      So I do know if Mr Pretorius will start – I    There is a delay.    Definitely they would be expected to sign the receipt.    Okay.  Settling an advance also requires that part B of the TA form be completed by the member for approval by way of the line manager.  Once part B of the TA form had been signed the claim would be settled by the chief finance directorate and the TA was then removed from the member’s name.    Yes.   Yes.    Correct.   Here it is in relation to cash withdrawals.  All cash TA’s requested had to be any withdrawal thereof. On any TA requested and approved if the amounts and fell short of the amount taken no cash was returned the amount of the unpaid funds would be loaded on the system and deducted from the member’s salary.Should there be monies outstanding or not settled by the member they would not be allowed to take out any further money until the advance taken by them is fully settled.    Okay.  All cash temporary advance requested had to be authorised by the CFO before any withdrawal thereof.    On any TA requested and approved if the amount of money spent fell short of the amount taken and no cash was returned the amount of the unpaid funds would be loaded on the system and deducted from the member’s salary.  Should there be monies outstanding or not settledby the member they would not be allowed to take out any further money until the advance taken by them is fully settled.    Yes correct.    Yes it has happened.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    It is the line manager and line management from the chief directorate finance.    They do – to the line manager of the …    Yes.    Yes.  It would be the line manager of the chief directorate.    Hello.      Okay.  It would be line manager of the member requesting the funds.    And to a certain extent the line manager of    It is quite a number of people Chair it is not only two people it is quite a number of recommenders and finally to the approval.    Yes in our case it is the member that takes it from office to another.    Because we did not have systems at    The approval.    No, no it is – okay the CFO only comes in if the member is requesting cash.  It is the CFO that can authorise.  Right you can receive cash or not.   Yes.    Yes on the green form there is a portion.    On the green  form there is a portion that   Correct.    Yes.     Two groups of individuals whom we refer to as co-workers were recruited and trained and utilised by SSA.  The first group was recruited by Mr Dlomo when he was then General Manager at Special Operations.The second group was recruited by him after his appointment as the DDG upon his request for Curricula Vitae of potential recruits.These with my knowledge they were contractedbetween them and SSA.    (Inaudible.)    Yes.    Okay.  On the – on the instruction of Mr TDlomo we at SO utilise individuals from these groups including the PSS.  To my knowledge the co-workers employed in Special Operations were paid monthly salaries through one of our companies by our HR consultant at CDSO.May I continue?    Okay.    Okay.  About fourteen members from the second group who were sitting at home after their training were then assigned to assist us at PSF.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  By instruction of Mr Dlomo this was in relation to the rally held by the ANC on the 8 January 16 in Rustenburg.  We used MK veterans who were deployed to the Royal Bafokeng Stadium to assist with identifying and reporting on potential disruptive behaviour of attendees at the events.  The funds were utilised to cover their expenses such as    Correct Chair.    Yes correct.    Yes Thulani Dlomo.    Chair Mr Thulani Dlomo would be the better person to answer this question.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes as stated in my comment.    I do not remember Chair because I do not have copies of that – the settlement – the document in relation to that.    Occupy Luthili House was – it was a # that was created by certain individuals who wanted to come and occupy the offices of Luthili House on the day when the President and Deputy President were to be – for the weeklymeetings.    That take place on the specific day.    The former and the current.    No current (inaudible) in his capacity as President.   Yes.    Yes Chair.    The funds were utilised to cover expensessuch as stipends, transport fees, accommodation and meals of the MK veterans who were deployed then.  I worked with the head of the ANC security which I will not mention his name Mr T Dlomo instructed me to make requisition and pay for all the expenses related to the operation above.    Yes.    I confirmed.    I think Chair – I think my answer is going to be the same as the one for the Rustenburg rally wherein I think Mr Dlomo being the person that had requested that we utilised these people he is the best person to explain what was the rationale behind having the MK members come toLuthuli.    Yes they were not the person to occupy.    Okay.    Chair I did not hear what it –     Okay.  Can I just correct something hereChair?    These expenses were not related to SONA in terms of my work.  I – what I said there was that I was deployed in Cape Town for SONA and then I was called in relation to this amount.  Because I hear Pretorius talking about it is SONA expenses.     I do not know what the money was meant for but nonetheless during my deployment – I was deployedto Cape Town from- for the SONA event.  During my deployment I was instructed by Mr Fraser to receive a bag of money from one security employee of SSA and to take the same to Mr – Minister Mahlobo.I met the SSA member and collected the bag of money as was instructed from him.  I then handed the money to the Minister Mahlobo personally as his – at his official residence.  I cannot recall if he signed for it or not nor how the TA was settled.    In Cape Town in Cape Town the official residence in Cape Town.    Yes.      I am saying I am not sure if it was SONA related.  I was deployed there for SONA but I am not sure if the funds were for SONA related expenses.    Verbally.    Mr Fraser would not have known who specifically the member would be.    That is bringing the money.     Because I was told he is bringing money.     ...amount    Yes, Chair.     I do not remember Chair the part that I opened the bag or not.     Yes.    Yes.     [Speaker unclear]     I said, did he mention anything?  [Speaker unclear]    Sorry, I did not hear that part?     Yes, I did.     I cannot be – I cannot say that I am one hundred percent satisfied that I handed one point five.  Ihave relied on the instruction that I was given that there is an amount of one point five that is coming and then I need to take it Minister Mahlobo.     Yes.     Yes, you can.    Yes, Chair.     I cannot recall.  I cannot recall Chair if weopened the bag.     Yes.     Mr Fraser informed me that there will be an amount of one point five coming and that I should take it then to Mr Mahlobo himself.      We met personally.     We met personally.     In Cape Town.     In Cape Town.     It was not in an office but I do not recall the exact – I am not very familiar with Cape Town.     Ja, I am not very familiar with Cape Town but it was in Cape Town, not in an office, it was at – in aparking somewhere.  I do not remember where.  I drove there and he – I waited for him and he came there with his car.     [Speaker unclear]     Obviously, he came with his protectors.     No.     Okay.  The conversation was that there will be money coming.  He did not indicate who the person is who was going to bring the money.  I was to receive a call.  So he would not have known who is bringing themoney because he issues an instruction and then somebody delegates a member to bring the money.  So he would not have known who brought the money.  But I am going to receive a call and there is money that is going to be coming.  I must take it to Minister Mahlobo.    Yes.     Yes.     Chair, I knew it was money because he informed me.     Yes.     Yes.     One point five million.    Yes, I had.     No, it was to my first time.     Yes, I had been.     I would not recall that, Chair.  It has been a while back.  I would not recall ...[intervenes]      ...what conversation we then had.    I do not remember but – I do not recall but sensible it would – I would have that conversation to     No.     There was not any conversation.  I just informed him that I was tasked to bring this bag to him.  I knew what was in there.     Yes ...[intervenes]      Yes.    No, I personally was involved.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.    Yes, Chair.     It would – the stuff(?) is usually paid after the event and obviously the food is on a daily basis.     And the accommodation is once-off.  Ja,so it varies.  It depends on the days because the food – they eat on a daily basis.  So.     Chair, I do not recall.  As I said that the documents would actually guide me in the sense of when did they come and when did they leave.     ...from different venues.  So I would not remember.     ...when they came and when they left.  Whether it was the day before or two days before.  I do notrecall.     Do I read from    Okay. “I met Mr Alan Nickson on the 19 t h of November 2020, where he asked me about the R 500 000,00 that was transferred into my bank account. I said to him that I am not sure about this but we will go and get a printout of my bank statement to verify this transaction.I received my statement and called Mr Nickson on the very same day of the 19 t h of November 2020 to inform him that I can confirm receipt of this money. I further informed him that it was for furniture and other expenses which were related to the rental of the safe house at Bloubergstrand. Mr Nickson asked for the physical address of the safe house which I had forgotten. I then called Lilly who also could notremember the exact address ...[intervenes]      “...but it was in [redacted]  Excuse me?     Oh.     “Mr T Dlomo instructed me  to make a requisition and pay for all expenses related to the above...”     Yes.    Yes.     The house.    The expenses related to...  Yes.     No, Chair.    In November 2020 is when I had the discussion ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     [No audible reply]      It is an EFT from SSA.     Yes.     It is to pay the expenses related to the acquisition of the rental of the house which is inclusive offurniture and other ...[intervenes]      ...and other things related to the house.     Yes, Chair.  Rented safe house.     Correct.     Chair, you will bear with me.  I have hive- fever.  So my voice would – if you do not ...[intervenes]      ...have a glitch.  I signed this submission in my capacity as the acting General Manager.     Correct, Chair.       Correct.     Chair, I did not get that.     I was not involved in the...  11.1?     Okay. “I was not involved in the conceptualisation of Project Mayibuye nor played any role in the operations of Justice, Commitment and Lock...”     Yes, I am drinking.  As I said I do have a bout of flu which is hay fever.  So.     That is my voice is... [Speaker unclear]     Yes, I can hear you.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes, I do.       Yes.     Yes.     That is my signature.     That is my signature.     Yes.     It is Thulani Dlomo.     No, I do not who Moses is.     [Speaker unclear – interruption in transmission]       Yes.     Okay.  As I have indicated on the     387.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Okay.  My signature would appear in the sense that I am taking the money in my name.  So I have to be the one that signs for it on the green form.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Chair, it would ...[intervenes]      Chair, with this transaction...     The only time, Chair, that I would take money out in my name which is outside of my scope of work is when I am assisting them to take money if somebody within – the project managers or Lilly herself have outstanding TA’s that need to be settled at headquarters.     That is true, Chair, but in some instances the explanation would be that maybe a service provider had not supplied them with the invoice as yet and the work needs to continue.     Ja, unfortunately, Chair, it will be finance that needs to responds to that because that rule came with finance that a person cannot have two TA’s under their name.  One needs to be settled before they can take further advances in their name.     Chair, I do not know.  I cannot answer on their behalf but I am assuming, if the person a way to explain something would have come out of it but in this instance I am not aware what was the situation.     I understand your concern, Chair.  Mr Dlomo signed this green form, the TA, knowing the fact – fully know that I do not deal with projects and this money was not for my work that I was doing.  So I would not be able to really answer in terms of the question that you asked but they went to finance to settle(?) the second TA or not.  But the fact that Mr Dlomo signed the green form, for me it says he was aware that I am taking the money and the person that was supposed to take money why they did not take the money.  Hence, I think I said that I would not be able to account but I think Lilly would be thebest person, really, to talk to this transaction specifically.  But I understand your concern.     I understand, Chair.     Correct, Chair.  But Chair, it is like...  [Speaker unclear – break in transmission] ...something.    As I said now.  When you said illegally.  When you have taken the money illegally.  I beg to differ with him because in the submission – hence I have said     No, Chair, I am not saying that.  I am saying the statement that Advocate Pretorius eluded to earlier to say that I took the money under my name illegally.  So I just wanted just to justify that by saying.  In the submission it does not talk to a name.  So the person could go and ask anybody in assist in taking the money.  I am not talking about the process itself of me taking the money.  I am talking about the submission.  The sense that the submission does not have a name attached to it.  I did had some as illegal, in the sense, that I cannot take money when that submission has got somebody else’s name written.  But I understand the     [Speaker unclear – break in transmission]     Noted.  Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Can you repeat the question?     Yes?     Yes.     Authorisation of receipt? ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.     Yes.    Yes, yes.     True, Chair.     Yes, I am there.
