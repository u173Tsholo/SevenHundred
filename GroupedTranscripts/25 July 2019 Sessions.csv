CHAIRPERSON:Good morning Ms Butheleze, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Okay.    Let us start.    Okay, alright thank you.    Ja.  Please administer the oath of affirmation.    Thank you.      You may proceed.    The file containing the statement by Mr Albert Doctor Radebe will be marked Exhibit HH6.   Do you know what was the reason for this significant decrease in the number of dairy farms?    So you believe that the decline was due to a number of challenges in the dairy farm business?    Hm  Okay.   Why do we not have a clearer copy?    I have been saying whenever there are going to be annexures the legal team must please try and make sure that we have got clearer pictures.      Yes but I am asking why do we not have a clearer copy because I have been saying that for quite some time.  The legal team looks at the statements and annexures in advance.  If they see that an particular annexure is not legible they should try and arrange for clearer copies.      Yes.   Ja I am just going to repeat.  Members of the legal team must please make sure that we get the best copies that we can get.  Sometimes you cannot get a better copy what you have is what you have.    But then I must be informed then I know. But if I have not been informed that attempts have been made to try and get a clearer copy I will take it that no attempts were made.  So let usproceed but a clearer copy should be obtained if possible.    Ja but then we must – if there is a clearer copy you must replace this one even in this statement with a clearer copy.    We must not have a situation where there is a clearer copy in other bundles but an illegible copy in some.      Okay alright.  We may proceed.    So do you know whether the debates or discussions were mechanically recorded when the discussions happened or you do not know?    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Rent – rent free.    Rent free.    Well he says – he said that the project is a scam.    Yes continue.        That is now the number of carcasses you saw on that particular day - on that particular day?    Or you mean over a certain period you saw 45?   Yes.    But as on the day when the media came were they still there – the carcasses – 45 of them?    Yes.    Yes.  Was it possible to – were you able to get anidea of how long the cattle had been – had died by the time you went there?  Could it have been a week?  Could it have been two weeks?  Could it have been much longer than that or it was difficult to tell?    Yes.    And it is obviously …    they – they may have died on different days.   Ja.  Okay, thank you.    Are you able to tell about how many in addition to the 45 you have told me about also died that you were – became aware of afterwards more or less?  In other words how many more did you become aware of that died afterwards?    Yes I understand that but what I want to find out because you said that those 45 were not the last ones to die.  Cattle continued to die after the date when the media was there.  So I am trying to find out whether you became aware - how many you became aware of that died afterwards or - or you did not see any that had died.  You just heard that they were continuing to die.   Okay.    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    By the way did you say you yourself have a lot of experience in farming with cattle?  You yourself do you have a lot of experience of farming with cattle?   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    To focus on, ja.    You have a good idea of how dairy cattle should be handled and should be treated?   Okay, thank you.    So he is a businessman?    Do you know why they attacked you?    In the media – to the media?    Yes.    And what were the difference about?  What – what were they saying and what were you saying on the issue?    And what was the argument?  What was he saying and what were you saying?    In other words what I want is to see whether it was connected with your stance on the Vrede Dairy Farm Project or whether it was about other differences that the two of you may have had.    Hm.    But are you able to say that they attacked you because of the fact that you had reported the – the fact that cows were dying on the Vrede Farm – dairy farm to the media or whether it was about other issues?  Are you able to say what it – it was about?    Okay.   Okay, thank you.    And are you basing that on what they said when they were attacking you or one of them – what one of them said?    But what Bongani’s surname again?    Radebe?    Ja.  Same surname as you?    Yes but he was one of those who attacked you?    Yes.    Yes.  So you say afterwards he – he spoke to you andhe said he was sorry about the fact that they had attacked you but the stance you had taken was the correct one?    He – he still says that now?    Oh, okay and how long after the attack was it when he said this to you?    And you say one of the – of your attackers said the ANC is bigger than you?    Yes.  Just repeat what he said.    Okay, thank you.    That – that is strange. You come as a member of the public.  You say to – you say to the police officer at the charge office.  I want to open a case.  They say they want to consult somebody.  That is what they said?   Yes.    So they went to consult the Station Commander?    Which year was it when you were attacked?    So they refused to open a case for you and take a statement from you because they said there is another office that handles politically connected cases or political motivated cases and that office is in Bethlehem?    But they said they would arrange for somebody fromBethlehem to come and take a statement from you or did they say you should go to Bethlehem?    And that has never happened?    Did the station commander at – is that – it’s not at Vrede Police Station is it?    This happened in Vrede Police Station?    And the station commander at the time was who, what was his name?    So it’s Mr Xhasa?    Ja Xhasa, (name spelt) I think?    He has never contacted you about this case since then?  He has never come back to you to say whether, when he tried to get somebody from Bethlehem there were any problems?   Yes.    Well, I’ve heard, I think from Mr Dhlamini also that he showed the same station commander a video of threats on his life and that station commander and the police station didn’t open any docket and they didn’t take any statements from him.  So you are also saying you went there and you spoke to him, you wanted a case to be opened because you had been attacked and you had actually been attacked onthe same day, you reported on the same day and they didn’t open a case and he said they would need to contact another office in Bethlehem and they’ve never come back to you?    Okay the legal team must please follow this up as well and I need to have report backs on all these instances where I’ve heard evidence that the police or some Law Enforcement Agencies don’t appear to have conducted investigations in circumstances where they should have and they’ve never kept complainants informed as to what was happening with investigations.  I need to have report backs on all of them.  Okay continue.    Okay thank you.    Oh what are their names?    And when were these incidents – when did they happen?    And they were reported in 2014?    And you say up to now, nothing has happened, they were turned away, actually from the police station, is that what you’re saying?   Yes were the attacks on them connected with the dairy – Vrede Dairy Farm Project or were they just – or were they just criminal attacks or were they attacks that were politically motivated by their political opponents, as far as you know?    Yes but they were not involved in any opposition to the Vrede Dairy Farm Project as such, the attacks may have been politically connected but in regard to other matters?    Okay alright, the legal team, I suggest that you don’t ask somebody else to be in touch with the police, if you’re going to ask somebody else to do that, it’s going to take ages.  I suggest that communication with the SAPS about these matters be direct.  If it’s somebody else you’re asking then it should involve just drafting letters that are to be signed by the acting secretary but don’t ask anotherwork-stream to look at that, look at that yourselves, then it’s going to be quicker.    Okay thank you.    Ja let’s try and finish with him.    Okay that will be included in checking exactly what happened ja.    Okay thank you.    I just note that at a certain stage when you called the media about the cattle that were dying on the dairy farm, it was 45 cattle and you also lost 45 head of cattle.    Yes.    Thank you Mr Radebe. Is there anything really that still needs to be covered, you still need to cover?   This dairy farm project?   Do you know whether they are known?    Well how far are the police with the investigating his murder, do you know?    And the third case, or was that the third case?    Oh yes, I – well I’ve been told about that one.    I think the first one you mentioned also I’ve been told about yes.    Okay no thank you very much.  Those were the three cases you wanted to talk about?    Yes, no I suggest that you speak to the legal team and the investigators, give them whatever information you have of cases that you think should be brought to the attention of the Commission, they will look at them and they will know if they falloutside of what the Commission is looking at or not.    Okay.    Okay no, I think that’s very important, it’s a point that has been made by others who have come before the Commission as well.  If you have any information relating to, what you refer to as harassment of whistle blowers and those around them, also talk to the legal team so that maybe another statement can be prepared which can be sent to the Commission and you indicate what you’d like to highlight to the Commission to such harassment.    Yes, thank you very much for having come to give evidence, before the Commission, we are grateful to you for havingdone that, if a need arises you will be contacted and asked to come back again but thank you very much for coming forward. You are excused for now.    We are going to take the tea adjournment now, the time is twenty-five to twelve, the – I’ll take a twenty minute rather than a fifteen-minute tea break, we’ll resume at five to twelve.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay no alright we will – I will stand the matter down so that those formalities can be done before we can proceed.  Hopefully fifteen minutes should be enough.    Okay we adjourn.    Yes Ms Gcabashe.    Yes.  The – I have administered the appropriate oath to the interpreter who will interpret for us in these proceedings.  Thank you.    Okay the file containing the statement of Mr Willie Basson I am saying Willie Basson maybe it is Willie Basson will be marked Exhibit HH7    Will either be a sworn statement or just affidavit.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    No that is fine.    Let us get him sworn or let him do an affirmation first is it not?    Yes.  The interpreter will interpret the oath as well.  Mr Interpreter you can use the microphone on this side.  Ja stand up.  Ja put it on.  Yes.  You will interpret the oath as well.    I am sorry what was the answer?    Oh.    Thank you very much.  Yes are you ready?  Does the interpreter have a separate copy of Exhibit HH?    Oh okay.    Okay.  Thank you.    Okay I am sorry. You might not have understood what the question was.  The question was whether there are any corrections in your affidavit that you would like to bring to my attention?    Thank you.    Yes.    No that is fine.    Okay.    Yes okay you do not need to come close to the microphone.  But you must not be too far but if you are where you are it should be able to work well.  Yes.    As well as?    Oh okay.    Yes.    Okay.    A shed.    A shed.   A shed oh okay.    Ja okay.    How long prior to this visit to the farm had you been – how long before had you been to the farm before this particular visit?    Okay thank you.    Municipality farm.    Meaning that council leaders?    So was it before Estina, was it leased to members of the council who had a farmer who was helping – who was running it?    Okay thank you.    Before we proceed.  Mr Gcabashe we normally go – break for lunch at one but we propose to continue until half past one and take the lunch break from half past one to half past two.  Would that be fine with you Mr Basson and Mr Interpreter?    Yes and for Mr Basson is that fine?    Okay thank you.      7 will be written 07 – WB07 that will be 7.  At the top.   Can you see the yellow tab.    The yellow tab.    Oh they are different colours.    Please ask the people who prepared these things to make sure that we all have exactly the same thing including the coloursof the dividers.      I think go and assist them.  You see if the divider was yellow with them it would be easy.      Yes.        Well …    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Okay.  No I - I must confess I am no longer good in Afrikaans as I once was when I was at high school and I think my Afrikaans is - yours is definitely better than mine but the longer I hear it the better I become.  I improve all the time.  So, okay.  Now Mr Interpreter just listen carefully to the questions as well as to the answers. As you - as you heard counsel is saying she heard Mr Basson saying certain things which were not translated accurately.  So just tryyour best - and I think she will go back to that question - try your best to interpret accurately on both sides.    Yes, okay thank you.  So you may go back to that aspect and get clarification.    Thank you.    Yes.  No that is fine, ja.    Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  Mr Interpreter just listen carefully.  Just interpret just what counsel is saying and no more and then when Mr Basson answers just interpret what Mr Basson says and no more.  Okay, alright.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Alright.  Okay, alright.    Okay, alright thank you.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.   A-R-D.    You said something about the head of the family.  What was that?    Did you meet all …?    Ja.    Okay, yes.  Okay.    Just - just repeat the answer - the full answer.    Sorry.  As I said my Afrikaans is - is not good but the more Afrikaans I hear and the more Afrikaans I try to speak the better I become.  So Ms Gcabashe you have been very good in picking up.  I think you continue to be concerned.    You are very concerned?    It may well be therefore that maybe we should try and get another interpreter.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Mr Interpreter counsel who as I have said understands Afrikaans better than me continues to be concerned about whether you are able to interpret accurately what the witness is saying and what sometimes she is putting to the witness and her concerns arestrong enough that we should try and get another interpreter.  You understand that?    Yes, yes.  Okay, thank you.  Let me find out from - you can translate this - let me find out from Mr Basson whether he would be available tomorrow morning if we were to adjourn until tomorrow morning in order to try and get another interpreter.    Okay.  Mr Interpreter you did not interpreter.  Mr Interpreter interpret what I say - said.  Would you be available tocome back tomorrow morning Mr Basson if we adjourn so that we can get another interpreter?    Oh okay.  No, no thank you.  I think we will do that.  The - in terms of the starting time the witness that you otherwise have for tomorrow is supposed to take how long?    Yes.    Just repeat that please.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Jm.   Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No that is fine.  So what time do you suggest we start tomorrow - 10 o’ clock/half past nine?    Half past nine?    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay, alright.  We - we are going to then - we aregoing to adjourn and tomorrow we will start at half past nine.  So if you could be back here tomorrow at half past nine Mr Basson. MR WILLIE BASSON (through    No thank - thank you very much.  We - we then Page 77 of 77adjourn for now.    Yes Ms Norman.    Good afternoon.    Okay, thank you.

ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Good morning DCJ.    Yes we are.    DCJ    DCJ our witness today is Mr DoctorRadebe.  He is a former DA councillor for Phumelele Municipality in Vrede.  His evidence deals with the acquisition of Phumelele Municipality land by the Estina Dairy Project.    May I ask that the witness be sworn in?    Thank you Chair.    Chair Mr Radebe’s bundle is marked HH6.    Thank you.  Mr Radebe would you please turn into Exhibit HH6 page 1 to page 6.  Do you confirm that is the statement that you made for the commission?    Would you please bring the microphone a little bit closer to you.  Thank you.  And the signature that appears on page 6 of this document, do you confirm that is your signature?    Thank you Mr Radebe.  Mr Radebe would you please tell us where do you live and what do you do for a living?   Thank you.  And tell us about your involvement with the municipality in 2012?    And which organisation were you representing in the council?    Yes.  In your statement you tell us about the event that took place on the 19 June of 2012 during a council meeting.  Would you please elaborate on what happened on that day?    And who accompanied Mr Zwane from the Department of Agriculture?    And what position was he holding at the time?    And then other than Mr Thabethe was there any other official from the Department that you remember?    Yes then tell us what happened then during this presentation?    Did they say in England?    Yes and did they tell you where was the – what is it that they were requesting from the council?    And where is this land?    Yes the agricultural land?    And how much was the municipality making out – making from that land on monthly or annually?    Yes did they explain who or how they identify this land?    The – this request or these type of requests how are they usually tabled at the council?  Will someone come in and make an oral presentation or is there a formal process that needs to be followed?    And it was not on the agenda for that day?   How were they – what is it that they were offering to the council in exchange for this land?    Do you know how much time was still outstanding before the lease that the council had with the farmersexpired?    Yes.    Oh they still had about two years remaining?    Yes and who was going to buy out the commercial farmers that were leasing the land from the municipality?   Yes and you said who made the presentation?  Is it Mr Zwane or was it someone else from the Department?    Okay.  And what else did they tell you with regards to the project that they wanted to use the land for on that day? You deal with that in paragraph 5 of your affidavit which is on page 2.    Sorry how were they going to be given this 0 million?    Yes.   And sorry how does it add up to 400 million then?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes and how was this received by the council?    Yes.    Why do you say it is a scam?  Why did you – how did you reach that conclusion?    Yes do you know then what happened to this request eventually?  Was there a decision that was taken after you deliberated as council members?    Was this a unanimous decision?  Were there any opposition to this particular resolution?    So there were 12?    So the opposition did not oppose this request?    Your concerns?    Yes.    Yes.  On paragraph 9 of your statement you deal with the decline in dairy farming in the area.  Could you just takeus to that or elaborate on that?    Yes.    Hm.    Thank you.  So is the cost of – the cost of feed for these – for the cows that was one of the driving factors, is that your evidence?    Thank you.  And you also talk about the milk processing plants around Vrede were they milk processing plant in the area or close to the area of Vrede?    Hm.    Yes.  Were you informed that for this project there was also an intention to build a processing plant duringthat presentation?    Would that then not be to the advantage of the Vrede people having a processing plant nearby?    Yes but – when you say it made us.    Who are you referring to?    Yes because the councils municipal manager – Vrede municipal manager will come to the commission and say this project was supported even by some of the opposition councillors.   Okay. And in paragraph 11 you deal with the relationship – you deal with the relationship that Mr Zwane had with the  Mayor Mr Motaung can you just elaborate on that?    Yes.    Yes.  And you attach the resolution that was made by the council.  It appears from page Chair.  Looking at this resolution there is no way where it indicates that there was opposition from the opposition party.  In fact this resolution was made unanimously by all parties or by all the members of the council. What do you say to that?   Um.    Yes especially page 7 it is difficult even for me read Chair but…    I will try Chair to see if we can still find a clearer copy.    There are other witnesses that will come and deal with this issue.    Yes.    We will do so Chair.  I believe that there is because there are some other witnesses that will deal with this issue.  They might provide us with a more legible copy than the one that we currently have.    Will – I will do so Chair.    I understand Chair.  Thank you.    Yes.  Mr Radabe I was saying that looking at this resolution that was taken on the 19 June it seems as if this decision to lease the land to Estina was a unanimous decision of thecouncil.  Do you have any comment?    Yes.    Yes.    But …    Chair we will follow up with the Municipal Manager.    Thank you.  Then on – on paragraph 13 you speak of the events that followed this resolution.  Do you know if the lease between Estina and the – Phumelela Municipality was concluded?    Yes.  So the land was not then leased toEstina as far as you know.  It was leased to the Office of the Premier Free State.  Is that your evidence?    Okay.    And – and do you know how long was the lease between the municipality and the Office of the Premier?    Yes.   What do you mean by lease free?    Rent free.    Yes and do you know if the municipality was paid by the – by the Free State – Free State Province for this land …    Or the Department of Agriculture?  Sorry.    Yes.  The Municipal Manager will come and testify.  He will say the lease between the municipality and the province was for a year and they were not involved in the 19 year - 99 year lease.  Do you have any comment?    For the dairy scam or the dairy project?   Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    Proceed.    Yes and he will say for that one year that they had this agreement with the province they were paid.  Themunicipality was made for the land.    Okay.    Okay.  We will take it out with the Municipal Manager.  Let us proceed Mr Radebe.  On paragraph 14 you deal withthe report that you made regarding the dead cows from the farm.  Could you please take us through that?    Which – which time is this?  Which year if you may remember?    Yes.    Yes.    But where they still in that stream?    Yes.    And how many cattle/cows were there that were dumped in that stream?        So were they also in different stages of decomposition?    Yes.        Thank you Chair.  Mr Radebe in paragraph 15 of your statement you express a view as to – a reason why those cattle were dying.  It is your personal view.  Why do you think those cattle were dying in the farm?   Thank you Chair and then you then deal with the – the threats and the attacks that you experienced following the reports that you - you made.  Could you please take us through those events?    Yes.    Hm.    And how do you know that?    Hm.    And what – what is it that they were doing these people – these special force for Mr Zwane what was their role in the Agricultural Department?    Yes.  What is it that they were doing?   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    And how – how were you attacked then?  Who - who attacked you and how were you attacked?    And who is Frans Mokoena?    Yes.    Where was he getting his tenders?  From – is it the Government tenders?    From which departments if you know?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.        Yes and then you …    Thank you Chair.  Did you report theseattacks to the police?    And who is their Station Commander?    And …        Thank you Chair, Chair we have already notified our Law Enforcement Work-stream on this issue of Mr Radebe and his statement was made available to them as well but we will follow up.   Thank you, Mr Radebe would you please then tell us about the further abuses that you experienced as a result of the influence that these people had in Vrede?    Yes and who else?    Yes and the third person?    Will do so Chair, thank you.    Chair I’m told it’s tea time, I’m almost finished with this witness.    Thank you yes.  You then deal with other abuses that you experienced, in paragraph 21 and 22 of your statement, as a result of you having reported this matter, can youjust…(intervention).    Thank you was this also after you reported this – the carcasses at Estina?    Thank you Chair, we’ll take it up with the authorities.    Than you and you deal with what was happening with the State vet at Vrede in paragraph 21 and 22 of your statement would you please talk to that?   Who are these gentlemen now?    Yes.    Stopped dying?    There’s just one issue Chair, that when we consulted with you in Vrede there was a group of men that walked to the venue where the consultation was taking place.  Are any of these enforcers part – were any of these enforcers part of that group?    But Frans Magwena was one of them?    Is there anything that you’d like to share with the Commission?    Yes proceed.    Who was the investigator, do you know?

MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  My name is Albert Doctor Radebe.    No.   Yes.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes I do.    Yes it is my signature.    Well I live in Vrede I am an emerging farmer around the area of Vrede that is where I farm.   Well I was a sitting councillor in 2012 in the Phumelele Municipality which is made up of three units.  Vrede, Memel and Warden.    I was representing the Democratic Alliance.    Well it was supposed to be anordinary council meeting at around in the morning.  Then the then MEC for Agriculture Mr Mosebenzi Zwane came with his crew from the Department of Agriculture and they have a discussion with the ruling party which is the ANC.  That is where they ask us as a DA to delay the council with two hours so that they can re-represent us with the proposal from the Department of Agriculture to maybe to – for the council to lease them land of or for agricultural purpose.    Well it was so many people but theone whom I remember who did the representation Peter Thabethe.    He was the HOD in the Department of Agriculture.    Yes, yes there were other officials.  That one they say is the manager but I cannot recall their names because they did not come with any documents in writing they just presented us with the verbal – with the oral work.    Oh that is when we – Mr Zwane first spoke and told us that they have earmarked Vrede to – to maybe toestablish a dairy farm whereby there will be a milk processing plant.  So they were in the council to ask the council to give them permission to lease that land which is Krynaauwslust in Vrede.  Then thereafter Mr Thabethe came with the representation but he never gave us any written documents he was just doing it orally.  That is when they said there is a company which is called Estina who will work in partnership with a certain company in English which is the big company milk processing plant in England.    I mean in India.  The name of thecompany is Paras.  Then they – they told us about the figures of the money that will be injected in the project.    They requested that the council should lease the agricultural land to the Department of Agriculture so that the Department can establish that dairy plant.     The farm?    The agricultural land is the land around the area of Vrede.  I think it was – it is a big agricultural land which was used by the municipality before.  And by that time I think in 11 around August the council has just taken a resolution to lease that land to the surrounding commercial farmers.  That land I think it is – itis 4400 hectares big.  Then when they represented this story of theirs in the council that land was already rented by the local farmers.     Well you usually – in agricultural point of view you usually charge per annum – a hectare per annum.  And by that time the – the equivalent rate I think it was close to a million because if you – if you lease an agricultural land you just – you check first what is the – is the value of the hectare then plus or minus % of the value of the hectare that is the rental amount per annum.   Not at all.    Well the procedure was they should have written a letter to the municipality so that the speaker and municipal manager they can discuss the matter first with the mayors and if we do have a council meeting that thing – their item can be documented so that it can be on the record.  As this one on the 19 t h you cannot find it in the record of the municipality because they come just before the council meeting and hijacked the council meeting.    No not at all.    They said they will – they will pay the council the money which those commercial farmers were paying to the council.  Then the Department of Agriculture will buy the commercial farmers contract out and compensate them so that they can operate the dairy on the farm.    As this contract – as this meeting took place on the 19 June at the farm you usually – the contract begins on the 1 s t August.      I think it was just less than a year – almost a year.  The contract of the commercial farmers was less than a year old.  They were left with two and maybe two and three months or four months to …    Ja they still have to have more than two years in their contracts.    To what it was represented in the council it was said the Department of Agriculture will – will do the compensation and buy them out.    The bigger – the large portion of the representation was done by Mr Thabethe.    They told us the figures of the money.  They said the Department of Agriculture is prepared to pay 100 million per annum in this project till it get off the ground.  They said the pilot project will be three years.  And in addition of that 300 million for that three years they said then they have also earmarked 100 people who will be beneficiaries in the BEE beneficiary model in that dairy.  Then those people will be given 100 million again which makes it 400 million in all.  Then – which means – which mean…    They said they – one beneficiary will be given 1 million so that they can – they can buy cattle.  That the dairy cattle and bring them into the dairy.    Then they said Estina will…    Well the Department they said the Department has planned to inject 300 for the project.  Then in extra the Department will give beneficiaries 100 million that is what makes it 400 million.    Yes.  Then they also said Estina will come with half a million – will come with 500 million.   Which will be – which will be injected by the – by that big company from India which is Paras.  They said Paras will give Estina that 500 million.  Then all in all when we worked this out then it was close to a billion.  If you maybe you add up the VAT by that time.  It was very much close to a billion.    Well I – I am the – in the council I was the only person who is clued up with the agriculture because I have been farming since 2003.  The council were so excited because the figures that just make people to be excited but when you look at the bigger picture you could see that from the beginning this thing was – was a little bit like a scam because they came in the council with no feasibility study, no business plan, no budget.  They just – they justthrow in figures without giving documentation on how these figures will be generated or will be brought into … ADV ZINHLE    As they hijacked the council meeting just after they left the – the first item in the – in the council was the council of the Department of Agriculture.    As you can – then that is when we asked the question now among ourselves and I was the person who wasasking those questions and say Honourable Councillors this thing if we do not think outside the box then we will get into trouble if we – we approved this certain project.  Because it did not sound like really.  It looked like a dream but if you are clued up then you could see that it was a scam.    In the same council meeting when we discussed the matter I even asked them that how are they going to identify those beneficiaries?  Then the criteria was not clear.  I even warned them.  I said let us not make this thing to be a pay cheque for maybe for party members because most of the time on the ground the party members more especially if there is a ruling party, party members believe that thing has been planted in the – into their minds that each and everything which comes from the government is meant for them notfor the community at large.  It is meant for certain individuals that is where we discussed this matter and say they must table – they must bring forward the criteria in which they are going to identify beneficiaries.  Then I was – I remember then they said I am against development because this thing is going to develop Vrede and it is going to benefit the people of Phumelele.    Just after that then in the followingcouncil meeting then that is when the documentation with regards to this Estina Dairy scam appeared in the council records.  Then that is where we – we – the council took a decision that they will lease the land to the Department.    Well we opposed the [indistinct] and it was a unanimous decision because as we were we were only three councillors from the opposition then the ANC councillors were I think were 13.  All in all we were 15.    There were 12 yes.    Well I do represent my side of thestory from [indistinct].    Yes.    But I represented it personally in my personal capacity as the person who know – who knows about agriculture.  As I am saying all 14 – all 14 councillors sitting councillors by then were not clued up with agriculture.    Around the area of Phumelele when we grew up until late 90’s we had more than 30 dairy farmers around that area and.    As a result when they represented this proposal of theirs we had only three dairy farmers around the area of Phumelele.    Chair I think the – I believe that the reason emanated from the farm gate.  When those farmers were farming by that time the milk processors used to buy maybe a litre maybe they will pay R2.00 per litre from the farm gate and by that timethen the cost of feeding those cattle – those dairy farms has escalated as is well known that dairy cattle need intensive feeding.  They depend on the feeding.  They cannot maybe be driving more than 300 meters from where they are being milked.   So when – I think – I believe that the farmers realised that they were doing a loss with regards to this dairy – dairy business.      Yes inside the farm gate.    Yes that is my evidence I put forward.    Before the decline the milk processing plant which was – it was in Standerton.  It is 50 kilometres from Vrede.  As a result of this decline from dairy farmers around the area then the milk processing plant was relocated to Harrismith.    And Harrismith is plus or minus 110 kilometres from Vrede.  Then the people who were working in Standerton were also – the employees were also transferred toHarrismith that is where they – most of them work even the ones who were residing in Vrede.  Then the other milk processing plant is in Frankfort and from Frankfort to Vrede it is plus or minus 80 kilometres.  I think what made to relocate that milk processing plant is the decline of those dairy milk farmers around the area as by that time as I stated that there were more than 30.  One farmer was milking not less than 0 cattle.  Then you can imagine the litres that they were supplying those milk processing plants around those areas.    They said would – we were informed that it will be a dairy – they will have dairy milk cattle and also utilise the land thereafter then and a big milk processing plant which will supply South Africa.    Well if it was done properly and maybe have people who knows how to do I think it was going to be feasible but as you can see they never gave us any documentation that we can go through and see what is their plan with regards to this thing.  Then that is what made us not to believe it was going to be possible for it to be in operation.    Yes.   As – well when we discussed – usually when we go to a council meeting we do have some – we do hold a caucus but with regards to this dairy thing I was given the mandate to speak about it.  That is what I told my colleague in the caucus that this thing is not going to be feasible.    Well as I stated that I was the one who was speaking about it.  But in our caucus then we – I do stand up – I stood up and tell them that this thing is not going to work.  But in the council then I was speaking alone then I cannot – well I cannot stand in his way and say maybe he is wrong.  He might be right.  But I was speaking from the – the agricultural knowledge which I had with regards to this dairy.    Mr John Motaung who is the Municipal Mayor in the Phumelele Municipality.     Ja he has been a Mayor for three consecutive terms in that municipality because he has been Mayor for –since 2004. They were like brothers with the MEC Mr Mosebenzi Zwane.  That is why the Mayor even in the council that is him who insisted that this project must be approved. I mean this lease must be approved to the Department of Agriculture.    Maybe if I can firstly give the background with regards to this resolution.    Not only this resolution.  The Mayor took a decision in that municipality that anything which I speak in the council must not be written down.  And I think even the municipal manager when he comes here then we ask him I was the only councillor in the whole council sitting who was participating in not less than 80% of the items which were brought into the council meeting.  And you askyourself why such a person is not maybe noted when he is even dealing with such serious things.  We even asked the council that they should record the meetings with a tape recorder but we – we usually have to have a struggle each and every council meeting to – just to have a tape recorder.  Each and every time they will leave that tape recorder behind.  Then we will have to say the meeting must not continue before we have a tape recorder.  As we have recognised that most important issues are not recorded.  When it comes to this one of this dairy scam.    That is why we insisted a lot that a tape recorder must be there but I am not surprised that my name does not appear here but on the tape recorders that is when we make sure that this thing was recorded in the tape recorder so that we can make reference because we know that this thing was not going to last even more.  I know – I knew it was not going to last even for five years.That is why I insisted that it must be recorded.  If they can bring the tape recorder you can see how – how we deliberated on this matter.    Chair more especially with regards to this – to this dairy scam.  They were recorded.  We made sure that before we start the tape recorder was working and …   And the Municipal Manager is the person who usually is supposed to advise the council with the legal things inside the council.  He also insisted that it should be recorded.    I am dead sure it was recorded.  Maybe it can be destroyed but it was recorded.    Chair it is just that some otherdocuments then - we cannot connect with them.  I think maybe they are missing but the documents that were agreed in the council is that the land was – the – the Office of the Premier sent a lease contract to the council so that the council can approve it that the council must lease the land. They said the council must lease the land to the Office of the Premier because the – they said legislatively it is stated that the council cannot lease the land direct to the Department of Agriculture.  It must lease it to the Office of the Premier.    Yes.  As far as the resolution was taken by the council it is that the land should be leased direct to the Premier.  So that the Premier can – can maybe give it to the Department of Agriculture.  So then they can lease it to Estina.  It was a – it was a …    It was a long, long, long story.    The document which represented that the lease between the Municipality and – and the Premier’s Office was 11 years …    And thereafter then I – I learned that the Department of Agriculture did lease the land to Estina Dairy Scam for 99 years lease free contract.    Rent free.    Rent free - for 99 years rent free to Estina Dairy Scam.   I …    I followed this – this thing of the dairy because it was interesting very much closely and when I looked onto – on the municipal financial books because we were represented with those documents.  I have never seen any payment from the Department of Agriculture to – to the municipality and which was supposed to be close to a million by that time and in the agreement we agreed that they – they – it was agreed that the – the department should pay the money which is equivalent to – to the rates of that time and if – if the hectare is maybe 8 000 this year. Maybe next year it is going to be 10 000.  Then they must pay the money which is equivalent to the rate of the hectare.  I – I followedthis thing.  I have never seen any payment into the municipality.    I do have a strong object on that because it – it – the – the representation from the Department of Agriculture is they said to the council the pilot project for this dairy scam is three years.    The dairy project.    He said …    Then it – it does not make sense.  How can they lease the land to the people who have a plan of three years to – to take the project off the ground and anything can happen.  You see in 11 years one year anything can happen.  Maybe they leased one – one on that level but as far as I know it was – it was 11 years not one year.    Then he just has to bring the proof …    Which states that Department of Agriculture paid – the Provincial Department of Agriculture in the Free State paid Phumelela so much for – for the lease of land which is 4 400 hectares.    Well during that – that time it was easy to access that – that dairy and I got a tipoff that the – the cattle were dying.    The cattle was bought in 2000 – towards the end of 2013 – towards the end of 2013.    The cattle was bought for that diary.  Then in 2014 I think the cattle started dying there towards the end of 13 again just after they arrived.  Then in February 2014 that was when I was alerted that the cattle – they are piling cattle up in the stream – in a certain stream around Vrede.   Then I went myself there and witnessed the situation.  Then I got that the cattle were - were dumped on the – on the stream which supplied drinking water to – to the Vrede Dam.  Then once I witnessed that I immediately alerted the press and the press came.  The story was on the front page on the very same week on Friday and the photos were taken on Wednesday. Then on Friday it was on the front page.  Thereafter then the – I – I saw that nothing did happen.  Then I alerted the Department of Environmental Affairs with regards that this - these people werepolluting water which is the drinking water for people of Vrede.  Then the official from the Department of Environmental Affairs came after I think it – the following week over the weekend. Then we met in Vrede.  I took them to the scene.  When we got there then we got that the cattle were now covered with – with soil.    Yes in – in that stream.    Then the official told me that no I must wait for them in - in Vrede.  They will go to the – to the dairy themselves and deal with the – the official in the dairy.  Then they went there.  They instructed them to go and exhume those cattle on that drinking – drinking water stream and bury them in the farm.  They must dig a hole they – they said to me they instructed them to dig three metres deep hole and bury those cattle in that area.   Well taking into consideration that it was in summer and some of those carcasses were already decomposed but as far as I – I recognised when I got there it was not less than 45 carcasses in that – in that stream.    Yes Chair.    Up to – Chair up to that day where – where – up to that day of February which I reported this thing to the press.  The carcasses which were dumped there were not less than 45.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  They were still there.  The media even took the photos.    And even the official from the Department of Environmental Affairs when they got there the carcasses were there but they were covered just with soil.  Chair when I got there my observation was that it was not three months since they were dying.    Yes, yes.    Up to that day yes.    Yes.  Yes Chair.    Yes.  Others they were almost totally decomposed.  Others were fresh and for the record it never ended that day.  Cattle kept on dying afterwards.    Chair just after that publication to the press because that thing it caught the attention of the whole South Africa.  Then the security was beefed up in that dairy that no one mustcome close to that dairy.  We were even barred for you to – to maybe to walk in – into - into the field not just the dairy alone.  Then that is when I – we – we - I began to stay away because my life was going to be endangered.    Chair yes I – I just heard that the cattle kept on dying but I did not witness because now they were buried deep inside the farm where we cannot access that place …    But people who working on the dairy then when we engage with them then they will tell me that the cattle keep on dying but we are burying them at a different place …    From the one that you – you saw.    Honestly speaking those cattle were dying – were – were starving and another thing they were not vaccinated.  They were not treated with proper medication.  That is why they were dying like flies.  Most of the time you do not just take dairy cattle and feed them in an open field.  You let them graze in an open field.  You have to give them some supplement and – and feeding but those were left to – to graze on their own on an open field.    Yes Chair.  I have been farming – I have been fully farming since 2003 …    But with beef cattle and – and when you do farming you do all – all sorts of aspects of farming.    It is grain.  It is – it is beef cattle.    It is – it is milk cattle.  Then you choose which one you want to – to work on.    Yes but I am clued up with the dairy cattle.    Yes Chair I do have that (intervenes).    More especially after this event of reporting the – the – those dairy carcasses …    This thing caught even the attentionof the – the Parliament itself.  People around Vrede then became so violent.  They – they were angry at me as I was the one who reported the matter to – to the press and I was even attacked personally …    By - by a group of people who I -0 by that time we believe it was – was Mr Zwane’s private force.  He – he – after he became the – after he got into that – that position of – of the Agricultural MEC he had some dubious employment in the – in the Office of the Department of Agriculture around the area of Vrede. They were – he hired five people that – that office hired five people without following the proper procedures.    What makes us to – what makes me to be suspicious that it was – the right procedure was not followed is that you cannot – you cannot hire – you cannot hire people who – acertain group of people maybe how are friends at the same time when – when the population of that area is so big.  Which means those - those posts were – were created especially for them.    Then …    Their role in the department?    The two guys were security guards.  I think the two guys is Bongani Radebe and Dingaan Dinga.    They were security guards and there were other two guys.  It is Thuto Kganye who was working in the office and the other one is Anton Sibeko known as Xolisa.  They – they were – all those two they were working in the Office of Agriculture and after that – after that time when they got into that office there was an extension officer working in that Office of Agriculture and another lady who is working – is an administration in that office.    Those two people were – were undermined during this thing of the dairy project.  I remember the extension officer he was even striped of the rights of driving a car.  He was walking …   And those two guys were using the – the agricultural – the Department of Agricultural car by that time.  They were – it - it looks as if they were seniors in that office by that time.    The people who attacked me they were – they were driving with Frans Mokoena.    Frans Mokoena is – is a welltenderpreneur in Phumelela.  He used to get tenders left and right in that area.    I presume so.  He is a tenderpreneur.    Ja they were Government tenders.    The – the – one of the biggest tenders that he got first is when – when Mr Mosebenzi was the MEC of – of CoGTA.  I think in 2009 he was MEC of CoGTA.  Then Frans got a big tender in Warden to build houses – the RDP houses.  That is one of his big tenders.  Then he – he will use some other tenders then around the area while Mr Zwane was - was the MEC.   When I was attacked they were – he was driving his car.  In his car it was Bongani Radebe, Dingaan Dinga and Anton “Xolisa” Sibeko.    Then I was – I was attacked.  Then I was even sprayed with pepper spray on the eyes.  They said that I am – I am disturbing the ANC from doing its work and I was not the only person who was attacked around the area.  Everybody who was associated with myself they were attacked throwing all sorts of insultson the streets.  The life that we live by that time is – it was a frightening life.    Chair, we – we had some difference just after the – the – after I reported those carcasses.    Yes.    Then we …    Well we had – we – we had an argument with Thuto Kganye at one of the tennis courts around Vrede.  Then thereafter …   Oh it – when we exchanging words he said with regards to the – to this day.    Well I cannot – I cannot recall correctly where but I – I – we had a going on each other with Thuto Kganye at the tennis court.  Then Thuto I do not know whether itis him or maybe – but there was – they were all members playing at the tennis court.  Then they phoned those guys and say here is Doctor here.  Come and – and fix him up. When I was on my way to – to the police station then I – I think it is plus or minus 400 metres from the tennis court that is when I – I came across the car of Frans Mokoena with these guys.  They stand in front of me like this on the car.  Then they opened the doors all of them.  They came out and – and attacked me. When I – when I came out then Bongani Radebe took out a pepper sprayer and said the ANC is bigger than me.  I cannot touch the ANC.  Then he sprayed me with pepper spray in the eyes and I was – I was driving alone.    Then the other guy – (indistinct) Icould not see.  Then there was another guy who approached me from the front.  I asked him to drive to the police station with my own car.  Then he drove me to the police station.    Chair with that one I am dead sure I was attacked based on this thing of the dairy farm.    I can put that on record.    Yes.  I am – yes Chair.  I am – I am basing it on what they said when they attacked me and afterwards maybe after a while when – maybe after around three years Bongani because we were sharing the same – surname then.  He came and approached and tell me that I am sorry about whatever happened because I was – I was used and I was duped but whatever you were doing then you were right because you were doing it for the people of Vrede.    Radebe.   Yes Radebe yes.    Yes.    He was the one who – Chair he was the one who used the pepper spray on me.    Yes.    Yes.  That is what he said.  Even now he still stands on his words.    Yes.    Well Chair just after the attack he said – he spoke in Zulu.  He said (isiZulu) I am sorry.  Then I – then afterwards then we met and then he said I think the things were beginning to be – not to be rosy as they were.  Then after a long while he approached me and said I am sorry I was used and I was duped. I did not think clearly because the – it looks as if there was – there was greener on the other part where I was shown but anyone Isaw that what you were doing was right and you were doing it for the people of Vrede and – I mean for the people of Phumelela.    That is “Xolisa” Anton Sibeko.    He said I cannot stand on the way of the ANC.  The ANC is bigger than me.  Immediately when that guy approached me from the front I asked him to drive me to the police station but I could not see clearly because that – that thing is so sore inside the eyes.  When I got to the police station some other police officer said I must go to – and wash my face.  Thereafter I went to the charge room.  I told them what happened.  I want to open a case.  Then they said that they want to consult with their Station Commander.    He is Mr Xasa.    Chair that is what they said …    And eventually that is what happened.    Yes Chair they went to consult the Station Commander.  Then the Station Commander issued a statement.  He said to me that such cases do not – do not fall in – in their office.  There is a certain office from Bethlehem.  There is a certain official who must come and assist us with such cases because my incident wasnot the – he said my incident was not the first one. These cases are political related cases.  They do not work with political related cases.  There is a certain department in Bethlehem.  Then I was – then I was turned away and say – they say they will bring people from Bethlehem but even today those people never came.    It was the election of 2014, just after the incident of the carcasses.    Correct Chair.    Chair they said they will arrange somebody from Bethlehem to come and make – and open a case for me.    Chair even today it never happened.      Yes Chair it’s in Vrede PoliceStation    Yes Chair.    Chair it was the same person Mr Xhasa but by that time he was acting, now I think he’s a permanent station commander.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    He never came back to me, the last time we spoke about this case it was that time when I was turned away.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair, you’re right Chair.      Yes, in addition, I can even assist the Commission with other three guys who were attacked beside me, who were turned away from the police station the same way I was turned.     The first one is Thys Qwebu.   the other one is Sisezwane.    He is well known as Magaga, but I know – I know him personally and even were he stays, we call him Magaga, I think his surname is Magaga.    Chair they all happened in 2014.    Yes Chair they were reported in 2014, the very same police station.    Yes Chair they were told that there will be people coming from Bethlehem who will assist them to open their cases. I even tried to speak to them when the Commission first approached me, they said, it just ended like that, they never came back to them.      Chair they were strictly politicallyconnected those three guys were very much close to me while I was a councillor, I used to spend lots of time with them.    Chair by that time Thys Qwebu and Sisizwane, they were DA members in good standing, then Mr Magaga he was – he was even supportive of us we used to spend time with him, but he was not a member by that time.    Some of the abuses are very much traumatised you cannot go back to them but I can bring one to the attention of the Commission that I was once shot by the police when I was getting into the farm.  It as in 2014, when I got into the farm then – but for security reasons and I cannot speak all the details but the police came at the gate and said to me, it was at night, they said they want to search my car.  I said, but how can you search my car when we are not even – you haven’t even turned on the blue lights, I don’t trust you, let us go to the house because – it’s only 300 metres from the main gate to the house.  I said I don’t trust you, let us go in the house because I’ve got some people in the house who can maybe be witnesses or back me.  Then I drove off, when I drove off, they fired five live ammunition shots on my car and two of them landed on my car and I don’t know what happened with the others, then I went straight tothe house.  When I got into the house they followed me, they came and in the house it was my brother and my cousin and the other guy, there were three, they went and spoke to them, they asked them what are they looking for, they said they want a driver’s license, then I gave my brother the driver’s license they said they want to search the car.  They opened the car then thereafter they said – a certain lady said to me I think I’m clever then they are the police they will get after me and immediately I went to open a case, then the case was investigated by the IP, it drag on and on and on then eventually then it just disappeared and no-one ever came to me, notify me what happened with the caseeven today. After the investigation was done then police got some cartridge on the scene and take them as evidence but even today no-one ever came to me, it’s more than five years now.    Yes this one I clearly remember it did happen on the -  it was on the 14 t h of June 2014.     As I have stated once these gentlemen were employed in the department – the office of the Department of Agriculture, that office was eventually turned to be a political party office of the ANC, even Mr Zwane, when he came to Vrede he will go to that office and they will have meeting in that office.  If they feel that the (indistinct) is small they will just take a phone call and phone the mayor in the Municipality so that the mayor can provide them with – if there’s space immediately without even making some – maybe an appointment or book a place to the Municipality and once these gentlemen got employed in that office, I wastaking…(intervention).    The one’s which I stated I think there was one private force? Kolisa, Thuto, Dingaan Dinga and Bongani Radebe.    To my surprise I was – as a farmer we – as farmers then we will get the extension officer did have his data base of the farmers but I was taken out of that data base after that gentlemen got into that office and - as we had some differences politically.  Those two were securities they were sitting at the gate you can’t get there in the office if you were not pro ANC and as a result then I - my cattle got sick, in that office there is a State vet and usually we don’t pay for the State vet because the State vet is paid by the Government, we just go to the State vet and consult when we do haveproblem with cattle.  Then I was denied access to the State vet, after a while I got the lady who was an administrator, the old lady in that office on the street, I ask her to give me the phone numbers of the State vet and then she phoned me the following day and give me the phone numbers of the State vet.  Then I phoned the State vet and gave them the circumstances of the cattle on how they were dying then she described me the medication of the cattle.  Unfortunately by that time I’ve already lost 45 heads of cattle and most of them they were heavy pregnant and the State vet diagnosed that my cattle were suffering from some serious sickness which quickly turned into red water but when itbegins it looks like the (indistinct) then he gave me some prescription.  Just after that prescription then, my cattle then stopped sicking.    Stopped dying yes.    Chair, mine – I even counted them, that’s why the extension officer did – I did have his numbers and he had my numbers.  When my cattle died I phoned him to come and take the pictures, that’s when he said to me, I’ve been stripped of the rights of driving – to drive the car from the department so I cannot get into your farm to go and have the pictures and witness the cattle.  The best thing that you can do then, take some pictures bring them to me so that I can see what I can do.  That’s then, when I took the pictures and –but when I got to him I asked him, is there any, maybe a disastrous relief grant from the department, then he said they don’t have such thing.  Those one – if you link these two, 45 and that other 45, maybe the carcasses that (indistinct) but I do have pictures of all of them, even the one from the dairy, you can see yourself, the one from the dairy they were not less than 45.    Mine are exactly 45.    Chair when we were sitting in that room, the first time you came to Vrede, one of those people, of that group which assaulted me, it was Frans Magwena who got, then the other one are his friends, they were not involved in…(intervention).     Yes Frans Magwena was there.    Yes I do.    Through you Chair, there are threecases with regards to this dairy – Vrede Dairy Project scam, those cases includes murder they are related in murder.  The first murder which did happen I think it was in 2013 where a guy was hijacked, I don’t know kidnapped or hijacked by the name of Moses Chauke, he was – in February 2013 and then he eventually died in 2015, around there – I mean in May 2013.   He was hijacked in February 2013 then died in the hospital, the same year in May and the guy was working in the office of the Department of Agriculture and he was against this dairy thing.    Yes, and up to so far I followed his story, the perpetrators, even today they are not arrested.    No not yet because he was (indistinct) I just read (indistinct) story on the newspaper he was in Bethlehem but the other two which I’ll speak – I will talk about now are those two cases, I worked on those two cases personally, hands-on, I know what was going on in those cases.  The first case is the case of the guy in Warden, he was my friend, when I got to Warden – Warden is one of the (indistinct) Mpumelela , I used to go to him then, his name was Vusi Mlaba, he was also a farmer then he – they were not in good terms with Mr Zwane because I believe if that guy – that guy was also an emerging farmer, he was supposed to be included in this project of the dairy milk, but because now he was standing on the opposite side then he was not included but I know he was an emerging farmer.  Theguy was killed, was mowed down with plenty bullets, I worked on his case then his case I can assure you it was a pure cover-up.     The case just disappeared, the investigator kept on ducking, ducking then eventually never surfaced in Warden, then the case was – the case end up like that, no-one was arrested till today.    I can speak to the family of that guythen maybe they can give me the exact name but the investigator was from Bethlehem it was not a person from Warden, it was a special person from Bethlehem, that case disappeared.    That was the second case, then there – the third case is the case which happened last year of Mr Philemon Ngwenya, it happened in Vrede.    He was one of the beneficiaries.    He was killed last year in October.  Then the police were working on the case, the case was transferred to NPA in the province, they are the ones who were working on the case but on the ground there is this -  one of the things that we mustn’t takefor granted is the public opinion, it’s not true but you must follow it and see what’s happening.  That case even today the people who killed Mr Philemon Ngwenya are not arrested. If you go to Vrede, you look how small is Vrede and you look at the resources that the police have, in order to investigate cases you become suspicious that there is something that is like a cover up on these case, even today, the perpetrators or the people who killed Mr Philemon Ngwenya haven’t been arrested yet.  They arrested two guys they say there’s not enough evidence then the case was thrown out of court but even today there is no progress.   Yes Chair, maybe – the other one is in 2017, it was the end of 2017 in Mpumelelo Municipal storerooms did surface four brand new Range Rovers and when we followed on that case we found that there was a document from the Department of Agriculture which said those cars were bought by the Department of Agriculture to fund the farmers with two Range Rovers then I don’t know whether that case can fall in this Commission because up to now then the community, everybody, we are at a loss, we don’t know what happened with that case.    Okay Chair.    Okay, maybe for the last one Chair, I’ll ask the Commission – I think this is the last resort for us as whistle blowers and people on the ground to speak to and may we please, the Commission look at one of the specific things or the harassment that the whistle blowers get, it’s not just the physical one, these things go deep – deep, deep, deep and it puts the lives of the people who speak out at risk and most of the time then we live in fear and it’s not good tolive in fear in a democratic country as if you are lawlessness country, I think that the Commission, may you please look onto that thing, it doesn’t effect individuals as such alone, it also affects people who are close to the individual who was speaking out.  That will be my humble plea to the Commission.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you very much. 
BUTHELEZI:Did you ask for the supporting documentation or did anyone in the council ask for that documentation? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Morning again DCJ.   DCJ we are preparing to lead the evidence of Ms Willie or Willie Basson.  This morning he asked for an interpreter who could assist him with the translation from English to Afrikaans, Afrikaans to English.      That was arranged this morning but I believe the interpreter has not taken the oath.      The relevant oath yet.    So I will request DCJ is that we just stand down until we have dealt with the formalities.    And then we will resume.   We will let you know as soon as it is sorted out DCJ.    Thank you.    Thank you Chairman.  Our next witness is a Mr Willie Basson he has requested the services of an interpreter who will translate for him from English to Afrikaans, Afrikaans to English Chairman.    The Exhibit bundle Chairman is Exhibit HH7.  We will also make a brief reference to the media bundle Chairman.    Chair might I just again say that there is a template that was followed in the preparation of these affidavits.  Weconcede it is not a sworn affidavit and we will make sure that any new ones that come just refer to…    Indeed so.  All I am pointing out is we have taken the lesson.  Thank you DCJ.    Yes.  Mr Basson’s evidence revolves around three major areas DCJ.     The one he – the – his observations on themachinery and equipment that was used to construct the processing plant at the Vrede dairy farm.  The second will be dealing with the death of cattle and his role in assisting in that regard.  The third one will be about the people he encountered on the farm.  So there are one or two completely different pieces of evidence you will be able to get from this witness Chairman.    Mr Basson do you have Exhibit HH…    Yes.  Thank you Chairman.    He does DCJ.    Yes.    Mr Basson if we look at the document that you have presented to the commission could you please go to page 1 of that document?      Whose name is recorded on page 1?    Thank you.  If you then go to page 6 of the same document.  The first signature just below paragraph 22 where the word deponent appears, whose signature is that?    Whose?    On what date did you depose to thisdocument and where did you depose to it?    Yes thank you.  Mr Basson are there any corrections even if they are minor corrections that you wish to make to the statement?    Chairperson I will – we will take – it is a very minor one and we can deal with it.   In the supplementary.    It really is not a material change.    Thank you.  Mr Basson where do you live?    Do you have a home in any other town?    And is there anything of interest – that might be of interest to the commission in relation to where you live – where your other home is and who your neighbours might be?    Mr Basson your business premises where are those located?    Yes.  Do you have a home in Warden?    Yes.  How far is your business from the Vrede dairy farm in terms of kilometres?    And here you referring to the distance between Vrede Town and the Vrede dairy farm.      How long have you been conducting the business of a construction company in Vrede?    Yes. Thank you.  You also in your paragraph 5 refer to hiring out earth moving equipment, plant and machinery.  Is that part of the construction company?    You are a farmer and you are well versed in cattle farming you say?    How long have you been a farmer?    And do you farm in dairy cows or in what is colloquially called red meat cattle.    Yes continue.    Is this the game farm or the cattle farm?    Have you ever had any interest in dairyfarming?    But you say you know the farmers who in the farming committee?    Yes.  There are four farmers – commercial farmers who were leasing the Krynaauwslust farm in the municipality, do you know them?    They are the ones who were moved off the property and the Vrede dairy farm was then established on that same farm.    Were those particular commercial farmers dairy farmers?    Okay.  Let us talk about Estina and the Vrede dairy farm.  You say that you were contacted in or about 2012 by people who wanted you to assist at the dairy farm.      I think it will be of interest to the Chairman to know if it is the people who were running and operating and managingthe dairy farm who contacted you or completely different set of people.    What did he ask you to assist with?    Roughly when might this have been 2012, 13 I do not know if you can recall?    The commission has heard evidence that by December 2012 the basic farm was up and running.  Would you agree that by December 2012 the farm itself the operations were up and running?    I am satisfied with that answer but would like you to explain where you then fitted in and the services you provided fitted in to establishing this farm?    A shed.    Just to assist you in recollecting the events in a chronological order when I look at your paragraph 7 you talk about enlarging the dam on the farm.  Would you have done that before you built he shed?    So you put the shed up before you built the dam?    You also speak about levelling the place out and compacting the farm surface.  Would that have been one of the first tasks you undertook?   When you were working on the farm were there any cattle at all on the farm?    Now let us take this slowly please Mr Basson.  So you start off by arriving and compacting the ground and levelling it.  Were there cattle on the farm when you were doing that?    When – when you observed that am I correct to say that the milking shed had not been set up yet?  The milk processing plant, there was nothing there which is why you were compacting the ground?    Had you been to this farm before you were invited to go there by Mr Prasad?    So were the buildings you describe when you came to compact the place there already?    That is fine.    But the farm was owned by private individuals before it was bought by Estina, am I correct?    Who – who owned the farm before it was sold – the farm and I am talking about the farm with the buildings that were there before it was sold to Estina?    Can I just spell that Chairman?  It is Krynaauwslust farm.    Had the municipality been leasing that farm out to private individuals prior to Estina arriving?    No a Raadslede is what he said who occupied it.    Then you say at paragraph 8 that in or about March 2013 you were asked to attend to drainage and construction relating to the cattle sheds.   So just in relation to the cattle sheds that you were asked to assist with you have annexed as WB1 the invoice you sent to Estina PTY Limited.  At page 7 you will find the invoice.    Under the first tab, tab number 1.    You will find the invoice.    No his are different Chairman.    Yes.  So just where number 1 is written there is an invoice there dated the 27 November 2013.      We will do that Chairman.      And the amount of the invoice is R6 384.00. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Willem Basson Mr Chair.    No.    Yes.    Yes My Lord.  The witness is sworn in Mr Chairperson.    Yes.   My names Mr Commissioner.    I am just perusing for page 6.  I do have it.      Chairperson the signature appearing here it is mine.    It was on the 26 June and in Vrede Chairperson.    Chairperson I delivered million rand fodder for them.    There is nothing Chairperson.    Chairperson I reside in Vrede, 61 Garrick Street.    I do Mr Chairperson.   No Chairperson.    I do my business in number 1 Kerkstraat in Standerton – I beg your pardon in Vrede.  And I do have another business in Vrede – in Standerton Vrystraat.    Chairperson I do have a home as well as a business in Warden.    A maximum of 8 kilometres Mr Chairperson.   Indeed so My Chairperson.    From 1987.  I beg your pardon from 1978.    I do understand Chairperson.   Indeed My Lord.  Indeed Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    Chairperson from 2000.    I do business with meat cows as well as a game.    As well as game.   May I say something Chairperson?    I have just sold the farm recently with the cows.    Chairperson both.  Both of them.    No.    I do have knowledge about the others who are doing business with the milk cows but myself I for one I do not have any one.    Yes I do Chairperson.    Ja it is correct so.  Yes it is correct so one ofthe farms Chairperson it is Krynaauwslust.    No.    Ja it is so.    CP Prasad Chairperson and this person was from India.    He wanted me to come and help at the farm with roads, dams which was – were supposed to be built on the farm.    I am not so sure about the date or the year but it was around 2012 to 2013 I am not certain about the exact time.    Not in full operation Chairperson partly.   Yes indeed so we were busy or I was busy building up a build – a big store or I beg your pardon – I beg your pardon Chairperson I just want the correct name for     I thank you.     A shed.    A big shed thank you Chairperson.    No.    Built the dam.  Indeed so Chairperson.    Yes.    Many of them.    Chairperson the cattle were already on the farm because they – they are going – they are being milked – at the time when they are milked Chairperson they formed a circle.   There was a small shed with a little concrete.    Chairperson indeed so I was there.    No.    I was about three to four years before thatparticular time Chairperson because my duties or my contract is linked to repair the municipality things as well.    No.    Chairperson it was the municipality and theperson who was in the forefront of that was Krynaauwslust farming.    Yes it is correct so.    Initially Chairperson it was not a private person who was occupying or working on the farm it was – it was councillor…    Yes it is so Chairperson.    Ja.    Ja.  They had a farmer who was farming forthem.    Krynaauwslust was the one who was occupying the land and doing the farming but he was doing that for the municipality.    It is indeed so Chairperson because that trench it is a very big trench.  That particular trench it is being used to suck the urine of the cattle.    It is right Chairperson. 
INTERPRETER:  That will be fine for me Chairperson.    Pardon me Chairperson.    I thank you.  I thank you Chairperson.    Chairperson let me - let me confess.    I forgot the name confess in Afrikaans.  I am sorry.    (Intervenes).    It does not come in my mind.  I beg your pardonChairperson.    I beg your pardon.    Pardon me Chairperson.    Come again?    Shortened to?    P O Box 3?    Thank you.    I do, I do Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The important fact here is that the invoice went to Estina (Pty) Ltd. MR WILLIE BASSON (through    I point it out Mr Basson because you say in your statement that there were other subcontractors.    You have mentioned him in your paragraph 6 Mr Koos Eksteen.    And you have also mentioned a Mr A Floris – F-L-O-R-I-S.    So the contractor who had been employed by Estina and you have here mentioned EG Construction.    They had no machinery.  So you brought yours in from your company and worked with them on the property. MR WILLIE BASSON (through    Your invoices however were not to EG Construction.  All your invoices went to Estina (Pty) Ltd.    We will come back to that because mostof the invoices that you have given us here just the ones here are directed either at Estina (Pty) Ltd or at Vrede Dairy Projects.  Now can you explain to the Chairman who Vrede Dairy Projects are?    No, no.  That is not what he said.  Please – can you please repeat your answer?    I am sorry to - to repeat this.  I am understanding you to say Mr Basson that when you were preparing this affidavit you asked your office PA to simply pull out the Estina invoices and the Vrede Dairy Farm invoices and that is the reason you do not have the invoices from the other subcontractors.  Please correct me if my Afrikaans is so poor that I have misunderstood you.    Yes.  That is what I understood you to say but that does not explain to the Chairman who Vrede Dairy Projects is.  Are you then saying Vrede Dairy Projects was really Estina (Pty) Ltd?    No.    I am sorry Chairman.  I - I actually spent time at the University of Natal.  We had to do Afrikaans.  It was compulsory.    So I do understand.    I am very poor at speaking it but Iunderstand it …    And what I understood Mr Basson to say is Estina was die Guptas se whatever.  It belonged to the Guptas …    And that has not come through in the translation.        I will also try and keep my questions shorter.  It will assist.   Can I then ask you Mr Basson to confirm what you said?  No.  I am sorry Chairman that is not the question I asked.    Chairman …    I would like to just get clarity on this.    You said Mr Basson Estina belonged to the Guptas.  Is that right?    Then you were going to explain what Vrede Dairy Projects was.    The province owned Vrede Dairy?    What about that?  Continue.    So there were at offices from the Department of Agriculture in Bloemfontein?   Department of Agriculture.    The other name we know is the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development shortened to DARD - D-A-R-D.    D-A-R-D DARD.   Mr Basson I will just ask.  It could be the Free State Development Corporation also who - who hired your services.    Okay.  Most importantly from the invoices you have annexed.  Not meeste.  All of them used the same P O Box number.    It is P O Box/Posbus 349 Vrede.    Other than Mr Prasad who are the other people you met when you rendered services at the farm?    Please repeat your answer.    No.  I am …   No complete - sorry Chairman.    He has not completed the translation.    He continued to say they are from that family.  That is the full sentence.    The boiler was shipped into the country in containers?    Continue.    Yes.  So you have met Mr Prasad.  You have met these three people who were introduced to you as Guptas?    You have associated your meeting with the Guptas with the installation of the milk processing plant.  Please correct me if I am wrong.    To come and build the milk processing plant.    I am very concerned Chairman.   Yes.    With all due respect …    To Mr Sagitta.    I think it would serve …    The objectives of the Commission better …    If we did do that just for this particular language.    Chairman I believe we could create space if we have to first thing tomorrow morning.    If Mr …we just need to talk to Mr Basson and see if it is amenable to his arrangements.    He will probably take about three to four hours Chairman.    We actually had two set down for tomorrow but we could (intervenes).    The - the first witness …    Is likely to take three hours possibly four. The report he goes through is quite an important one and the questions are detailed.    The second witness however Chairman we might be able to speak to.  He does not implicate anybody.    So we had squeezed him in …    And because he is Johannesburg based     We will ask him very politely if he either could come in the afternoon or just come when we come back …    And we then deal with his evidence then.    Because he is local I believe he may even be able just to be on standby …    And come in within an hour.    If all indications are that we are going to finish by lunchtime and we can take his evidence after lunch.    Could we start at half past nineChairman?    Yes.    The interpretation takes a little longer.    I am finding.    So we need a buffer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good afternoon Mr Chairman.    Thank you.  Mr Chairman this afternoon the legal team intended to present evidence of one witness but unfortunately due to circumstances that were discussed in Chambers itis not possible to do so and we are now seeking an adjournment of the proceedings until tomorrow morning because I believe my learned friend Ms Gcabashe still continues with her team tomorrow morning.    Thank you Chair.
