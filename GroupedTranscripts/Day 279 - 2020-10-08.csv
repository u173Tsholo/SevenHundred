CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation again?    Yes.    Good morning Ms Klein.    Thank you.    Okay.    The one I have here has got both black and red and it is Eskom Bundle 02.    Yes do you know whether the witness’ one has both?    Have you got red and black numbers at the top of each of page – the pagination?    Only red ones?    Oh okay.    Okay so we will use red numbers – page numbers today.    Okay alright.    Yes.  Thank you; you can do that from there.    Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Mr Seleka.    You will have to try and raise your voice this morning I think it is very low today.    Ja.      I – I hardly get asked to raise my voice.    I hardly get asked to raise my voice anyway.      Have you – you said affidavit.  The first one is a statement is it not?    The one appearing at – starting at page 2.    Well it has been but it is interesting normally an affidavit will start with I, the undersigned do hereby admit oath and say. This one does not start like that.     So one wonders whether she took the oath – I see the Commissioner of Oaths certifies that the deponent has acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this affidavit which was signed and deposed before me at – on this day and the provisions of the regulation bla, bla, bla have been complied with.  But Ms Klein herself does not seem to have said I swear.  Okay alright but she has confirmed under oath that the contents of the statement are true and correct?  Ja so that is fine.    I think she was going to check.    Because she – she when she left last time the issue was still uncertain.  She was going to check.  Well obviously Ms Klein you can tell me whether you checked and what you found?    But really I do not think there is much significance whether the meeting of the 26 February was meant to be the first board meeting or there had been one earlier.  So if it was the first or second the fact remains that this was a new board; it had not had much time to do anything as a board.  There may have been some committee meetings the board committee meetings but it was a new board.  Did you find anything – did you – were you able to find anything when you checked?    Well the – the extensive engagement between the board and the executives that I have not heard.  I have heard about the induction which I think I was told was in January.    I have been told that there were a number of meetings of committees of the board as opposed to the board itself between January and 26 February.  I have been told of those.  And therefore members of those committees we did meet in between – between January and 26 February may you have interacted with some executives that part I think I have been told.  Does that more or less reflect?    Your own understanding?    Ja okay.    Okay no that – that is fine.  I mean when you have applied your mind to – to the bundle.    At some stage then we can see what needs to be done – what can be done.    But otherwise it seems that the picture that emerges is simply that there was an induction of the board at some stage in January.  There were certain meetings of committees of certain committees of the board after the induction – between the induction and the 26 February.    So during those meetings of committees there may have been some engagement between board members – certain board members and some executives.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes ja.    Ja.  Ja.  No that is fine.    Maybe it was a board meeting which was used as an induction.    Ja.    Ja.    Well I had a look at I think the transcripts of what I believe was that meeting and my recollection is that when you read that transcript when it comes to the question of who the people are who are going to be suspended you seem to find different speakers talking about different – a different number of people.  Some seem to talk about three; others seem to talk about four which includes the Financial Director.  But you come to a point and it may be that that is at the end of that meeting where the issue arises again whether the Financial Director is to be included.  And Mr Zola Tsotsi if I under – remember correctly comes out quite clearly that no, no, no the Financial Director is not to be – is not included.  My recollection is that that is how that meeting ends.      My impression is that nevertheless at the P&G meeting later on the – the name of the Financial Director seems to be included.  Is that your – the same impression you have as well? MS    Yes,  Yes.  Yes Mr Seleka.    Let me just make sure I understand that.  Are you saying that when we see the minutes that Doctor Ngubane signed more than a year later and there is more than one I think – there are a few of those minutes.    Are you saying that that does not necessarily mean that the board approved those minutes more than a year later.  You say the board approved those minutes within a short space of time after the meeting concerned but the Chairperson for whatever reason signed them much later  Is that what you are saying?    Yes and that is the – that falls in regard to all those minutes where Doctor Ngubane seems to have signed more than a year later.    Yes.    Yes.     ...or could you sign those?     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Okay thank you.     Do you know whether before the board approved any of these minutes whether there was a recording of the meeting, the proceedings of the meetings?   Whether they would have been assured that whoever prepared the minutes had listened to the recording and therefore what the minutes reflected what really had been discussed.   Because when you have a recording, you have a benefit.  You know, you do not have to rely on your notes.  You do not have to rely on your memory when you prepare the minutes.   You can listen to the recording and make sure that the minutes you put together reflect in substance what was discussed.   Do you know whether the board was told that with the minutes that it approved that had been done?     Okay.  No, that is fine.       I want you, of course...  I am sorry.  What,     Yes.  Ja, ja.      And when you say it all happened, what are you...?  The names?     Ja.     Ja, it is... I think when I read the transcript to which I referred earlier, there were things that seemed to be confusing to me with regards to Mr Tsotsi because I think there is somewhere where he speaks on the basis that the financial director is included.   But there definitely is a place, I think it towards the end, where somebody raises the issue whether the financial director is included/     ...and not the financial director.  Yes.     But then at the P&G meeting, I think that is what you are saying.     ...her name was then included.     Yes.     But you do not have the recollection, or do you, as to who was the person who included her name for the first time at the P&G meeting?     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, that is quite interesting.  One, because as I recall, when the minister left the meeting she had with the board earlier on that day, she said she would be around if, as I understand the position, she meant, if board members want to clarify something with her.   She is not going to go far.  She will be around or something like that.  I think that is what I saw.  That is one point.  The second point.  It is interesting because Mr Tsotsi, if I recall correctly, testified that Dr Ngubane told him that it was the minister who said the finance director, the financial director must be included as well.   Also, Mr Baloyi gave evidence yesterday and part of his evidence was that Dr Ngubane was frequently on the phone and he was phoning the presidency.   And I think he said that, for example in relation to people who were going to act in the positions of the executives who were to be suspended, that his understanding was that Dr Ngubane was getting the names from the presidency.   Now, of course, it could be the presidency... he could have been phoning the presidency at some stage.  He could have been phoning the minister at some stage.  We do not know.   But what you do say, what do you confirm is that Dr Ngubane during, I think the P&G meeting was coming in and out of the meeting, making calls as you understood it, to the minister.  Is that right?     Yes.     Yes, but the minister that is... that was your understanding.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.  Okay alright.  Of course, maybe I could raise this with you which maybe I should have raised with other witnesses before.  Because you just touched on there having been allegation that the financial director had tampered or interfered or met with some service providers or tenders or whatever and ever.  That in the meetings of the day, the 11t h, one finds in the minutes or the transcripts that somewhere there were discussions about alleged wrongdoing on the part of the executives who were sought to be suspended.   And yet, at the Durban meeting which Mr Tsotsi attended, it was made clear that the suspension of the executive directors was not going to be based on any wrongdoing.  That is number one.   Number two, at the meeting or the meetings of the 11t h     No, no, no.  I understand the same.  My recollection is quite clear that at the Durban meeting, Mr Tsotsi has said.  And I suspect that Mr Linnell may have said the same thing too but I am much more clearer about Mr Tsotsi’s evidence.   That when the Durban meeting discussed the suspensions, Mr Tsotsi was opposed to the suspensions.  But one of the, or the main reason that was advanced to     Mr Seleka, you might be able to ...[intervenes]      To throw light, ja.     But am I right about saying that some of the documents that he prepared for the meeting of the 11t h, may be documents that... the memorandum maybe is one of them.  That it does include some of them do include allegations of wrongdoing?     Yes.  We just do not know why he would have included those allegations and circumstances where, to his knowledge, the suspensions were not supposed to be based on any wrongdoing.     Ja.     Okay.  Well, we might have to ask him even if he sends an affidavit to deal with that.     Ja, okay.       Maybe before you answer that.  I was going to say.  Either one of the witnesses or may have picked up in minutes or transcripts.   Somewhere I think I read something along the lines that board members who may not necessarily have been members of the P&G were not allowed or were entitled to be present at this particular P&G meeting.   Now, maybe it is not this particular.  It may be at any P&G meeting if they want to attend, they are free to attend.  I do not know but I think I read somewhere or I heard one of the witnesses say something along the lines at that board meeting, at that P&G meeting, members of the board who may not have been members of that committee were allowed or were entitled to go and sit there.   I do not know whether that meant they could participate or they could be observers.  I do not know whether it meant they could vote.   But I read something along those lines or I heard somebody say that.  You might be able to enlighten me.     Ja, ja, ja.     H’m. ADV SELEKA     Yes.     And that at the P&G meeting?     Did you eat lunch on that day?  [laughing]     Did you not, the board members not eat lunch on that day?     I am simply asking because you are talking about finishing the board meeting at half-past one but then another meeting starting...?     Yes, but I heard Mr Tsotsi also say after the board meeting that happened after the minister had left, and before the P&G meeting started, he went for lunch.  When he came back from lunch, he said the P&G meeting had been running for about ten minutes.   So he came in when it had been going for about ten minutes.  That is when he says, he found the meeting discussing names of people who were going to act in the positions of the executives.   And raised the issue of how can you people discussing these names because you do not know these people.     That is what...     So I am wondering whether in terms of the timing, there was not time allowed for the board members to go and half lunch and then come back?     So you locate the P&G meeting at half-past meeting to something to three?     Yes.     Yes.     Okay let us just see.  So nine o’clock it is a board meeting.     Somewhere after that, while that board meeting is going on, the minister arrives.     And then the minister has a meeting with the board.     And at a certain stage, the minister leaves.     And then the board continues with its meeting.     Is that right?     I think that is about twelve o’clock.     From twelve to half-past one.     That is a full board meeting.     But what you are saying is that from half-past one up to what time?     Something 43?     Ja, okay just before three.     There was a P & G during that time.     Was that the only meeting that was going on at the time or could that meeting having been going on in parallel with another board meeting which would be without the P & G members?     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.  Ja, what I am trying to understand is this.  You see, I – when I read some things somewhere suggesting that at the P & G meeting it was said that the Chairperson of the board must chair the P & G meeting.     You remember something like that?     Yes, yes.  So I then asked the question was the P & G meeting chaired by the Chair of the board as opposed to by the Chair of the P & G meeting?  What is your recollection?     Ja.     Ja.  Okay, we might never be able to get all the details but I think we will just focus on the important issues.     On Ms Klein’s evidence the names at the end of the board meeting that ended at half past one, on her version, at that stage the board was talking only about three executives being suspended and that that list did not include the financial director.     What she does say is that during the P & G meeting which she says started at half past one and went up to about two minutes to three, that is the meeting where the financial director ’s name was added and ultimately the suspension involved all four executives and she says it was during that meeting which started at half past one and went up to five to three, it was during that meeting that Dr Ngubane was moving in and out of the meeting phoning, as she understood the Minister about certain matters.     Okay.     From half past one to two minutes to three.     Which one is that meeting because I think that is part of what she is emphasising.     Are you able to tell that is the meeting that started when?     Now if you look at the top of those minutes what time do they say that meeting started?     Because they normally write what time the meeting was.     Oh, it is the transcript.     Oh, okay.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Oh, well, if you say it is prior to the P & G meeting.     That might be in line with my impression but I am not feeling very certain that I am right but I have an impression that at the end of the board meeting that started after the Minister had left that there is the – that issue arises and that Mr Tsotsi insists that the Financial Director is not involved.  I have that impression, I think …[intervenes]     Ms Klein confirms.     Okay, then in that event what that transcript says is in line with what Ms Klein is saying because she does say at the end of the board meeting that ended at half past one, on her version, which is board meeting that started I think at twelve, after the Minister had left, she says the decision of the board was that it was three executives.       So that is in line with what she says.     And then what she does, she takes – she says then there was a meeting that started at half past one and ended at something to three and she says that was a P & G meeting and she says it is during that meeting, it is at that meeting that the Financial Director ’s name was added and she says she cannot – I think she cannot remember who add the Financial Director ’s name but she does say Dr Ngubane during that meeting was going in and out making phones calls to – on her understanding, the Minister, and when one looks at that one must remember what Mr Tsotsi said if my recollection is correct.  Mr Tsotsi’s evidence was that Dr Ngubane told him when he was saying but the Financial Director should not be included, he says Dr Ngubane said the Minister said this name, the name of the Financial Director must be included.     So you have a situation where on the transcript, which you have read...     …and on Ms Klein’s evidence…     At the end of the board meeting that ended at half past one, only three names were agreed and they did not include the Financial Director and then you have this meeting where I think Mr Tsotsi says Dr Ngubane said it is the Minister who wanted the Financial Director to be included and you have Ms Klein saying during that meeting Dr Ngubane was in and out of the meeting phoning, on her understanding, the Minister.     I think that part.  Of course you do have – you have put to Ms Klein Mr Baloyi evidence.     That Ms Klein is the one who put up the Financial Director ’s name.     And, of course, she has categorically said no, that is not so but that is where we are.     Ja.     Yes, no, no, that is fair enough.     No, that is fair enough, but this is what I want you to think about.  I mean, it may be that the position is that as you categorically deny, that did not happen, okay?  But you said earlier on that during the board meeting – I do not know whether it was the one before the Minister came, the names were not mentioned.      But the areas were discussed, it seems to me that what you were saying was, a principle was established.     And the principle was if your area – your portfolio is going to be investigated you should step aside.     Now if that is so, if that is what – if that is true and if your understanding was that the finance portfolio was one of the areas to be investigated one could understand if later on you would say but why leave out the FD because her area is included, would be affected.  You understand what I mean?  But maybe that did not happen and if it did not happen, it did not happen.     So but I was just saying to the extent that a principle was established you may have understood the finance department to be affected and therefore in terms of that principle you may have expected that she would be suspended as well but let us deal with it.  Are you able to refer her to the …[intervenes]     Yes.     The FD, ja.     To the markets.     Ja.     Okay, maybe …[intervenes]     …it is time for a short break.     That might help to find the place.     But if when we come back you have not found it, this has not been resolved, we can continue.     With other questions while your junior is looking.     And then we can revisit it later.     Okay, we will take the tea adjournment and resume at twenty five to twelve.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     We have spent quite some time on some of these matters but I think it was important to deal with certain issues.     But I think if you have been able to find the relevant parts of the transcript that Ms Klein wanted to be pointed out to her do that.  If not, let us continue while your junior is looking for those parts of the transcript and then we can go back to that issue later.     Has she had a chance to look at that one or not yet?     Ja.  No, I mean has she, Ms Klein, had a chance to refresh her memory on that part there where you say she is talking?     Ja, if you can read it to her, ja.     Ja.  But if it is in the bundle before her you can tell her what page.     While you read she can look at what …[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes but let us have Ms Klein have the reference bundle in front of her as well.     That will give her the advantage [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     You are referring to the red numbers now on this bundle as well?     Black numbers.     Okay, so what page?     358?     Okay, 358, black numbers, yes, I have got that.     Well, what you read, Mr Seleka…     Unless I am missing something, might what you read which you said is attributed to Ms Klein, might not necessarily relate to the Financial Director, it might be a call upon members of the board or P & G, whoever we are dealing with here, to say look, we have got to make hard decisions here and we must step up and make those decisions without necessarily – and I may have missed some things without necessarily saying I am motivating for the inclusion of the Financial Director.  I may have missed something.     I am just saying that is the impression I got.     Yes.    She is saying let us go along.  Oh, okay.     Ms Klein, what do you say about that interpretation?     Sorry?     That that is what – yes.     Okay.     That is the one that you could not remember.     Ja.     Yes but I think just to make sure we are on the same page.  Your response, your reaction to what Mr Seleka has read as attributed to you is yes, that is what you said.     Number one.  Number two, yes you were supporting the suspensions that were being discussed.     And those suspensions included the FD.     Okay, alright.     Yes, okay, alright.       Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.     Yes please, yes.     Of course – maybe I should not say of course.  This does not affect the answer you gave earlier on of categorically denying Mr Baloyi’s evidence that you came up with the name of the FD.     That answer stands.     Okay.     Okay.     Well, is it also your recollection, Ms Klein, that the Minister indicated four areas or portfolios?     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     You see, it may be that this is what happened.  We certainly know that at the Durban meeting the Financial Director was not included.     And the finance portfolio I think was not included.  That we know.  We also know that ultimately four and not three executives were suspended and they included the Financial Director.  So it is a question of at what stage the Financial Director was included and part of what you have said this morning is when the Minister was speaking to the board on the 11 t h, she laid down a principle.     And the principle was that she thought that executives who were leading portfolios that would be investigated should step aside or should be suspended or she would leave it to the board but she would understand if they were suspended or something like that.   Now if that is so and if her speech or what she said to the board at that time included the finance department, it would be logical if at the P & G meeting the question arose whether the FD should be included among the executives to be suspended, it would be logical or understandable if someone from within the committee, and this time maybe Dr Ngubane, called the Minister to say, you know, Minister, there is an issue about whether the FD should be included or not, you know, and you said that portfolios that are affected, people who lead them, executives who lead them, maybe should be suspended, did you mean that the FD should also be suspended and therefore if Dr Ngubane came back to the meeting and said no, we must include the FD, one would understand if Mr Tsotsi asked him but where are you coming with this name from because we only spoke about three?  Then he would answer the Minister said she must be included.  So it would fall in place logically if that – that that because she seems to have laid a principle and if later on she was asked in terms of this principle you laid when you talked to us, should the FD be included?  And it seems that logically she would say apply that principle and if you apply it, the FD gets included.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.     Yes, so based on what Dr Ngubane says, the Minister spoke about four executives.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  But also, it is important to make sure that we know exactly who is speaking in the different parts of the transcript.     So that we do not wrongly attribute something to somebody.     Who did not say those things.     Okay.     Ja, okay, alright.     Okay.     Just remember, Mr Seleka, not to bother to go over the same thing that we went over.     Let us focus on things that were not covered but obviously if there is something we covered where you have remembered some issue that you need to raise, you may raise it.     Maybe, maybe, I am sorry …[intervenes]     I think there is a part which Mr Seleka left, maybe he was going to deal with later on and I hope I am not confusing the different executives but I thought she – ja, I think she said Mr Romeo Kumalo was the one speaking.     In that meeting and she says despite the fact that she told the delegation and told Mr Kumalo that she had not written to the board wanting to leave.  Mr Kumalo followed up with a suggestion along the lines that the investigation or the inquiry may still take quite long, maybe we should talk about a separation package anyway.  That’s what Mr – Ms Molefe said, the gist of it and that is what she added, does that ...[intervenes]      That’s your recollection as well?     Yes, and do you have a recollection of Mr Kumalo having responded along the same lines that she says or do you have no recollection of that?     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     I think there is a part which I think Mr Seleka doesn’t articulate but I may be wrong, that is why didn’t you say to Mr Romeo ...[intervenes]      But the Board has no problem with these people why should we talk about Ms Molefe leaving when she makes it clear she is not asking for an exit, I think that’s what he is putting to you, why didn’t you say that, because you on your evidence you knew the Board to expect them to come back, and therefore if a particular executive says I have not asked for a separation and your colleague Mr Kumalo says no even though you haven’t asked for it I think we should talk about your leaving one would expect you to say why are you saying that.     So I think he is asking you why didn’t you say that?     Yes, but the point is you may have come to that meeting with Ms Molefe on the understanding that she also wanted to leave but the moment she clarified the position that she had not written requesting to be allowed to leave, one would then expect you to say oh that changes the picture then, at least as far as Ms Molefe is concerned.  We came here under the impression that all the executives want to leave, she doesn’t want to leave so Mr Kumalo why are you pursuing this issue of leaving, that’s the point.     Yes, no, no, that is fine.     Yes, okay, no, no, that’s fine.     I am sorry, Mr Seleka let’s just go back to this.     Of course the question that Mr Seleka puts to you about why you didn’t raise this would arise with regard to Mr Kumalo’s and would arise even with more force, to say Mr Kumalo here is an executive telling you I didn’t write to you wanting us to talk about my leaving, why did you then say we must talk about her leaving you know, and it raises another question Ms Klein, namely whether we might not hear we’re dealing with a situation where the Board as a body might not have ever taken a decision to say we don’t want them back, but there may have been some individuals within the Board who may have been working on the basis that these executives must leave, you understand what I am saying?     Yes, no, no, that is fine, yes, yes.     Yes, yes, we have a situation where Mr Matona gave evidence and said after my suspension I was so aggrieved that I used my own money to pay lawyers to go to the Labour Court to get the suspension set aside so I could go back to my job at Eskom, the Labour Court said there was some unfairness in my suspension but referred the matter to the CCMA.  At the CCMA the Board delegation asked for a postponement and they said they wanted to get a mandate from the shareholder Minister, and we had two meetings.  At the first meeting with the delegation of the  Board, and I think Mr Romeo Kumalo was one of them if I am not mistaken, Mr Matona says one of the members of the Board who was in that delegation when I said I want to go back to my job said that is off the table. So you have that situation, and then you now have a situation with Ms Molefe, a delegation of the Board is meeting with her on the understanding from what you have said that apparently the executives have been writing wanting to talk about separation.  She makes it clear that I have not written to – want to talk about separation, nevertheless your colleague Mr Kumalo wants the discussion to be – to focus on exactly that, and that is what happens. So it may well be that it was the Board, it may well be that the Board as a body had – didn’t have a problem but there were certain individuals within the Board who might have wanted the executives or some of the executives out.     Yes, no, no that’s fine.  We will hear all the evidence and see at the end what picture emerges.     Ja, Mr Seleka.     With Ms Molefe.     Mmm, in other words if Ms Molefe’s evidence that Mr Romeo Kumalo said to her after she had clarified that she had not written to the Board to talk about leaving Eskom if her evidence that he then said you know the inquiry or the investigation is still going to take long so maybe we should talk about a separation package, that statement by Mr Kumalo could not have been true because Dentons was about to complete its investigation and the three months that the Board had even Dentons had not been extended by the Board, so he would have known that the Dentons investigation was about to be completed, so one wonders why he would have said to somebody who says I haven’t asked that we discuss my departure from Eskom why he would have said you know the investigation may still take quite long, maybe we should talk about your separation, one wonders why that statement would have been made.   Of course he will come here, he will give evidence, we don’t know if he will admit that he made that statement but as I understand your position you say you recall Ms Molefe clarifying that she had not written to the Board wanting to talk about leaving, is that right?      Yes.     Yes, that part you would have known.     Ja, that part you would have known.     The other part you would have known is that the Board had not extended the three months.     Okay.     That’s fair enough.     That’s fair enough.     [Laughing]     You were not part of that meeting?     Maybe let’s take it step by step.  Is your question based on an affidavit from Dentons.     And a report.    And the question relates to the proposition that Ms Klein would have known at the time of the meeting with Ms Molefe that the Dentons investigation was about to end.     Yes I think the starting point is do you remember such a meeting of the Board on the – or was there a meeting of the Board ...[intervenes]      There is no, ja but Dentons says on the 11 t h they were told by Eskom, they don’t say who exactly at Eskom told them.     Okay do you know whether by the 11 t h of June the Board had taken the position that Dentons should submit their report?     You don’t recall?     Yes, okay, alright.     Yes, certainly from the mere fact that Dentons had been give three months from sometime in April, is it 20 April, or sometime in April had been given three months to complete its investigation, three months from around 28 February, I believe that is the date, I don’t know where I get that date from, it would be May, June, oh, it would be May, June, July, it would be about, so three months would be about July. Now the first meeting with Ms Molefe would have been what date, do you remember, it was end of May?     4 May or in May okay so that would have meant that there were still about two months to go but that period would be the same period that the executives would have known at the time of their suspension, because they were told that the investigation had been given three months.     That’s what they would have known.     So if Mr Romeo Kumalo did indeed say the investigation might take longer that could only have been understood to mean longer than the three months I would imagine?       But from your own knowledge as far as – at board level there was no basis for any member of the Board to say the investigation, the Dentons investigation would take longer than three months.       Ja, because the Board had never changed from its stipulation that three months was the period.     Ja.     Okay, alright.  Of course I think it would be fair to say to you Ms Klein apart from the fact that one would have expected you, which we have dealt with, to say to Mr Kumalo why must we talk to Ms Molefe about separation when she is making it clear that that is not what she wanted to talk about and we as the Board actually want them or expect that they would come back, once he also said the investigation would take longer one would expect you to say but where from, it is not my information that kind of thing.  You understand that?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine.    No, no that is fine.  That is fine.  Mr Seleka.    You cannot remember.    No, no that is …   Dentons.    Yes.    But also minutes can be sought.    To see whether …    There was any meeting of the board on that date.   And what was the content of the discussion.    Or whether it might have been a meeting of committee of the board.    Ja.  Okay.    Ja.    Okay.  Continue.    Ja.    Ja no I am hoping we can – we can finish with her evidence by one o’clock but I might have forgotten some of the parts that need to be covered.    It is important that we cover everything that is important that should be covered with her.    Ja.    So if we have to come – continue after lunch with her in order to do justice to the issues so be it.    But let us do the best we can to do as much as we can within the time available.    Ja.    Yes.   But do you – do you dispute the proposition that on the understanding or maybe let me put it this way.  Do you dispute the proposition that     If – if you knew the board’s position to be that it wanted Ms Tsholofelo Molefe like the other executives back after the investigation.  Once she said she was not asking to talk about her separation with – with you then you should not have pursued any separation discussions with her. Do you dispute that proposition?   In other words if you were part of a board that you knew wanted her back or at least had no problem with her coming back once she had indicated that she is not one of those who had written to say I want to talk a separation you should not have pursued with her any separation discussion.    No, no.  I understand that prior to your meeting her your understanding based on what you had been told was that she also wanted to talk separation.    Okay.  But the proposition is once you were at the meeting with her and she clarified her position and her position was no I have not written to the board to talk about separation.  I am actually happy to continue at Eskom.  Maybe she did not put it expressly like that but once she had made it clear that she was not one of those who may have written to say let us talk separation.  Then you had no business pursuing separation discussions with her as a delegation.  What do you say to that?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    No you did ja you said that.    Yes.    You see the difference on your evidence the difference between Ms – the position adopted by Ms Molefe and the position adopted by Mr Koko – I mean the position may have been the same but the articulation of the position might have been different in that maybe Mr Koko was much more emphatic and maybe did not even want to look at the figures but the fact does remain it seems that they both contemplated that they should go back.  Maybe one was more emphatic than the other and then as I say one would have expected that representatives of a board which    Ja.    Okay.    Mr Koko.    The proposition obviously that Mr Seleka is making to you is what Mr Koko says in his affidavit seems to be in conflict with what you said earlier on.  You remember you said you did not even get a chance to show him the figures.  But he seems to suggest that you actually did and he took the document away bla, bla, bla.  That was one of the – that was the reason you advanced to say the manner in which he responded to your approach as the delegation of the board was different from the manner in which Ms Molefe responded because you said Ms Molefe was prepared to look at the figures but Mr Koko was not.  But Mr Koko seems to say I was given the numbers, I looked at them as well.    Ja.  Hm Okay.    Is that Ms Molefe?    Ja.    And who is saying can we find a way of amicably parting ways.    Saying to Ms Molefe?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  So you have that situation and maybe there is not much you might be able to say about it.  You have a situation where the executive concerned Ms Molefe says, I did not write to talk about a separation.  But it is a member of the board who says; let us talk amicably parting ways.   So the question is, why was he adopting that attitude if the board to his knowledge had no problem with these executives coming back?  Was the position he was adopting reflective of the position of the board as a body or is the position that he was adopting a position that did not reflect the position of the board but reflected the position of either himself or of himself and a few other members of the board.  That is the question.   And if so what was the underlying basis for this in circumstances where when these executives were suspended they were told it is not on the basis of any wrongdoing.  And they were told you would come back after three months when the investigation is finished.  When did this change?  Those are the issues.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Of course with regard to Ms Molefe it – the matter goes further. She has testified that she even threatened to go to court against Eskom.  Now I cannot remember whether she said she made that threat at a meeting that she had only with Mr Khumalo because she said there was a meeting that she had with Mr Khumalo where Mr Khumalo had said to her he was there in his personal capacity.   And of course one has got to ask why – why he needed to go and see her in his personal capacity because he was supposed to deal with her as a representative of the board.  But she says at some stage in her interactions either with Mr Khumalo alone or in a meeting with Mr Khumalo and other members of the board who were delegated to talk to her she threatened to go to court and she says Mr Khumalo said something like, you do not want to take on the state or you do not want to litigate against the state.   In the end what we see is that her settlement, the payment is actually much more than the limit that had been put by the board.  As I understand the position the board had said the executives should not be paid more than twelve months salary.    But she – she said here that no ultimately she was paid I think something like one year six months or something like that.  But certainly more than twelve months you know.  And then one asks the question which of course you and I dealt with last time.  But more with her now to say why must the board go over even the limit they had put to pay her so much if they want her back?    Yes.    Ja.    You were –    You had nothing to do with the figure?    Oh the whole settlement.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.      Yes Sir.    You do not recall.    Well the settlement – her settlement agreement is in one of the bundles.  It was produced when she gave evidence.  But the point I think Mr Seleka is making and I just want to make sure whether you take issue with that is that his understanding of the evidence is that you were part of the first meeting with Ms Molefe.    And to the extent that there may have been further meetings you were part of that.  Obviously you may not have been part of the meeting that she had separately with Mr Khumalo where Mr Khumalo said he was – he came in his personal capacity.  But the point he is making is you might not have signed but it would appear like you were part of the people who were involved in negotiating the settlement.    That you accept?    So is the position that as far as you are concerned is your recollection that she had accepted twelve months or is your recollection that you do not remember what figures were discussed with her or you do recall that she did not want twelve months she wanted more but you ended up not knowing how much more she got.    It is the latter.    But of course there would not have been any discussion of legal fees on her part because she had not gone to court, is it not?    ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes, yes.     What you are saying is that whereas you were a member of the delegation representing the board that was mandated to negotiate with her ...[intervenes]      ...somehow you were excluded when it came to what amount was to be paid to her.  Is that what you are saying?     Yes.     Yes.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     Okay alright.  We are six minutes past one.  You want to follow up ...[intervenes]      ...a few questions?     H’m.     Not eighteen months ...[intervenes]      Ja, for all of them.     It might have been a wrong figure ...[intervenes]      A breakdown.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     What date is that?     Okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  Ja, she... I think she accepts that she ...[intervenes]    ...that she was involved in the negotiations.  But all she is saying is.  When the amount was offered or agreed, she was not part of that.     The actual amount.     Or the final amount that was agreed.     There is ...[intervenes]      Yes, there is a reference where you were reading.     Her email to where Ms Molefe said.  It     So let us go back to her...  Ms Molefe has made and see what she has said there if we have it.     Oh, okay.     No, no, no.  You ...[intervenes]      Just let him to make him to check.     I think you can mention it.     H’m.     What we can do.  Let us take the lunch break.  During the lunch break ...[intervenes]      ...look at those things.     When we come back, there may be a resolution.     And it may be that somebody in your team could even phone Ms Molefe.  She might be available.  She might not be available.      She might clarify some of the things that we talked about.     To say, you know ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja.     Ja, in the end, what remains is that, certainly on her evidence, she was paid as part of the settlement more than the 12-months’ salary that the board apparently had set as a maximum.   And Ms Klein confirms that at the first meeting with her, she did make it clear that she had not written to the board to invite discussions about separation.   And of course, she testified here that she even     Okay we adjourn.     Let us continue.     Okay alright.       Okay.     Thank you.  You confirm it got it right?     Okay alright.       Are you still on Eskom Bundle 02?     Oh, that is the letter from the minister at page 51, red 51?     Page one, four?     Okay.     Okay.     Do you know, and maybe Mr Seleka was still going to come to this.  Do you know whether the board either before the signing of the settlement agreement involving Mr Molefe or after was alerted to the fact that her amount was higher than the amount specified in the authorisation?       You do not recall it.  Yes.     H’m, h’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.  Do you have any recollection whether after the settlement agreements have been signed with these three executives, there was a time when these settlement agreements were circulated among all board     The terms.     You see, it is... it may be quite significant if the position is that one, at least in regard to Ms Molefe, the delegated authority of the board was exceeded in terms of the settlement and the board was never told even after.     Because that was a very material issue to bring to the attention of the board.  One would have expected that if the board had said the maximum is 12-months as it did say and the delegation that was mandated to negotiate felt that there would be no settlement with Ms Molefe if that maximum was not exceeded.   One would have expected that the delegation would go     Yes.  Now, if for some reason maybe there was a good reason or some explanation why things were not done that way.  One would have expected that at least after the settlement agreement with Ms Molefe had been signed and the person who signed it knew that that exceeded their mandate.   One would have expected that they would take the first     Okay.       Oh, yes.  Yes.     Yes, yes.  And then, if your evidence is correct that you did not know the final amount that was agreed with Ms Molefe, then it is very strange because one ask oneself the question.   Why did another member of the delegation of the board authorised to negotiate with these executives?  Who knew that the person authorised by the board to sign settlement agreements was you.   Why did he sign those... that settlement agreement instead of asking you to sign it because you were the person who had the authority?  And why did he not tell you about the amount?   Of course, it does raise the question also from your side to say, when you knew that you were the person authorised by the board to sign settlement agreements.   How did you allow somebody else to sign the settlement agreement in regard to Ms Molefe?   And if you did allow, how did it come about that you did not want to see the settlement agreement after when you know it was signed by somebody other than you as the authorised person?  Do you understand that?     Yes, yes.     Whether you were still the chairperson?     Okay.  So ...[intervenes]      ...it might have to be checked.  But if you cannot get it now ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja.     Yes, but I think the point she is making is.  She is not sure whether on the 25t h of June when the settlement agreement with Ms Molefe was signed, she was still the chairperson of P&G.  What she says she is clear about is that on the 2 nd of July, she was no longer chairperson of P&G.   She wonders whether there is a chance that she might have seized to be chairperson of P&G before the 25t h.  I am sure from your side, there is some checking that you can do.     Ja, so do your own checking as well ...[intervenes]      ...with Eskom.     Because if you were still chairperson, it has a certain significance.     If you were not, then it also takes a certain perspective.  Because it may be that... and if you are no longer chairperson, then the issue does arise as to how you allowed somebody else to sign because you were not the person who authorised anymore.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     You being moved from being chairperson of P&G, is that something that would have been discussed at a board meeting?  Because then it is a question of checking board minutes.      Yes, yes.     H’m.  Okay.     Ja, I think what she is saying is ...[intervenes]      In March, from what we are reading.  In March, she was made chairperson of P&G.     Sometime in June, she believes, she was taken off as chairperson of P&G but on the 14t h of July, she was reinstated as chairperson of P&G.     So the question what she does not know ...[intervenes]      And what we do not know at this stage ...[intervenes]      With effect from when ...[intervenes]      ...in June.     ...did she seize to be chairperson of P&G     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, but that might... your point might be addressing the question of whoever signed ...[intervenes]    ...does not appear to have been authorised to sign.  But she is addressing the point of ...[intervenes]      while she is still the chairperson of P&G ...[intervenes]      ...on the 25 t h of June.     Ja.     What I think you do recall because you said it earlier, is that you did ask him whether he could... he still trusted this board or whether he could still trust this board.  Is that correct?     You remember that part?     Yes.     Well, maybe you and Mr Seleka have a certain understanding of that sentence that he read as being attributed to you by Ms Daniels, namely, could you still come back or... because ...[intervenes]      ...to my inclination is to see it as very     Ja.     H’m.  Yes.  Now, what I am saying and I just want you to have the... both of you have the benefit of what is going on in my mind.   Is that, my inclination is that, you asked that question     Yes, ja.     Ja, yes.     H’m.     [laughing]  And I think Ms Klein may be understanding it that way too and she agrees.     Okay, it is two against one.  But I could take a chance and ask Ms Klein’s counsel, maybe he would be on my side.  [Laughter]  Okay, alright.     I am tempted to ask Ms Klein’s counsel.  He might be wishing not to commit himself.  No, that is fine, we understand.  Let us continue.     You never know, it is still a long way before we come to – I come to writing the report.  Who knows, maybe by the time I write the report I will have come around and…     Yes.     Can I have that affidavit by Ms Daniels.     The disadvantage of not having it and relying on you, Mr Seleka, is that there if there was something else I could pick up then I cannot pick it up because I do not see – I do not have it.  And Ms Klein should actually have her own as well so that she can see where you are reading.  She might pick up something on the next line which you do not read because you have stopped somewhere.     So everything that will be referred to we should all have, hey?  You were reading from page – oh, from paragraph 69.     Yes, has…?     Do you not have a copy for Ms Klein.     Ja, please.  Just make sure that we all have the same thing.     Ms Klein, do you remember – do you remember that Mr Koko was given quite some time to express his sentiments on the issue of his suspension because Ms Daniels says he was given a lot of time to do that, the other two had not been given that time.     Have you found something for her?     Of course, according to Ms Daniels, Mr Koko went to great lengths imparting to the board members that they had been misled and that he would not make it difficult for the board if the board says you do not fit, he would accede and leave Eskom.  Now that does not seem to be consistent with your evidence that he was adamant that he was not going anywhere.  That is at paragraph 70 on page 16 of Ms Daniels’ bundle.     Well, it may – ja, this is Ms Daniels who says he said he would not – and she puts this in quotations “would not make it difficult for the board” if the board says “you do not fit”, then she says he said he would accede and leave Eskom.   So that part, if it is true, gives me the impression of somebody who says I do not want to go but if the board says I do not fit into their plans, I will not fight, I will not make it difficult for them, I will accede and leave Eskom.  That is what – that the impression I get from what Ms Daniels says Mr Koko said.  Does that seem inconsistent with your impression of the position Mr Koko took in the meeting?     But I think there is something interesting in what you have just said.  If he said I do not want to go but if the board wants me to go, I will not make it difficult for them, I will leave, why would your reaction to that have been to say this person wants to go, let us talk about him leaving because you were representing a board which I am told wanted these people back, why would your attitude, your reaction not have been no, no, no, the board wants every executive who is happy to continue to continue?  Why would you have grabbed that and say okay, let us talk your departure?     Okay.  What does Mr Koko say about his meeting, does he – in his affidavit, Mr Seleka, does he say whether – does what he say reflect what Ms Daniels says here?     There is no indication in his affidavit that if the board insisted that he should go he would not make it difficult for them?     It does not – it is more consistent with what Ms Klein says in terms of his attitude?     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.       Into more details.     Ja.     Okay, alright.  Okay.  Well, I think Mr Seleka probably was still going to put this to you, if he has not already done so. I see that Ms Daniels at paragraph 73     Yes.     Okay.  Mr Seleka?     And I think Dr Ngubane did not dispute that part.     Of Mr Matona’s evidence.     I think one of the things you said a few minutes ago seemed to suggest that you were wondering how the Minister could come into these types of matters, into this settlement, talking about amounts and so on and I think what Mr Seleka is saying but that should not be surprising because Mr Matona said Dr Ngubane or somebody from the board at the CCMA said please, let us postpone your matter because we need to get a mandate from the shareholder Minister so – and if that is factually true, and Dr Ngubane did not dispute it, it may well be therefore that the Minister did get involved into amounts and so on.     Ja.     Okay, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Maybe the -  one could ask the question this way.  When you see that – a brief – that document which she says was document she was asked to prepare for the Minister, do you recall it as a document that your committee or you and your colleagues had asked her to do?     You recall that?     Okay, alright.     Okay.  And is it possible that it was at the meeting that Mr Seleka refers to where she was asked to prepare that document?  It is possible?     Yes, okay.     Yes.  There is then correspondence that seems to confirm what you say was your statement to Mr Koko, could you come back, and it seems as if – and you will correct is in that regard, that the board or maybe the P & G committee, I would not know, if fact did decide to have Mr Koko back.     Of course the question arises, why was it an issue for you or for you and the board whether Dentons had found any wrongdoing on the part of Mr Koko because Mr Koko, together with the other executives, had been suspended on the basis that there were no allegations of wrongdoing on their part, number one. Number two, the brief given to Dentons excluded them looking into any wrongdoing on the part of the executives.  So why was this an issue?  Why had this to be checked when you and your board knew that you never asked Dentons to investigate any wrongdoing on the part of Mr Koko or any of the executives?  Why now when there was a discussion about any one of them coming back or Mr Koko coming back was there an issue to say let us check if there is any wrong wrongdoing on – found by Dentons?     Ja.  Yes, yes.     Okay.  If they said they had found something – some wrongdoing, would that have made you to take the position that Mr Koko should not be allowed back or what – how would that have affected your judgment?     Okay.     Well, Mr Seleka, did you address you as Ms Daniels …[intervenes]     And asked her whether she recalls Ms Klein.  It has been a long day.     Yes, continue.     You confused her with Ms Daniels, that was your question.     Ja.      Okay.      Do we not have Mr Romeo Kumalo’s affidavit by now?     Yes.       Your voice has gone down.      Ja, raise it ja.      But we cannot wait for somebody who is on holiday.      Yes.     Yes, okay.       Yes, okay.      Yes, okay.      Yes.            Ja, I do not think the issue can be taken further.      Ja, okay let us proceed.      I think next time he makes this mistake he must pay Ms Klein.     And you know counsel can afford you know so he will understand if you demand quite a high amount.  Yes, let us continue.        Or maybe Mr Seleka maybe please do not, do not take your eyes away from what you are looking at but maybe let us ask this question which related to the question that Mr Seleka is asking.  Do you know whether your concern was shared by the other members of the board?      It was not to a large degree.     Yes, okay do you know why you would have this concern but the other members of the board or some of them would not have that concern or is that something you do not know?      Yes.      Okay.         Let me while Mr Seleka prepares to ask you his next question let me go back to your – his comfort that relates to the fact that three of the executives had left or were leaving and you were looking at the possibility that the fourth one could be allowed back.  What do you say to the proposition that that discomfort – you said your discomfort was twofold 1, are related to Ms Daniels the other one related to the fact that three of the executives were leaving but you were faced with the possibility of allowing back the fourth.  What do you say to the proposition that that discomfort you had is not consistent with somebody who knows that with regard to the three executives who were leaving they were leaving because that was there choice that discomfort is more consistent with somebody who knows that in regard to this three we may be accused of having pushed them out of not having wanted them back.  What do you say to that proposition?  In other words, if having negotiated with the three executives and you are clear in your mind that you wanted them back and they know that but they chose that they wanted to leave you would have no discomfort when you come to the fourth executive you adopt the same attitude.  The fourth executive say I want to come back because you would know that we have been consistent with all of them we are saying from our side we are happy for to come back but if you choose to go it is fine as well.   We are adopting the same attitude to Mr Koko if he chooses to come back we cannot be accused of anything because we are consistent but if the position is that with regard to the other three you think you may have acted inconsistently.  You may have not wanted them back or acted in a manner that seems to suggest you wanted them out then that discomfort would be there when you are faced with the possibility of allowing the fourth one back.  What do you say to that proposition?                        Yes, yes.      Yes, yes.      Yes, okay.        That might because the board mandated the P&G basically to do whatever the board had a mandate to do.        Is that fine, I am saying that maybe that, you might say no it is not but…[intervene]     Yes.       But you can pursue it does not mean you must pursue your question Mr Seleka if you want but I do not know in the end whether it makes much difference whether it is P&G or the board.          Mr Seleka sorry I think we are at twenty to four.  I would like us to go beyond 4 o’clock with Ms Klein if possible I would like us to finish with her.        But you if there are important issues that you will not have covered by that you can tell me.        But I would like us to try and wrap up with her by four.       That one yes.      The answer was yes?     Ja, okay I just wanted it to be captured.       Well going back to the mandate of the board to the delegation of three yourself, Dr Ngubane and Mr Khumalo you were the people who were authorised to negotiate settlements.  Now I seem to remember that the board had said something to the effect that we understand that these executives who have been suspended want to leave we are mandating you to negotiate settlements and they set out the parameters of that settlement and that that mandate did not include having anybody come back.  Is that correct?         Yes, so did your committee this group of three or the P&G but the mandate was given to the group of three.  Did this group of three go back to the board or to P&G at some stage and say in regard to Mr Koko the mandate you gave us cannot be effected because he wants to come back we have the authority to bring him back.  Did that happen?      No that is fine just as a matter of interest do you know whether the board was ever told that Ms Molefe at the first meeting with the representatives of the board had made it clear that she wanted to come back?          Even though ultimately a settlement was reached.  Do you know whether the board was ever told of that situation?       Okay.       Maybe to get this out of the way Mr – both Mr Dan Marokane and Ms Molefe if I remember correctly testified that they felt unwanted by the board.  Do you have any comment on that they felt unwanted?  You know Mr Marokane said he wrote I think a letter on the 18 t h of March after the suspension had begun and raised a number of issues and indicated his preparedness to contribute to solutions and so on and set out what he had done and he told me that actually around the 6 t h of March his portfolio had reached a milestone that had not been reached in 20 years or something.   I have even said so unbeknown to you in two days’ time your name would be among those who have been discussed for suspension in a Durban meeting.  So he said in that letter of the 18 t h he talked about what he had done and so on but there was no response from the board.  I think he sent another letter about himself or through his attorneys so he was not getting a response.  At a certain stage he thought you know I am not wanted and he reached out to Dr Ngubane to say it looks like there is no trust here anymore can we talk parting of the ways separation and from what he said Dr Ngubane did not make any attempt to say no, no actually the board wants you back or anything like that but he maybe thought that is Mr Marokane that interestingly whereas when he had been sending these letters over this period to the board there was no response, there was no acknowledgment of receipt of the letters.  Once he talked about separation there was an immediate response in a day or two.   Dr Ngubane made sure that he could you know he went back to him or whatever.  So they said they felt unwanted, I don’t know if you want – if you are able to make any comment.     Yes, okay, alright.     Ja.     Mr Seleka, despite what I said about finishing with Ms Klein at four, the bottom of line is the issues – we must do justice to the issues.  So, if you feel that there is still a few issues that are important to be dealt with, it’s fine but we might have to take a short break at four and then come back and continue.     Yes.     Let’s take the short adjournment, during the adjournment, maybe Mr Seleka, you could let Ms Klein see what you are reading from it might assist her.  So, when we come back then we will continue.  We will resume at quarter past four.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.    But what is the point about the presence or absence of names of individuals in the report?  Whether there were names or there were no names? What is the point about it?    Oh okay.    Okay.  Okay.    Okay.    Okay no then I understand.    Okay.  Okay.    I am sorry to interrupt you Mr Seleka.  I think – I think you did not complete the first part relating to Ms Daniels with the part that is really important.    Ms Daniels testified that she was called by Mr Koko to meet with him at Melrose Arch and she says they met I think at a certain restaurant but from there Mr Koko took her to certain offices where the two of them met Mr Salim Essa who said to Ms Daniels something along the lines what does one do if one wants to suspend an executive at – at Eskom?  Or what is the procedure for suspending executives at Eskom?   And actually went on to tell both Ms Daniels and Mr Koko that there were certain executives who were going to be suspended the following day at Eskom.  Because I think they were meeting on the 10t h if I am not – the 10t h March and that I think the names may have been mentioned or their portfolios but one of the things that Ms Daniels …    Ms Daniels said is that Mr Koko’s name was mentioned by Mr Salim Essa as also one of the people to be suspended.  And she says she looked at Mr Koko and Mr Koko did not show any reaction of being concerned or surprised or anything. And then Ms Dlamini gave evidence and said on the 10t h March she got a call from Mr Koko who wanted him or her to go to meet with him I think at Melrose Arch as well if I am not mistaken.    Yes at Melrose Arch and she was not available to go there because she was occupied in a certain session but he then asked her to give him her CV.  And then later in the evening the two of them did meet and because Mr Koko had not received her CV he asked her to send it to a certain email address and he did say to her that there were certain executives who would be suspended and she that is Ms Dlamini could be asked to act in one of the positions.   So the person that on the 11t h meets with you that is Mr Koko who seems very surprised and angry at the news that he may be suspended is not exactly accordingly to this evidence the same person that is not the same reaction that he seemed to have shown the day before when he and Ms Daniels met with Mr Salim Essa and Mr Salim Essa said he would be suspended.   So have that scenario.  So when Mr Seleka puts this to you that you end up allowing Mr Koko back whereas the other executives go it is against that background.  Okay.    Yes.   Hm. Hm. Well Ms Molefe also corroborates in a certain way Ms Dlamini’s evidence about her having received a call from Mr Koko because she says they were in the same session that day on the 10 March and at some stage I think around about lunch time Ms Dlamini approached her and told her that Mr Koko had phoned her asking that she should go to a meeting at Melrose Arch and she said that is Ms Molefe no you cannot go because we are busy tell Mr Koko to phone me if he wants to talk to me about it.  Or something to that effect.  You understand.    Yes.  Okay Mr Seleka I might not have put your question the way you wanted to – the angle so feel free to put in – put it to her in the angle you wanted.    Yes.  You remember I said to you earlier on it is possible that we may – I mean Eskom may have had a board which as a body wanted the executives back or had no problem if the executives came back but had had individuals within the board who did not want the executives to come back.  That is one scenario.   Another scenario could be that the entire board or the majority of the board at least did not want them back.  So there are those possible scenarios.    Ja.    You know Ms Klein on the evidence that I have heard and on some of the things that I am reading affidavits and so on one gets the impression maybe it is not it is more than an impression that actually probably it is not an impression.  The decision or the idea that there should be an inquiry at Eskom and that certain executives must be suspended came from outside of Eskom.  It seems quite clear.  You know.    Ja.  Now the question that arises is with whom did it originally originate?  Who came up with this idea and to whom did he or she sell this idea until it came to the Durban meeting – until it came to the board on the 9t h and on the 11t h?  Who outside of Eskom originally came up with this idea and what was his or her agenda?   It is possible that some of the members of the board knew quite well by the meeting of the 11t h where the idea came from and who was really behind this idea but they had no problem pursuing that idea.   It is possible that among the board members there were some who did not know these things.  Who did not know where this idea really came from.  Who only knew what was said at the meeting and what they were told by Mr Tsotsi and by Mr Nick Linnell.   And it is possible that among the board members there may have been some who were misled.  There may have been some who may have genuinely thought that – that there was no other agenda other than trying to fix problems at Eskom.   But the moment you hear that on the 10 t h Mr Koko called Ms Daniels and took her to a meeting with Mr Salim Essa.  Now if that part of Ms Daniels’ evidence is true then it paints a different picture.  And if the evidence that – her evidence that Mr Salim Essa told her that there were some executives who would be suspended then he seems to have known the names already and was asking what procedure should be followed at Eskom if they wanted to suspend – if you want to suspend an executive. All this is very worrying.  And of course you have if Ms Dlamini’s evidence is correct then you have Mr Koko approaching Ms Dlamini and asking her to go to meet him at Melrose Arch. And of course I think Mr Seleka read Mr Koko’s affidavit where he denies I think having called Ms Dlamini on the 10t h as alleged by Ms Dlamini.   But the investigators have found cell phone records from which it would appear that – or that day alone Mr Koko tried numerous times to reach Ms Dlamini and ultimately reached her only twice.  But the other times he seems to have tried and not succeeded.  If that – is those cell phone records are correct. And then I have heard evidence when Doctor Ngubane was giving evidence here that when he was acting Chairperson or Chairperson at some stage he received from Mr Salim – I do not know whether it was Mr Salim Essa or Mr Howa – Howa who sent a document to Doctor Ngubane at Eskom in which they were – if he was effectively saying the board should make the following resolutions.   And the resolutions were about how the board should – what position the board should take with regard to certain newspapers which had written certain articles.  And Doctor Ngubane admitted that he put that to the board and the board went along. So you may well have heard a board here which was being controlled from outside and was not acting in the best interest of Eskom.  And in that context it may be that there were some members of the board who were – who knew exactly what was happening – who knew the agenda and there may well have been other members who were not privy to all of those agendas but who went along for whatever reason. So that – that is a picture that seems to be emerging.  Did you want to say anything about it?    He seems to admit the call that led to the meeting but my recollection is that he did not seem to admit the earlier call during the day or does he?    Oh he – but on his version does it look like he only admits one call to her?    Ja.    Yes.    Oh okay, okay.    So it may be that what he is saying is I called her once but the purpose of the call was to invite her for dinner.  It could mean that I am not saying I called her once I am saying whatever times I called her it was not for asking her to go to Melrose Arch but it was for dinner.    But of course Ms Dlamini has said that he never called her for dinner and they did not have dinner.    Ja.    They met for about twenty minutes at KFC or McDonalds and that was all.    Okay.    Are you asking whether she recalls having seen something along those lines in the minutes or are you asking her whether she recalls that that is what is happened or are you asking her whether she recalls both?    What is that?    With who?    Who was the acting CE again?    And what date would that have been when they met with her – with him?    I thought they were supposed to have met with somebody at Melrose Arch on the 10t h March.    Okay.  Do you know…    Of anything along those lines?    Yes okay.      Well that does not say with – with whom they allegedly met.  Does it say?    Ja, ja.    Ja that would be – that would certainly be different from what I understood to have happened on the t h.  I understood that the people who were going to act in the positions of the executives were called to a meeting at Melrose Arch.  I am under the impression maybe wrongly that they would have met with Mr Salim Essa there maybe with Mr Koko as well but that might not necessarily be so.  But I do not remember having heard or noted that they had had a meeting with the acting CE.   But if – but if people are going to be appointed to act in a position it is – it is not unusual that they would be informed ahead of other people. If Mr Seleka I think I am going to fire you tomorrow.  I would need to know whether I will have somebody to take your position and therefore I might talk to that person before I tell you about firing you.  Because I do not want to be in a situation where I fire you and then I cannot find somebody to act in your position.   So on the face of it if they were – if they were meeting with the CE let us say for example the day before their acting appointments were to be announced that would not – that would not be of concern to me because I would take it that the board asked the CE to – to tell them. But if they were meeting with people from outside of Eskom – outside of Eskom with outside people that is different.    Oh okay.     Well, let me first say.  If Mr Zethembe Khoza met with the people earmarked for appointment to act in positions, if he met with them before he was told that he would be acting CE, that gives a different picture.   But if he met with them after he had been told that he would be acting CE and after he had been told that maybe these are the other people who would act in the different positions, then I would not have any problem with that.   But from what you say and from the reaction of the board, it looks like the board had not told him that he would be acting CE at the time he met with them.  Is that right?  From what you read in the emails.     They were surprised.     Yes.  Did you remember anything like that in the meeting?     So you cannot deny that that was said but you simply say, you cannot remember hearing that being said.     Ja.     Okay.     H’m.     Maybe, let her continue.     We will see at the end whether she is talking about that.       She says    At some stage, she will tell us whether it includes what you have said.     Now, having heard some of the evidence that has come out here, some of it came out in the Portfolio Committee in parliament and maybe based on whatever else you may have read.   Looking back, do you not believe that there probably were people outside of Eskom who were influencing decisions that were being taken by the Board of Eskom?     Yes.     Yes, yes.  The report, the Dentons’ report... Mr Seleka was reading from somewhere that Dentons say they were told they had three months to investigate.   I guess it probably means investigate and submit their report.  But they say seven weeks into that three months, they were told to stop and prepare a report.   Now, do you know what justification the board had for asking Dentons to stop their investigation after only seven months(sic) of investigation when the investigation...  When the same board had thought the investigation warranted three months?  Do you know what justification the board had for stopping them so early into their investigation?     You see, that is worrying to me because one of the executives who were suspended, it may have been Mr Dan Marokane.     He says, I think in one of the letters he wrote to the board or to the chairperson of the board or maybe he said so in his evidence but I think he said so in one of his letters.   He says but there have been a lot of investigations     October 2015...  October 123, 2015,  I have heard evidence from Mr Jonas that at that time when he had a meeting with somebody from the Gupta’s who seemed to have been Tony Gupta, that person told him, Mr Jonas, then Deputy Minister of Finance, that we have a number of people who are working with us.   And he mentioned some of them.  And Brian Molefe is one of them.  Ms Lynne Brown is another one.  I think he mentions one or two others.   Mr Jonas says to me when he gave evidence here.  He     H’m, h’m.  Mr Seleka.     And it goes back to a question that I raised both with you and I think with Mr Matona and Dr Ngubane if I am not mistaken earlier on, to say.  I do not understand the need for the suspension of the executives in circumstances where the board says the investigation is not into any allegations of wrongdoing on their part.   And I was saying, if there is a genuine desire to find a solution, how do you exclude the people who have... who worked with this all the time, who are the leaders?  How do     ...even if they were outside but it goes back to that question.  So you then say, seven months(sic) into the investigation, it is stopped by the board.  It is stopped because it is said what is coming out is nothing new.   And one of the executives seems to have thought exactly that, that really there are reports.  There have been investigations.  We know what you are going to find.   But because they were pushed out in the way in which they have simply been pushed out, this is what happened.  And then the board realises, really there is nothing new.   So we should stop.  But maybe the board realised or some of those members of the board who may have known what the agenda was ...[intervenes]      ...realised    Yes.  No, it would be important if one could find minutes to that effect because I certainly have not had that part.     But Mr Tsotsi did say that when he was told at the Durban meeting about the idea that there should be an inquiry as into the affairs of Eskom, that resonated with him because he had himself thought about the idea of an inquiry, that is what he said, you know?  So it was easy for him to go along with that part.   The part which he said he found difficult was the suspension of the executives but whatever – what we do know is that Mr Tsotsi was called to a meeting in Durban by Ms Myeni, according to Mr Tsotsi’s version, to meet with the former President, Mr Zuma, and he came and at that meeting the idea of an inquiry was raised as well as the suspension of the executives.   Whether either the then President or Ms Myeni had got the idea of an inquiry from the war room or from somebody who was assisted with the war room, we do not know but I have also seen Ms Lynne Brown’s affidavit who makes it clear that he knew nothing about the Durban meeting.  She makes that clear.  And that is strange if the Minister responsible knew nothing about the plans for that meeting but Ms Dudu Myeni, who had nothing to do with Eskom, was the one coordinating and calling everybody to the meeting and, of course, according to Mr Tsotsi and Mr Linnell, when they met with Mr Zuma in that meeting, according to them it was clear that Mr Zuma knew the issues that were being discussed.  So the idea of an inquiry that was being pursued by the board was the idea that was raised at the Durban meeting.  Whether before it went to the Durban meeting it had been to the war room or it came from somewhere else, we do not know.  Okay.     Yes, okay.     Ja, that is fine.     Yes.     Ja, no, you can come back to it.     Yes, maybe it might be in an affidavit way, that is fine.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, but I think Mr Seleka’s point is this.  When the Minister arrived on the 11 t h, as I understand the position, Mr Matona had not finished presenting his plan, he was interrupted by the fact that the Minister had arrived and the board had to meet with the Minister.  That is my     But even if it was not the turnaround strategy, he had begun – he had been appointed as Group CEO I think with effect from sometime in October or beginning of November, I cannot remember – or beginning of October, beginning of November, that is when he was appointed.  So would this not be a situation where even if he had not yet come up with a turnaround strategy, given the shortness of the period within which he had been at Eskom, that would be understandable and he should therefore be given a chance to come up with a turnaround strategy?     You see, I – you may be saying in your view even that period that I say was short was long enough or somebody who is paid so much money if he was worth that amount to have prepared a turnaround strategy and have it ready, you might be saying that – and I cannot necessarily say that is not true, I am not sure - but on the face of it, it just seems to me that given the fact that he was appointed so late in the year and given the Christmas, December, January holidays, it maybe that it is unfair to expect that be early March he would have completed a turnaround strategy particularly because I imagine that if a strategy was to be successful, he would had to get a buy-in from various units within Eskom and maybe even stakeholders, I am not sure, there had been no board which maybe could have approved that strategy if he needed to present to approve it before he could use it, I am not sure.  This board had its induction mid-January.  They were appointed in December.  It seems to me that there may be room for saying given all of this maybe it was not – it would not be fair to expect that by early March he would have had a strategy that had had the buy-in of all concerned.  But you might say the world in which you have operated is different, forget about holidays, when there is a job to be done, you get into the job, he should done, a, b, c, d and have the turnaround strategy read by the induction of the new board.     So feel free to say that is…     That is what you are saying.  Okay.     No, you did not say completed, ja.     Oh, ja, you said that, ja.     Ja.     Yes, yes, okay.     Of the strategy, okay, okay.     But surely – please do not forget your line of though, Mr Seleka.      The one part which you are not mentioning even before you come to the appointment of the Dentons, which I was going to raise with you in due course, is Mr Tsotsi is himself kicked out by this board and Mr Tsotsi testified before me to the effect that around about beginning of February around the days of the State of the Nation Address 2015, he was called by Minister Lynne Brown to a meeting where she said to him Chairperson, I am getting complaints that you are interfering in operational matters, or something like that, you must stop that or otherwise I will find somebody else to do your job.  Mr Tsotsi says later that day, same day, maybe a few hours later, he got a call from Mr Tony Gupta, I think he asked him to come for a meeting with him, and at that meeting Mr Tony Gupta said to him Chairperson, you are not assisting us, we are the ones who put you into this position, we can take you out.   Within two month thereafter this board has kicked Mr Tsotsi out.  It has kicked out these three executives, it has kept Mr Koko, it kicks out Mr Tsotsi, against this background of this evidence, which has at least not so far been denied, and it stops the investigation.  It stops the investigation and, of course, I mean, there is the issue of Mr Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh being taken from Transnet and brought to Eskom.  And, of course, later I have had evidence about some of the things they are alleged to have done at Eskom which are alleged to have benefited certain people. So, I said do not forget your line but I though you may have forgotten the Tsotsi matter.     He has been kicked out against the background of what had been told by him by Minister Brown, according to his evidence, and by Tony Gupta, according to his evidence.     Well, the executives it seems are paid not less than R18 million, all of them, the three.  So if you say R18 million to the executives, R17 million to Dentons, you are going to what, 35 million?  This is the board of an entity that is said to be in serious financial trouble and this investigation, for which they pay so much, is stopped immediately, within seven weeks.  Lots of money is even to the executives. For what?  To allow them to go.  To allow them to go, that is what it seems to be.     It ends up – it goes back to was there a good reason?  Was there a good reason to get rid of the executives?  Was there a good reason to pay the executives the amount that they were paid and then you ask yourself the question were there good reasons to bring in this investigation and spend R17 million or was all this simply and excuse – was it part of an agenda to achieve certain things?  Some people – that some people might have known about, maybe others might not have known about, that that is the context.     Yes, yes.     No, you have, you have and I think you cannot add.  I think the reason why one keeps on coming back to this, because the more you think about it, the more you really get very concerned.     Ja, ja.  But at some stage, Mr Seleka, I think I would like to hear what Ms Klein has to say about whether the charges that were preferred against Mr Tsotsi and that whole thing, whether that was justified, that was genuine or whether charges had to be found because he needed to go, according to certain people and, of course, maybe not everybody in the board might have been privy to any agenda.     So but I just mention that at some stage you might deal with it.     Yes, no, no, that is fine.     Ja.     Yes.     Okay, no that is fine.  Let me ask this question.  Was the Dentons’ report used to any useful effect in the end by the board?     Now I assume that if that is correct, if that is true, it may be that its recommendations that they made that may have been used like that as opposed to what they unearthed, because you have told me that seven weeks into the investigation they were told to stop because what they were unearthing was what was known, is that correct?   Ja, so it may have been just recommendations.     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Yes but of course what you would have – what you would be expected to have been interested in as a Board member is whether the work of Dentons made any difference at Eskom, whether the investigation or the recommendations ended up making a difference at Eskom because you would want to know did the people we brought in as a Board add value, you know to Eskom, if they made recommendations, it is one thing to say different units must use those, but you would go beyond that one would expect, in due course say give us a report.  The implementation of those recommendations how does it work practically, how – has it been helpful, you know that’s the kind of thing one would expect Board members to want a report on at some stage or another.   Is that something you are not able to say?     Yes, yes.     Okay.     Okay.     We are at ten to six.     And you didn’t know what was known before?     Okay.     Let – maybe that is so and Mr Seleka will deal with that, but what do you say to the proposition that he was presented to you as the Board and for whatever reasons you embraced him, you embraced his role, you did not object, you didn’t say no, no, no Mr Tsotsi have you followed procurement procedures, what, what, what, you didn’t say that as the Board.   You allowed him to take part in the meeting, actually when one reads the transcript one sees that he was allowed to play a very active role in the making, he was being asked these questions and he was allowed to play that active role, so the question arises how does the Board allow somebody to do this, to play this role, they embrace him and then afterwards seek to charge Mr Tsotsi alone and say you procured the services of this man without processes, that is the question.     That I understand up to a certain point when you make the point that as far as you  are concerned it looks like he was brought in under false pretences, that might be a separate issue.  The charge as I understand what Mr Seleka is saying, the charge didn’t seek to talk about him being brought in under false pretences, it sought to say Mr – to allege that Mr Tsotsi did something, brought him in without the Board’s approval, without following processes, and yet the Board embraced him, that is the question that is being put to say how could you as the Board see it as right to charge Mr Tsotsi or bringing Mr Linnell into the Board to play this role and yet you had embraced him, and you had embraced his role, rightly or wrongly but you had embraced him, why do you then charge Mr Tsotsi now.     That is what I am saying.     Yes, yes, no that is what I am saying because the charge is not about whether he was qualified to do the job, it is not about whether he was brought in under false pretences, it says Mr Tsotsi you brought in this person without the Board’s approval or without following processes and yet if the Board had an objection to how Mr Tsotsi brought him in the Board had an opportunity to say hang on Mr Tsotsi we can’t let Mr Nick Linnell play this role without following procurement processes.   Have they been followed?   They didn’t say that, they embraced him, they embraced his role and then turned around and said we are charging Mr Tsotsi, and that is difficult to understand for a Board that acts like that, and when you add all these other things that we have been talking about, decisions being – seemingly being taken outside of Eskom, being pushed to the Board to take and to rubber stamp, that kind of thing, you get worried to say what exactly was going on here, and then of course you remember Mr Tsotsi’s evidence.   I was told by Mr Tony Gupta that they put me into this position, they could take me out because I was not assisting them, and of course sitting here Ms Klein I can’t not remember also Mr Jonas’ evidence that the Gupta brother who met with him on the 23 r d of October 2015 at the Gupta residence, who seems to have been Tony Gupta, told him, according to Mr Jonas, that Mr Nene was going to be fired as Minister of Finance because he was not working with them, and indeed Mr Nene was fired in six weeks time, and Mr Nene was fired under very strange circumstances, he was fired in circumstances where the President himself was saying in the media statement that was issued that Mr Nene had done a sterling job as Minister of Finance, so the question arises how do you fire your star minister who you say has done a sterling job, that has been the media statement that was issued, that is before the Commission, and then you say you are firing  him because he is your candidate for a certain position that has not been advertised and he sits at home for more than a year, nobody ever contacts him about this position and of course I have heard evidence from one of the people at the bank where he was supposed to get a job saying no the rules of that bank would not have allowed this.   Mr Nene himself has said here before me that reason given by Mr Zuma was a fabrication, that’s what Mr Nene said under oath here. So when one looks at these things questions arise, and sitting here and looking at evidence that I have been hearing from a lot of witnesses I also remember that Mr Themba Masego gave evidence and said Mr Ajay Gupta told him that Ministers who don’t want to work with them they report them to President Zuma, that is what Mr Themba Masego said Mr Ajay Gupta told him.  That evidence remains un-contradicted. So I am bound to think about all of these things as I hear what was happening at Eskom.     Ja okay thank you.     There was no formal written contract but he was allowed to play a role in the affairs of Eskom, of the Board for the duration of a certain time.     Yes, ja.     Mmm.     Ja.     But how – on what basis did you take the view that he was responsible for the statement reaching the media at the time that it did?     I can tell you that there are affidavits of witnesses that have been submitted to the Commission that have found their way into the media in circumstances where they should not be in the media and that is something that is of great concern to me and sometimes when they do, when that happens a copy might be with me because I have been given it so that I can work on it, a copy might be with a member of the legal team, a copy might be with an investigator.   Investigations have been done by the commission to see how do these leaks happen, but somebody outside of the commission may well be having a copy as well, and they happen, so one wonders whether a Board that had no agenda to get rid of Mr Tsotsi wouldn’t have handled that differently in circumstances where they didn’t have anything to say he was responsible for that because what would he be seeking to achieve by leaking that prematurely.   You know, I don’t know, maybe somebody in the Board might have had an answer to say this is what he would have wanted to achieve, I don’t know, so ja, okay.     So the point you are making is that there is a media statements, a proposed media statement that passed through you but you say that one did not have these things and you are saying the one that found its way into the media had these things.     Yes, of course one would come back to the question why would the Chairperson of the Board leak a statement to the media that had not yet been approved by the Board in circumstances where everybody knew, including him that the Board had to approve.  What would he have been rushing to achieve that could not wait until t he Board had approved?     Well it is the kind of question that I am saying the Board before charging him with this ought to have asked itself to say if we are saying we are charging the Chairperson for this what are we saying he would have wanted to achieve, why would he have done this?   He is the Chairperson of this Board, he would have known that there was a media statement being prepared, which would have had to be approved by this Board then it could be sent to the media.  What is it that he would have been in a rush to achieve by sending out actually a statement that has not been approved?    Why would he do that?   I am suggesting to you is the board should have said but it does not make sense to think it was him.       Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     You see, if the board’s thinking was that it was Mr Linnell, maybe there would have been no basis for thinking along those lines.  Maybe there would have been for present purposes, I leave it at that.   But I have more difficulty with the board thinking that the chairperson would prematurely release such a statement.  I am inclined to think the board should have thought but why would it have...  Why would he really have done that when he knew the time before he gives us the media statement and then we approve it and then it can go out?     H’m.     Yes, yes.     No, thank you.     Mr Seleka, we are at quarter past... fifteen minutes past six.  I would like us to finish at half-past six if we can.     I am mentioning that because if we are not done by that time, we might have to adjourn and unfortunately, Ms Klein might have to give us another.. might have to come back.  But I would have liked us to finish with her.       She was here already yesterday.     And there really kindly had no objection to coming back today and she has been on the witness stand for the whole day.  But also, I am thinking ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Oh, ja.  [laughing]     But I do not know.  What is your own assessment of how far we are to finishing issues?  But as I said, you know, the issues we are dealing with are important.     If we have to arrange for her to come back, we might have to do that.     But if we are about to finish, then it is fine.     Ja, okay.     Okay.  Well, I must say to Ms Klein.  Just remember that even if come half-past, we say we are finished.  We might think of something later.     And ask you to come back. [laughing]     [laughing]     Ja, okay alright.     Well, the first question is in effect.  How can you now, more than five years later, say that the statement that was leaked to the media was not the same as the statement that went through the P&G Committee, because...  I guess, it is Mr Tsotsi, who said in your presence, the statement that went to the media is the same statement that went through the P&G Committee.       Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And the idea is simply that, if at that time, your knowledge was that the statement that was leaked to the media was not the one that went through the P&G     H’m.     Yes.     H’m, h’m.  But remember that Mr Seleka is reading where he says Mr Tsotsi said in effect, I am putting it     Is about the charge?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     But remember, that if the charge was    You must acquit him on the charge because if he says it was the same statement, the one that was leaked or that went to the media, is the one that went through the P&G Committee.   So now, when he confirms you or when he says that, if     Ja.     Ja.     Mr Seleka knows the ...[intervenes]      Just assist her in terms of where to find what.     [Indistinct] [microphone not switched on.]     Ja.     Yes.     I am sorry.  Just come closer to the ...[intervenes]      Come closer to the mic and face this side.     Ja.     No, at this stage, one is not necessarily saying you have done something wrong.  At this stage, one is trying to understand why the board behaved the way it behaved.   One... under charge one, it charges Mr Tsotsi with bringing Mr Linnell without following processes or without the board’s approval and yet it embraced Mr Linnell.   So one does not understand this kind of behaviour.  Two, it now charges him with leaking or sending out a media statement without the knowledge or consent of the board.     Yes.     Ja, without the board being informed.  But that is that part.     But that is not what you have asked her for now.     Oh, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Of the board.  So one is simply saying.  Is this a case where the board genuinely had a reason to act against Mr Tsotsi or could it be that Mr Tsotsi was not wanted as chairperson of this board anymore and something had to be found to kick him out?   And when one thinks about that Ms Klein, one has got to also think about who replaced Mr Tsotsi when he has been kicked out.       He is replaced by Dr Ngubane as Chairperson.  And Dr Ngubane had an existing relationship with Mr Salim Essa.  He acknowledged that when he gave evidence here.  Number one.   Number two, later on as chairperson of this board, Dr Ngubane has the kind of relationship with Mr Salim Essa that he seems to allow Mr Essa to send him documents, indicating what decisions must be taken by the board.  And Dr Ngubane places those before the board and the board takes those decisions.   So you then go back to saying, early February, Mr Tsotsi     ...were dealt with in in a particular document.  Is it a coincidence or was this... was the whole thing part of a larger plan?  We will get rid of these three executives.   Maybe because we know that they are not the type of people who are going to cooperate with us.  Or because we do not know whether they will cooperate or they will not.  Once we have got rid of them, we will get rid of Mr Tsotsi because he is not cooperating.   Then we will push somebody into the position of chairperson of the board that we know will allow us to influence what the board is doing.   And then, we will go... we will then say, let us bring in Mr Brian Molefe from Transnet and Anoj Singh and they will then be brought to Eskom.   So one asks the question where it was part of a bigger plan or whether it was a coincidence that these three executives were left.   That Mr Tsotsi left or was kicked out.  That it was Mr Brian Molefe and Mr Anoj Singh who were brought in.  Whether all of these were coincidental.       H’m.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     December 2014.     Ja.     No, no.  I understand what you are saying and one does...  I mean, one of the questions that arose with me is.  Both in regard to... well, firstly in regard to Mr Matona.       Mr Matona.     To say, but this man was appointed ...[intervenes]      ... to this position at Eskom only in October.     Why do you want to get rid of him so quickly?  It does not seem to make sense.     He had not been allowed, it seemed to me, to show himself, his capabilities, put together his plans and test them and see whether they worked.  And when he is got rid of, it is not on the basis that he is being confronted to     Then you come to Mr Tsotsi and you say    And then he gets... got rid of like this.  But of course, the person who allowed him to continue is the minister.  And on the face of it, it is not the minister who got rid of him.  It is the board.  This board was new.  It had not worked with him for a long time and suddenly seems to be so intolerant of him and get rid of him.   Then Dr Ngubane takes over and Brian Molefe is brought in.  Then Mr Anoj Singh is brought in.  And of course, we know later in 2015, certain things happened with regard to optimum coal and better and so on.  Ja, okay.     [laughing]  Ja-no, I think if...      I think we have to stop.     One or two questions?     But we... after that... but I do not want us to not do justice on issues.     If you ask those two, will you be comfortable that we have covered them or we should arrange for Ms Klein to come back later?  I do not want us to...     Ja.     Yes.     Well, maybe we should adjourn.  Maybe we should adjourn.     If obviously, you note where you were.  [laughing]     Ja.     But when she comes back, how much time do you think you need?     H’m?     Thirty minutes.     [laughing]  Oh, well ...[intervenes]      This gets slapped to me all the time.  [laughing]     Sorry?     Ja-no, we must adjourn.  If at all possible, I was thinking.  Maybe... I think Dr Ngubane is coming on Tuesday, is it not?     If at all possible, we could start with her ...[intervenes]      ...before Dr Ngubane.     How is your... do you know whether that is doable?     And ...[intervenes]      And your counsel?     Yes.     The whole of next week?     Mr Seleka, says he needs about 30-minutes.  I doubt if I will have a lot of questions.  I give no guarantee but I doubt.       I am wondering whether it might be possible, depending on when your arbitration starts and when it finishes, whether it might be possible to start early with her on one of the days next week.   And you come and then we give that 30-minutes or whatever and then you can proceed.   Or we... she comes in the afternoon late, like, four o’clock or five o’clock.  We take 30-minutes.  You might be out of that arbitration.  Is that doable?     For the afternoon, yes.     No, no.  That is fine.  I think what should happen then.  Mr Seleka will talk to you and obviously Ms Klein, which of the days next week we will see but let us find a day where she can come, four o’clock or five o’clock.  And you... when your arbitration might be done for the day.     Then we finish.  Is that alright?     Okay.  Would that be fine with you Ms Klein?     [laughing]     [laughing]  Okay alright.       Okay alright.  Thank you very much to everybody who... everybody has cooperated.  Thank you very much.     We are going to adjourn for the day.  And tomorrow ...[intervenes]      ...I will hear an application at nine and after that, there will be another witness who will be coming in.     There is two more?     Okay alright.       Okay.  Thank you.  We adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chair.    We are ready Chairperson.    Yes the first witness Chairperson for today is Ms Venete Klein.    Thank you.  Chairperson Ms Venete Klein is coming for the second time in regard to the issue of suspension of the executives and the – the appearance this time around is to complete her testimony in regard to that.  We will be using the previous bundle Chairperson it is paginated differently from the bundles we have been using recently which is the black pagination and the red pagination.  In her bundle we only have the red pagination.    And that is Eskom Bundle 02.    Oh so they – they must have printed you a bundle different from mine Chairperson.    I was going to ask her to..    Yes just assist the witness.    No it seems to be like mine.    It is that one.    Thank you Chairperson.    Ms Klein is legally represented Chairperson by a colleague of mine.  Maybe he could place himself on record?    Thank you chairperson.    Okay.  I will – I will do so Chairperson.    Ms Klein thank you.    Chairperson?    Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Ms Klein thank you once more for coming before the commission to assist the commission.  So you have that file before you which contains your affidavit.  You see that?    Ms Klein because we have done your testimony.    Let us…    On page 2 Ms Klein.    Yes.  It is between tramlines it is written statement by Venete Klein to the commission of inquiry into state capture; on page 2.  But I believe that this has been commissioned.  If you go to page 24 which is the last page of the affidavit.    Correct Chair.     Thank you Ms Klein.  Ms Klein n regard to the suspension of the executives briefly just by way a background today we dealt with your appointment as one of the newly – one of the new board members in December 14.  Correct?    And from – from there we – we addressed the activities of the board prior – leading up to the meeting of the 9 t h and the meeting of the 11 t h March 15.      You recall that?  And an issue – it is not an issue really there was clarification needed to be done as to whether the first board meeting was that of the 26 February 2015 which got cancelled or whether there was a prior board meeting before that date.  Correct?    And I think you were pointing out to the Chairperson that your recollection is that there was a board meeting on the – in January.    2015.    It – I think the reference…    Yes.  Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Ms Klein’s legal representatives did provide us with a bundle that has minutes of some meetings Chairperson.  But the witnesses have come here and testified that there were some level of engagement at supplementary levels.  There is a minutes of a meeting on the 16 January 2015 where I thought maybe Ms Klein was going to refer the Chairperson to that.  We already have it in the bundle.      Yes.    Okay Chair.    Correct.    Yes.    Ms Klein ja we understand that but just to clarify for the Chairperson as well.  In your own affidavit you do say the 16 January was the induction on paragraph 23; page 6.  So it is not only the Chairperson who subsequently says that was an induction others have said the same.  But you also have said the same.  And remember last time I pointed out in your statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee you called it a board meeting but this affidavit subsequently done you called it an induction.    Yes thank you Ms Klein.  So Ms Klein then we went through process and we came to the meeting of the 9 t h you say you could not attend the meeting of the 9 t h.    And – but we saw that you sent an email showing your interest in becoming part of the sub-committee or an ad hoc committee that was being proposed to champion to oversee the inquiry.    Yes.  And that was in a memorandum which we have learned was prepared by Mr Nick Linnell.  An email of which – it was attached to an email sent to board members?    With a proposal of the resolution by the board?    Then we have you did not make the meeting.  We have the meeting of the 11 t h because the meeting of the 9 t h the board members decided that no want to see the Minister.    And then – and the meeting of the 11 t h was convened.    Yes.  But remember that email was presented to you Ms Klein because you had said to the Chairperson you objected to a short notice and raised the governance issue.  You recall that?    Yes.  And it became apparent that the memorandum and the proposal to establish an inquiry was a request of President Zuma at the time.    Mr Linnell has said to the Chairperson that there seems to have been board members who met with the Minister prior to the meeting of the 11 t h in regard to this issue of the inquiry.  Do you know of that?    When did it apparent to you that this was the request of the President?    I am sorry when – when did you become aware that it is a request by the President?    Yes.  That was after the meeting of the 9 t h.    But before the meeting of the 11 t h.    Yes.  You say you did not become part of the committee that oversaw the – the inquiry.    Yes.    But you certainly will recall from the board meeting that the delegation was made to People in Governance and Audit and Risk to oversee the entire process.    And that you were part of People in Governance? MS    Ja no chairing beside the point but you want – you did not want to chair the sub-committee that was being established or did you?    Yes you just wanted to part of it.    Yes.  So you were part of People In Governance.    Yes.  And it was the People In Governance that effected the suspensions.    Of which you were part.    Yes.  Now the Chairperson has asked repeatedly the witnesses who have come here – we understand from Mr Tsotsi that the executives who were to be suspended were three.    The executives who were to be suspended were three.    But ultimately four executives were suspended.    And the question has been how did the fourth executive which is the Financial Director ’s name make its way into the list.  Are you able to answer that question?    Did then – are you saying to the Chairperson it is at that stage that the fourth name being the FD was included.    Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson.  Then Ms Klein you have – let me deal first with this aspect about the recording which you say is apparently incomplete.  Now this recording you have had it all the time.  We did not know you told us on your last appearance that you have it.  There are minutes that have since been produced from that meeting of 11 March 2015.  Some of those minutes of the various meetings were signed by Doctor Ngubane we said more than a year later.  18 November 2016.    And you were still serving on the board at the time.    Those minutes would have been discussed before they are signed by the board.    Did you at any stage point out to the chairperson at the time that – but we are missing something from these minutes which should have been captured?     Thank you, Chairperson.       Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, we then have these recordings.  We have checked them with yourself.  And we have, as you have, relied on them.  Correct?     Yes.  To the extent that you say, things are not there but yet not raised.  You have not done anything about it and that is where it is.  That is what it is.     So to the extent that you say the audio recording is missing something ...[intervenes]      ...which you did not raise.  There is nothing the Commission can do about it.     So we move on from the meeting of the 11t h ...[intervenes]      Thank you.  Ms Klein... Ja, perhaps I do not need to belabour the point because Mr Tsotsi has said explicitly that what was presented to him in Durban with the president was that three executives should be suspended or step aside and that is what he presented to the board.   And I think what you are trying to answer, which is not clear to me, is.  What is your answer to when was the FD, the financial director’s name added to the list?     Ja.     Yes.  No, I wanted to assist ...[intervenes]      ...the Chairperson.  In his affidavit, Mr Nick Linnell, refers to Jabu Maswanganyi who gives in documents but he says, these were mainly for unverified sources and so on.   But then specifically in regard to the executives, and I     He did refer to document that contains some allegations.     Correct, Chair.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     And Chair, the other point is this.  Ms Klein... Mr Baloyi in his affidavit, in fact, says that you were the one who suggested that the FD be included on the list.      Thank you, Chair.  May I go to the transcript, Ms Klein?     Because I know that you have the recordings.  Two things arise from what you are saying.  Number one is that.  Mr Norman Baloyi was not a member of P&G.     Mr Norman Baloyi says and the other witnesses have also said, he was present at the meeting of 11 March 2015, P&G meeting.       He was a present.  He is not a member.     May ...[intervenes]       No, it is fine.  Do you say you agree with the Chairperson?     Yes.     [No audible reply]      The minute of the People in Governance     I can give you the page reference.     Yes, no …[intervenes]     Yes.     Correct, Chairperson.  And that version, Chair, has to be contrasted with what Mr Baloyi says and with what we see from the transcript because Mr Baloyi you headed or suggested the FD also be suspended.     Yes and he says because you were saying he is not a member of the P & G but I do not think he was saying he was not present at the P & G, the meeting.     Ja.  It will help, Ms Klein, if we stick to the documentation because that question was asked by Dr Ngubane and Mr Tsotsi said it is three should be suspended.  The reference bundle, Chairperson, deals with that and Ms Klein, I am expecting you to know this because you were in that meeting.     Yes.     I am emphasising the point Ms Klein is saying – a question is asked how many are going to be     This, Chair …[intervenes]     The timestamp on this – the transcript does not indicate …[intervenes]     The timestamp – this is the transcript.     But it is the board in-committee meeting.     Immediately after the meeting of the Minister.     It is prior to the P & G meeting, Chair.  Let me before the Chair …[intervenes]     Yes.     This is the one.     Yes, his is exactly where I am.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Correct.     Yes, Chair.     And, Ms Klein, on that point because I was going to go to the point of the P & G but let me address that point because even in the board in-committee you are heard supporting, not even supporting, motivating for the suspension of the FD.  You motivate for the suspension of the FD along the lines which Mr Baloyi is saying that you were involved in the finances with the subcommittees, you know there are problems with finances, the FD should also be part of it.     Okay. MS     Sure.     That is fine.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Ms Klein, I give you reference.  Chairperson, on this specific issue because Ms Klein refers to one incident where Ms Naidoo is talking and there is one aspect where you are also talking.     I have looked at both of them, the transcript.     No, not yet, I did not show it to …[intervenes]     Yes.     It is in the reference bundle.     Ja.     So, Ms Klein, Ms Mabude talks about what the Minister said, just to give you context. “Thanks, Chair, I think the Minister has indicated a whole of issues that needs to be looked at and in her speech, if you noted what she was saying, it was – it is the basis for the terms of reference, so if we can use that speech as a way of putting the terms of reference from that speech.” Then she carries on.     No, no, Ms Mabude.     I am just giving you the pretext.     To get to the context.     The reference bundle.     Yes, thank Chair, I beg your pardon, Ms Klein.  That is on page 356.  Page 356.  Against line 20 on that page, I was reading from there, Ms Klein.     “...and from that speech it was  indicated to me.  Indicated the critical sections that needs to be looked at and in looking at this critical sections, just keep the leader in its section from what she was saying...” And so forth.  Then you turn the page to 358, the     No, the …[intervenes]     The black numbers, Chairperson, thank you for reminding me.     Page 358.     358, Chair.  I am now automatically used to the black when I see them, Chair.     No, the black one in this one.  In this reference at the top, top left.  Yes.     Yes, then the Chairperson after Ms     And then Ms Naidoo speaks, at the bottom of – after the Chairperson has spoken. “Mr Chair…” She also spoke about the fact - that the load shedding.     I will then specifically refer you to …[intervenes]     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.  No, correct, Chair, specifically here it is the motivation for what the Chairperson has said.     Ms Mabude, what I understand you to be saying, is that the Minister has identified four areas for suspension and Ms Klein in this regarding is saying yes, let us do it.     Yes.      I have not checked the one, Ms Klein, you want now.     But we can do that later.     Thank you.     Yes, Chair.  Can I move on, Chair?     Ms Klein, the …[intervenes]     Because it seems from what Ms Mabude is saying, which Mr Tsotsi then reiterates, that the Minister was the one who indicated four areas.     Chair, your summation seems to bear concurrence with the documentation because Dr Ngubane     Correct, Chair.     So then you find that latter part you referred to, Chair, in Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit.     Where he says about the FD.     That the FD was not to be included but then Dr Ngubane phoned the Minister and when he came back he said yes, the FD – the Minister says the FD must be included.     And that is at a P & G meeting.     Because when you look at the P & G meeting Mr Tsotsi introduces Mr Linnell and he says to     Is this – oh, okay.     Can we do that exercise?     Yes.     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     Indeed.     Indeed, Chair.     Yes, we made that arrangement with one of the witnesses to identify who is speaking at any given point.  Chair before – you will see the lunchtime being referred to but your recollection is correct because     Ja.     Ms Klein, let us move on quickly because we spent too much time there.  The suspension of the FD and especially the three other executives was then done – well, we can include Mr Koko, but the other two executives write to the board and they engage with the board.  They are seeking answers from the board about the actual reasons why they are suspended because they see in the public media different reasons are advanced as to opposed to what they were given.   We have gone through that and we came to the meeting where there was meeting, you attended, where they talked about letters from the executives.  You can recall that?     Okay.     Okay, thank you, Chair.     Yes.  They will find the minutes of that meeting.     I remember referring you to it.     Yes.  But, Ms Tsholofelo Molefe has indicated that you were actively involved in the discussions, settlement discussions or exit negotiations with her.     Ja. Because in your affidavit you appeared not to be knowing how her situation was handled.     Ja, no problem on that.  Let me tell you because Ms Tsholofelo has testified that when she was met by you and the delegation on the 4 May…     You did – the delegation said to her she has been writing letters to the board asking to exit and she says she categorically denied that.  She said my letters were not about me wishing to exit, it was about me seeking information from the board.  Do you recall that?     No.     The delegation…     …said to her you have been writing letters to the board seeking to exit.     She said – she denied that, her letters were not about her wishing to exit, it was about her seeking information from the board about the terms of reference and the actual reasons for her suspension and there was an issue about insurance of directors.     Yes.     Thank you Chair.  So nothing much I need to pursue there but safe to ask you Dr Ngubane has said here that the Boards actually wanted them back, the executives back.  What is your comment on that?     No it was on the 18 t h.     It was addressed to Mr Tsotsi.     No sorry Ms Klein, can I clarify that?     No, it wasn’t said that the letter came to you as P&G, the minutes of the meeting I am referring to, which I will find, the Board said there, and it is minuted, it acknowledged, it accepted that there are these letters from the Executives and to Ms Phukubje, the Company Secretary to reply to those letters.     And that is the minute which I referred to, but not that you received the letter, no.      That is alright.  Yes, thank you.  But my question was Dr Ngubane said the Board wanted them back, is that what you understood as well?     Now isn’t it that you would have known at the meeting with Ms Molefe ...[intervenes]      Isn’t it that you would have known at the meeting with Ms Molefe already that it was not the position that she did not want to come back.  On the 4 t h of May when Romeo Kumalo says to her you have been writing letters which we understand wishing to exit from Eskom, she says no, and you were in that meeting.  So you would have known then that it is not her intention to leave.     I was going to ask that.     4 May.     Mr Baloyi yesterday testified about his view that the laptops should not be taken away from them.     Yes Chair.     Thank you Chair, and just to strengthen the point further Ms Klein, you see that part about Mr Kumalo saying the investigation will take a while, kind of motivating, separating with the company because we are going to take a while with the investigation.   Now this is in May and you will recall that Dentons was appointed in April and the say in their affidavit which we have provided you with that they commenced their work on the 20 t h of April 2015.   They detail what they did in the first week which is essentially meetings and clients who understand the terms of reference and the mandate and that’s April, May, and then on the 11 t h of June they say they are told please provide us with a draft report, so in their estimation they say we will – they are appointed for three months and about seven weeks into the job we were told give us a report.   Now that is on the 11 t h of June 2015.     But what I am testing with you is this proposition given to Ms Molefe that we are going to take a while with the investigation, but in fact because that contract is only signed on the 25 t h of June 2015, a settlement agreement, I beg your pardon.     With Ms Molefe yes.     A settlement agreement is signed on the 25 t h, so what I am saying to you is the statement made to her when you look at it on the facts it could not have been that the investigation was going to take long and therefore you are advised to settle and separate with the company.   Do you appreciate that?     Ja, Ms Klein the presentation was made on the 27 t h of May 2015.     Yes, that’s the first presentation.     And – but after that Dentons specifically says, and we have seen its report, they say in this affidavit they were told to give a draft report on the 11 t h of June they are told that, and that’s when they stopped the investigation work.    You have read Mr Kapdi’s affidavit.     But Ms Kapdi is not saying anything that is not in the reports, the report itself documents that, that we were told by Eskom on the 11 t h of June 2015 that we should provide them with a draft report, that is in the report itself which as the Board member he would have had it at the time, so but as you say you cannot quarrel with that, we can find the report for you but what the significance of that is this Ms Klein, at that time, at that time, 11 June 2015 you, the delegation and in particular yourself at that time because it seems on Ms Tsholofela’s version the other members did not participate any further, Dr Ngubane, Mr Kumalo, but it was you and Mr Khosa who were corresponding with her regarding the settlement discussions.   You agree, I see you’re nodding.     Yes, the proposal was sent to her and so on, so the point ...[intervenes]      Yes the point I am making then just to emphasize is just that if as Dr Ngubane says the Board wanted them back, if as you say the intention has always been they will come back, you wanted them back, then you know since there is a window period then between the 11 t h of June to the 25 t h of June that you say to her look let’s drop the settlement discussions you are welcome back.     Yes.     No, but I haven’t referred to a meeting Ms Klein, I said Dentons says in their report and in this affidavit they received instruction from Eskom that they should provide a draft report, and the ultimate report is dated 2 July 2015, and now you are referring to meetings after the date of that report.     That doesn’t bear on the point I am raising with you.     No, I am saying the Board, Dentons says the Board has asked me to stop, not to stop but to provide them with a draft report, and they say from that moment forward we concentrated on drafting the report and not the investigation and – this is Dentons saying it is a mid-point report, you have made me not to complete my investigation, that’s the Board that has instructed ...[intervenes]      And a report.     And the report of Dentons Chair.     It is based on this fact Chair, between 11 June 2015 and 25 June 2015, which is the settlement period there’s a window period.  If the Board says to Dentons stop, give us a report you have said you are suspending these people until the end of the inquiry, so here you have a shortcut, you have cut it short.  It is the time then you say to her okay well the inquiry has been stopped, we are now awaiting a report, let’s stop these settlement discussions ...[intervenes]      No, no reference to a meeting Chair.     No Chair.     Okay thank you Chair but that is the position.  Dentons said on the 11 t h June 2015 the firm was requested to prepare a detailed presentation to the Board in addition to a draft report detailing the state of investigation to date.   You will find it in Mr Kapdi’s affidavit and in the report itself.       4 May.    Thank you Chair.  By the way Ms Klein I see from Mr Kapdi’s affidavit that in fact the presentation on the 27 May 2015 was done to the board.  He says a presentation was made to the board on 27 May 2015 setting out some of the issues identified by investigation team at the point.  Obviously we received this affidavit yesterday and we were able to provide you with it only yesterday.  So that is what he says there.    A presentation was made to the board on 27 May 2015 setting out some of the issues identified by investigation team at a time.  A presentation to the board.    We can – we can verify that.    Because he says to the board we can verify that.    Indeed.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  And on the extension quickly    Ja.      And then he does say   Thank you.  So the – I think you get the point we were saying that that window period more so than when the investigation is cut short and shall I add that the investigation was not seeking to determine any wrongdoing on their part.  You recall that?    Ja.  And quickly on that because then you will – you have seen what Mr Kapdi says about your averment that you approached him.  Let me see.  In regard to the return of Mr Koko.  Sorry Chair I am – I hope you will not lose me because I am cutting to the chase.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you very much Chair.    Thank you very much Chair.  Ms Klein as I was going there the Chair is talking reminds me something.  And I want to draw the parallels between at least Ms Molefe and what you are going to tell us here regarding Mr Koko.  On your version you say Mr Koko – it was only Mr Koko who wanted to come back and you went to find out from Dentons with regards to Mr Koko.   He was the one executive who was not interested in leaving the employ of Eskom.  He indicated that he wanted to come back.  In this regard I contacted Mr Noor Kapdi of Dentons who indicated that they had not found any evidence of wrongdoing by any of the suspended executives.   Now you not saying when did you do this but we see that you had all the meetings with the suspended executives on the 4 May according to Ms Daniels because she was present.  So she says you have these meetings one after the other even a meeting with Mr Molefe on that day at the Protea Hotel.   To me it seems and you will correct me Ms Molefe is in exactly the same position as Mr Koko.  She wants to come back; she lets you know that March.  You know that there is no wrongdoing investigation to be done against her.   How is it that that situation is different when it comes to her as opposed to when it comes to Mr Koko?  It justifies his return but it is not used for her return.    May I – sorry – sorry Chair.  May I interrupt you Ms Klein?  And I beg your pardon.  Forget prior – the lead up to the meeting with Ms Tsholo gets cancelled by her at that meeting.  So whatever you heard prior to your meeting with her she is telling you that is not true.  Now take us from that moment onwards where you know as a matter of fact Tsholo says I do not want to leave.   The reasons for my letters is not what you the delegation – I mean the delegation is not just Mr Khumalo.  It is all of you there.  Forget about prior to that.  Now you have this situation; you have a fact the executive here he is interested to get his job back.  There are not wrongdoings, findings against him.  This is exactly Ms Tsholofelo Molefe explain to the Chairperson how is it that she gets treated differently to Mr Koko?    Sorry Chair.    Ms Klein you saying to the Chairperson Mr Tsotsi would not even want to look at the figures.    Oh Mr Koko. I beg your pardon.      No that is alright.  Okay you want to carry on speaking.    Ms Klein Mr Koko has submitted an affidavit to this commission he has told in his affidavit how – what happened in the meeting and in addition to that he has attached what he says was a document signed by yourself titled Proposed Terms for Settlement and it shows the amount.  The document is dated 11 May 2015.  And I can show you the document.  So he did it seems look at the document, was in fact provided with it, did go away with it and he has attached it to his affidavit.      Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels tells this commission in her affidavit and Ms Molefe herself says  “At the beginning of the meeting the board delegation tried to – tried a different strategy.  Mr Kumalo led the discussion and said that they understood that I had written numerous letters to the chairman Doctor Ngubane asking to part ways.  I denied this outright emphasising that the purpose of my letters which had not been responded to was to establish when the so called inquiry would commence and to get access to the Terms of Reference so that I could start preparing for the interviews with the investigation.” I will give you a chance to respond.    That is Ms Molefe Chair.    Ms Daniels who is present there says   That is Mr Khumalo.    To Ms Molefe.    This is Ms Daniels writing in her affidavit.    Ms Klein.    I am not – I am not referring to the signing of the agreement.  Ms Molefe has presented evidence that shows that you were involved throughout up until when she signed somebody else would have signed not you personally but the build up to that conclusion that you were part of it.     Yes, Chair.     Very quickly.     Ms Klein, it is not being put to you that she was paid R 18 million.     Yes.     Ja, it is 18-months the Chairperson was referring to.     No, no, no.  Have we talked about R 18 million last time?     Yes.  But it cannot... sorry, let me say this ...[intervenes]      So we would not know because we do not have her ...[intervenes]      An annual.  Ja, the breakdown.     Ms Klein, you would have requested the figures from Anton Nienaar.     That is what he says in his affidavit.     You requested the settlement figures from Anton Nienaar.     You have sent an email to Ms Molefe on the 11t h of June 2015.     You say    That is 11 June 2015, Chair.     So the first meeting is the 4t h of May.     Then they have a meeting on the 8t h of May.  And you sent her a proposal Mr Klein.  Is it on the 8t h or the 11t h of May, where... are your second meeting?     Correct, yes.     Yes.     I have it.  I have it.       It is the 8t h of May.     It is exactly like... the tabulation is exactly like Matshela Koko’s one with your signature at the end of it.     And a provision for the executive to sign.     It has an amount.  An amount is reflected in there.     The 11t h... 8t h of May.  But that gets overtaken by events.     Because we can see your email on the 11t h of June 2015.     More than a month later.     The 8t h, the 11t h of June.  And you are     And she writes back to you.  So you would have known about the inputs or questions that she had.  You would have been involved in the negotiations of the terms and the figures.       Okay.     Okay.     Yes, Chair.     Ja, she did not attach a response to this Chair.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.  No, I will let you know.     I can let you know what I see from the documentation.     ...I do not know.     ...which he has given to us along with this email ...[intervenes]      ...has an amount.     And that amount ...[intervenes]      ...that amount...     That amount, it is said to... the total separation payment... should I mention the amount Chair?     The amount is there.     Yes.  It is a little over R 4 million.  R 4 032 945,00.     Your proposal, however, on the 11t h...     On the 8 t h of May, had other items to this.     And the total amount was a little over R 5 million.     I can read it to you.     No, no.  It is not ...[intervenes]      Yes.     That is right, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     The actual amount paid.     Ja, that is... if anything turns on that, Ms Klein.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     Thank you, Chairperson.  Ms Klein, thank you.  You are still under oath.     Chairperson, we managed to... Is it resolved or clarified?  Rather, more clarified.  The issue about the payment.  In fact, the settlement agreement gives you a breakdown of the amounts.   So you have the main amount, which is what has been mentioned, the six point something.  Then you have the other small amounts, which I think when Ms Molefe testified, said the main amount excluded certain items relative to her. So those items are broken down with the specific amounts.  So she was paid more than the figure we have been referring to.     Yes.     So that is...     Thank you, Chairperson.  Ms Klein, so there is this correspondence leading up to the settlement and we accept you were not part.  You were not the person who signed this settlement agreement.  Mr Dan Marokane also has shared emails with the Commission where you were sending the settlement agreement to him.       Just speak to the microphone.     Yes.  So we know that the agreement with him was signed by doctor... Mr Zethembe Khoza, I think.     Or Dr Ngubane.     Yes.  At this stage, you were the Chairperson of P&G?     People in Governance.     Would this settlement agreement not have come back to the People in Governance before they go to the board?     Yes.  I want to read from the affidavit, your affidavit.  It talks about, you know, the mandate given to the... you talk about yourself, Dr Ngubane, Mr Romeo Khumalo who were mandated to negotiate the settlement and the terms on which you were to negotiate.  Do I have your affidavit here?     And there is a further item in that mandate that the chairperson of the P&G... Why do I not have it?  Oh, yes here it is.   “That the chairperson of the P&G Committee be authorised with the power to delegate further.  To take all the necessary and all immediate steps to give effect to the above including the signing of any agreements or either documentation necessary or related thereto.” Now that is page, here in your bundle, that is page 15 but it starts on the page 14, paragraph 51.  The red numbering, this time around Chairperson.     No, 14.     No, it is paragraph 51.     Paragraph 51, page 14.     Eskom Bundle 02, Chairperson.     Not the page, paragraph 51.  Page 14.     Page one, four.     P14.      Paragraph 51 by me.     So you... that is where you deal with what the board had authorised.   “The authorisation provided for the acting chairman, Dr Ngubane myself and Mr Khumalo to enter into exit negotiations with each of the executives, Mr Matona, Molefe, Koko and Marokane.”   And then you detailed what was the mandate to you.  Then the next page, settlement agreement shall set out the terms.     How did you deal with this now that we see it was your fellow colleagues who signed these agreements?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So the settlement agreement may have been signed by persons who were unauthorised.  Thus the authority was explicitly in terms of your affidavit vested in you.       H’m.     And may I add to that, Ms Klein?  Chair, it is not only exceeding the amount in terms of this, the mandate but it is also going beyond the authority given into the person.  Because the authority was given to you as the chairperson of P&G but we see that it is somebody else...[intervenes]      ...that signed this document.     Yes.  No.  We will do so Ms Klein.     Because from your proposals, those proposals you presented to them.     You were still designated us the acting chairperson of P&G?     Yes.     By that time, the settlement... the last one was Ms Molefe’s.     The other ones had already been signed  Done and dusted.       H’m.       H’m.     Chair, we will do so.     I see from Ms Klein’s affidavit that she     But you are saying 14 July.     Yes.     Ja, that is what ...[intervenes]      It says that but it just gives a different month.  But you say, in or about?     August.     But it is fine.     That is right.      Yes.     Yes.     Is the same.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.  Because we see on the 11t h of June, you are still writing to Ms Molefe.     In that capacity.      And in her affidavit, she gets replaced, not by Mr Zethembe Khoza or Dr Ngubane by Ms Chwayita Mabude.       Who also still, did not sign the settlement agreement.     Yes.     I accept, Chair.     I accept.     Of June.  Yes.     I accept, Chair.  Ms Klein, then the version in regard to Mr Koko because we have dealt with Ms Tsholofelo Molefe.   And I have drawn the parallels between the two with Mr Koko.  Ms Daniels who was again present, talks about how the exchange or negotiations with Mr Koko was different.      Oh, okay.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair that part ...[intervenes]      ...which Ms Klein admits she said, is what Ms Suzanne Daniels says as the very first part.  She     Chair, may I put what is in my mind?     Ja, I think what is my mouth(?).  What is in my mind is this, Chair.       If the question is    It is an invitation on my part that I want you to work with me.     Okay.     Yes.     No.  Ms Daniels, right    Then she used her own words.     That he waxed lyrically and so on.     But the question is asked    If I was in his position, Chair, I will also keep quiet.  [Laughter]     Come to one position.      And she goes on to say    Ms Daniels.     Thank you, Chair, I appreciate.     Correct, Chairperson.     I will …[intervenes]     We want to provide a copy for Ms Klein.     Yes.     They are still looking, Chair.  Sorry, they are still looking for it.  Yes, we may be able to…     Yes, Chair, she will – she has a different bundle but the same affidavit so the paragraph numbers – you see “Unlike…” there at the top of the page?     Do you see it?     Yes, yes.     Sorry, Chair.  He says he rejected outright the proposal that was given to him.  Now I need to find what he – essentially, it is a rejection of what was being presented to him and he would not accept it.     No, he does not go into the details.     Yes.     In terms of the first part with what Ms Daniels also says there.     It is consistent with that, I do not want a proposal, I am rejecting it out of hand.     But then he does not go into …[intervenes]     Even that his blood is blue, I want to come back.     He does not say those things.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein but we know from the evidence of both Dr Ngubane and Mr Matona that when they met at the CCMA Mr Matona was told let us adjourn the proceedings, see whether we cannot reach an amicable separation and he was told that they need to get the mandate from the shareholder so the proceedings were adjourned so that they could engage with the shareholder and that seems to be in line with what Ms Daniels is saying there, that your mandate, as the board, ultimately came from the shareholder.     No.     Correct, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels (sic) do I understand you to be saying that paragraph 71 where you     Oh, you did.     Oh, sorry.  Ja, I understood it differently.  Okay.  But that one was not asked of Ms Tsholofelo, could you come back and work with this board?     Yes.  Can I go back to that paragraph 73.  Oh, you know, if I conclude – sorry, Ms Klein, if I conclude in regard to your explanation to the Chairperson why you asked that question, the reasons would similarly have applied to Ms Molefe who had indicated she wants to come back and I appreciate you were not in Mr Dan Marokane’s negotiations, he also had expressed interest o come back.  This meeting which Ms Suzanne refers to in paragraph 73, did it take place?      But we also do not have minutes of your settlement discussions with these executives and you have agreed that Ms Daniels correctly reflects what you have even said in these meetings.     Yes.     No, just the meeting itself, no what you said.     Because she does say in paragraph 74 that she was then asked to prepare a brief to the Minister from the Chairman on the status of the suspended executives and then she attaches a copy and she links that to the meeting the delegation had on the 19 t h.     Thank you, Chair.  Then, Ms Klein, we can put aside that file.  I wish to go back to the reference file, Chair.     And in paragraph 57 page 16 you talk about – paragraph 57 you talk about your meeting with Mr Koko, he was the one executive who was not interested in leaving the employment of Eskom and you then say you enquire from Dentons whether they have made any evidence – whether they have found any evidence of wrongdoing by any of the suspended executives.     Now before I go to my point let me deal with this quickly because you have seen Mr Kapdi’s affidavit again.     He says he has no recollection of you asking him this.     Yes, you can comment.     Yes, please.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, do you recall – Ms Klein, I beg your pardon.  Ja, the – obviously the Chairperson does not have and the Commission does not have that information in your affidavit.     No, I changed it, Chair.     It has been a long…     Yes.  What was my question now?     Oh, I was saying, Ms Klein, that the Commission does not have the benefit of that information in your affidavit, we also get the version of Ms Daniels and Dr Ngubane because you say it was Dr Ngubane who said that.   So would you – would you provide us with an affidavit?     We will liaise with you after this.     Ja, because let me read what Dentons     She was the Chairperson of audit and risk being contacted by Ms – is it Cassiem or Carrim?   “To enquire whether the firm had made any findings of wrongdoing against the suspended executives.  I was not involved in the drafting of the firms report and referred this query to Mr Sulaiman[?].  Mr Sulaiman[?] has informed me as follows.” Now that first part does not impress on me as a person who is confusing you as somebody else.  He seems to be clear about who he is talking about.  The distinction between you and Ms Carrim.          Well Chair it carries on    Ms Klein there is in fact letters addressed to Ms Carrim on this issue.  So he is clear he does not recall you calling but he does recall being called by Ms Carrim but your version is your version we can leave it at that.      Yes.      Yes, please, yes certainly.      Yes, they were emailed after the affidavit had been sent.      Chairperson may I beg leave to hand it up?     They are – this are annexures specifically referred to in those two paragraphs Annexure N12 and N13 which is referred to in the next paragraph.  The affidavit Chairperson has been inserted at the end of the reference bundle, right at the end of the reference bundle.          It only came in yesterday.      Chair should I place it on record Chair?  He was given a deadline of last week Friday, 2 October 2020.     He did not meet the deadline and I reminded him by email he subsequently responded and in his email it is a message to the effect that his attorney…[intervene]     Has it gone down oh sorry Chair.     His attorney is on holiday, school holidays and upon his return they will engage and attend to the drafting of the affidavit.      I have indicated that myself.     And so I have not received a subsequent response but I will follow up with him.      Thank you Chair.       Yes, thank you.     So Chair let me just place on record because the letters that are annexed to Mr Kapdi’s affidavit are respectively dated 13 July 2015 and 14 July 2015.  It is a letter from Dentons under the author is Mr Shahied Sulaiman[?], the attention Ms Mariam Carrim, Eskom     Just to place that on record.      Then Ms Daniels you say after you made the Ms – oh my word sorry Ms Klein.      Yes, Ms Klein then related to that paragraph of your allegation that you approached to Mr     Mr Sulaiman[?]’s letter says    No I am putting it to you.      No listen let me it says you saying in your affidavit which nobody had said...[intervene]      My discomfort not the boards discomfort but anyway.  So Ms Klein what was your discomfort?     Yes, in order to address my discomfort so you say you have received a response from Mr Noor Kapdi he says he does not recall you contacting him but     His going to make you pay.      Yes    You further say Dentons also provided a letter confirming the above.       Sure.     And that was a mandate given to you by the board?     So that mandate for you to do this exercise of finding out was given to you by people in governance?      So your affidavit say    We will find out from the board.      That is fine Chair what I wanted to – Ms Klein the letters that Dentons has provided they have not provided it any other in regard to the request.  You cannot dispute that this was the response given by Dentons to Ms Mariam Carrim?      Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.      Thank you Chair.  So Ms Klein I was going to refer you to the correspondence between you and Mr Gerry Kapou[?] which you have had sight of that is in the reference bundle.  There is a letter there on page 21 which is addressed to yourself by Mr Kapou[?] you have seen or read it and I am interested in the mandate given to Mr Kapou[?] the instructions.  So you had first gone to Dentons.        The you go to Mr Kapou[?] and his writing on 2 July 2015 or the letter is dated 2 July 2015.  Suspension of Mr Matshela Moses Koko and paragraph 1     And so he gave his advice about the impact of your decision to return Mr Koko with the agreements.      You said there will be no impact.      And you wrote back to him on 2 July     So by this time the board has resolved to bring him back.      Ja, now the curious note here to me.     Thank you Chair.  Ms Klein, just to complete on this, Mr Koko you had said earlier that if there was one person you wouldn’t want to take back it would have been him because of the issues that were raised against him.  At this time, when you were asking for this legal opinions when the Dentons making it clear that we – you haven’t given us a mandate to investigate any wrongdoing, why didn’t you commission an investigation into his – these allegations about Suzanne Daniels, issues you alluded to earlier about Mr Koko himself?     Ms Daniels’ version in regard to the Dentons report, and you know the draft which you refer to in your affidavit as a draft which was destroyed, he says, in fact – and we’ve seen the minutes of the meeting where the Board resolves that copies be collected and that you be the one to destroy them and that, that decision was made in because there were allegations in the report regarding how Mr Koko had concluded certain transactions which was not above board.     Let’s talk the first.     Yes.     Not you collecting, there’s a minute in the Board meeting saying, the company secretary should  collect copies give them to you and that you will destroy the copies.     Two things, Ms Klein, one is that in your affidavit you say, the report, the first one included, allegations against individuals and companies.  I hear you now tell the Chairperson, it was only the names of the companies that were mentioned.     But then, Ms Daniels is consistent with your affidavit, says the names were mentioned, of individuals and it was shredded for that reason, not only companies but individuals.     Ja, and I don’t want to be difficult with you but how would it get into your affidavit?  It’s page 22 paragraph 84.     Yes, can I pursue a little more, Chair.     Ms Klein, the question was, then how did it get into your affidavit which is a sworn statement?     You have seen, again, the affidavit of Dentons, and this is the second point, Dentons says, you’re saying you gave the request, you requested them to remove the names of the companies and the – well you say the companies.  Dentons says there was no request from Eskom to effect any specific changes to that draft preliminary report. The amendments to the draft preliminary report were made for the reasons set out in the abovementioned email to Ms Carrim.  The sequence of events in relation to the preparation of the final report is set out above.   “We have furthermore provided to the commission a compared copy of the firms report so that the changes can be readily identified. So, I may not show you – I may not do the exercise now but perhaps for the benefit of the Chairperson, but let me deal with the first part, which is, there was no request from Eskom to make any specific changes to the draft preliminary report.      Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Klein the – the paragraph we read just before the adjournment is 8.6 in that affidavit.  Chairperson the – the disadvantage is that the affidavit was received yesterday. What I think I would like to arrange with Ms Klein is to look at some of these annexures    Yes the – it was – we were putting to Ms Klein the version which we see in her affidavits visa vie what we see in Ms Daniels’ affidavit that the report was destroyed because it had certain allegations made against Mr Matshelo Koko.    Yes.    So I think she needs to have the opportunity to look at it Ms Klein.  We also need to have an opportunity to look at that because…    We only received them yesterday.    Yes Chair.      Yes that is what I am saying.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Chair that – Ms Klein you may want to answer this question and I want to make my concluding remarks.  Because what we see is the – of the four executives only one comes back in circumstances that would have allowed all four executives to come back.   And when he comes back Mr Koko he is alleged to have then engaged in certain transactions that facilitated the awarding of contracts to Tegeta to McKinsey, Trillian and that that was the purpose for him coming back.  What is your comment to that?    Yes.    No that is fine.  On the one hand on the other hand is that this is the very person who was in fact behind the suspensions.  Ms Daniels says she met with him at Melrose Arch in fact having been called by him.  Ms Nonkuleleko Dlamini testified yesterday as well that Mr Koko had called her said provide me with your CV.  This is before the day of the suspension and they meet …    Okay.    The names were mentioned Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes.  Well I think the Chair has done it and Ms Klein confronted with these facts and the commission having been established because of some of these facts.  You look at that and as I said the circumstances that lead to him coming back are no different from Tsholofelo Molefe’s circumstances.  Dan Marokane circumstances.  Mr Matona who actually is taking it to court says I want a relief to reinstate me.  But none of that shakes the board to do what it does in regard to Mr Koko.  Do you have any comment to the Chairperson on that?    Thank you Chair.  And ja and one really needs to understand the fiduciary duties of the board.  What role does the board play in this regard?  Because we see yourself in your affidavit saying to the Chairperson I was mandated to get these opinions.   But you say it was your personal discomfort so it is a little bit confusing there. But that is what you do nonetheless.  But you do so only in respect of Mr Koko.  And the question is, exactly what was going on in your mind when you go out of your way in your discomfort to have this man accommodated and ensure that there are no legal repercussions to Eskom visa vie the other members?    Chairperson Mr Koko in fact admits    “I deny that I called her to Midrand – to Melrose Arch.”    You could say that from here.     “I called her on the day and we met for dinner in the evening at Midrand.”     “I deny that I called her to come to Melrose Arch.”    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    May I add to that Ms Klein because in regard to the acting appointments.    The board itself you will recall the minute it makes that the acting appointment seemed to have been – seemed to have had a meeting beforehand with the acting CE which at the time is Mr Zethembe Khoza I believe before the suspensions were made.  Before they could be appointed to act.  You recall that night?    Ja recall the minute – what is recorded in that minute.  I think it is the 19 March.    I will help you.    I will help you.      I am asking in fact for both and the question – obviously you could answer on a step by step basis.  The first thing is you recall there had been minuted by the board in a board meeting and secondly that you recall that that is said to have happened.    Okay let us see whether you can answer the second question.    Do you know that that had happened?    Which is that…    That the people who were subsequently appointed to act had had a meeting beforehand with the acting CE.    With the acting CEO Chairperson I…    That was Mr Zethembe Khoza.    The…    Oh correct Chairperson that – that is the allegation made.    No Ms Klein you were there again the 19 March 2015.  That is where the board decides to take disciplinary action Mr Tsotsi.    Yes.    There in that meeting it is noted the people who were acting in place of the suspended executives were allegedly called into a meeting and knew beforehand that they would be acting.    Ja, no I can carry on Chairperson.    That is the first line. “The board needed to find out how this happened.  They were apparently called into a meeting and the acting CE met with them.” So we put this to you Ms Klein.    Yes Chair.  Chair I would have allowed Ms Klein to explain to you who is the acting CE.    Because Ms Klein explain to the Chair as at 11 March 2015 before the suspensions who is the CEO?    Yes.     He became acting CE?     So Chair, when they are saying there was a meeting, now they are now on the 19t h of March.  They are talking, looking backward and said people who were earmarked to that, meet beforehand.   And when they were meeting, they were meeting with the person who is now the acting CE.  At that time, he was also earmarked to act in the position of Mr Matona.   So this meeting is taking place and the board wants to know but how does this happen that these people meet beforehand and they are told, which is not explicitly spelt out here.  Ms Klein, if you could assist the Chairperson.     And the chairperson, there might have been that meeting, which is the chairperson referring to, at Melrose Arch.  The Chairperson will recall Mr Baloyi yesterday, referred to Mr Zethembe Khoza saying he meet with officials of the DPE.   And now, somebody has to explain to the Commission what were the facts before the board at this stage, when this minute was recorded.   It may be a shorthand minute but you had more information that could be minute here.       Ja.  Yes, from the impression from the minute Ms Klein, because this seems to be a concern of the board.  It seems to be that Chairperson that ...[intervenes]      That the board itself is surprised.     H’m.  Ja, this is by the way, the same meeting where the board referred to the letters of the suspended executives including the CE and that the company secretary should prepare responses to those letters.  It was the same meeting.     But this is what we were saying to you.  It is... the documentary evidence, the evidence of the     Are you saying, this was wrong?     This what I have narrated to you, are you saying that was wrong?     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, that reason for cancellation of Dentons’ investigation.  Ms Klein, it is a very significant one.   And the Chairperson is addressing this issue by reference to Mr Marokane.  It is, in fact, him who writes on the 18t h of March 2015 and specifically what the Chairperson     Yes.  Ms Klein, the war room issue, yes, the Chairperson is correct, you are raising it for the first time that the war room also had contemplated an inquiry and it is very strange because when Mr Tsotsi met with the board on the 9 March, Mr Matona says I am confused, you are telling us that the President wants an inquiry into Eskom’s affairs but cabinet, which is headed by the same President has decided that there should be a war room and it is conducting essentially and investigation to help Eskom turn around its situation.  So he says how can the President, when he is in cabinet, speaks with one voice, when he out of it, he speaks with another voice?   So it difficult to say, I mean, that the war room itself would have wanted an inquiry when Mr Matona spoke along those lines.     Yes.  No, you do have the recording, you do have the transcript, so it is there in the transcript, in the record.     No, you do not have – you can do it now …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     That is the one thing but I want to come specifically to you, Ms Klein.  You said in your affidavit and you have said this to the Chairperson when you were here before that you supported the departure of Ms Matona because he did not have a plan.  He did not have a handle on the turnaround.  In your affidavit you say that but to the Chairperson, he did not have a plan.     But, Ms Klein, you were in the meeting of the 11 t h prior to the meeting with the Minister.  You were in that meeting.  Mr Matona presented his report and the     Thank you, Chair.  Well, that has raised a new concept which is that you do not have confidence in him but what you were saying to the Chairperson is that he did not have a turnaround strategy and I was showing you that minute which actually says the contrary.     No.     Yes.  Then to the Chairperson’s point – well, so he has not given a chance to do that.  The settlement agreement with Mr Matona and Dan Marokane are both in May 2015, respectively Matona 15 May 2015, Dan Marokane 28 May 2015.  And here is the narrative, Ms Klein.  Now the board knows these people are out of the way.  No suddenly the board realises the investigation has nothing – it is not about anything new, we know this thing, we are in June, we do not need this investigation.  The impression is the board now knows.  They have achieved their objective.   They go along with Mr Linnell, they dump him after seven days.  A month later they appoint Dentons.  The executives are on suspension about …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Chair, thank you.  Yes, the Chair has added the foreground to that because along with Mr Linnell this deep dive investigation, that he is removed.  He cannot even finish his terms of reference.  He talks about his meeting with Ms Mabude at Mr Tsotsi’s house and Ms Mabude, this time around, has a cooling – shows a cooling of enthusiasm, according to Mr Linnell.  But the executives are suspended.  The board then, a month later, appoints Dentons.  It stops that investigation, midpoint, Dentons says.  It pays Dentons over 17 million for working a little over six weeks but Ms Klein – and I have stopped there because I am putting a pause.   Because, you see, this was a company without money and here you sat on the board that approved the payment of a little over six weeks’ work, which you stop midpoint, of R17 million and then the executives are paid a total and we have not touched on whether they were paid for their pensions, which is not mentioned.  So these figures we are talking, might be even more.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, so that I do not forget it, Chair.  And we heard to these costs, Ms Klein, the legal costs that would have been incurred, Bowmans being sought to give a legal opinion about keeping somebody – whether or not to keep somebody on suspension or whether or not there is wrongdoing against him when the board knew – the board knew that Dentons was not investigating any wrongdoing against them. But, if I got to the main thing, is that the impression created is that the investigation was a sham because it was never in fact undertaken.  There was a purpose, ulterior, to Eskom that was being pursued.  Your comment on that?     Okay.     Thank you Chair.  Can I ask you a question on this Ms Klein because it is very ironic that the Board says ultimately that’s the Board making that decision, what we are getting from Dentons is nothing new, but you want to assert to the Chairperson that there were recommendations that the Board could use from that report, which gave you nothing new.     If the Board did not interrogate what was given to it Ms Klein as it sounds ...[intervenes]      Ja, as it sounds to be from your explanation to the Chairperson, it sounds, it gives the impression that the Board would have failed in its fiduciary duties.     Yes, then this narrative continues Ms Klein because then we see after the Board had acted together with Mr Tsotsi.     Before the month ends on the 19 t h of May, that’s 11 March you acted with him after the Minister came there, Dr Ngubane says after the Minister left it was now clear that is the shareholder who wants the inquiry ,the shareholder who wants the executive to step aside.  Nine days later you are sitting in a meeting of the Board where you are resolving that Mr Tsotsi must be charged, the first charge is that he procured the services of an external consultant Mr Nick Linnell to provide consultant services to the company without following the company’s prescribed procurement processes or information the Board – or informing the Board of his actions, but you agreed with him.  Mr Nick Linnell was invited to the P&G, to ARC by Dr Pat Naidoo to Build Programme Committee, how is it that the Board charges Mr Tsotsi with the very thing or conduct the Board itself took part in it?     Yes and what happens thereafter?     Yes Chair.   Chair the reference to what I am reading is in the reference bundle Ms Klein, the minute of 30 March 2015, it says on page 228, Ms Klein you will know these charges, page 228, let me just read them to you.   The second charge is that the Chairperson will see how Mr Tsotsi responds to these charges in that minute.  The second charge is the consultant commenced with his word to the knowledge of the director and without the Board of Directors being informed that work had commenced within the company.  The director was aware that no contract of engagement for the consultant had been concluded, thus exposing the company to non compliance with applicable statutes and procedures, but Dr Ngubane is heard saying Nick we are contracting with you, do you recall that?     Yes, the 30 t h.       Yes, charge 3 is that the director authorised the commissioning of a media statement in relation to an inquiry into the affairs of the company with the assistance of the consultant without the knowledge and/or consent of the Board.   The media statement consequently fell into the public domain. Now you know Mr Tsotsi’s response to that/.     Yes, you say that much in your affidavit.     And that he didn’t know how it got leaked.  Mr Baloyi in fact testified yesterday ...[intervenes]      Exactly to that effect, that apparently the leaks were on the part of the DPE ...[intervenes]      This charge?     Yes.    Ja, he did use the firm ENS.      But Ms Klein here is the point, the Chairperson raised, not raise in itself but added to what Mr Baloyi was saying yesterday, and it is here in this minute.  The minute says Mr Tsotsi stated that, the Chairperson is     Before that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, they are.     Ja.     I think we are about to finish, Chair.     Let me just pace myself.     Yes.     She already owns us a supplementary affidavit, Chair.      Ms Klein, in the minutes, it is clear that the person who chaired the meeting, I think it is mister ...[intervenes]      He gives the opportunity to the members     The question is ...[intervenes]      No, let me clarify.  The question is.  You have said to the Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi... give me this... you say to us.  Give me the media statement that was leaked so I can show you it does not...  Essentially, you are saying, it does not... it is not the same that passed before us as the P&G.  I said, Mr Tsotsi told you the media statement that was leaked is exactly the one that passed before you as the P&G.   He is saying that here.  The chairperson gives you the opportunity to clarify.  If you have any questions of clarity with Mr Tsotsi.   The only question we are seeing in the minutes, it is about Sumitomo Corporation.  Your concerns which you have now laid out before the Chairperson are not here.  More than five years later.     Ja, the reference bundle.     The reference bundle.     Page 228.     Yes.     And Chair, might I add ...[intervenes]      ...Ms Klein is looking at that.  Ms Klein, you will see the beginning of the charge is that he commissioned a media statement in relation to an inquiry into the affairs of the company with the assistance of the     Yes.  Page 228.       Yes.     Okay, I have read this.     Not you ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Let me assist the Chair.  The second charge, actually, flows from the first.     Which is, Mr Linnell commenced work without the board being informed.       Yes.     No ...[intervenes]      The first charge is what the Chairperson has in mind.     That is he is commissioned the drafting of the media statement ...[intervenes]      ...without the knowledge or consent of the board.     2014.     Ja.  Chair, that is why I cannot control the time.  [laughing]     [laughing]     I have one or two ...[intervenes]      Let us...     Ja.  Let us see ...[intervenes]      Yes, okay.     Ja.  Miss...  Yes, it will... I will be restricting myself.     If I say to... I will be restricting myself.     So...     Ja.     I know.     No, I am know.     Thirty minutes.     Thirty minutes.     I personally thirty minutes.  [laughing]     He is laughing at me Chair.     [laughing]     No, it is to seven.     Tuesday, next week.     Yes.     Tuesday, the 13 t h.     [laughing]     [laughing]     [laughing]     Sorry.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     There is two more ...[intervenes]      ...witnesses, Chair.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.   
MS KLEIN:  Morning.    Morning Chairperson.    Venete Jolene Klein.    No I do not.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    Sorry Chair what do you want me to check?    Red.    Red ones.    Yes Sir.    Thank you.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Correct Chair thank you.    That is correct; that is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair I think for me the question I thought I was answering at the time was – was this the first time we had engaged with the executives?  And on going back we have actually provided a deck of all of its prior meetings.  But to your point there were various other meetings.  The meeting of the 16 January; the meeting of the 16 February so I believe the point I was trying to make was it was not like it was the first time.  We certainly were a new board but we had engaged extensively with the executives over those first three months.    Yes it was.    Yes absolutely.    Absolutely Chair.  Absolutely.    May I just add something please Chairperson.    I think just to be clear it is the question of the engagement but you know in reading – going back from here and going to re-read everything you know the Chairperson opens a meeting and welcomes you to the first board meeting in January.    And then later on you know we say but that was not the first board meeting this was – so I must say when you read it it can become very convoluted as well.    But I think what is of importance is the level of engagement and who was all present.    You know Chairperson it becomes – as one delves deeper and deeper into it you pick up different things.    You listen to recordings and then you say okay that is what I said then because that is what I knew it to be.  Then I come back here and then I go and listen to the recordings and I have got a Chairperson saying to us welcome to your first board meeting.  So it becomes – all I am trying to say Chairperson is that the terms we used very interchangeably.    Which did allow for I believe a lot of confusion in amongst the war – what were they called?  What were they exactly?  So it was more for me the issue did we engage or did we not engage ultimately that is the question I was trying to answer.    That is correct Chair.    That is – that is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is correct.    Correct.    Chair – true can I just add onto – for Chair just for clarity.  Obviously after being here the last time I went to go and look at why would I have wanted to be part of – in fact when you showed me the email I looked at this because my recollection was I could not make it.  You know I even may have objected because why – why is it that you know you calling meetings at such short notice.  But when Mr Seleka showed me my interest in the meeting on reflection Chair remember there are two statutory committees of every board.  The one is Audit and Risk and the other one is Social Ethics and Sustainability.  I was the Chairperson of Social Ethics and Sustainability which is a statutory committee of the board.  These two committees are responsible for giving feedback on the runnings of the organisation at an audit – sorry at an AGM annually.  That was my reason for wanting to be a part of.  I was not Chairperson of People in Governance at the time.  Had I been I probably would not have put up my hand for it.  But as the Chair of Social Ethics and Sustainability which is a statutory committee I felt I was obliged to be part of any inquiry that would take place.    That is correct Chair.  That is exactly what I said because I had raised so many objections to such short notices in every meeting that I must admit at the time that is what I thought I had done with that one.  Until Mr Seleka pointed out to me that what I had actually done was to say I wanted to be part of it in as much as I was travelling the next day can you not just hold it later on in the day so that I could become part of it.  So I acknowledge Chair exactly what you are saying.    It became apparent Chair.  Yes it did.    No I have no clue – I have no idea about that Chairperson.    Because I was not at the meeting of the 9 t h Chairperson obviously board members from what I could tell were becoming very uncomfortable with being given a directive from the President and calls were being made you know like you know – because remember as you correctly pointed out I wanted to be part of it.  So when I could not be part of it you know there were calls between myself and different board members.  And board members simply said this is what…    After the meeting of the 9 t h.  Because I was not – I was not in the meeting of the 9 t h Chairperson.    After the meeting of the 9 t h.    Correct.    That was my – like I said you showed me the email where I suggested becoming part of it.    But I was not part of it.  It certainly was not in the documentation.    That is correct yes.    No, no of course not.  Of course not Chair.    Yes.     I was part of People In Governance and we had a chairperson of People In Governance Zethembe Khoza at that time.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct.    Sorry Chair I did not get that last – I did not…    Correct. ADV SELEKA    Correct.    That is correct.    Chairperson all I can say to you is that the morning that the Minister was there you know obviously on recollecting now or having – had the benefit of being here going away and then applying my mind again.  What I recall the Minister said was that the people responsible for the areas that were affected she had no problem with ask – being asked to set aside.  Because I think the discussion was about asking people to step aside.  And if I remember correctly the Minister said something to the effect that the people who were responsible for the various areas would be asked to step aside or could be asked to step aside.  But she did say that it is the board’s decision but the people who were responsible for the – what the board felt the areas of responsibility was could be asked to step aside.    It was not at the time when the Minister was there.  When the Minister was there my recollection was there were no names mentioned.  After the Minister left which is the meeting which started at twelve o’clock and this is where it becomes just a little bit more difficult because Chairperson when I was here last time I indicated that I had a recording of that meeting which starts at    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chairperson.    That is correct.    Correct.    Chairperson no and I will – let me try and answer – answer you this way.  It was not until I was asked about the suspensions for preparation for preparatory purposes of this committee or this inquiry that one then started wanting to refresh your memory.  And then you went to go and listen to recordings to make sure that your recollection is correct because we are talking about five years ago.  That is the first point.  So to answer you Chairperson no I did not point that out previously.  The point that the minute was only signed a year later I cannot talk to.  What I do want to place on record Sir is the voracity of the minute as it stands was approved by all board members in a meeting of April of 2015.   I cannot Chairperson explain to you how Doctor Ben only gets to sign it a year later.    Yes.    Chairperson that is correct.    From what – from what I have heard from the commission Doctor Ngubane – because even in my own evidence.    All of the minutes I have got is unsigned.    What I do want to say to the commission however is that it was not new in Eskom that minutes got signed so much later than it actually happened.  In fact Chairperson when I got to a number of the meetings that I chaired I was asked to sign minutes of 2014 which is of the previous board ...[intervenes]      I think, you know, I want to place it on record so that... I know you got the company secretary coming later and he can maybe help to enlighten us because the company secretary was there when the meeting of the 11t h happened.       And the company secretary was there ...[intervenes]      ...when we, the board, ratified all of the minutes of the meetings that had happened in our time.     So those, why Dr Ngubane signed it a year or two later, I cannot...     You will have to ask Dr Ngubane that, Chairperson.     Chairperson, to the best of my knowledge.  Every single meeting was recorded.  But I must also say, at the time at Eskom there were discussions which I know that actually asked for it not to be recorded.   So it is a bit difficult to say that it was all one hundred percent recorded, number one.   Number two, I have actually also tried to get access to the In-Committee minutes because that would give, you know, rise to a lot of the questions being asked and until there are no such minutes.   So I cannot conclusively say to you Chairperson that every single meeting was recorded.  I think Mr Phukubje would be the best person to answer that question for you Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Sorry?     Yes.     I totally agree with you Chair.     I agree with you Chairperson.     I think if I look at my notes(?), Chairperson.  My version which was the same version in parliament as what it is here.  Is that it all happened at the same time.     The names.       The names were motivated, according to me, which is what I have said in parliament and I say here again by Mr Tsotsi at the beginning of the meeting.   Bearing in mind, that was with the benefit of having looked at the minutes and you know, acquainted myself at the time of parliament with that.   When asked the question by the Commission to go and look at the suspensions more specifically because in parliament I was not really focussed on the Commission, only on the suspensions.  It was more about a whole range of other issues.   I then went to go and listen to the recordings and it is at that point that I became aware... not became aware.  I started realising that what was in the minutes, which were all for with Mr Tsotsi, which by the way, I remember specifically Mr Tsotsi telling her that the financial director was involved with some form of tender tampering.  That stuck in my mind.   But when I listened to the recording, it becomes clear that we would have heard it somewhere that she was involved with tender tampering but at that stage, at the end of the meeting which now ends at half-past twelve...      That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes.     Included.     Included.     Chair, it was very interesting because when I started listening to everything again, some things then did crystallise because I was asked at this Commission the question before and I think I even raised it with you.   I said there was a time when Dr Ben was running in and out of the meeting on the phone.     I think I even said to you Chairperson.     And I know it is not my job to do.     But I said, you know, I find it strange that Dr Ben was running in and out and coming back and forth.  And I think what Dr Ben said was, that he was on the phone with the minister.  That happened in that P&G meeting.     And I think it is at that point ...[intervenes]      ...when that name went back on.     What exactly the minister said to him or did not say, I cannot account for it.  You will have to ask Dr Ben.     But it was at that stage ...[intervenes]      Remember, the minister in the earlier meeting said ...[intervenes]      ...people who are responsible for.     So what exactly was said between Dr Ben and the minister, I do not know.     But that was the point in P&G where the CFO’s name went back onto the list.     That is correct, Chair.     I cannot really talk to the presidency because I mean, I do not know who ...[intervenes]      That was my understanding.     And I think for me, it would have lined up with what was said previously in our earlier meeting with the minister.     Chairperson, I guess where I am struggling with the sequence of events, is that my recollection or understanding, certainly of also now following the Commission with great interest on who is saying what, is that Mr Nick Linnell who was obviously briefed by whoever in Durban, actually had charges.   So it was not a case of let us just ask them to step aside.  Nick Linnell came to the meeting which he testified to with actual charges of wrongdoing.   So when you say that in Durban the decision was not to charge, that is not congruent with what Nic Linnell said.  Nick Linnell said he came with the charges.   And the questions would have to be.  Where did those charges come from?  I mean, that would be my question.     Chairperson, I categorically deny that.  In fact, to go to the... or for two reasons.  Norman Baloyi was a member of Audit and Risk.  He was not a member of People in Governance.  So I do not know how he would have heard me say that.  That is the first thing.  In the recordings of the debate on the whole thing around should the FD go or should the FD not be suspended.   I am not the person who raises the issue about many problems in the finance department.  I have actually provided the Commission with the names of the peoples who were speaking there.   The one thing I was consistent about and I said it here before.  The finance director had shared with us earlier on that morning that we were running a company of R 30 million an hour.   So I was always very cognisant that whatever decisions this board makes, we must do it and move on.  But that I said that the CFO must be included, I categorically deny.     Please do.     Correct.     Chair...[intervenes]      I totally agree Chair.  But I think let us Mr Seleka ask the question because then it is probably better to answer it then.     I agree with the Chairperson.     Can I... may I ask a question Chair just for clarity?     Chairperson, are we referring to the meeting     Alright.     No, no.  I want to... I think there are two versions here.  And please, I do not want to waste time.       The first meeting, the first board meeting started at nine o’clock the morning.  The minister comes in.  The rest of the board meeting starts at twelve o’clock and     That then becomes a full board meeting.  The P&G and the Audit and Risk meeting happened between     Sorry, say that again, sir?     We ...[intervenes]      At quarter to three.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Chairperson, I can only imagine that there would have been such a lunch-break and I am sure that others can give you more detail on it.   But remember the questioning being asked is.  At half-past one there were three names.  At ten to three, you now have four names.  Something happened in between.   And the something that happened, happened at the P&G meeting which was a breakaway session between those two meetings.     Somewhere in between that something happened.     Which is the meeting where Dr Ben runs in and     That Dr Ben is coming in with such a name or such a name.  Nowhere in the transcripts does that come through.       Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     That is right, sir.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     From twelve to half-past one.     Yes     That is correct.     Twenty... I think it is ...[intervenes]      ...14    Just before three.     Yes.     Ja, Chairperson, my recollection is that there was a discussion that took place after that three o’clock – not the three o’clock, the half past one meeting.     That is where the three became four.  It was in that meeting that the three became four.     Because at the beginning of the meeting, which is known as the P & G meeting but when you go and you look at the actual – the Chairperson’s talking about, that the full board meeting at this stage.     Yes.     I remember that as well, Chairperson.     I recollect that as well.  What I am suggesting is if you listen to the transcripts because somewhere at the beginning of the transcripts it starts talking about this being a full board meeting.     And then towards the end of it when the executives get suspended, you know, basically get called in, that is where the aid memoire of Nicola Nel which is where, you know, Mr Tsotsi, you must now take over and run P & G yourself.  That is where that comes in?     Yes.     Okay.  Are you going to take me to the transcript?     Ja.  Chairperson, remember, we are talking about two different meetings here.  What you are referring to is the meeting of 14.48 where Mr Baloyi is present where Mr Baloyi is present.  What I am talking about is what happened in between.     That is what I am talking about.  Remember, the question was when was the FD’s name put on.  That was the question, Chairperson.  When we stopped the meeting at half past one her name was not on.  When we come back at 14.48 the first couple of minutes somebody asked the question about is it three or is it four?  And you could hear Mr Zola Tsotsi saying at that stage it is four.     That is correct.      That is correct.     Chairperson, I am going to have to ask that you please point that out to me.     When I read the transcripts that was not me, that was Viroshini Naidoo who said that and in fact I provided the Commission with the names of the different voices.     Correct.     Yes.     That is right.     Ja.     The exact wording.  Because I remember on listening to it and sending through the names to the Commission, the person who said that I have worked very – on numerous committees and the finances were not in order was Ms Viroshini Naidoo.  That was not me.     What I did say, Chairperson, and I said is before is what the finance person or …[intervenes]     The FD had said, she gave us the numbers, she said they were running short, so I was not there defending her, like for example – I think it was Mark Pamensky who was very vocal about, you know?  But you cannot let the FD go because – he spoke stuff about, I think …[intervenes]     Downgrading, all of that.     But the piece about me saying that I sit on various committees and the financials were not in order, the committee or the Commission asked me to re-listen to it and give them the names and I gave them the names and that comment came from Viroshini Naidoo, not me.       But maybe Mr Seleka could give it to me.     Ja.     Ja.     Chairperson, maybe if you can just read and then …[intervenes]     Then we will see if I need to maybe …[intervenes]     Okay, maybe it is better.     Thank you, Chairperson.     Sorry, is that Ms Mabude, Chair, or is that me?     Okay.     Okay, alright, right, okay.     Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.     Yes, sir.     Sorry, Chairperson, mine has all the red numbers, hey?  At the top.     Alright, thank you.     Yes.     Yes, Chairperson …[intervenes]     I absolutely support that, Chair.     I absolutely support.     That is what exactly what I was saying.     You cannot be busy with rats and mice there is bigger issue here, we have not had information before, now we do, now can we please just get on with the job of doing it.  But I thought – but maybe, Chairperson, there is another reference because some – if you can just show me that other one where we talking about I have dealt with the FD before and she has not …[intervenes]     That is one that I remember was…     But if you could take us to there it would help us please.     That is correct, sir, yes.     Yes.     Correct.     At that stage that is what I was saying.     No, no, but we can do that later.     We can do that, I am comfortable with that.     No, that does not address it at all.     Yes.     Yes, absolutely, Chairperson.     Yes.     I remember the Minister ’s words being – I remember with the last time we spoke about it, I could not recollect it clearly but I went back and rethought a whole lot of things.  The Minister said the people heading the areas considered to be the problem areas, it would be best to get them to step aside.     Those were – that is how I remember it.     That is why when we got into the board meeting of the – after the in-committee meeting.     It was the to-ing and fro-ing, is the FD in, is she not?  But the Minister I do not think said four.  If I remember correctly she said the people responsible for the areas that the board considered to be problematic areas.   If I remember it correctly.  I speak under correction there, Chair.     Right.     Yes.     I agree, Chairperson, and I think the only people who can answer that would be Dr Ngubane.     Or Minister.     Because like I said, you know, that was the level of deliberations.       The meeting closed with three and the next one opened with four.  So somewhere in between there.     Maybe the calls – maybe, like you correctly point out, Minister was in the building.  I do not quite know how that worked.     But I remember a meeting where Dr Ngubane was running in and out and then looking at the transcripts of the 14.48 meeting I could not find where he was running in and out and coming with names.  So that is what led me to believe, Advocate Seleka, that must have happened in between those two…     In fact, on the – in the transcript of the 12 – of the meeting that ends at one, it is actually, Advocate, when you look at it – sorry, Chairperson, when you look at – we say there we are now going to break into the meeting which I would assume would have been that smaller meeting where this was going on but I think that needs to be verified with the likes of Dr Ngubane.     And the Minister.     I cannot say anything more than that.     Can I just add, Chairperson, that voice that you heard is Malesela.     Ja, so you know what, I would actually like us – I think, Chairperson, you asked me to put names next to and identify voices.     If you can because it was sent – I hope my counsel has sent it through to you because it took me a lot of time to work through it.     So that was Malesela.  So once again, I think what that then also shows is Malesela was part of the first meeting.     Which ended at a certain time.  Here we go into a second meeting, whether we call it now P & G, we can have a difference of opinion of what it is called based on a different thing, but here is the company secretary     Just help me, Chair, please.  Which – what are we talking about?     No problem, Chair.     No problem, that is okay.     Correct, Chair.     I am sorry if that was the indication that I gave, Chairperson, but as Chairperson of P & G I can actually go take you to a minute where, as the board we kept on getting requests, my understanding, from different executives wanting to exit.  That was my understanding.  In a board meeting in April, if my memory serves me well. It     Yes.     Let me just go back, sorry, Chairperson.  Let me just understand.  Are you saying that I said?     Oh, sorry, I did not get the question.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes, ja, ja.     I have got to agree with her, Chairperson, because after the last time that I was here …[intervenes]     I have to agree with her.     Yes.      That does sound correct Chairperson.     That is my recollection of what – of certainly what she said because I have read through her letters as well so I have to agree with that.     Chairperson I can’t remember exactly what was said but I do know that Mr Kumalo, you see my understanding was prior to that meeting there had been engagements between people, people talking to people, which is why the Board had ultimately then agreed that Mr Kumalo continues to talk to I think it was Tshediso Matona, and that then there was a sub-committee formed because people were getting – apparently calls were coming in.   I was led to believe that people were calling in because they were wanting to go, that was my understanding, so – but when I went back to re-read particular to Tsholofela’s affidavit, not affidavit, her – the letters that she had been writing it was more questioning around process, about one letter about you know she is part of CICA, how this would affect her in the long run, I remember reading all of that. So I have to agree with it, the exact wording I cannot account for, but definitely you know that is – it is as she says.     My understanding right from the start Chairperson is that people were asked to step aside to not interfere, that is what my understanding was, and that ultimately they would come back.   Obviously what has now happened and in listening to different people testify you kind of try and now rethink some of it, my understanding at the time was people were saying there is so much confusion, we have got professional integrity that is being questioned, you as a Board are not coming back to us, we want to leave.  That is what I understood then. Going back and rereading some of it now I must admit rereading Tsholofela’s letter by the way was the one where I could she was rather asking questions than saying I want to leave.   So that is on Tsholofela.   If I can just add something else, I went back to go and reread Dan Marokane, because the last time I was in the chair here Chairperson, and I know we want to speed this along, but I think it is important that we clarify this, a letter was put to me that was written by Dan, correctly so, two days after his suspension, I think it was the 14 t h or something.     Oh, the 18 t h okay, and Chairperson it was presented to me but it came to P & G and it came to company secretary and to ...[intervenes]      Mr Tsotsi.   I went to go and look through all my mail to satisfy myself that I did not miss it.  Chairperson I could find no record, number one, of when it ever came to me as P&G, remember I wasn’t chairing ...[intervenes]      Okay, please do.     Okay.     Chairperson thank you, that is clarified, I am so sorry sir.     From the start Chairperson that was always going to be the position.   My personal view I have given you on the CE, not on everybody, on the CE, I gave you a particular view on the CE, that was my view.     Which remember I gave you the example of R500 000, but that was my view and it was based on a perspective from outside of Eskom.  But my understanding always was that these people would step aside for three months and come back into their roles after three months.   Not after three months, after the investigation had been completed.     Sorry Chair?     I am not sure how to answer that Chairperson, simply because ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Very simply Chairperson because we went to that meeting with already prepared numbers to talk about separation, remember I have indicated to you that we had been getting feedback in the Board itself that people are wanting to disengage, so I would have had no reason to think that she still wanted to stay.  I attended a meeting alongside of Romeo to talk about how to use – I think it was his words or her words, no, his words, how to amicably resolve this, but at that stage, and remember we are talking about from the 13 t h or the 11 t h of March, right now to either the 4 t h or the 5 t h of May thereabouts.     4 May, we’re talking about almost two months later, I consistently had been hearing people are wanting to leave.     Ja, Chairperson quite frankly I cannot tell you why I didn’t ask.     That I cannot answer.    I hear you Chairperson and what you’re saying is highly – it is possible but like I said you know the question to me was that I can’t answer.     I can’t answer that.     That’s possible Chair, I am sure you will ask the appropriate people the same question.     Of course.     July. ADV SELEKA     No that’s okay Chair.     With Dentons?     Oh with Ms Molefe, okay.     That is correct Chair and I am also, like you correctly say, Mr Khumalo will come here and he will probably or for sure be asked that.        I was just thinking from my own perspective would I have known at the time, remember not being a member of Audit & Risk I wouldn’t have known at that time how long that would have proceeded, but I would have known, you are correct, it was supposed to be for three months.     Ja, so I think – I think you have cleared that.     Yes.     Exactly, that had not come, the Dentons things I think started coming to the Board sometime in July, if memory serves me correctly, 25 t h of June.  25 t h of June was the first time Dentons did a presentation, but I think the members of Audit & Risk may have been more knowledgeable at the time as to exactly you know what the position was.     To Audit & Risk.     Correct.     Chairperson I don’t mean to be difficult but I mean I was given a document yesterday to read with highlights, I was trying to browse as quickly as possible.   Just the two areas that affected me, so if Ms Kapdi is saying about dates I am sure he is correct, I obviously couldn’t cross-reference that with my own was I a member, would I have known it, would I not have known it.     That is all I’m saying.     Yes, sorry Chairperson, yes I would have as Chairperson P&G I would have been at the centre of the discussions for the settlement.     Yes Dr Ngubane wasn’t part of it.     Chairpersons sorry I don’t mean to be difficult.     I really don’t mean to be difficult, but the Board according to me, remember there is Audit & Risk who is dealing directly with the Dentons, giving them instructions and no instructions.  According to me the first time I become aware of the Dentons report and what it says is on the 25 t h of June, which is when it gets presented, so if you are telling me that there was a meeting where it was agreed on the 11 t h of June that they must cut their report short, you are going to ...[intervenes]      Please can you show me because I thought I had read everything in connection with Dentons, Dentons I know met with us on the 11 t h, on the 9 t h of July, sorry 25 t h of July, 25 t h of June apologies, I think it was the 2 n d of July, I think it was the 14 t h of July, these are all the Board meetings where Dentons gets discussed, so if you can just show me the meeting where it gets cut short.      I would appreciate that.     Yes.     I apologise Chairperson, I misunderstood, I thought there’s a meeting where this is discussed, because I am being asked to comment on why I would have not with Tsholofela fought harder if we knew Dentons was going to stop already on the 11 t h of June, help me sir.     No I don’t recall that Chair.     I don’t recall it.     No I think you said 4 t h of May.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes.      Correct chair, I would imagine.     No.     Chair I do remember a discussion I think at ARC, and we just need to have a look at Audit & Risk Committee where apparently there was a request for additional I think if I remember correctly I think Dentons did come and say they wanted an additional three months or something, the actual date of that Audit & Risk Committee meeting I don’t have, but there was such a discussion from what I learnt afterwards, with the higher budget etcetera, which is why I almost think in my affidavit I address the fact that I know it was three months because of that having been the agreed timeframe, but also because of budgetary constraints.  That’s how I remember it.   So I know that I heard about another meeting where there was requests for an extension but I don’t remember that having ever been approved or who had decided that this is where it ends.   We need to go and look at minutes and things, I would also need to just – because it is not something I went to go and look at chairperson.    I hear you Chair.    But like I said the one thing that as I am sitting here now grappling with the – what do I remember and what do I not remember.    The one thing that was always very big at Eskom is all the noise and people talking to people.    And you know then you come into a meeting and now you have heard something so the noise of the investigation taking longer I had heard.    But did I ever see it; was I part of a meeting where it was said that you have got – I cannot remember that.    And I can only talk to what I knew.  Unless of course I am given the chance to go back and reconsider my minutes.    I cannot – I cannot argue that.    My recollection is – sorry did he say that he made a presentation?  Just help me again there Sir.    And I am going to go as far as saying to you Chairperson without being difficult I want to have an opportunity to go and con – take the affidavit and compare it.    Because Chairperson the first presentation that I have got in the board in committee minutes made by – by …    Sorry by Dentons was on the 25 June.  When I was asked by the committee to go and check.  He may very well have made that presentation to Audit and Risk and I think so .    Ja you can clarify it.    Please.    Yes absolutely chair.    Absolutely Chair.    Audit and Risk.    I remember reading exactly that Chair so I cannot state that is one hundred percent accurate.  I have read that.    Correct Chair.    Can I answer Chair.    Chairperson the significant difference between the two was we went in and there were numbers prepared for everybody to discuss the possible separation.  Because my understanding was people wanted to leave.  Now fair enough Mr Koko’s name had never come up.  The name that I had heard – names I had heard come up was Dan Marokane and Tsholofelo.    Chairperson I do not believe that she was treated differently at all.  We had the sets of numbers there.  Tsholofelo in her introductory mark said what she did and Romeo said what he did.   I have explained I cannot tell you why I did not ask Romeo why he did not – why he is saying what he was saying.  But she looked at the numbers.  She took the numbers and she had a problem with various things on the numbers.  She took it and she looked at it.   Mr Koko refused to even look at the numbers.  He sat in the chair which is what I said in my affidavit here and I said it at Parliament.  He would not – when we started the discussion we said what we were there for.  Explained to him that we are here to have a look at how we can get to a common ground.   He started off by saying to us my blood is blue and I am going nowhere.  I sat with the numbers.  I did not even have an opportunity like with – with Tsholofelo to even give him the numbers – he would not look at it.  He just said guys I have grown up in Eskom I want my job back.  I am not prepared to look at numbers I am going nowhere.    Chairperson you would remember me saying to you that – and I know that I have been told do not go back.  In my mind she was one of the people in fact her name was mentioned that she wanted a settlement.  So coming into the meeting I mean if I knew that she did not want to talk to discussion or talk settlement there would have no numbers on the table.    Yes.    I totally agree with you Chairperson.    I totally agree with you.  And remember your question was, so why did we continue?    And why did Romeo Khumalo say    I cannot answer that    I cannot answer that.    But to come back to Mr Koko.  And why you know why was – the man would not even take the paper.  He would not look at it.    I accept that.    Chairperson.    Mr…    Chairperson that is how I remember it.  He came in…    No, no.  The one thing that stood out for me was that I do not even think that much of a chance to speak you know he came in and went for my blood is blue, I grew up in this organisation, I am not going to go anywhere.  And I even remember then I say asking him the question about but do you trust this board?  Because I remember with the suspensions he was the one executive who was the most – almost not aggressive maybe but annoyed with the suspensions.  So now I am saying to him, okay your blood is blue, you want to come back do you even trust – I mean this is the same board you going to work with.  Can – will you be able to work with this board?  Something to that effect is my recollection Chair.    I cannot argue with that Chairperson.  What I am saying to you is where with everybody else you would have had a discussion with it.  Mr Koko was adamant he is coming back he wants his job.  I do not remember him taking it but if he has got it then he must have been given the document like everybody else.  That is all I can say.    He did – like I explain to you Chairperson my recollection was before we could even talk he was not prepared to look at anything.  I may very well have given him the document to take with him for consideration afterwards.  I cannot remember but that is the only way he would have had the actual document.    And – and ja Chair and I said to you you know for the benefit of hindsight I should have questioned it at that stage I cannot answer you at this stage.    But I am sure Mr Khumalo will give you additional information.    Correct.    Chairperson if I may?  Firstly I do not remember in the meeting when we were in that she spoke about litigating so I think it must have been.    Maybe in another meeting.    Regarding the settlement for Ms Molefe I think I heard Counsel asking earlier that it was between myself and Mr Khoza.  I was not a party to Ms Molefe’s settlement.     I was …    With the – the actual settlement.    The settlement.    So – so I was not a party to that.  That was concluded between I think you will probably get that in her affidavit.    Between herself and I think Mr Khoza.    Chairperson I am going to – I am going to disagree.    I – no not do not recall I was the Chairperson of People In Governance and that was the one her and Dan Morakane where I was not a party to the actual signing off of the figure.  So when you tell me that it is eighteen months I must say I am a little bit surprised because I was of the view twelve months was the maximum.    Yes.    No that I agree with Chairperson.    No I agree with I was part of the people but when you tell me it is eighteen months now I go okay.    I think it is the latter.    I saw communication you now regarding her paying legal fees and something to do with the house and something like that but the rest – the actual figure whatever that became that I was not aware of. Because I was not part in that last discussion to conclude the final figures with her.    No but I think she was seeking support for some legal – if memory serves me well.    There was some discussion about legal costs; there was some discussion about a home in security.    Or something like that.    So what I am saying to you I certainly saw – sorry Chairperson.    I certainly saw communication around that but what that ultimately became I must say I was a little disappointed that I was not part of the ultimate sign-off of but I think we have – I am not sure whether we are saying the same thing.  There was a toing and froing so it was not a straight ja I am accepting this.     Yes.     That is what I am saying.     I was privy Chairperson to some of the communication.     But when it came to what it was... I mean, if you are to... when you told me the other day when we were here about it was R 18 million ...[intervenes]      ...I could... you know, the thing is.  As People in Governance, you must make sure that governance is followed.       But if something happens outside of what I have actually seen ...[intervenes]      ...I cannot attest to that.  That is something whoever was... whoever else was involved must come and give you the breakdown as to the why.     I remember, like I say, that the proposal put to her the first time, she questions certain things.     About why certain things would not be included.     So that is where I am objecting.     No, no.  Not her.     No, I think Chairperson said all together ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Oh, that is what I was referring to.     Absolutely.     Yes.     Yes.     I am not... No, I think I would have given her a proposal ...[intervenes]      ...at the first meeting.     And then... are you saying there was a ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Alright?     Okay.     Yes.     Alright.     Alright.     Alright.     H’m.     H’m.     But I did not argue that I was.       I indicated ...[intervenes]      The actual signature.     Yes.     But it would be interesting Chairperson. I would like to, maybe just for clarity?  Was that number, that one that was on the final proposal, is that the same number that was ultimately paid?  Because that I do not know.  And I guess, that is what I am saying.  I took cognisance of all of her... the input she made which was security and various other things.     What I am not sure of ...[intervenes]      Yes. ADV SELEKA     And Chairperson, if I may?  Is that... do you have a list of what she was ultimately paid out?  Does that proposal give you an amount?  And is ...[intervenes]      I am not sure if it bears any relevance.  I am just ...[intervenes]      I must say, I felt left out.     Please.     Okay. ADV SELEKA     Was ...[intervenes]      Oh, okay. ADV SELEKA     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     But let me just check it....      Ja.     Yes.     H’m?     H’m?     Okay.     So I offered more than what was originally... I am trying to just get my ...[intervenes]      Ja, please Chair.     Ja.  I am not ...[intervenes]      Thank you.     Yes, Chair.     Got it right.     [No audible reply]      Sorry.  Yes, Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.  If I remember correctly.  I think Mr Zethembe Khoza or Dr Ngubane ...[intervenes]      ...would have signed all of this.  Yes.     Correct, Chair.     [No audible reply]      Not necessarily Chairperson.  What would technically happen is.  You would get all the information from your executive remuneration department being Anton Minnaar.   And when it was then signed off, if the agreement was reached, it would then be signed off by the chairman who was the head of the board and that would have been acceptable.  It did not necessarily have to come back to People in Governance.     [No audible reply]      Sorry.  Are we talking about the red page 51 of my ...[intervenes]      14.     Paragraph 51.     Okay I have got on page 14, I have got paragraph ...[intervenes]      Yes, I have got that.     Yes, Chairperson.     Chairperson, what I can say to you is that, this was what was given to me to be done but as I have indicated earlier.   There was just so much going on all around us that if you say to me know, was it wrong for Dr Ngubane not to have signed it?   Or let him because whoever and it was for me to delegate it to them.  I am going to have to say to you, you are correct.  Because that did happen.   It was for to have delegated it but I have said to you in front of Chairperson, what was happening all around us.  Remember, at that stage also, we were quite new.   I was still quite new as well.  So a lot of what I felt happening, I now today know is not what ought to have happened.  But then ...[intervenes]      ...I would have thought that, you know... because remember, we also have an executive remuneration team who would have guided.  Or a secretariat who would have guide.  So.     I can just... all I can say to you is.  I need to take accountability that that was not according to mandate ...[intervenes]      ...which was mine.     Chairperson, I would go as far as saying to you, the point is valid.  But I would argue that the people who find it, were senior people in Eskom.  Both Mr Khoza, as well as Dr Ben .   And I am not trying to... I said to you, I except that because I was new because there were other what should have been almost catch-nets to make sure that it came through the right delegated power.       But the fact that it was Dr Khoza... ag, Dr Ngubane and Mr Khoza who signed it and not somebody outside.  I had no reason at the time to go and object to it.     Chairperson, I would have to say I do not recollect that because ...[intervenes]      Because if it did happen, I would have been a little more vigilant on the amount having been increased.     I am not aware.  It may very well be that it can turn out that it was somewhere but I do not remember that.  It is not my recollection, sir.     Chairperson, I do not remember that ever having been done.  I remember feedback being given to the board to say settlement has been reached with individuals.  But the actual distribution of the ...[intervenes]      ...the terms.  I do not think that that did ever go to the board.     H’m.     I accept that, Chairperson.     I do understand what you are asking to, Mr Chair.     I hear you, Chairperson.     But Chairperson, there is one point that I also want to raise and maybe Mr Seleka can help us with the date but... it is in my affidavit.   I did not remain the chairperson of P&G right through the process.  In fact, on the 2 nd of July’s meeting, I was not the chairperson of P&G.   Everything was moving all the time.  So I want us to please just go and check that on that date when... 25 June ...[intervenes]      ...whether I was the chairperson of P&G.       Can we please just have a look at that?     We can do it afterwards.     Please check for me.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct.  But like I said, you know, in that time.  One month you were P&G.  The next month you were not.  I remember specifically on the meeting of the 2 nd of July, I was not the chairperson of P&G any longer.  It was Chwayita Mabude.  So.     Which was ...[intervenes]      It happened.     Absolute, Chairperson.     I will do that.     Yes.     I hear you, Chair.     I agree, Chairperson.     Chairperson, just one last point.  On the 14t h of July, I know that I get reappointed as the chairperson of P&G.  So when I was the last... I am just saying, in reference to Ms Tsholofelo Molefe’s signing of documents, it may very well be that that was discussed with the chairperson if I was not the chairperson.     But say I was the chairperson, I have got to take full accountability.     That I was squarely in the feet.     And it was my accountability.     Chairperson, I know the one thing that I did see was on the 14 t h of July, if we can check that, I become the chairperson of P&G again.       But when I was taken off, I have not got that date because you know, one month you were... and I actually allude to it in my affidavit that things were moving all the time.     So if we can just please check that.     Thank you.     No.     No, on the 14t h, I was reinstated as chairperson of P&G.     Is that what that is?     Okay.     When I was taking out.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Chairperson, I am having a hard times with the words here.  I have got no recollection ...[intervenes]      ...of asking Mr Koko would he come back.       Yes, Chairperson.  You are a hundred percent.     And remember I had actually explained why I asked that question.     Because at the suspensions of the four, Mr Koko was the one who seemed the most hostile, if you were.  So it was in the context of that that I asked the question.   But I do not remember asking Mr Koko if he would come back.  That would not be congruent with me offering him the papers which we had discussed earlier.   So I do not... I cannot remember but I would be surprised if those were my words.  That is all I am saying.     No, no.  No, Chairperson, now I have got to be careful what I am agreeing with.     Chair, can I just clarify something?  I just want Mr Seleka, just remind me again.     You said at the beginning of the meeting he got given opportunity to wax lyrical?     Okay.     No, of course.     Okay.     I do not have a copy in front of me.     I do not remember just him being given time, Chairperson.  I remember the man starting to talk about his career at Eskom and how he was  - his blood is blue, he is going nowhere but if you ask me did he get more time than anybody else, it did not occur to me at the time that I was giving him more time.  It was part of a discussion with the person.  So I am not sure that I would agree that he got given more but if it was more because somebody was timing it, I cannot argue with that.     Yes.     Are we talking about the same page?  I think we are on the same page.     Chairperson, my only comment on this would be, I went into that meeting in the same way that I went into the meeting with Tsholofelo.  Tsholofelo said she did not want to leave and then the discussions carried on about various other things. This gentleman literally came in, sat himself down and started telling me about – was not telling me, started telling the committee about how his blood blue, about how he was going nowhere and he used somebody else’s term, waxing lyrical about it.   At the end of it, in spite of how I may have felt personally about the person, I just knew that this is somebody who did not go anywhere.  So if you are saying to me that he said he would not make it difficult for the board decides he must go, I cannot remember that comment.  He may very well have said it but if you are asking me today, I cannot remember him saying those words.  I cannot remember.     That certainly does not sound like what I heard, Chairperson, I would have remembered that.  I would have remembered if Mr Koko I would not make it difficult for you because I had my own views on Mr Koko, which I shared publicly before.  I would have grabbed at that opportunity to say to the guys, hold on, this person –sorry, Chairperson, I would have grabbed at the opportunity to say this person is ready to leave, let us talk about leaving, so I do not remember that.  That is the one part of this thing.  The fact that he was talking a lot, the fact that he says his blood is blue, the fact that I knew he was very – I do not know if the word is aggressive but when he left the night when he was suspended he was very angry with the board.  I remember all of that.  So I just cannot remember him saying if the board says that, you know, I am not required, I will not make it hard.  I do not remember that, sir.     Chairperson, I have been on oath in parliament as well stating that of the executives, when I became People in Governance Chair, Mr Koko seemed to have had difficulty with a lot of the members of Eskom and there were many complaints about it.  I did not know Mr Koko from a bar of soap but one of the things that I learned was that he had difficulty with a lot of relationships with some of the people there.   So if there was any one person who was asking to go, I would probably have encouraged it.  I would have encouraged it.  That is why I cannot believe that I would have – that that was said because I did not hear that.  I would have remembered that.     Chairperson, I have no idea what Ms Daniels is talking about, very simply because the Minister had never spoken to me about any ceiling on any settlement.  The Minister had never spoken to me about who has got to leave when.  I honestly do not know, unless I can see a minute which says that but I do not remember any of that.  What I will say is, and I think I have said this time and time again through the inquiry, is that I was always cognisant about a board making decisions to turn the company around.     But clearing the decks, Minister talking about a 12 million [indistinct] 15.15 I do not know who the Minister would even have known what the people were earning.  So I have got no idea what Ms Daniels is talking about.     Chair, I am not disputing any of what Advocate Seleka has just said.  What I am disputing is that the minutes that told – or unless I am reading it wrong again, because I tend to do that – the 12 million …[intervenes]     That is very possible, Chair.     Very possible but I guess I read that what Ms Daniels was saying is that I said those things.  So maybe I was reading it incorrectly.     No, Chairperson, I have already said that I have – I have explained that I actually did ask that.     No, I actually have already acknowledged that I said it, right at the very beginning.     Chairperson, as I have said earlier, the reason for asking that question of Mr Koko was because of what happened the day of his suspension.  He was very angry with the board.  He walked out there, he was so cross with us, hence my question.  That was the only reason I asked him that question.     Chairperson, I have no idea.  I do not know what meeting we are referring to here and as I am saying, you know, if I had minutes of it or some indication but I do not know what meeting they are referring to here.       I have acknowledged that some of what she said is correct.     Not all of it.  So if you asked me if this happened, it may have happened.  Did I say those things?  I do not know.     Okay, I have no recollection of that meeting, Chairperson.     Very definitely, Chairperson.     I do recall that.     I do recall that.     It is possible, Chairperson.     Yes, Chairperson.     Correct, Chairperson.     Yes.     Right [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     To respond?     Chairperson, I do not know if Mr Kapdi is confusing me with Miriam who was the Chairperson of audit and risk.  I spoke to Mr Kapdi myself.  In fact I want to go a step further.  In the discussion with Mr Kapdi he told me categorically that there was no evidence of wrongdoing.     Can I respond, Chair?  May I respond?     Chair, early in the Dentons’ inquiry I got a call from Dr Ben Ngubane who told me that Suzanne Daniels had been interrogated, I think was the word used, by the Dentons’ investigators and they were very hostile towards her.  So hostile she was apparently in tears and Dr Ben, because I was Acting People in Governance, asked me please would you meet with Ms Daniels to find out what is happening. I met with Ms Daniels and she told me that the Dentons investigator had told her that they had found enough evidence on her to have her dismissed, whatever the word, but she was very, very, very distressed by this.  Based on that, Dr Ngubane at one of the meetings that followed and I cannot quite – I know that I found the minutes a week or so ago but I could not find it last night, would not even allow Ms Daniels into the meeting because of what supposedly Dentons had found and it was with that in mind, Chairperson, bearing in mind that Ms Daniels, at the time, worked for Matshela Koko.   So in my heart of hearts when I was told that – and we can listen to the recording of the 2 July where there is such a motivation to bring Mr Koko because somebody had died in his department and the acting people were not coping, so it would be great to bring Mr Koko.  I said only on condition that I can make a call to Dentons because of what had happened to Ms Daniels.  I needed to satisfy myself that in the inquiry, whilst it was not focusing on the executives, if anybody could be this rough on Ms Daniels, surely she was not working alone, she was working for Matshela Koko.  That was the reason that I made the call to Dentons.     It would absolutely have meant that Mr Koko could not be allowed because – and I am sure we are going to deal with Dentons’ reports in a while, but Dentons was going to continue – not Dentons, but there was going to be another process afterwards for a lot of allegations that were made.  I wanted to make very sure in my heart of hearts that what had happened to Ms Daniels had nothing to do with Mr Koko before allowing him back in.      Absolutely.     Absolutely Chairperson.     Yes, she was the Chairperson of audit and risk.     Chairperson all I can say to you is I spoke to Mr Kapdi, Mr Kapdi did not refer me to Mr Sulaiman[?].      Chairperson I stick to my version which is I would have had absolutely no reason to go back to the board and say that I have spoken to Dentons if in fact I did not and if on reading - and if I look at what because in fairness the investigators and the advocate did give me a copy of it yesterday.  He says he has no recollection he does not say he did not speak to me.  He says he cannot, because I mean it is five years ago.  One thing I will say is when I spoke to him he did not say to me that he is referring me to Mr Sulaiman[?], that he never did that.         Chairperson I do want to ask the letter because remember I did not have the benefit of the response from Mr Sulaiman[?] to Ms Carrim.      May I have a look at that?     Because that would help me.      And I just want to just be clear because I have had no interaction with Mr Sulaiman[?].       Thanks very much Chair I have noted that but I stand by my version…[intervene]     Where Mr Sulaiman[?] did not write to me and I got the answer from Noor Kapdi and it was on the basis of the affidavit that I will provide about Ms Daniels.       No.     Thank you Chair.     My discomfort was twofold here you have got three people who you settling with in the three-month period that they were supposedly being given to get everything you know for the investigation to be done and here is a possibility that one person comes back, that was the first discomfort that I had.  Legally you know am I exposing, are we the board exposing the company to any kind of legal for litigation.  Secondly if there then is no wrongdoing because remember I stick to my version which is I spoke to Noor Kapdi based on what I had experienced with Ms Daniels and Noor Kapdi tells me there is no wrongdoing.  I wanted to make sure what would happen if I as the board member said to the other board members I am not going to allow Mr Koko to come back.  I needed to understand what the consequences of that would be for the organisation.          Chairperson that is a very interesting question because you are going to have other board members who’s going to come here and I hope that you are going to put this question to them.      No, no and I am going to answer you.       Chairperson to a large degree it was not.     It was not.     I cannot explain it Chairperson.     All I know is that in more than one meeting I indicated guys we cannot do this there is one or two things coming out that is of concern to me and I think that was part of the reason I was asked to go and get an opinion from Noor Kapdi as well as go and get a legal opinion because of my reservations which I was raising.     As I have explained earlier my discomfort was based on what happened to Ms Daniels and I was afraid that there may be something underlying which could come at us afterwards.  Sorry are we still talking about the same thing Chairperson?  Just help me quickly I maybe off the point.       My discomfort at that stage was now that Gerry Kapou[?] has said not Gerry Kapou[?], sorry Noor Kapdi.       Noor Kapdi, now that Noor Kapdi has told me there is no – all these things that I have been worried about with Ms Daniels is it out of the way.  Then I was concerned that here you have got three executives literally who’s according to me by now accepted that they are going to be leaving.  What does bringing a fourth one back do to the company.  Do we not open the company to litigation was the first concern?  Secondly if like I am saying to you I was told by Mr Kapdi there was nothing else there.  What would be, what would we be exposed to if we kept him out, so it was twofold.  So that was my discomfort the litigation which could possibly open ourselves to by this other three now that his coming back and the second thing was keeping him out after supposedly there is nothing which was confirmed by Noor Kapdi.  What does that mean?  Those were the opinions that I was asking Gerry Kapou[?] for.            Yes, yes.      That was picked up in one of the minutes I never personally saw the letter it was a minute of a meeting where Chwayita Mabude gives feedback and says there was a letter from Dentons I never physically saw the letter from Dentons myself.      Chairperson I think what you saying is probable because you will remember Mr Matona saying that you know he felt like he was pushed out.      You know so what you saying is probable but that is certainly not what was in mind at the time.     I wanted to make sure that legally bringing one out of four back is not going to create a problem for the organisation.     By people in governance on behalf of the board.      Correct on behalf of the board yes.      Correct.      But Chairperson but that is exactly the point the board had mandated people and governance and people and governance had instructed me because I think of various push backs for me to do certain things.     Chairperson I can only say to you I see it here, these are the letters that was sent to Ms Carrim, Ms Carrim would have to give you that assurance I never got the letter from Dentons at all.       Yes.      I agree, yes.       Of course.      Yes.      Yes, correct Chairperson.      Yes.      Sorry?     Yes.     So P&G had agreed to bring him back, ja not the board P&G – there was going to be a P&G meeting later on, on the 2 n d I think there is a problem with the date because I think the date of the P&G meeting that we have got there is on the 1 s t.  The P&G meeting happened later the day on the 2 n d where I gave feedback in terms of what both Mr Kapou[?] and Mr Kapdi had said.      That is correct Chairperson.     That did Chairperson after P&G which is dated the 2 n d which we sent you the clip of as well where I give feedback to P&G as to what happened with my discussion with Mr Kapou[?] and with Mr Kapdi.  After that it then went back to the board to say to the board look this is our proposal and the board then based on in the information they then received were comfortable that this could happen bearing in mind we have now checked it off with the enquiry, with Kapdi as well as with the legal people.      Chairperson I…[intervene]     Chairperson I am not aware of that I do not think so.      I do not think so.       Chairperson I can’t make a comment other than to say that I can understand why they would have felt that way.     Chairperson, let me answer that this way, the man was not back yet, let me say this to you, should the four have come back on my watch there would have been an investigation into all of the allegations that had been made prior to them leaving because me we’ve dealt fairly with various allegations and things like that, so when people did come back we would have had to have them looked at various things.  The difficulty that I had, or I think that the Board faced, Chairperson, was we were on a burning platform with so much going on.  We had load shedding, going concern problems and all of the rest of it, so, if you say to me why didn’t I then institute an investigation against Mr Koko, that just wasn’t a top priority for me at the time.  We were wanting to get this business stabilized, that was my perspective.   I wanted to make sure that we had dealt with the four Executives in a way that the Board would not be exposed, legally and I had done what I thought were the checks and balances required.    Chairperson, when it comes to the Dentons, as I hope I’m not going to go too wide, you must just help me here Mr Seleka because remember because we’re talking about various versions but I think they’re all…[intervenes].     First one?     First one, the first version of the Dentons report was given, presentation was made to the Board on the 25 t h of June, that version had no – according to my recollection, no names of individuals but names of companies.  I remember the Board asking the question, how much of this has been verified and how much of this are just allegations because we were very cognisance – certainly I was, of the fact that we had three months for this thing to run.  They gave us, this was verified, and these were allegations.  The Board decided that the allegations could be looked at afterwards but in order to get a base line which is what I thought we were needing to do, that we would work with the version which was verified, that was the first version.  The Board then, asked Dentons to go away and take out the names of companies, once again, Ms Daniels – let me not talk about Ms Daniels, I do not recall any names of individuals in that report.  So, when the report, the second report came on the 14 t h of August, that was the report that the Board accepted and signed off.  Regarding the question about me, collecting them and shredding them…[intervenes].     Can I just go back?     Right, so the first presentation was made on the 25 t h of June, the meeting of the 2 n d or the 3 r d of July, the Board gets given this first draft which is with all the names of the different companies in it.  On the meeting or at the meeting of the 14 t h of July the company secretary is asked to get all of those versions back from Board members because Board members are now walking around with documents which the Board agreed it would rather not have because we could be sued because there wasn’t proper investigations done on it.  So, at the meeting of the 14 t h of July the company secretary asked, please can we have all the documents back, that’s the first version, with all of the names in it.  On the 14 t h of August, Chairperson, when we get the final draft, the one where the Board is now happy, we’ve taken out the names of people, we can’t get sued, by this time quite a few of the Board members had still not given back the documents in spite of having been asked for it a month before.  It is at that point, that I’m asked as Chair of People and Governance, please can you help us to collect these documents from the Board members so that they can do shredding and, Chairperson, I certainly did not shred any documents myself.  I would have worked with company secretary where people had not brought their copies in, to maybe make a call to say, please can we have your cooperation because it was an entire month later that Board members had still not complied with the request from the secretary.     And if I said that it’s individuals and companies then I’m wrong here because as far as I remember it was against companies and I was afraid that we would be sued.     Chairperson, as I sit here today, my concern at the time was about companies.  I can’t remember individual names even being mentioned in that first document.     Chairperson, all I can say to you is, with the benefit of looking at it now, I really believe it was companies, I cannot believe that there were individual.  Sitting here now, if that’s what I wrote there, then I can – then I have to say to you, hand on heart, then it was a mistake because it was definitely companies and I cannot remember seeing individual names on it.     Chairperson, that is news to me.  My understanding, and there’s a letter which we have, I’m not sure, I think was given in my pack the last pack to the Commission, was where Ms Carrim actually wants to understand what’s the difference between the first and the second report and they actually then say, the corroborated version was, what was then, the final version, the uncorroborated or the allegations was all removed.  So, I must say I’m not sure, I mean, obviously not having had sight to what it is that you’re referring to, I can only go on what the Chairperson of ARC told us, which was to say, this was the first version, this is the second version, so what is the difference and the difference – one of the first things, point number one, on the letter which she got from Dentons was to say that all uncorroborated names of companies had been removed.  I think that’s something, Chairperson, that we’d need to then ask Ms Carrim because I can’t really respond to that any further. My version is, there were names of companies in there and I was – my personal concern was that they could sue us which is why they were asked to be removed.    Chair just to be clear am I going to get a copy of that first report from you so that I can look at it because I do not have?    Oh alright thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Chairperson that is certainly is not how I understood it at the time.    That certainly is not how I understood it and why I understood him coming back.    I completely understand Chair and I completely understand and all I can say is…    I think somebody is going to write a book about us one day.    I hear Chairperson and ja.    Chairperson all I want to say is and I am sure you are going to have other people coming I am not sure on the same topic but I would like you to test please with the other board members who pushed the hardest for Mr Koko not to come back.  I would like you to please test them going forward.    Agree.  Agree Chairperson.    Agree.    Chairperson at the time when the calls were made when I was asked because of my discomfort which I am sure you will navigate or interrogate with other witnesses at that time there had already been conclusions reached with every one of the other three.    I agree with that Chairperson.    No Chairperson I cannot add to that.  I think everything that we have heard so far I cannot add – I cannot disagree with anything that you have said.    Yes.    Are you asking me if I recall that?    Just help me Chairperson?    Ja please.    No I do not recall.  So if you can just read it to me please because I went through quite a lot of the minutes but I do not recall a meeting – if I understood it correctly where people met prior to – is that in what you say is in a board minute?    Okay.    No I am not aware that there was a meeting.    Prior meeting.    Chairperson..      Okay.    No Chairperson.    No I do not.  That is why I am saying just read to me the minute because I do not remember being at a meeting where that was discussed.    Yes.    Okay.    Before the suspensions it is Tshediso Matona ...[intervenes]      ...it was suspension, it became Zethembe Khoza.     That is correct, Chair.     H’m.     Chairperson, on the 19t h...  I must admit, the one thing that stands out for me on the 19t h were... it is a couple of things.   Remember, this is now not a normal situation.  There is noise.  There is all kinds of stuff you are dealing with.  So I must admit Chairperson that for me was not something that stuck in my mind.   The one thing that stuck in my... there are two things.  In my mind in that meeting, was the one that Mr Tsotsi was going to be talking to me about something that I as a board member refused to sign on the 19t h.   And the other thing is, was the whole issue around the leakage of the information in the media that was coming at us.   So if it was something that I ought to have paid more attention to, I did not.  I mean, we are talking about five years ago now.  So I cannot remember...   Look, if I am in the meeting.  But remember, Eskom at that stage, there were allegations flying all over the place.  You did not know what to deal with first.   So maybe if I had, you know, a recording of that particular meeting it would maybe make it a little bit easier for me to responds to.  A little bit more conclusively to what ...[intervenes]      I cannot remember what to react to something like that ...[intervenes]      ...at that particular time.  That is what I am saying.     I am not saying it was not because if it is in the minute, it clearly was there.     But how it got there, who said it, what the reaction was, how much time was spent.  That is the part I am struggling to be able to answer at this stage Chairperson.     Ja.     Chairperson, when you are in a situation where you have got bombs going off all around you.  You have got load-shedding, you have got no money. You have been told by your shareholder representative that you got to move things along because things cannot continue as they are.   You have got the media shouting at you about stuff that... decision that you have made which are wrong.  It is very difficult to look at anything outside of what you are sitting with in front of you.   So to ask me if there was anything that was obviously     Yes.     Ja.     There was a lot that was wrong.     We have to then make decisions based on what you have got in front of us.  Remember, there are all kinds of things that have now come out of the woodwork about who knew what and who spoke to who and who did what.   At that stage, for those of us who were keeping our heads down and trying to solve the problem, that is what we thought.  That... not, we.  Let me talk for myself.  That is what I thought we were doing.   Obviously, with everything that I have heard up to now, affidavits and what has come out of the reports and what has come out of the parliamentary inquiry.   Maybe I could have been a little bit more vigilant.  But let me say this to you Chairperson.  My family hardly ever saw me.  It is not indicated in the minutes.  But I most nights went home at twelve o’clock.  Because you became so involved in operational, trying to solve different problems.   So should we have been more vigilant Chairperson?  I suppose the answer is today, absolutely yes.  Should we have seen more?  Yes.   Did we know that there were strings being pulled from maybe one agenda, two agenda?  I do not know.  All I can say to you is.   I believe that with what I had at that stage, I believe we were... I thought we were busy with the right thing.       Chairperson, I have no doubt of that based on what I know today.     Based on what I know today, I have no doubt of it.     Chairperson, I can only tell you what I have heard from Arc(?) at the time because I was not a member of Arc at that stage.  What I was told or what the board was told is that whatever was coming out of the inquiry, the...  You know, the investigations at the time, were not matters that were unknown to Eskom.  These were matters that were known to Eskom.   My understanding is that that is when the board said and the board, I believe was Arc, but we can confirm that.  That then take out the uncorroborated pieces because if we were to come out with a report which was not fully ventilated and fully investigated, we could find ourselves being sued by those people mentioned based on just an allegation.  That is my understanding from Arc.   So if you ask me why were they stopped within seven weeks, I can only tell you what the board was told and the board was told that there was nothing coming out from the investigation other than the stuff the board already knew.  That is why it was cut short.     H’m.  That is correct, Chairperson.     Ja, Chairperson I think you have said a lot and one does not want to take anything away from who you view it at this point in time.   Short of saying that, obviously, if one was not in the know and you were doing the best job that you could, that is what you did.   And load-shedding was a big thing for us at that stage.  Everybody wanted load-shedding to end and...  But I am sure...  I am not going to add to it.  You have given us where you, you know, where your thoughts are right now.     H’m.     H’m.     Chairperson, I just want to add one thing.  I mean, I cannot take any from anything that either you or Advocate Seleka said.  I cannot because, I mean, I cannot argue what is developing.  I want to, however, just add that the idea of the inquiry, not the suspension, the idea of the inquiry also came from the war room.  It think it has got to be – one has got to under - for me, in any event, you were getting inputs from various groupings.  I mean, here we have heard from Mr Linnell about stuff that happened much higher up, we have heard about other people being involved but you had a war room and the war room, Chairperson, I must say in their minutes also called for an inquiry.   Sure, I mean, it did not talk about the stages but also called for an inquiry.  Now I am not sure what the basis of that was but there was also a call for an inquiry from the war room.  I just – that is really the only thing I can add on …[intervenes]     Yes.     Let me respond this way to you, Chairperson, I am actually making the comment on the war room based on the minute of the 9 t h.  Remember I was not there on the 8 t h.  My understanding of what Mr Matona said, unless I read it wrong, was that here was – I did not understand him to mean that here is an inquiry, I understand him to mean but the war room has also called for an inquiry.  So there may be – then Chairperson, then let me just go and reread and maybe, Chairperson, come back to you on that because the point I made on the war room was specific to my reading of the minute of the 9 t h.     But let me rather just go – remember you have given me a recording as well, so let me go and re-read it and read that.     Do you want me to do it now or do you want us to…?     No, I will come back to it.     I may have misunderstood what I read there.     So I understood that to mean Mr Matona is saying this.     But I can come back to you, let me clarify and then I can [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Ja, ja, I will do that.     Yes.  Yes, Chairperson.     Chairperson, I maintain my position, which is I had no confidence in the CEO.  Can I just quickly just complete?     I completely support what you say because that is exactly what is minuted.  However, the full turnaround strategy had never been presented to the board.  In part it is saying there he had developed it and he was updating it.  The first time the full strategy gets presented to the board is at the next board meeting.  So the full strategy had not been presented to the board. So I am still sitting here, and I have given you my views.     Not everybody else’s, about that I had no confidence in the CEO.     Chairperson, my understanding of what Mr Matona was presenting that day was the CEO update, it was not the turnaround strategy.     Chairperson, I think I have explained myself, my perspective to you the last time.  The world I come from, a CEO earning R500 000 a month, comes in, does not look at all the problems of the past and starts immediately turning things around. The piece that Advocate Seleka read is one hundred percent correct, I referred to it the last I was here to say that he was in the process of it, he was developing it, which was – it does not take away – you may have a different view on it, but my position, where I was at, given that we were on a burning platform, we needed to move but I felt that we were not moving fast enough.     Yes.     That is what I am saying.     Then, Chairperson, my point last time round was to say that he did not have a completed strategy – did I say completed?     I said completed – said he was busy developing a strategy, that those were my words.     Those were my words.     So which you just read now, that is exactly what is in there as well.  But I think the question that I was asked was that he was stopped when the Minister came in.  He was busy giving us his CEO update at the time.     Which had to do with the development of the strategy.     Chairperson, all I can say to you is that we were running an operation of about – what did we call it?  R4 billion, with a buffer of 4 billion which was one month’s turnaround.  The Eskom numbers are huge.  It was costing us R30 million a day – sorry, an hour, to run that business.  There was a budget received of R20 million for running Dentons’ inquiry.   For you to ask me why we stopped it after seven weeks, I have given you the answer that I know.  If there was a different answer, maybe you need to bring different people to give that answer.  The only answer I know, which is the answer that was provided by audit and risk, was that what was coming out of Dentons was nothing new. And now, remember, I am not Chairperson of audit and risk but when we talk about 20 million for a company that does not have money and 18 million for suspended executives, Chairperson, we were running a business with a turnover of 340 billion.  These were huge numbers, so whilst in the context of the discussion today, it is big.  If you had looked at Eskom’s complete salary bill, for example, it was – numbers we spoke about was negligible.  I suppose what you are asking me, is do we feel that we wasted the money?  Maybe is that the point?     And I cannot add to anything you have said, Chairperson.     I did think that – I have been asked the question and I have given you the best answer I can give you.     I understand.     Chairperson, I was part of a board who had agreed the inquiry.  I was not part of audit and risk when it was stopped.  I have given you the only answer I have which was what I was told as a board member is that things that were coming out were not unfamiliar, which is why at a time that was the view.  But I do feel, Chairperson, that you would need to bring the people who made the decision to stop that.     To properly interrogate it, as I mean I cannot give you more.     And it may not be the answer that is being sought right now.     But I cannot say to you I stopped it and this is why because I do not have that answer.     Absolutely, Chairperson.  In fact I have included in my affidavit the findings.  Then, what happened to the findings is it was broken up by different divisions and how the board on a regular basis, thought audit and risk used to get feedback on how progress had happened in each of the areas identified.  I sit it under correction, but I think there were like 72 areas identified and each of those had to then go to different executives for plans to be put in place and that was tracked on a regular basis by the board.      That is correct Chairperson.     Correct, what the Board was working with was the recommendations out of the work that Dentons had prepared.     Chairperson the recommendations that came out of Dentons, to answer your question, was taken, broken up into different departments and that was then established as this is what the Board is going to track.   If that is considered to be nothing new that we need to ask the executives, I am a Board member, I get given something which I am told by my ARC colleagues who looks at this, and I do feel Chairperson that you need to get the Chairperson of ARC in here to ask these questions because I am answering this as a Board member who didn’t serve there at the time but to the best of my recollection this is the recommendations, I am told from ARC there was nothing new but these are the recommendations, the Board then wants to see that these recommendations are now on a monthly basis tracked and that we get through to conclusion on the outstanding matters, but for me to sit and say to you now there was nothing new but therefore the recommendations – I can’t respond to that Chairperson, I apologise.    I think this is not where, I was not on Audit Risk that you need to ask them.     No, no I can respond to that Chairperson.     But what it was and was it a duplication of before I think you would need to ask that of the people who were involved directly with that.     Chairperson I do not agree with that, the question that I am being asked is did the recommendations, were those recommendations if it was no, was it the same and I am saying to you I do not have the answer, we would need to go back to the people, number one, who wrote the letter to say stop this because there is nothing new here.     I don’t know what it was before.  What I know was that the recommendations that came out here was then tracked on a monthly basis.   It would be interesting, I mean if Counsel is asking me was it the same as before I would suggest bring in the Chairperson of ARC and let him give you the answer because I cannot.   I believe my fiduciary duty was fulfilled by here were recommendations, here was value for money according to me and this is how we track the progress.     Yes.     Chairperson with due respect my view I don’t believe that we invited Mr – look I can’t talk about the meetings he was invited to outside of the 11 t h, but on the 11 t h Mr Linnell came into that board meeting under false pretences, my view.  We were told that Nick Linnell had done work into the on-goings of Eskom for months before, which could help us with the suspension, which is – and Nick Linnell came to the 14.48 meeting, in that transcript you can hear me ask Mr Linnell questions like Mr Linnell you have told us, or we’ve been told, not you, we have been told at the earlier meeting Nick Linnell has been doing this work, he has got all the answers and he is going to help us with this investigation.  I asked Nick Linnell, I said please explain to me you know your role and how long you have been doing this and he gives me a hypothetical answer and I go as far as saying Mr Linnell please this is not hypothetical, we were told that you had been doing this for six months and you could provide us with a report.   Lots of toíng and froing and pushing and ultimately his aide memoire is accepted, so if you ask me Nick Linnell was brought into that meeting Chairperson, with due respect, under false pretences.     Chairperson I am saying my understanding was he is coming there to fill us in because he had done all this previous work which was going to help us with the inquiry.    Chairperson all I can say to you is that at Eskom there were very rigid rules about how to go about procurement, so if maybe after all of this we’re saying the entire Board should have been charges because of this, then I will accept that.   I however do maintain that if we knew who Nick Linnell was from the very beginning that he had done three days worth of work, not six months, because we were told six months worth of work, in fact I go a step further and you would pick that up in the transcript, I asked Mr Linnell the question, I said are you here today based on the fact that you knew that there was going to be a piece of work done or is there something that you have been a part of for a long time and that is when the Chairman says to me just Nick let’s just tell them as it is, because I think that was very hard for him as well. But if you are saying to me that I let – by listening to Mr Linnell we should accepted accountability and not just Mr Tsotsi, you know what then as a Board member ...[intervenes]     Then as a Board member Chair I will accept that.  I am talking for myself, I am not talking for other members.    I hear you Chairperson.     Yes I do Chairperson, but what I also remember is in – on the evening, I think you are reading from the 30 t h.      30 t h of March, when the charge is put to Mr Tsotsi, Mr Tsotsi said there was no contract with Nick Linnell, I think there are two things here Chairperson, there was no contract with Nick Linnell, what you are saying is by us letting him into the meeting we by definition contracted him.   I think that, I think they’re all saying the same thing.     Time that’s it, I can’t argue with that.     I think we’re saying the same thing now.     I think I heard him say, if I remember correctly you can help me, that it was leaked.     Yes I think that was what we were told.     I heard.     Very hard for me to comment, was it DPE, wasn’t it, I can just tell you as a Board member what was of concern to me on the charge, if you will.     On that charge, of the media statement.     Okay, here we are the Board, we are sitting and we’re discussing this whole thing about the inquiry which already is so contentious, and there were so many diverted views.  Do you suspend, don’t you suspend you know, do you need the inquiry, don’t you need the inquiry.  Nick Linnell drafts a memorandum or a media statement, which I think he attested to.     That something about is it Edward Nathan Sonnenberg I think was the group, or some group together with ...[intervenes]      Ja, together with a retired judge etcetera.   Here we’re sitting as a board member knowing how porous Eskom is, you talk about something in a Board meeting which affects people’s lives and five minutes later it is on the wire somewhere so that is why I think there was an issue of bugs etcetera. Now that communication, to the best of my knowledge never came to the Board, and I think that is what infuriated, personally me, I can’t talk about anybody else.  How is it that something that is this prescriptive gets into the media domain and the Board hasn’t signed this thing off, at a time when we are going through all the volatility within Eskom that we are.   So I mean, I talk for myself now, that is actually, that was for me very, very upsetting to read about that in the media.    Chairperson I can only answer you this way, none of us had it, if it was a DPE like Mr Baloyi said yesterday I don’t know about that.  So for me as an individual, and I am not talking for anybody else, you will have to ask them, this was in the hands of the Chairperson and in fact if I remember correctly I even,  I said in my last testimony here that the person in the Chairperson’s office, Leo Dlamini, I think had a copy of it.   So somehow it got out, so who leaked it I don’t know.  The fact that it was in the public domain and the fact that it was in the Chairperson’s hands is I think what infuriated me as a person.   You may not agree with me, but that’s my ...[intervenes]      And Chairperson I want you to please give me the copy that I approved where we spoke about a retired judge, where we spoke about the stuff Nick Linnell put in, because those were not things that were ever put in front of me at P&G.  There may be more than one version of it, but what was discussed at P&G did not have the retired judge, it did not have – there were a couple of factual problems with it, so Chairperson if you can give that to me I would be very happy.     That is what I am saying Chairperson.    I cannot answer that for you Chairperson, that is something only he can answer.     Chairperson, possible not.     But I think it is important to note that the very document that Nick Linnell, the media statement Nick Linnell put together or helped to craft, is the one that found its way into the press, not what was discussed with the board.     And I think that may be... your question about, what did he stand to benefit?     I do not know.  If one is to assume that Mr Tsotsi was taking instructions, maybe Mr Tsotsi was under pressure to get exactly what he was instructed to do, out there.  I do not know.  I cannot respond.     I hear you Chairperson.     I am giving you my perspective.     But I do hear you.     Yes.     Yes.     It is the second day Chairperson.     It is the second day.     [laughing]     Yes.     Ja-no, I understand.       [laughing]     Pamensky.     Chairperson, I know we are mindful of time.  I am not sure what is the question.  I mean, what is ...[intervenes]      What is five years later?     Chairperson, I am not even sure how to answer that question.       Chairperson, all I can say to you is.  I cannot answer that.     I mean really.     If you are asking me, why did I not say it that night?     Okay.  Chairperson, I am not sure that I...  I want to disagree with that.     The very purpose of the charge was that what was agreed with us was not what was in the media.     So to say that why I am raising it five years later.  The very charge was it was a different...     Chairperson, where I am struggling here.     It is... that was the actual charge.     The charge is, it was a different thing.  What was I going to add on ...[intervenes]      ...if that was the actual charge?  The charge is ...[intervenes]      ...that this is not the statement.  So not raising it at another time, I am not sure what benefit that would have been.     H’m.     Chairperson, the way I understood it was.  That was the charge that it was leaked.  Now if it was exactly the same, why is the fact that it was leaked such a big issue?  I mean, I do not, unfortunately, have the benefit of having that minute in front of me.     Because Mr Tsotsi’s minute... actually, can you just give me that?  Because he responds to that.       Maybe it is just interest... can we just read what Mr Tsotsi’s response...     Where is it?     Ja?     Yes, just give me some time.  Please, Mr Chair.     Just hang on.     Is it 341(?)?...[intervenes]      Chairperson, can I in the interest of time?     Can I ...[intervenes]      Can I help the Commission?     If your view is that I have done something wrong here, then let me take the punishment.       No, no, no.  I know what you are saying.     Sorry, Chairperson.     I say, if your view is that I have done something wrong, then let me take the responsibility for that.     No, it is when ...[intervenes]  ADV SELEKA     H’m.     Sure.     Chairperson, maybe just one comment from my side and I know we are pushing time.     You know everything that you have said now is probable.  You know, like you say, if you take it all into account and you have had the benefit of looking at all of the affidavits.  But when the board was replaced, surely that would have been a good time if the idea was to get rid of Mr Tsotsi, and I am not talking about suspensions and this.     But in terms of the bigger plan.     If it was that.       You know, because the board was only appointed in December.     Ja, 2014.     But... anyway... but look, that is not my job.  I am not here to ask questions.  Sorry.  I am not here to ask questions.   But I mean, based on what you have just said.  I... that is all I could think, you know, if it was part of a bigger scheme, rather than going through all of the pain of doing all of this.   I mean, that would have been probably... if I were the one pulling the strings, first...  But Chairperson, I cannot respond to that.     Mister?  Sorry?     Matona.     I know.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m?     Thank you, Chair.     [laughing]     Please.     Can we not find ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, can we not try to finish now, please?  I am becoming a permanent feature here.  I prefer not to.     I am feeling I am becoming a permanent feature here.  I prefer to get this done.     Let me see on my phone and I will quickly tell you Chair.       Just a minute.     [laughing]     Not my first choice Chairperson but thank you very much.     It does not look like that I have got too much of choice.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God? 
ADV MAHON:  Thank you Chairperson.  Advocate Mahon representing Ms Klein instructed by Adams and Adams.     I beg your pardon, Chairperson.     I am unfortunately involved in an arbitration that is running the whole of next week.     [No audible reply]      I think so Chair.  My preference then would be the afternoon because ...[intervenes]      ...then we have no risk of any ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Yes, thank you Chair. 
KLEIN: I was part of People In Governance Chairperson but I was not chairing People In Governance.   That is exactly the same impression Chairperson.   Because when I read the transcript …[intervenes] 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
VENETE KLEIN:  (s.u.o.) 
MR KLEIN:  That is what I had attached to my affidavit, was to say these were the findings and on a monthly basis Audit & Risk used to sit on a monthly basis or six weekly to say now executives give us feedback on each of these, but to reconcile that point back to – these are things that was known before, I cannot respond to that, because I don’t know what was before, I am talking about the recommendations that went out and that those were tracked, by the time I left Eskom I know that there were only two matters that had come out of the recommendations that were I think still open.
