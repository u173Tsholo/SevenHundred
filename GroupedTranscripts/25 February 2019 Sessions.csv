CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody, good morning Mr Mabuza.    Thank you.    Morning.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Well I see that you might not be the only one affected by that.  Yes, no, that is fine.  If he will be able to continue.    If he has that then we can continue.   And was that in Exhibit U5?    U1?    Yes.    Yes.    What page does it begin on?    Well Exhibit U1 for me goes up to 396 the page so it must be U2?    Well I have got that one which is marked Exhibit U1.    Then I have another file written Volume U, File 1 of and I think that one which we marked U1 was originally written like this as well.    So it may be that it is this one.    That has been updated and not the one that I was using on Friday.   So let me see.  Ja I am told that this is the one but whatever has been added on this one – whatever has been added on this one should actually be put there.    So that – because that is the one that I am using.    But for now I will use this one.    But we will call it U1 because that is where it should be.    Ja. Ja.    Okay.    Well…    I – when you say J I thought you were talking about what we have been referring to as dividers and I was looking for a divider marked J and there is not one marked that so it must be something else you meant.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay so in this new file that is updated the annexures will be J up to what or is it just J?    Oh okay, no that is fine.    A divider or something.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do not have anything here.      Where should that go?  You wanted us to put that at 397?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is fine thank you.  So do we start with Exhibit U5 or we started with?    Okay.    Thank you.    No of U5.    U5    Ja that blue file go to page 27 on the right hand corner – right hand corner.  Okay, alright.      Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well before you say – you proceed I am sure Mr Maleka will pick that at some stage and you will deal with them but in the unlikely event that he forgets and I forget please feel free to say there is still this matter that you would like to really dealwith thoroughly and then we can make sure.  But it is highly unlikely that Mr Maleka will not remember that.    Or maybe I should say the way I understand what you said a fewminutes ago.  What you want to deal with might go beyond just the trip to Dubai?    Ja.  So Mr Maleka will see at what stage he would like you to deal with that.  But all that which you believe will give us a full picture you will get a chance to deal with and Mr Maleka can guide you at what stage.  He might say this is the time or he might say later on.  I just wanted to emphasise that.  I think from what you have said what you want to say goes beyond – seems to go beyond the trip.    Ja okay.  It is okay.    Of course for what it is worth you confirm that that at that time you were not involved at Eskom but this is based on the documentation that after your – the board of which you are part began to be involved at Eskom you looked and you found?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, ja.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes, yes.    Yes.   Ys.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No thank you, thank you.  Mr Maleka.   I am sorry Mr Maleka there is a green file here I do not know if that isthe one you are talking about or you talking about U5 or you talking about the U1 that has been supplemented?    Okay.  What page on U1?    Have you got Mr – U1 Mr Mabuza?  If you want to see whether it is U1 look at the outside on the spine. You have got it?    Okay, alright.      Again just remind me the page again Mr Maleka?    453, okay.    Ja I have got both.    Ms Tsulu Molefe?    Ja.    Maybe for the sake of completeness you can confirm Mr Mabuza that on the face of the document Mr Van Zyl seems to have signed it on the 4 July 2014 and Ms T Molefe on the 7 July 2014.    Yes thank you.    So it was the document seems to have been about a year old by the time it was sent to by Mr Koko to whoever?    Okay.    Well maybe before we, we, we leave this document you, you have said that in sending this document to the person to, to whom Mr Koko sent it he did or may have intended to show them what opportunities were there and I take it that youmean business opportunities.  Now maybe you, you should say, say something to substantiate that statement if you also agree to the question that Mr Maleka has put to you namely that it is a document that deals with cost containment.  So on the face of it, it may, it might not sound like you say, if it is a document that deals with cost containment it might not sound like it is a document that deals with business opportunities for people but having gone through the document you might be able to say no we say it does, because A, B, C, D.    Oh.    Yes, I am happy if you, if you say you can deal with that later when you give the whole context.  I am quite happy.  I just do not want us to leave your statement as it is, the two statements as they are.  If later on you are going to deal with that I have no problem.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Ja that is fine, ja.    You may, ja.        Well it is a very legitimate [laughing] question Mr Maleka, but it is, it is, it is, it is a question that probably simply depends on ones analysis of what happened and why certain things may have happened or why certain things may not have happened and maybe different people might have different analysis.    And conclusions, but one can understand a person who might have not so noble objectives saying to those with whom they might be working on those not so noble objectives.  We have got to try and appear to be as noble as possible in whatever we do.  If there are rules to be complied with we must try and comply with them, because if there is, if we do not comply maybe that we will attract attention that we do not want to be attracted to what we are doing, but one can also imagine that sometimes rules stand in the way of what people want to do and then at a certain stagesometime people say forget about the rules and they proceed.  What it was here I do not know.    But it probably depends on, on an analysis and what view one takes.  So.    Ja, okay.  Thank you.    And when the document ...(intervention)     It was 2014.    Right, right.   Well the first one where it’s one which is settled appears to be a commercial process needs to be followed to select the firm, I don’t know whether in, whether that’s (indistinct) or in McKinsey something, we’re all trying and then what appears to follow there if you have struggle reading it Mr Mabuza and the notes seems to say I don’t believe we should be paying McKinsey to meet their FD plus L commitment, then that’s the one, the second bullet point, this appointment is subject to new Treasury requirements relating to consultants.     And bullet point 3 I support the continuation of the Top EngineersProgram, ja that’s – well there’s somewhere immediately after M Chokolo’s signature there, next to the one that is encircled, there is somebody has written “we need to ...” I’m not sure what that word is “...for a further ten six something”.  Ja, I’ve done, I’ve been able to read substantially but not 100%.      Well there seems to be at least to my eyes three signatures, one for the top left comment with one which is then settled, which I read to be a commercial process needs to be followed to select the firm and then there seems to be a signature below that.    And then there is the other one that I couldn’t read to very well, there seems to be a signature that is on the right hand side of that one, and then there is the one at the bottom where it says note, the signature at the bottom of that notation appears to be different from the two that are above.   Yes, yes.    Yes the one at the – the one that you said seems to be Mr Lennon’s one, is it the one right at the bottom?    Oh ja I see if I look at column S it ...(intervention)     Yes ja, okay.   Oh okay.    Oh okay.    Yes, I think what you say fulfilled seems to be followed, “needs to be followed”.    Or maybe a further.    Ja, I don’t know the rest.    Yes, it’s okay.    I’m sorry Mr Maleka I thought I am on the same page as both of you, I thought you were talking when you talk about a submission document we are talking about the document at page 485 of U1?    But did you just say that and Mr Mabuza agreed that it seems to predate the document signed by the Executives that we have looked at?    But that date on page 485 that document says review date July 15.    Well I just want to make sure I am on the same page as the two of you..  Mr Maleka put a question to you which I understood to be this document at page 485 predated, or predates, predated the document we looked at that was signed by theExecutives and my question is if it’s dated 2015 how can it be a predated document signed in 2014.      Yes.    Yes I see that, 24 Feb 2014.    Now I understand, thank you very much.    Now I understand, I think what was confusing me is the date at 485, and I hadn’t seen the one on 490, it appeared to be a different document when I looked at it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay thank you Mr Mabuza.    Yes.    Yes.   8 August 2015?    Before we proceed.  It may be that a member of the legal team for Mr Mabuza is quite happy with the way the evidence goes but I would like her not to be nodding towards – in his direction while Mr Mabuza is giving evidence otherwise thatmay be misconstrued as indicating whether Mr Mabuza is giving evidence in the right direction.  So she might be completely unconscious of what – what impression it might give I am sure she did not intend that but I think she might just have to listen to the evidence without showing any indications of anything.  Okay thank you.    Just say something?    Yes, okay alright.  Mr Ngcukaitobi.    Yes, yes.  Yes no thank you Mr Ngcukaitobi.    Thank you.  Thank you.  YeS.    Ja you may proceed ja.    Yes.    At this point as in 2015?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    Well …    Well if you are able to say, say but if you are not able you do not need to say.    Ja, okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Thank you.    Okay that is fine.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay we – Mr Maleka.    You quite happy?  Let us do that Mr Mabuza.    Yes.    Okay.      Okay let us see how we are going to deal with it.  There are two ways of dealing with it.  One is you say what you are able to say without the benefit of the notes you are looking for and then after the tea break add whatever you want to add after having been helped in regard to your notes by your legal team.  Another way of doing it is to postpone it to after the tea break and you say everything after the tea break.    Which one do you…    Oh okay alright.   Of Exhibit U1?    Wait, the bundle that has got your statement?    Oh the blue bundle?    Okay alright what is the page?   Thank you.    Oh I am sorry.  The blue bundle does not appear to have page 447.    But you are holding the blue bundle – have you got the page right?    Oh.    Okay one sec – one second.  That must be U1.    Ja. 447 okay alright.  Ja you may proceed.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    The previous page?    Yes.    Yes.  @eskom – the Eskom …    2016?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.    Yes.    Now you, conclude that in part because the email address used in the document at page 446 that you have, from which you have just read uses the same email address that to which Mr Koko had sent a number of emails that is infoportal1@zoho.com.    That is that is that is, you say is the same email address?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    I think Mr Maleka is asking you whether you know what Mr Koko’s version as to who, to whom that email address belongs.    Or who uses that email address.  So in other words you have put your conclusion to say your conclusion is that it is an email address belonging to Mr Essa and, but Mr Maleka is saying Mr Koko has a certain version.  Are you aware of that version?  That is the question.    Hm.    Yes.  Okay.  We still had about seven minutes on my watch.  I do not know whether you deliberately would prefer that we take the adjournment now?    Ja.    Yes, until what [intervenes].    On EXHIBIT U1?    498?    Load shedding, load shedding, load shedding incidents.    I, I, I.   I am sorry I interrupted you, but I have noticed that like me despite the assistance that we get from specs sometimes we do not see every word.  So I was helping you there to say, it says load shedding.  Maybe you can start that sentence from the beginning.    Hm.    Well just for what it is worth it is, it is of concern that one does remember, because it is public knowledge that when there was load shedding I think in 08 I think the government at the time admitted that the, it had warned about I think eight years earlier by Eskom management that, if I remember correctly it has been a long time.  That certain steps needed to be taken to avoid what ultimately happened into [indistinct] namely the load shedding and the Government at the time as far as I can recall admitted that the mistakes were on their part.  They did not follow the adviceor warning that had been given by Eskom management and if I am correct to say even then the cause related to maintenance.  It is of concern that so many years later the, part of the cause at least may still well be maintenance.  So I just mention because we, we all ought to learn from you know the past.  So I just mention that, because you just mentioned that part of, of, of, of load shedding comes from issues of maintenance and then you mentioned the skills as well.    Thank you.    Ja.    Ja, okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.  No that is fine.    I think we should take the tea adjournment.    Yes.  Let us take the short adjournment and we will resume at twenty to twelve.    We adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius?    Good morning.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay, okay.  Thank you very much Mr Pretorius, thank you.  Before we resume Mr Maleka I just want to say something unconnected with the currentevidence, previously I expressed concern that certain sections of the media were publishing witness statements that had been filed with the Commission before the witnesses concerned could give evidence and I drew everyone’s attention to the relevant provisions of the regulations which required that the Chairperson’s permission be obtained if it was sought to publish such statements before and subsequently meetings, a meeting or meetings occurred between representatives of the Commission and SANEF and I indicated that the reports I had received of that meeting indicated that all parties had engaged very constructively in regard to the matter.I – there is in today’s Business Day an article relating to Mr Sean Abrahams’ affidavit which was filed with the Commission some time back, and Mr Abrahams has ofcourse not given evidence before the Commission.  I raise this not to say the publication of that article is in breach of the regulations, because it is not, I raise this to indicate to everybody who may see that article and remember what I have said before and what the regulations say, to say that the publication of that article has happened after my approval was sought and I granted it in the circumstances of Mr Abraham’s affidavit and Mr Abrahams I had been assured also wished or was consenting to publication.  So I just mention this so that nobody might think that that article is in breach of the regulations and goes against what we have said, but actually to say proper processes have been followed in relation to the publication of that article and I commend the conduct of all concerned who have made sure that when they sought to public an article in the circumstances and they followed the law.Thank you very much, that is what I wanted to place on record so that there can be no misunderstandings about that article.  Thank you, Mr Maleka you may proceed but before you proceed I think I want to bring something to your attention that escaped both your and my attention onFriday, that is that we had spoken around maybe Wednesday last week that on Friday morning I think I would be giving feedback in regard to the question whether the Commission’s legal team was going to do anything in regard to the application for leave to cross-examine that we dealt with last week, and I think there was the legal team of the witness concerned, I can’t remember now who we were dealing with, they had intimated something which escaped our minds, so I mention it so that maybe sometime today or tomorrow I could have the report back of where we are in regard to that matter.    Yes okay no that’s fine.   Yes we are aiming to do that as previously discussed, hopefully we will have finished Mr Mabuza’s evidence.    Yes, yes I hope he will be fine with that as well.  Mr Mabuza if we have to use the lunch break are you happy with that, in order to finish?    Okay thank you.    What page at U5?    Okay thank you, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA   Yes, you previously wanted to go to page 28 of U5, I’m just wonder whether whatever you are looking for is where it is.    Okay.    521 in Exhibit U1 and then on U5 must I be at page 28 which is where I am.    Yes, yes.    Well you didn’t suggest I do that in regard to the other emails, but I did it, so I have been doing it for all the other emails that we have dealt with in thisparticular document from page 27 when we’re dealing with these emails so I have been cross-referencing to Exhibit U1, ja okay.    Yes.    Of Exhibit U1?   Did you say 399 or 311?    Yes.    Yes.   I am sorry.  I am at Exhibit U1 page 399.  Is that where you are as well where you are – it looks like you are seeing something I am not seeing on that page?I am sorry.  I am at Exhibit U1 page 399.  Is that where you are as well where you are – it looks like you are seeing something I am not seeing on that page?    Yes I want to go there.    Oh okay, alright, thank you.    Just before you do so.  If there was a point you wanted to say make sure you do not forget it.    Ja, okay, alright, thank you.  Mr Maleka.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well there is one who is dismissed.  There is one who is appointed is it not on the same day?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    That is true but I think it is important to make the point that he has just made.  I think that is important.  Ja okay.    Oh maybe after the question.    Maybe that question is – was going to go to the same question that I wanted to put.  Mr Mabuza in the light of the addressee of that last email to which you have referred.  In the light of the identity of the addressee do you have anything to say about that addressee and the date of 9 December 2015?   Ja, yes.    Ja.    Okay.  Okay no that is fine.  Mr Maleka.    Yes and, and you have covered the point that I said you must not forget.   Oh, okay.    No that is fine.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.   That is the email on what page again?    Thank you.    Hm.    From Eric Wood to.    Huh-uh.   That is now on page 434?    Okay.    Ja.   Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Treasury of, of Eskom?    Ja, okay.    Thank you.    I am sorry SN29 is on what page, on U1?    Ja, I have noted that and then on N.    Okay.    Yes, I have got it.    Ja.    I, I am sorry.    I am sorry.  Let us be on the same page first.  The page 36 that I am looking at is in U5.  Is that the same one you are talking about?    You said if we look at page 36.    So I am just checking whether that is U5.    It does not have.   That is why I am wondering whether we are on the same page.    Oh.    Oh.    The, the.    The blue file.  I know you said you have two blue files there.    The one that had the emails from Koko that, Mr Koko that you have [intervenes].    Hm.    Ja, Mr Maleka referred you to page 35 because he said that is where you find charge, I think four.    Charge four against Mr Koko.    35.  Page 35 at the top right hand corner.    Okay.    Ja, can somebody assist him?    We are looking for U5, page 35.    Ja.    I think, I think the problem is that you have got more than one.    U5.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.   Yes.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    A further suspension?    Ja.   Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, hm.    Okay.    Yes.    So the, so the amount that related to Dr Ngubane and SABC and him being represented by a certain law firm that Ms Daniels approved be paid by Eskom was over R1 million.    If you put or not really [intervenes].    [Intervenes].    Ja, ja, ja.  Okay, thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Well maybe I should say the question is intended for you to offer what you think is the explanation if you have it, but if you don’t have it you don’t have it, so but you have had occasion to look at these emails and you therefore may have a result of – a conclusion you have made based on analysing the situation.    So you’re saying decisions that relate to Eskom in regard to these matters were now being taken by people outside of Eskom and certain people within Eskom were simply required to execute those decisions?    Okay, thank you.     Ja, GMT+02   Yes.    I’m sorry Mr Mabuza, you might have a reason but not to read the full email address for Mr Khoza but maybe we should, it says khozazw@telkom is that the one you are reading.      That’s the email address, the email is marked of high importance and sensitivity, confidential.    Or less than 5%.   So by this time he has been forwarded the draft statement by the Chairperson of  - the then Chairperson of Eskom and he is responding and saying what you have just read, is that right?  Or am I misunderstanding something?    Maybe Mr Maleka will help, or not yet Mr Maleka?    Okay.    And she must just add that line, that the so-called big four are supplying 80% of Eskom coal and Tegeta supplies less than 5%.  As I understand it he is asking Ms Daniel to add that line in the statement.    Okay, alright.    Yes okay.    Well in the meantime I see that in the – on page 541, the paragraphs are not numbered but in paragraph number four the last sentence captures what the Businessman said to Ms Daniel she must add with regard to this big four providing approximately 80% of Eskom’s coal while Tegeta supplies less than 5%, so it seems that that was captured.      You see that Mr Mabuza?   Thank you.    Okay, yes?    I was trying to go back to the statement Mr Mabuza because I had moved away from ...(intervention)     541, thank you.  Now I do think that what we have read is important.    Yes, yes.    I see that on page 542 paragraph 3 I said the paragraphs are not numbered but paragraph 3 from the top the statement says? “Eskom rejects any insinuation of favouritism towards suppliers such as Tegeta who are willing to step in to avert the coal supply crises and allow Eskom to meet the winder demand.” So he is saying that they reject that t here was any favouritism towards (indistinct).    Ja that’s what the statement says.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.   I just want to say Mr Mabuza that although we said we are going to finish at two o’clock I don’t want us to leave out, I don’t want you to leave out somethingthat you consider important to say, so – but there may be things where you think you have dealt with sufficiently in the statement you don’t want to add but if there is something that you consider important to say do feel free to do so.    Okay do not rush too much I will give you enough time.    Just listen to Mr Maleka’s question and when he is done I will give you enough time to…    Look at what you wish to look at.    Yes. I would like that ja.    Thank you ja.    Maybe to the – maybe we may as – I may as well mention this.  There has been reference to one or two applications that are presently pending.    In one or other high courts that Eskom has brought or has lodged inrelation to one or two matters.  I think one of them might be McKinsey.    Or Trillian or both.  It may be helpful even if there has been no decision to look at the affidavits.  Obviously they are public documents.  It may be helpful to look at the affidavits there and see to what extent the information that is there may assist in terms of what we have as well.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay ja then …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    No, no that is fine.    Ja no if it is so much paperwork as long as you have indicated that you as the legal team are applying or have applied your minds to the affidavits or some of the affidavits as long as you will have looked at them you will be able to identify those that you might think I should see.    Ja.   Yes also ja.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay thank you.      Ja.    Okay maybe we – you might need five minutes to do so.     Ja okay.  I will adjourn for a few minutes or maybe let us say – ja I will adjourn for a few minutes and somebody will indicate to us once you are done but it will not be later than five past one.    Okay we adjourn.    Oh yes five past two.   MEETING ADJOURNS MEETING RESUMES    Yes Mr Maleka.    Yes.   Yes Mr Mabuza.    Well maybe whether you can sleep well depends on what is happening with law enforcement agencies.    Yes.    No thank you very much Mr Mabuza.  I am sure that the – I mean the some of those names are already well known to the legal team and to the commission in terms of what has been placed before the commission but I have no doubt that the names will be given to the legal team.  But thank you for coming to give evidence in regard to Eskom as Chairperson of the board of Eskom that started in January last year and thank you for indicating your commitment to come back should the commission askyou to come back.  I have no doubt that other people within Eskom in the leadership of Eskom will also be sharing that commitment to come and give evidence before this commission in regard to matters that fall within their knowledge.  Thank you very much you are excused.    Thank you.    Thank you very much.  Yes Mr Maleka.    Ys.   Yes, yes no that is fine.  We will adjourn for today and then we will resume tomorrow.  Tomorrow will it be fine if we resume normal time or should we resume early – should we start earlier.  Now maybe Ms Hofmeyr might be able to assist there.  You know that we do not want to lose any time but…    But I know – I see that we have actually made sure we have got the nine to ten hour and now we have got the one to two hour which caters for the two to four time that we will not be sitting.  But tomorrow how is the situation?    yeS.    Ja.   Hours ja.    Okay, okay no that is fine, that is fine.    We will then adjourn until tomorrow at ten o’clock.  The commission adjourns. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   Good morning Chair.    Good morning Advocate.    I confirm that I am still under oath yes.    Page 27 of my statement.    Page 27 being of my – being my statement?    On it.    Yes I am.    Yup.     Correct.    Correct.    Yup.    Mr Chairman sometime in the course of today we really would like to return to this whole issue of the suspended...    Executives hopeful also paint the context for capture.    Between the period of March 2015.    To December 2015.    Including Mr Koko’s Dubai trips.    We also want to give an example to show howextensive this capture was.    And then go into a little bit more on additional inputs.    On the disciplinary matters of Mr Singh and Ms Daniels.      And hopefully at the end we could close with any lingering issues around this Optimum and Tegeta Coal Mine.    Now it would be remembered…    Thank you, thank you Chairman.    Ja we may do that but and I am happy to…    That is correct.    Correct.    So in answering the question from Mr Maleka about the 20 July I think it has got to be remembered that in March 2015 Eskom was go – we were in the midst of big load shedding at the time.  It has to be remembered that it was in March when four senior executives were suspended from Eskom.  The four senior executives that were suspended at the time was the acting chief executive Mr Matona, the CFO Ms Molefe as in Tsholo Molefe, the head of commercial Mr DanMarokane and the head of generation Mr Matshela Koko.  Those were the people that were suspended around the 15 March.  As we go through the details we will demonstrate other developments around that period but we will remember that really in the midst of the problems that were facing the utility to suspend these four executives was quite profound.  Once they were suspended that also created the possibility for other executives to be brought into Eskom i.e. the chief executive, acting chief executive as in Mr Brian Molefe, the acting CFO as Mr Anoj Singh.  But to the question on the 20 July.  The 20 July is significant in the sense that of the four executives that were suspended the one executive that was returned on the day – the day he was returned to the 20 July is Mr Matshels Koko.  It was on this day when he was returned. So let me just track back.  Between March and July it is around the same period that whilst these executives were suspended the Denton was appointed to do investigations before they could even bring their report certain actions were already being taken by the board.  But the emails that we are going to be referring to will show the amount of activity between Ms Daniels office moving from one office to Mr Matshela’s office, from Mr Matshels’s office to the chairman’s office and how the co-ordination of the work between the chairman’s office as per Ms Daniels, the Mr Essa outside in the Gupta’s and how this got orchestrated.  So Mr Matshela Koko was brought on the 20 July back.  It is significant Chair that on that day in the emails that I referred the commission to earlier that very day he was referred.  His activities on his email which is what we referred to on point 15.1 all the way up until 15.4 it was on that day.  We at Eskom hold the view that having been suspended with the four, being head of generation should have been suspended.  These were about generation.  Mr Matshela Koko was brought in and he had to demonstrate his capability and his allegiance to the capturers what he can do.  So as we go down I will demonstrate that.  So the significance of the date ofthe 20 July was when Mr Matshela Koko got back.      That is correct Chair.  These – all these that I am talking to happens before I arrive but these are in one – some of the public statements.    Mr Matshela Koko’s and Mr Anoj Singh’s presentation to Parliament.    The Public Protector material.    Some of the disciplinary hearings.    That was started and completed in as far as Ms Daniel is concerned.    The disciplinary charges that were placed in front of Mr Anoj Singh who resigned before he could be brought to a disciplinary hearing.    The disciplinary charges that were placed to – in front of Mr Matshela Koko after he was re-instated by the labour court.    So this is material.    That is in Eskom.      Admittedly Chair as we will at the end of this be proposing and strongly recommending to the commission.    That these individuals.    Be brought to the commission.    To answer for this.     But also confirm that these are part of the charges.    In the criminal processes that we have laid.    With the – working with the SIU and the Hawks.    And also to confirm that – to the extent there are several claims that arise out of these.  This body of evidence …    Will be presented there.    To also confirm that these emails.    Come out of a server of Mr Matshela Koko’s email.    Which we had to go to court to obtain his laptop.    To access this information.    So these are based on information and lastly some of the carte blanche we will refer to the carte blanche interview.    Where certain of these accusations were place in front of Mr Matshela Koko.    He denied them.    Once they placed some of these – the contracts that he has personally signed relating to the guarantees on Tegeta and Optimum.    So this is where this information comes from and we as – at Eskom have no doubt in our minds that it would lead.    The commission somewhere on its path to find – to get to the bottom of these if these individuals were to be called and have to answer to these questions.    Yup.    Yes this one.    Yup got the same.    Correct Chair.    This email is the email from Matshela Koko,   The attachment that email begins at page 454 and you will see that it begins with a title, what is the title of that attachment?    The – this attachment is an Eskom document.     Molefe, Ms Tsholofelo Molefe Judge, yes Chairman.    That is correct.    I confirm those dates Chair.    This …    That is correct Chair.    What is – what is on that page 26 it starts to explain that this document is a response from National Treasury directing various public entities on how to contain their costs.  So this is what is then attached as a document tothe businessman to indicate this is what will be going out.  What is – the pattern that we are picking up here is on this day the 20 July on returning to office Mr Matshela Koko sends this material this being one example of it to Mr Essa to demonstrate to Mr Essa what business opportunity – opportunities exist in Eskom.  As we will demonstrate at the end of this this is where certain work was then given to McKinsey.  This is how Trillian that did not exist by this time was inserted to offer the business opportunity.  So this is how it starts that I am here now.  This is what I can, I can give you.  You have demonstrated your power to me as we will show earlier that in that meeting of early in March where Ms Daniels was in a meeting with Mr Essa where it was, she was told at that meeting to her surprise as we heard in Parliament that these four Executives aregoing to be suspended.  She was told before it happened and she was kind of taken aback and she said in Parliament that how does an outsider get to know this detail and true that happened.  These Executives were suspended.  The one that was returned was Matshela Koko.  On his return this was the start, this, this cost containment directives demonstrate that this is what we are assigned to do.  In doing this there is clearly some opportunities.  Can you act, activate from here?    Control of disclosure means this is a document that cannot be widely or publically to third parties be distributed to.    It is a classified document.  It is a, it is an internal document for specific use by certain prescribed officers in an, in the organisation.   I do confirm Chairman.    Yes Chairman as I said once I am allowed to go into the context and then put the emails into context.    But suffice to say.    Chairman yes I will deal with it later on, but I may for now so that I do not leave this in anyway hanging, to say as it would become clear as to how McKinsey was appointed, how a company that did not exist, Trillian, was put in place to be the so called BEE partner of McKinsey and what his role was in that area following this cost containment directives.    As.    Spoken earlier about.    Some of the consultants.    And the engineers.    These were all and these were not the ones.  We will also link and demonstrate this as to the business opportunities of even not only acquisition of Tegeta, companies and also how they then went on to procure and, and, and, and supply coal to, to, to, to Eskom.    Yes.   I am, I am, I am happy with that Chairperson.    Ja.    I, I, I have got, I have got that Chairman.    This document is from Matshela Koko from email    That is correct Chair.    I have got to that Chair.    The heading of this attachment is “Approval Conditions Agreed between the Acting CFO and the Acting Group Executive GCT and on Friday 26 June 2015 Top Ingenious Development Program”.    The Acting CFO at this point is Mr Anoj Singh.    The Acting GE at the time is Mr Matshela,Mabelane.    Edwin Mabelane.    He later got subjected to a disciplinary hearing.  When we, we arrived he was on suspicion on a, on a, on a disciplinary hearing.    But he was not one of the four who were suspended in, in, in March.    Well once more Chair to, the context continues to be about the state on the operation side on, of the, the generation which as I indicated this time there was load shedding and back to the point that was arrived at then that one of the thing that is missing are skilled Engineers in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the business, but this document seeks to say we need to develop a strategy of attracting but retaining Top Engineers so that once you have, you are done you still have those skills local, localised and contained in the organisation.    This budget contemplate to the, the acquisition and the, the, the, the appointment of retention of these Engineers and the project work they will have to be doing in, in that, in, in, in, in the engineering work.    No, I, I, I, I have not seen it myself.    It is Business Productivity Program.  BPP stands for Business Productivity Program.    This is meant a program that would facilitate operational planning session’s development and a structure of this.  It is to ensure that the business is productive.  It is, it is a productivity program of the business.    That is correct.    Correct.    Chair what should not be lost in this is firstly the point we have made earlier that these were classified documents.  These are notdocuments in the hands of an external party.  These are the documents now, now the documents should not have left Eskom.  This has now left Eskom.  It is in the hands of the external party.  It now tells the external party having told the external party this is the opportunity, but please when you quote for this job please adhere to the following instruction, the following guidelines, because we cannot do it outside of this but just bear that in mind.  So that when you respond because following from this there will be a, either a call for tenders through a request for, for, for, for proposals or the company as in this particular instance which led to the appointment of McKinsey a company then takes a decision that we can have a sole sourcing decision which in this particular instance that is where it finally ended.  So there is a problem here.  There is a, theproblem is now known as load shedding.  We have got issues on Engineers.  We need to get Engineers, but when we get them they must be within a strategy that it is not the usual consultants work, come in, stay forever.  They must come in, leave, leave us with the capability.  When they do finally quote this is how they should quote.  This is the budget they will be working towards.  These are the prices they will have to quoting within.  We then will make a decision that we are going to open or we are going to close sourcing.  We made the decision making to close sourcing and that that is out, this external party goes outside and say hey, I have got opportunities at Eskom.  You want to take this opportunity?  This opportunity is so much.  Are you okay with that?  Says okay, but hey you need me as a partner.  Me as a partner will be Trillian, but I do not exist.  I will create myself.  Then we will together go in there.  Are you okay to go?  This is, is, is what this whole scheming finally led, led us to the McKinsey and the Trillian.    Ja, ja I guess I have got to also just try and get my own answers to be in line with how in my own head I was aligning these, therepresentations.  I, I, I referred to last, on Friday that people have authority and the Chairman worked with me they have authority to take decisions.  They have no authority to illegal and wrong things.  So here we will comply.  We will comply in that at a point in time we will decide to call for tenders if we have decided it is going to be a public tender, but if we also decided that it would be sole sourcing we would have complied.  So in this particular instance we have now created the, somewhere our, our, our, our theory is that the problem was created also.  Created the problem now here is the solution for the problem that we created.  To get the solution here is the service provider that we want to get to.  Once we get to go to Treasury guidelines, Treasury guidelines say you must do this, you must do this within this budget.  You must follow this process.  Yes, we will followed the process, but at the end of the day we decide whether it is going to be open or not open.  Indeed even if it was open we can still decide who then gets to be allocated the, the, the task. So they have complied in as far as they have, they will do it within the budget of a, of a, of a, set by, by, by National Treasury, but they will also because they have got the authority to decide whether to goon single sourcing or open tender.  In this regard as we know they have opted to go for single sourcing.    But maybe Chairman it is, it should not be difficult to understand why people do not comply knowing that they should comply when their intention was.    Not to comply.   No, their intention was never to comply.  Their intention was to create business opportunities for specific people for a specific reason.    As, as I indicated on Friday Chair that this particular email seemed to have been a resent of the same email from Mr Matshela Koko to infoportal1@zoho.com.    The same.    That is correct, yes.    It is a, it is a, it is a resent.    As I say we, we, we, we, we come to the; that it seems to be a duplicated email, because the email is sent from the same person, thesame address to the same person, is the same document with the same attachment within, within four minutes of the previous one.  Yes Chair, this email is also from    That is correct.    Ja and really either than reading it the time and seeing that it is the same arrive at the conclusion that it is a resent.  The; and now I am in the, the, the, the area of just surmising what happens with the technology, but the intention was to send this resolution and inadvertently resent what you have sent earlier.  I have seen it happen on my messages on my cellphone that I thought I sent a message and I come back it has not gone.  I made a call, could not go through.  When I try and make another call it redialled the number that I could not go through.  So, but    From the same email.    That that is correct.  This, this document Chair is,      For the Executive that is now in the hands of an external party.      Ja, paragraph 1.3 in this document talks As Advocate Maleka says Chair on external support that is required to design this program, so as a key element that resulted in the process of this program was the openers and collaboration of our partners, being McKinsey and Company, who shared their own internal intellectual property and extensive project experience with Eskom to ensure that our colleagues were able to expedite their development and benefit from the continued support, project management and mentorship of McKinsey Consultants.  In order to make this program impactful, to ensure that we develop it using world-class standards it will be fundamental that we partner again with a strategy consultant to ensure the seamless continuation of our colleagues’ development and the impact thatthey achieved.Then it goes on to describe what the strategy would do but in order to ensure success Eskom would need to deliver a number of key elements, steering operational support, operational management, allocation of members, and project tracking.       “That it be resolved that the selected top engineers should be immediatelytransferred into Group Commercial and Technology until the relevant program structure and reporting department has been confirmed.”      “The group technology partnership with a consultancy firm is approved.”      In principle the consultancy firm is McKinsey and here the consultants would be Trillian.         “That the Divisional Executive Group Technology is authorised with the power to delegate further to take all necessary and all immediate steps to give effect to the above including the signing of any agreements or other documentation necessary or related thereto.     It was – this was when?     Chair just as we say this document is a 2014 document, this was a document that in 2015 the relevance of it, it was going to be taken in 2015 to implement in 2015, but this material is material that was sitting in 2014 that was owing to a particular process that was followed by the Executives in 2014.  These are – as it happens in 2015 they went to file, pulled what was agreed in 2014 to say this is good enough to take to external parties in 2015 and say can we do this now.  So these are – the executives that are now sitting doing this are not the executives that were in office in 2014, and at this meeting on 2014 in March 2014 clearly this would have been something that predates the 5th of March 2014 and I haven’t gone back to see what happened between 2012, 2013 and March 2014, but it is a document that was used in 2015 on the 20th of July to send to this external party to say we will be looking for this as per the prescript that was prescribed.  I don’t know whether the people sitting in these offices in 2014 would have, could have, or have followed this process in sourcing at the time, but I do know that these ones sitting here now in 2015 using this material were intentionally not going to follow the process so when Advocate Malekasays why is compliance so prescribed yet it’s not so followed, this compliance is prescribed to people that were in office then, these ones that were in office now, all what we know they have not followed process by leaking this information to external parties, as would be clear going forward that when they went onto finally employ these consultants that is why when I was asked the question I said McKinsey Trillion, this did not happen in 2014, this happened in the now era, using sourcing material and strategy that had been arrived much earlier than this day, being the 20th of July 2015.      Well as I said Chair this is a document in 2014, this document is signed by the then Group Chief Executive, Mr Dames, and it may well be that the copy that we’ve got as you can see it’s a Round Robin, the other – well when you go further to page 484 you will see the continuation of the other executives that have signed this document, so all the group executives as they were then have signed.  It would appear to me that these were not signed in the same place at the same time, one document, the first one referred to was signed by the Group ChiefExecutive and this other document was signed by all the other executives and – let me go and just check this point I want to make here.      That is correct Chair but worth mentioning that it’s not unusual for the boss man to be the last to sign, so you would see that Mr Dames signed this document on the 20th of March when his – all his executives signed the document between the 4th and the 13th of March, so when the Chief Executive finallyput his signature is when all his executives had signed.      Ja, (indistinct) at reading these hieroglyphics.      Agreed.     Ja Chair I think that first point just and I’m no authority on handwritings, I am just going to try this “a commercial [asterisk] we need to find previous needs – a commercial” I’m trying to see where it goes that way or this way.      Ja, but what I’ve tried to also check here this document ,these comments, these notes, the Chairman was reading would appear to be comments by Mr S Lennon, just looking at the signatures, that signature would seem to be the one that is in that column.      That one would seem to me Chair to be T Govender’s signature.      Correct.  Correct, I can’t work out the second one.      The first one on the top column Chair.      Ja, it’s one right at the bottom.      It can say “me note” “my note”.      And then there is one now we’re getting there, the one from Lacmia Haron it’s got a note one, it’s got one second next to it.      Which – so these are three notes now, I think I finally got into this, the one is one settled relates to like Lacmia Haron next to his signature, and then there’s an asterisk, that asterisk if you go to the second signature on the corner is the one that there is a signature an asterisk to Mr T Govender.      So the way this should be reading one goes down and then the asterisk starts on the other side and goes down so once there’s a commercial I don’t process, a commercial process needs to be fulfilled to select the firm.      “to be followed to select the firm” correct ja. And the one with the asterisk says “we need to push for a 5th reduction in McKinsey’s ...(intervention)       A further reduction.    I don’t understand the formula here as well.    All of them, some with notes, some withoutnotes.    Yes I can see that.    I can see that.    Acting.    Correct.   Correct Chair.    The format of how they’re going to – just the process they say this document was since reviewed on the 25th of July, this particular document but as it was clear in my own declaration my declaration was in January but the review document, I don’t know whether that means this documentation, this process, this format must come up for review in July 2015.    The answer, and we’re back to that document, my own declaration, this column at the top of this document on page 485 this is what is the unique identifying number, what document type is this, it’s an internal document control within Eskom, so Eskom have got set documents.    So I think this so-called review date says this format, this document, this type of document will come up for review in 2015 July, this document, but because it’s a template it comes out like that as a master, then what weshould be focusing on is the actual body of the document and the date at which that  particular paper was signed this one what Advocate Maleka is saying Chair.    Right, this was signed in February 2014, which was a submission to the Executive.    The time we had spent just before this was the resolution following from this submission.    Yes but so that we don’t lose the point we are making here, this is a 2014 document that was to be reviewed just the way they do thisin July, this is a 2014 document that has been used and has been sent to external party, and the year this document is now submitted as can be seen on page 490 with the fine print at the end, that this submission now it’s now a resubmission.    It’s resubmitted for the purposes of this so that we don’t confuse submissions.    This submission was to an Exco in 2014, this is now resubmitted again by Matshela Koko.  You would have noted that he was no executive at Eskom in 2014.  He was not a signatory in the Executive team that was ledby Brian Dames at the time.    So he is now resubmitting this to – this one is now prepared by him.    But it is a resubmission of a document that was – that had served to a previous Exco.    Which was no longer in office at this time.    Yes I can see that.   Right.    That’s correct yes.    I agree Chair, ja.    It would appear Chair that as early as February to May 2014 the executive that was in office at the time had determined that this is the course of action to be followed, we need to develop engineers, 2014, we need to develop engineers, and this is the program, we need to go and source these engineers following a particular revised guidelines from Treasury on how to appoint consultants, so the Executive in office at the time considers a submission from the responsible executive of – in technology, Group Commercial and Technology, to say I submit that we go this line.  All the executives look at the submission, this was followed by a resolution to execute on the proposal from the sponsor, being Mr – I now recall his name incorrectly – Mr Lacmia Haron, and this has been done to the T, followed theprocess of Eskom of checking, does it meet all these requirements as a submission, send this to the Exco, the Exco supports it.  Three of the members of the Exco with some qualifications on price and maybe on format and sticking to Treasury.So we don’t see these Executives actually acting to appoint these consultants.  I would argue they were no longer in office at a certain point because when we – it’s May 2014 as Advocate Maleka is saying but we now know that by 15 March there was a different set of executives in office, who went on to their archives and pulled this and resubmitted it and then went on a particular process in securing.So what flows from here is what we surmise and we conclude that having seen this a decision would have followed, that it looks like we will end up working withMcKinsey it would appear when you look at this document that they might have dealt with this McKinsey before, so we’re coming back to them, we know they have had this thing internally, for their own, if we go to them, but this time we must make sure that when they give us engineers they will be permanently with us we won’t be going back to them again. So all that squares ticks process, ticks logic, commercial logic and it is sensible.  But we now have other issues here at Eskom. We have got issues of our suppliers must be empowered.  It would then appear to me that the executives that were in office then between March and July 2015 this our summation take this document and go to McKinsey and say McKinsey through Mr Essa, McKinsey you can get this job but you will have to do something else.  You can get this job this is what we will pay you but at a point you will have to do something else.  As I will demonstrate in my submission as I contextualise this that this something else was you will appoint Trillian which at this point does not exist.  As at in March a company Trillian does not exist.     That is correct.    The date here now is the 8 August and it is an email that was sent on the 8 August from Matshela Koko from kokomm@eskom.co.za.    The body of the email is – this is a submission to the executive committee procurement.    The body of the email on 493 is – we did not finish our discussion about this transaction.  So this is Matshela saying to infoportal which we have concluded is Mr Salim Essa and we will demonstrate how we arrive at that conclusion.  He said they did not conclude their discussion about this transaction.  And this is what is going to the board on the 18 August.  So on the 8 August Mr Matshela Koko sends our argument to Mr Salim Essa a document on Online Vending that was discussed with Mr Salim Essa as it would appear on this email but that discussion about this transaction was not finished to use his words.  But this material isgoing to Mr Salim Essa ten days before it is going to go to the board which would be on the 18 August.    So on page 494 what happens this is a document – it is an executive summary of a document that is a submission to the executive committee procurement sub-committee what they call the EXCOPS.  Yesterday I have tried to explain what we have suddenly – we have since done about the various levels and schedules of the authorities of the various structures.    This was the sub-committee of executives which was to be submitted on the 11 August bearing in mind this document is going out on the 8th to Mr Essa, was to be submitted on the 11 August and then on the 18 August the same document was on the assumption it would be approved by the EXCOPS the same document would now go to the board tender committee on the 18 August.      501.  I am at 501.    The one is Mr C Kalima who was the general manager commodity sourcing in acting capacity and Mr Matshela Koko who was the group executive technology and commercial.  Both signed this document on the 8 of August certifying that all the various boxes were ticked and when they were not ticked they did say why it was not required.  So this was the control document again whichattaches to the document of the submission that on the same date as on 499 was signed by Mr Matshela Koko.    Which is the document that he sends to Mr Essa which would then serve three days later to the EXCOPS clearly assuming that it would pass the EXCOPS.  This document will go to the board tender committee a week later on the 18 August.    Correct.    This is signed on 499 by Mr Matshela Koko in his capacity as group executive technology and commercial Chair.    He signs it on the 8th and as soon as he signs it he sends it to Mr Salim Essa.    That is correct Chair.   Correct.    Correct.    At 20   In the evening of the 8th to Mr Salim Essa.    Well Chair I do not know either than it is in keeping with the activities of Mr Matshela Koko on his emails that we have seen on that trend from the 20 July.  So from the day he arrived back from suspension he really was quite busy on his email.  So this is in keeping with that just we have not I am sure we did not find that gap between the 20 July and the 8 August but that is in no way suggest it was not happening.  So as you can this document Chair refers to a discussion that was not finished.  I mean if we have the time and the interest to look at what that discussion it would just be in line with that.  So I do not know why.    I am just next door.  Ja I am on 515.    Correct Chair.    The subject is ME, ME.  The attachment is Disciplinary Intention to Suspend.    This disciplinary process is to suspend a Mr Phetla.    Mr Phetla is an executive at Eskom at this point who …    As at the 31 August 2015.     Which is the date on which he was being suspended.     Well Chair according to this letter of suspension    Chair really other than being Chair of Eskom I am also a member of the public.    And in the public domain I have followed…    No I am not able to say.      Yes I am at 515 Chair.    The date of this email is the 30 September 2015   The subject is RE.    R-E.    Chair this which would be a legible copy of 516 is on Eskom’s letterhead Chair.  Is a letter from the Chairman – Interim Chairman as it is signed here of Eskom Doctor B S Ngobane.  It is a letter formally addressed to the    I confirm Chair in line with these emails that thisis one of the letters that – that email that we dealing with of the 30 September attaches    Ja Chair I was – if we are soon to be breaking for tea.    I do not know whether it might perhaps not be appropriate for us to just to close this point about why we saying infoportal1@zoho is Mr Salem Essa.      I get to my notes.  I will get to the actual details.   Where I will – might ask the team to help me with the actual reference to the bundle.    But the details are this.  We have email here.    Chair I think I have got…    I have gotten to it.    I have gotten to it and to the extent my numbering does not accord to the record here.  On page 447.    I think so.    The bundle that is in front me.  The one we have been using.    The blue bundle.    It is page 447.    The Chair is…    No I have got the…    I have got many blues here?    On the bundle of …    Would that be 325 or JAM447?    Just 447.   Ja 447.    On JM 447.    This is an email Chair that comes from Sameera    Sameera is sending this email to Mr Salim Essa on email address salemessa@gmail.com.     And he has copied Halima Allana at Travel Excellence and Sagheer Sajida at Travel Excellence.    Sameera is sending this from his email of – at travelexcellence .co.za.      And he says – she says  or Sameera says one visa is out.      Your one visa  is out.    This is to Salim Essa from Travel Excellence.   On page 446.    Yes.     We see an email from Matshela Koko from his email address.    On the 3 January 14   Yup.  He is sending this email to the reception at grandastenbali.com.    This is would appear it is a hotel in Bali.  And the    This is sent from his Samsung device.  That    An email sent from Businessman    With the topic one visa for travel.   And it has for what it is there 3 x Koko family visa.      So Chair Sameera sends an email to Salim to his gmail address.    This visa finally lands in Koko from Businessman infoportal.  So the conclusion we have drawn is Salim Essa who received the email from Sameera is the same Salim Essa who used Businessman infoportal1@zoho.comto send it to Matshela Koko.    This is how we conclude.    That Salim Essa is Businessman referred to as Businessman using address infoportal1@zoho.com.    Hm.    Ja, correct Chair.    The, the, the, the, the visa comes from Sameera.   Goes to Mr Essa.    Mr Essa sends from his private email to Mr Matshela’s private email.    Mr Matshela uses his Eskom email.    To send to the receptionist in the hotel in Bali to print.   Those visas.    Which enables him to travel with his family from Bali to Dubai and that is that is that is that is how we arrived.    At this linkage.    Zero.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Well I do not know about the, the, the email version.  I know about his version of why he was transiting via Dubai.    Yes I am, I am aware of the version and if I am not mistaken Mr Koko’s version is that this email address belongs toMs Suzanne Daniels.  It is Ms Suzanne Daniels who told him to communicate with her using this email address.    But we, we reject that as we do not know why a Chief Executive would agree with a, a subordinate to communicate on official business on a different email address code named “Businessman” being a female Chief Executive and also why would the Chairman of Eskom who is also been in communicating on the same email address.  We, we, we reject that.    Yes, I am aware that she was, she was confronted.  I just need to refresh my memory of what her exact response was to that.    Will do.    I will Chair.    Yes.  I do Chair.    Chair I can think of any other reason other than the conclusion we have reached that Mr Matshela Koko as he is the author of this submission was put in the hands of Mr Salim Essa all the pertinent information including the price in sense per kilowatt hour to enable Mr Salem Essa to see the opportunity and seize the opportunity.   Yes, I am on page 517 Chair.    Ja, I confirm this is an email from kokomm@eskom.co.za being Matshela Koko.    The, this is on 14 November at 10   Sorry.    Oh, correct.  I, I missed that.  This email attaches a document entitled “Electricity Load Shedding Review and way forward”.  This is the, the email that was sent with this attachment as appears on 518 to 520.    Yes Chair.  I am on 519.  If I may it says   “…load shedding incidents.”    Thanks Chair.    Conclusion   Well Chair all that I know we have in the very recent past started to experience load shedding and there is various documentation that is available.  There is the Treasury Report.  There is the NERSA Report.  These are amongst others that seek to address the issue of load shedding.  That we continue to have load shedding can only conclude that these which are not new today of what should be done was never done before.  Hence load shedding continued to persist.  Wein the current state we have also reached that same conclusion that load shedding has a lot to do with the absence of maintenance and the absence of skilled people in the operation.  At least the required skilled people in the operation.    Chair yes.    And I would avoid the temptation to.    To go beyond here.    Well [intervenes].    Well what, what, what we make of it is there are, there are various elements of this relationship.  There is an element that deals with the commercial opportunities, but there is also an element that deals with the media as when we go down the line we will demonstrate some media statements that we believe have been crafted outside of Eskom, but also given that there was public outrage, outcry of course you have to be seen to be also addressing issues that are of publicconcern.    Like load shedding.    So we are not only talking about what we can be getting ourselves on the side.  We will also demonstrate that these issues that were between Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa and those for whom he was working with were also over and above the things that Mr Koko was doing himself that were not, it was help us with this.  You do this with us.  Do what you are doing with whoever you are doing elsewhere.  As it has become clear to us that for instance the issue of Impulse International has absolutely nothing to do with Salim Essa and associates.  So the, the, the only conclusion we, we, we could arrive at is this particular aspect was one that goes to the hearts and the minds of society because load shedding was affecting anybody, but it is curious in its sequencing as to where it ranks in the order of things that had to be, to be, to be done.     That’s in order Chairman.       That’s correct.     Got that Chair.       Chair thank you.  Charge one which is paragraph 60 says the nub of this charge is that Ms Daniel caused the distribution of confidential Eskom proprietary interest be it in the form of documentation or contents thereof to a third party.  It is not disputed that Ms Daniel distributed information to an email address businessman being infoportal1@zoho.com.  It is also not in issue that the material so distributed by Ms Daniel contains confidential Eskom information which ought to have been made available to outside third party.  Ms Daniel’s defence is that the email address, ie infoportal1@zoho.com belongs to Seleke.  Eskom contention on the other side is that the email address is likely to be that of Essa.  In order to evaluate their respective contentions I need to analyse the role of the two individuals concerned apropos the information made available to them and the overall probability.        Is that paragraph 64 or page 64?ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC      Right, Ms Daniel conceded that she met Mr Essa in March 2015 at a meeting in Melrose Arch convened by Koko, then her immediate boss.  From the contents of that discussion it was apparent that Essa had intimate and intrinsic knowledge about the affairs of Eskom.  Essa had alerted her to the fact that four senior Eskom, senior officials of Eskom would be suspended the following day and there would be investigation into Eskom and his observations were correct.     The Chairperson on paragraph 67 says      Chair if I can beg your indulgence to deal with the third point.      “Thirdly the contents of the email demonstrate a clear leaning to favour Essa and the Guptas in business transactions involving Eskom.  Fourthly the conduct of Essa by this time and in particular his ability to pack the Eskom Board with his lackeys demonstrate that he was indeed running Eskom. An outsider conducting the affairs of Eskom for the purpose of enriching himselfand his associates.”       When we adjourned I was dealing with the load shedding, Advocate Maleka asked the relevance and why.  What we could confirm on that document we were dealing with earlier pertaining to the emails of November 2015 the one that is on page 28, what do we call this one, U5, on page 28, which was dealing with the electricity load shedding chair.     Right the point we want to make on these load shedding story is as that document in page 518.  What the status of this documentbeing that it is on a clear piece of paper, no letterhead, but it is a document attached to this email from Matshela Koko to Infoportal which we have just now dealt with the versions of Matshela and the one of Daniel and still conclude as Advocate Cassiem had concluded that it is Essa, so this was sent to Essa under the email from Matshela Koko on the 14th of November.This document in essence Chair what this document says, I have sought to make the point that there were three buckets, the one was commercial interest, the other one was media, management of media, the other one was public interest.  There’s no doubt there was an issue of public interest that was being injured by load shedding.  So of course they had to show that they were not only about self-interest,they were also about public interest, but the point in his email at the start of this attached document, the one about load shedding and the way forward, without going into reading it word by word, says the past leadership, because now there’s new leadership, the past leadership in addressing the issues of supply thought – focused on one solution only being loads shedding.  There are other solutions, one of those solutions is the use of - they’re also OCG, the open cycle gas turbine which is you should buy more diesel but there is that solution.But when you go to page 519 Chair in the conclusion, the conclusion is     That is correct Chair.       So these emails when you once we’ve concluded on the Makoko (indistinct) emails.     Correct.ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC    Yes, correct.ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC      On the face of the email which is from     No, I don’t have that information right now.ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC     Well this document Chair seems to be asummary of the amount of money that – in Rand terms that has been spent on the cost plus agreements between – during the period breaking it on the various mines and arriving to a figure at the bottom of 12.1 billion, and it’s summarised that the main mines being Arnot, Matla, New Denmark, Vaal (indistinct), these are the mines that have got agreements to the tune of R1.38.  Significant to note that these mines are all mined by the so-called majors.     Well this states that the name of the mine, what is that mine, what does it do, it was acquired at the value of R300million if we take the first one as an example and depreciation over time was about 212million leaving a book value of 87million, so this schedule shows what was the value, what is the now      Well these are the so-called cost plus minus that are mined by other companies but Eskom has got an agreement to source the fuel from those.     Right.ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC      Yes.    Well I would argue – my read is this is building a case for an acquisition.  This is to just throw a backdrop that mines valued at these – this is what happens and in the majority these are the people that owns these mines.    So there may well be an opportunity to acquire a  mine or that opportunity to acquire a mine as we later got to know that there was a certain mine that was under business rescue and this was all material leading to the timelines I was referring to immediately after the end of this November period.    Well as I indicated Chair that this once more was standby.  There will be an opportunity, a business opportunity.  This just so that youready this is the universe in this type of commercial opportunities.  This is what they look like, this is what they cost, this is what their value is, this is what their going rate is.  Therefore when we get to the opportunity you have got to know whether it is a good or a bad opportunity in the context of what this thing really means.      Chair maybe whilst add this to just illustrate that these exchanges which we have now established was giving classified information or proprietary information within Eskom to third party i.e. Mr Essa, we have concluded that is to prepare and advance his personal and financial business interest.  We have also dealt with the public interest and we have dealt with the media.  But as it was demonstrated in the Suzanne Daniels email exchanges that these were not isolated and confined to those two.  It was also in the various email exchanges that was later to come about of – between Mr Singh, Anoj Singh the CFO in the period around the 8 December.  We can see email exchanges in that period between Mr Singh and Mr Eric Wood of Regiments.  We can also see in the exchanges in emails and the meetings between Mr Wood, Mr Bobat and Mr Anoj Singh.    Right Chair just to conclude my point here.    About these – the emails and the commercial interest Advocate Maleka was leading me to answer the question about these cost plus mines.  That was – it was the end of November 2015.    This email that we now referring to is dated the 8 December.  This is an email that comes from Mr Anoj Singh to Mr Matshela Koko and now this is about round rib – I think the RR means Round Robin Resolution Optimum    My apologies.    I am on page 401.    This is an email from Mr Anoj to Matshela Koko    And the subject is RRR which I would think would    And it is following an email that came from   To Anoj Singh.  So the sequence the email came from Fahiema Badat at Regiments.  It was sent to Anoj Singh at Eskom.  It was cc’d to Eric Wood at Regiments and Mohamed Bobat at Regiments and the subject of that is    Now Chair here is Mr Badat, Mr Wood, Mr Bobat writing a Round Robin Resolution for the board of Eskom sending it to Mr Anoj Singh the CFO of Eskom who in turn sends it to Mr Matshale Koko undercover to review.    That Round Robin Resolution referred to is on 403.    This Round Robin Resolution without just going into its details is a Round Robin Resolution to the board of directors of Eskom which it would appear has been drafted outside of Eskom, sent into Eskom to process.  This is a Round Robin Resolution that deals with the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal and it details what resolution it is required.  This is sponsored by the Group Chief Executive and the Group Generation Executive.  This Round Robin Resolution its    But …    I will not, I will not Chair.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.    Well Chair I can only surmise that it is to prepare Regiment to be a supplier of some service to Eskom.  Get them ready to be.  Enable them to be suppliers.  They then draft what type of Round Robin Resolution they would require to be such.    Correct.    408 yes correct.    Correct.    Correct Chair but so let me just make two other points about the timelines.  This is the …    The 8 December.    Another development takes place on the 9 December.    A new Minister of Finance is appointed on the 9 December.    On the 10 December.    The vacancy occurred.      On the 9 December there is a new Minister of Finance appointed.    On the 10 December.    One of the recipients and a part authors of that Round Robin Resolution I have referred to of the A.    One Bobat is now a panel of advisers to the Minister of Finance.      If I can just pass there and come back to 408.    Chair yesterday – on Friday when I spoke about some curiosity I at least have of a recipient of services and goods gives guarantee for the benefit of the supplier.  This email that is on 408 and I do not intend to go through it but it is – it relates to a guarantee that is arranged by Eskom for the benefit of a potential supplier to Eskom and for the tune of I think it is about a billion.    1.7 billion.    Van Eisland.    At Barclays.com.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    At ABSA Capital.    I can see that Chair.     I think it is important I read it.    It says   The Chair would remember that we spoke on Friday about the cost SEKA 630 000 that was incurred by Eskom at the time when this guarantee was     Alive.    Right.   Correct.  He has got this email now and it is the    Well as I – the only – I cannot talk about 9/15 except that it is a development that happened Chair.  What I can talk about is the emails of the 8 December which has got three people in it.  Mr Singh, Mr Wood and Mr Bobat.    The 9th is an announcement of an appointment.    On the 10th we see one of those Mr Bobat in office.  On the 10th we see these email exchanges with the bank that is now between Mr Wood, Mr Anoj Singh and the bank and as it would become clear on what thenhappened going forward on from 414.    I can see that.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.  Now Chair yes this email from Anoj on the 10th on 414 – page 414 to Suzanne Daniels on the 10 December at 1.34 pm and copied on this is Caroline Henry at Eskom and still that subject of 1.7 billion.  This letter    The question of the CP’s is dealt with on page 14    Just to get the sequence right.  At 4   Correct.    Chair I can only say here this takes us back tothe start of the emails between Wood and Regiment – and Mr Singh about this agreement that would be entered into to.  Now there is a draft agreement.  See this, are you happy with this, then if you are happy we will go on and pay ABSA this or we will settle the agreement with the guarantee with ABSA.    Chair just to complete the – really the point to make was we have answered the financial injury that Eskom had suffered with this.  This guarantee was not finally implemented or perfected or called on in that certain information started to get into the public domain about the workings of the associates of the parties involved here which naturally made ABSA a bit nervous.  At which stage this guarantee had already been shown to a potential seller that I am good for 1.7 billion to buy this asset which we argue the asset is buying the Tegeta and the Optimum Mines.  But just before ABSA reached this decision there was then a pre-payment of another 600 odd million 6 – I think it is just around 6 just over 600 million which added to the guarantee amount would have translated to 2.2 billion which earlier on in the documentation we talk about a figure of 2.27 billion.  If you add those two numbers they are what would have been the purchase price for that asset.  I just wanted to conclude on that on the time lines the emails and this particular transaction.    Chair I have not forgotten it.    I have, I have covered that point.    I have covered he four points.    Daniels, load shedding.    December timelines and Singh on 401.    Correct.    This email is dated 10 December at 04   On the one side we have dealt up to now Chairabout Eskom and its bankers providing the guarantee to, to Absa.    Now this email, the subject of this email is from Mr Wood to Mr Singh attaching banking details which I image this would be banking details of Regiments of and it details their account name being Bank of Baroda.  This is a Nedbank account with the account number and the branch code and it references to Tegeta exploration and resources.  This is from Eric to Anoj.    Eric Wood to Anoj Singh.    From Regiments to Eskom at 04   On page 434 Chairman.    I do not know Chair.    Chair maybe it is once more just to conclude this.  Page 435 has got a memorandum on this.    Guarantee.   It is a memorandum from Caroline Henry who is a Senior General Manager in Treasury sending it to Mr Anoj Singh the CFO on the 10th of.    Treasury of Eskom.    And the subject is   Correct Chair.  Now.    This closes now the entities enables to have money to go and act.    Correct.        Chair at the risk of sounding like repeating thepoint that we were establishing, we were making was to demonstrate why we have concluded that “Businessman” going by the email address infoportal1@zoho.com is Salim Essa.  These emails of the travel agent advising Mr Salim Essa that visas which we now have established were visas of the Koko family who was at a hotel in Bali.  That email from this company Travel Excellence if I am not mistaking their name sent their visas to Mr Essa on Mr Essa’s email, private email at Gmail.  Mr Essa sent that that attachment to Mr Matshela Koko to his private email.  Mr Matshela Koko sent those emails to the reception at the hotel in Bali to print the visas and he took those visas, him, Ms Koko and young Mr Koko they travel to Dubai.  We part of the charges having now established that Mr Essa is infoportal1@zoho.com or infoportal1@zoho.com is Mr,the “Businessman” is Mr Essa and we have gone onto the Advocate Cassim’s disciplinary hearing of Ms Daniels.  So we have dispensed of their version of Mr, the version of Mr Matshela Koko of who “Businessman” is.  That the Chairman of the disciplinary hearing has rejected that and has accepted the conclusion that “Businessman” is Mr Essa.  Now Mr Koko would now be able to travel to, to Dubai as per his arrangements that have been made by Mr Essa and travel, Travel Excellence or travelexcellence.co.za.    There, there is nothing else I want to canvas any, any, any, any further here.  So the charges that were placed on him subsequent.    Well there is the charge of flying to Parliament about the circumstances surrounding his trip.    And he was advised to detour in transit via Dubai is what we are charging him for having lied to Parliament.    This is how we arrive at the point that he has not stated the, the, the truth to Parliament.    Yes I, I, I confirm that Chair, but on page 36 it, it may well be worth just putting it on record that under D on page, on page 36.    Earlier on in my statement I.    Of names.    Is the Chairman looking at page 36 with the D?    Oh.    No this is my statement.    I have got too many.    Correct.  What page through you Chair?    35.    I might need help here of page [intervenes].    I do not, can I get help here.    Chair.    Which pagination is this solid one?    Page 35 written by hand.   Thank you.    More than one.    Page 35.  There is page 35 that is GM35 and there is one paginated by hand.    I am there Chair.    I am there Chair.    Chair just a, I think it is worth mentioning these.  We have mentioned the other two charges the one on emails.    We have referred to the third transgression on the trip between Dubai and Bali.    The third charge was being paid for by and we have advanced.    Evidence.    That indeed that is what happened.    The fourth charge I think it is important just to call it what it is which was, this charge Mr Koko played a central role.    Inserting Trillian’s initial mandate and these go onto to advance that argument of the, of this particular charge.    Chair you, Advocate Maleka asked what was Mr Koko’s response to these charges.    These are the charges that were placed to Mr Koko and we never got to, to, to discipline Mr Koko on this as the Chair would remember we indicated that when we arrived at Eskom on 22 February, January Mr Koko was not at Eskom.  He was on suspicion and he was challenging his suspension.    And the Labour Court had decided that he bereinstated.    On reinstatement for reasons of logistics he was to report the following Monday owing to the fact that the Wednesday before and the days leading up to that he was in Parliament.    We then served him with these charges.    Over the weekend.    Before he was to resume office and we placed him immediately on suspension.  Being.    Being reinstated.    We respected the, the court decision to reinstate him.    As a reinstated employee we had placed these charges and we immediately suspended him.    And we never got to; a lot of time passed in, in the nature of these or the engagement between setting up the, the disciplinary process getting an independent Chairman and our legal team being ready to come and, and lead the, the evidence against Mr Koko in with his legal representatives.  A date was setand I will have to check what those dates were.  Suffice to say having been reinstated and having public said he wants to clear his name Mr Koko resigned one hour before the start of the disciplinary hearing.  We got a letter from his attorneys telling us to that effect that he is resigning.  So the, the conclusion is as far as this current Board is concerned Mr Matshela’s departure from Eskom in this particular term is not related to what is publically said about IPPs not signing.  He resigned an hour before his disciplinary hearing stating that and I am paraphrasing this letter.    Which you might get to it if need be.    But in the interest of the safety of his family and children he does not want to proceed.    [Intervenes].    Yes.    Chair I do not have, I do not have to addanything more.  We have spoken about this charges at various times.  I do not need to add anything more save to say that there was a third charge.  The first one was on Mr Essa.  The second one was her role on the McKinsey Service Agreement.  The other, the third charge for the record Chair was the one relating to.    [Intervenes] to it.  Relating to, to her breach of duty in as far as it relates to her role in the, in that guarantee and the, the, the, the submission of the Tegeta, Optimum and her submissions to Parliament and the last charge was relating to the, these charges of signing some invoices.  These were invoices Chair that, Mr Ngubane was now Chairman of Eskom, had some legal fees that related to his role and a parliamentary enquiry about her role, his role as Chairman of SABC and there were some legal fees that ought to have been paid by Mr Ngubane relating to SABC.  Ms Daniels authorised that the SABD related legal fees be paid for by Eskom.    We thought that was neither related to Eskom or no value gained by Eskom.    Yes.  On 12 May 2017 she signed and approved two invoices.  One for R154 614,04 and the other one being a figure of R651 811,67 being charged to and paid by Eskom for legal services not rendered to Eskom.    Well Chair suffice to say she did.  She was foundguilty by the, the Chair of the disciplinary hearing and she was found guilty on all four the charges that she was accused of and on the basis of that the Judge, the Chairman of the disciplinary hearing went further to recommend that she be dismissed summarily and also further the law firm that she was working with should cease, Eskom should cease doing business with that particular law firm.  Both decisions have since been implemented.  We are aware that she, she must have taken this matter out to the CCMA or the other courts, but that is where the matter is at.    Hm.    Ja, it is round numbers Chair.  This would be bout    800 000.    Well Chair I agree.  As, as I say we then got to hear that she had taken the matter to the CCMA.    Got it.    Yes, I am Chair.    [Intervenes].    Yes Chair.  I recognise Ms Daniels’ email address here in this U1 Chair.  Ms Daniels is sending herself an email from her own home email    Well on reading this email Chair firstly Ms Daniel sends herself an email that she got from Mr – or from her home address to her business address, but what Mr Howa sends is what Ms Daniel must send back to Mr Howa, so Mr Howa is drafting a letter that all what Ms Daniel needs to do is to put it on the letterheads of Eskom and send it back to Mr Howa.    But Chair ...(intervention)     Well Chair at the point we have made the argument that in the context of – in reference to Mr Essa that Eskom was being run outside of Eskom, so in this regard the body of the email would indicate firstly we’vedealt with the drafting of the agreement, the guarantee, the Round Robin Resolution, the role of Mr Singh, how it came from Mr Wood to Eskom, now we see Mr Howa drafting a – what should be a letter back to Tegeta that must now be signed by, be sent back to them from Ms Daniels.  So the body of this email speaks about that guarantee and the basis on which this session and the assignment of the sale agreement to Tegeta now, so these were – outsiders would determine what to do and then would draft executive insight, this new leadership that has now been put in place that has been the game-changer at Eskom, is now taking these instructions from outside and they draft and they send them, they put on the letterheads or the draft resolutions they put in front of the Board, the Board approve and that becomes an Eskom position.   Correct.    Correct.    Correct yes.    Correct.    The date is now the 11th of June 2016.    The time is very early in the morning at two am?    One Baldwin.Ngubani@gmail.com, I suppose this is the private email of the Chairman of Eskom at the time.    The subject matter is a draft statement by the Chairman.    I’m sorry Chair the time was 11   Yes, I just wanted – the time 11   Around the same time Ms Daniels sends this email to the following, the one is 1kwaitam@yahoo.com, Zethembekhoza@telkomsa.net, markvivianpaminsky@markpam.com, these would be ...(intervention)     That’s correct Chair for Twahita it’s Twahitam@yahoo.com, for Zethembe Khoza it’s Khozazw@telkomsa.net,markvivianpaminsky@markpam.com.  These are members of the board of Eskom that are being sent a draft statement of the Chairman, a draft statement by the Chairman to the members of the Board clearly attaching that statement to say to the members as per Chairman’s telephone call your consideration and review.    Correct.    Correct yes.   This email Chair comes from Businessman, which we have advanced the point now that’s from Salim Essa.    Of Infoportal1@zoho.com, the date is now the    It is to Suzanne Daniels, the time is 13   Correct, she had sent the email to board    Two and a half hours, well one hour fifteen minutes seventeen minutes.    The subject matter is forward draft statement by Chairman.    It then says please add okay line about the big four that they supply 80% of Eskom’s coal and Tegeta supplies only 5%.    Less than 5% and I am then happy that we issue as soon as possible.  Maybe worth just mentioning that this has become when we’re looking at that statement about the various prices of the assets, the depreciated value, and these are all those coal plus mines all owned by the so-called majors.  This became – was to become the line that was common in all communication that says it’s no big deal if Optimum gets an opportunity, it is after all going to be supplying less than 5% so this is how this statement gets into the language at Eskom at the time, but he, the businessman, is now then happy that we, now we issue as soon as possible.      Yes, by this time ...(intervention)     Correct.    On Saturday 11 at 14   She says “okay will do.”    Maybe context Chair, I don’t know whether we will get to it, this is a statement that is prepared as a holding statement in the knowledge that there will be a big Carte Blanche coverage on the role by Mr Matshela Koko and the guarantees and on the CSA contract, so this was a bit of damage control just to conclude my point about public’s interest, business interest and media, this was a – this statement ought to – it would appear not only did businessman see it the firsttime now, he would have been the one, or he would have been part of drafting it and sending it and sending it to the Chairman, from the Chairman to Suzanne and now to go back and say just add this other line.    Correct.    Correct.    Suffice to say it’s sent to members of the Board Chair from – and it’s still about that statement.    Correct Chair.    Ja correct Chair, I have ...(intervention)     It says   Yes I see that Chair and I confirm and agree that it makes that point of the Businessman.    Chair sorry before I go there, just for me to close this, I think we have not, we have spoken about the statement but I think it’s worth placing on record by reading just the first two paragraphs of the statement.   Which is on 541, it is a statement dated the 11th of June, we keep on saying the statement says it’s from the Chairman of Eskom, Dr Ben Ngubani. “I’m advised that Carte Blanche will be airing an interview with Eskom Group Executive for generation Mr Matshela Koko alleging that Eskom’s coal contracts were not concluded in accordance with the procurement procedure.  I am concerned about the recent media speculation and sensationalism around the procurement of coal.  Eskom stands firm by its process and undertaken to conclude extension of its coal supply agreement with its suppliers.”     It’s on page 41, 541.    It is the first two paragraphs Chair, you took us to paragraph 4, the end of paragraph with their less than 5 and 80%.    But the germane point in the statement and its genesis was on hearing that Carte Blanche will be airing something this was a statement that was seeking to blunt whatever that interview was going to be sayingbecause it was done now, it was to be added.    Ja Chair, that’s what the statement says.    We understand now what happened building up to this statement.    Okay, I’m comfortable Chair.   Alright.    Yes I can see that.    Chair nothing save as to say really in the scheme of things at a low of 10million and a high of 43million.  There is much we should concern ourselves about than the relative numbers and their relevance to materiality.    Chair I think we have established enough of some of the parties that were involved, how they’ve enabled Optimum and Tegeta, how McKinsey got – brought into Eskom, how Trillion got sent which in the process to be supplied Eskom and the only point we want to make here Chair is we have spoken atlength about the – maybe the three executives, ie Matshela Koko, Anohd Singe and Suzanne Daniels.  There are a number of other executives that we wouldn’t encourage and urge the Commission that did maybe helped it his job , if it sought to interview there’s people we illustrate what in our view was their role, but we don’t intend to spend time on them, except just to correct, which is where I was heading earlier when a bit, not at one about which document we’re using, the Chair will remember I spoke of a certain lettering.In the documents here we refer to certain names of executives, I just want to correct to the extent and impression might have been inadvertently created elsewhere.    That the Govender we’re referring to his name is Mr Prish Govender not to be confused with another Mr Govender, who is an executive at Eskom.  I thought it’s important that we correct that.  We do not go too much to talk about Ms Ayanda Ntetwa but we would also encourage that she and Mr Madelani would be of great help to the Commission in its work if there was time spent on them but I don’t intend to do that today.    Correct Chair.     Chair maybe before I step off, we do say of those people that have been mentioned It may also be worth a while to – we don’t spend too much time on it to look at how the former Group CEO Mr Brian Molefe himself got implicated in what we considered to be a scheme to defraud Eskom in assisting (indistinct) to acquire Optima, but that in the interest of time I am not going to ,highlight it, it may well be – well they referred to the CEO and CFO without putting a name to it.      Just say that Chair, I’m sorry I’m trying to get myself to my concluding point to see what have I covered before.    Thanks Chair.    Thanks Chair.   Correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair at all the various lower levels there has been a decision that Mr Molefe needs to repay the money to the pension fund this he has taken on appeal so it is still out there I think he is now petitioning – I think so the Chief Justice on this.    I need to find my notes on that.    Ja it would appear to us that the Eskom executives sought to unduly influence the appointment of Nkonke as a sub-contractor and information had obtained that Nkonke the accounting firm was acquired by the Gupta associates and this was to be the executives were trying to influence that KPMG appoints Nkonke as a sub-contractor for the purposes of Eskom’s work.  And to this endEskom had paid Nkonke about R63 500 770,00 as a sub-contractor to KPMG which was flat as an irregular expenditure and we just conclude that we have placed – we have laid a criminal charges in Sandton and the Hawks and the SIU are investigating.  But we then also noted that there were weaknesses on the panel approvals and the management of sub-contracting process so that is – that was our issue on Nkonke Chair.     Ja Chair there is nothing else to add either than to now confirm that as I state in paragraph 114 that under ongoing pressure from Mr Ngubane the Chairman of Eskom board at the time and following a meeting with Ms Lynne Brown the former Minister the former Interim Group Chief Executive of Eskom Mr Sean Maritz executed the Asset Development and Finance Agreement in October 2017 shortly after Mr Johnny Dlala was removed as Interim Mayor Group Chief Executive in the face of internal advise against this and without the requisite authority and approvals.  So the – we argue that these were not coincidences these were things designed to arrive at a particular point by putting certain people once more in line with that statement that the game changer was new leadership.  We have got to embed this trait through – these traits throughout the organisation and change the leadership.  The commission would have heard of the status of that that we have said no we are notpaying that fee and we have refused coffee time with the Chair of Warung and they must go to court and force that we do not intend to do anything further.    Yes Chair this matter as said relates to a tender that was awarded for Duvha Unit 3 Recovering Projects to Dong Feng after an open tender.  The contract was signed in March 2017.  Alstom trading as General Electric and an unsuccess – as an unsuccessful tenderer brought an urgent application in court against Eskom to stop Eskom from awarding – implementing the awarding of the Dong Feng tender to Dong Feng pending a review application which seeks to set aside this award.  Murray and Roberts Shanghai Electric Consortium another unsuccessful tenderer intervened in the application for the same purpose.  The – it would appear that part of their objection relates to the status, the BEE status that was granted to Dong Feng here they attach that the BEE commission had issued a draft report findings that Dong Feng did not comply with the BBBEE Act of 12 March 2018.  The recommendation is made in this draft report have been implemented by the new board that comes from the commission.  The matter is still proceeding in the Pretoria Highcourt and additional information I might just add Chair in my position as Chair I had been approached by one of the parties that had challenged this to offer a way in which this matter can be expedited.  I was advised by the legal team that the matter where it is at must be left where it is in the court.    Correction noted I apologise Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair I think the initial capex – I need to – the initial capex of Medupi was 60 – 70 billion in round numbers.  The initial capex of Kusile would have been 80 billion.    Chair I would …    I would and I am subject to correction by two or three billion either way.  The Medupi project today would be standing at about 120/150 billion.  And Kusile would be around 130/140 billion.    Give or take.    Give or take and its ten years or so late.  And it is still not producing the intended output.    Yes Chair those processes are currently underway.  Primarily because these two new bills were put in place with the view of meeting anticipated demand and as a choice that let us rather build new than maintain those ones that were already coming to end of life.  So unfortunately the said cocktail has finally transpired.  We have not maintained the ones that were coming close to life – to end of life.  The ones that we have spent so much money to build have not been complete, have not come on stream.  The few units that have come on stream non-commercially albeit have not produced the required throughput so we facilitating now behind – between fixing them to produce what they are meant to do and also going to try and breath in new life in those that we were – they were between cold reserve to actually decommissioning.    That is correct Chair.      No Chair not to the detail.  I have seen some material over the weekend and I would not want to go into that.  I would need to be very, very certain about my facts.    Chair may I consult my legal team?    Even less Chair.    I agree Chair.    Five past two.    Yes Chair thank you very much.  Chair we – what we had hoped to do and will continue to help to do is to assist the commission in its work but we say the context of capture at Eskom we have already been stated – I have said that the stage for capture was at Eskom and that time line was between March 15 and December 2015 where various structures were put in place.  It is also at the same time that we also need to look at the people because it is one thing to change structures.  The people that were brought into Eskom at the time at board level at executive level as we have indicated that around March 2015 four senior executiveswere suspended owing to that gap vacancies existed and two acting senior executives as in the acting CEO and the acting CFO were brought into Eskom and that material date of the 20 July where of the four executives just to recap it was Matona was the acting CEO, Tsholo Molefe was the acting CFO, Dan Marokane and Koko Matshela those four were suspended.  Matshela was Koko was brought in back on the 20 July.  As we have seen in the various images that we have demonstrated that that started to not only indicate the interaction with the businessman as in Salim Essa it also in there – that email he makes the point that the game changer was changing the executive leadership.  And that change – that game changer spirit an ethos should be allowed to permeate and be embedded in the organisation at levels below.  So we also need to see this in the context of Eskom’s size I indicated on Friday Chair that if Eskom was a listed company Eskom would have been number 2 if not number 1 in its size if you just look at their revenue.  The revenue of Eskom is around R190 billion.  They are – what they buy – what they spend is if you just look at coal it is just shy of R100 billion.  They buy many other things so they are big as a target that if you get hold of them you canreally be in business and you can live well for a long time.  Whether you can sleep well is another question.  And its impact on the economy the systemic impact of Eskom in the economy.    Well Chair we do hope that in the fullness of time it would be shown that crime does not pay.  But for date – to date we have unfortunately seen people whom we know have broken the law, people whom we know that they have stolen and they continue to flounder their ill-gotten gains almost to create to society that it is good to do this thing.  You do not need to go to school.  You do notneed work.  You do not need to pay your taxes.  What is the point of doing this if I can sit in some hotel foyer with a laptop on free wi-fi and get tenders?  As I have demonstrated at the hearing on Friday but how do say to a person whose company has just been set up a week before you call for tenders?  If they have ever seen anything they have seen 10 million and you give them a contract for R1.5 billion.  So unfortunately one hopes that at the end of the work of this commission that ethos would be brought back to society that you do have to work hard.  You do have to work hard and pay your taxes and spend your after tax money as you see fit.  So from your lips Chair to the legal process and the various prosecution processes that are in place we do hope we will get to that point.  So I was saying the systemic nature of Eskom and its impact on the economy it is such that it is important that not only structures but people that are placed in Eskom who have demonstrated and it has been seen that this has been multi-layered.  This capture has been multi-layered and it is not enough to just deal with structures you need to get people not only of skills, not people of capabilities but peoples of upright standing.  People of ethics because the amount of authority yougive to these people requires such that you do not keep on second guessing them.  What we have seen here, we have seen people of skills for which they were – the basis on which they were placed at Eskom but they had other skills which Eskom can do best without.  So we also leaving the commission with a list of names  Chair we have covered four or so of those names but I think it is important that I place on record that there are fifteen or so names that I strongly encourage that the commission invite these ladies and gentlemen to help the commission in its work and in no order of importance Brian Molefe, Matshela Koko, Mr Sean Maritz, Mr Anoj Singh, Ms Suzanne Daniels, Mr Prish Governor, Mr Edwin Mabelane, Ms Ayanda Ntetha, Mr Charles Kallima, Mr Abram Masongo, Ms Mia Bana Naidoo, Mr Zethemba Khoza, Mr Eric Wood, Mr Ben Ngubane,Doctor Ben Ngubane, Mr Salim Essa.  We think they would be of great help to the commission’s work and Chair just to close.I said earlier and I hope I have managed to convey why it is our belief that corruption is just the name the real game is procurement.  Let us look into that area.  Thank you very much Chair.  Thanks for the privilege and we remain available should the commission think we can be of further help and this note and these lists that I have read we are happy to submit with a little paragraph of the points we trying to make that the commission can be assisted.    Thank you.    Chairman thank you very much.    And wish you luck. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chair.      There are some few glitches.    One of which is that the witness bundle is not here but itought not to detain us.  I believe that I can continue without it.    For as long as Mr Mabuza has one in front of him.    A copy of Exhibit U5 which we were working on in the last round of the hearings.    Yes.    Chair on the question of documentation you will recall that on Friday we gave you a copy of the emails which were referred to as annexures to the set of disciplinary proceedings that Mr Mabuza was dealing with on Friday from Annexure SM1 going up to Annexure SM18.     U1.      Yes.  I gave them to you without any pagination.  I understand from the secretary’s office.    That they have now been paginated.    And included in your U1 file beginning from page 397.      397.  And it goes up to page 564.     No Chair I believe that it has been included in your file.    Yes originally it ended at…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.      Yes.    Alright.    Yes.    It should be yes, yes.    It is…    It is a set of documents under titled descriptionAnnexure J.  If you look at the new index.      I think for now it will be …    Yes.    Just to re-orientate you.  You remember the statement of Mr Mabuza.   Has annexures to it.    And the last annexure was Annexure H.    And we have now included as part of the annexure.    J comprising the very documents we are talking about.    Beginning from page 397.    It is just J.    Yes.  So Chair I think it will convenient if one can place a…    A divider or some sort of a tag.    So that you are able to follow the documentation.    As we take you through it.    I know that the resources of the commission are limited but there we are.   397.    What we propose to do this morning is to complete Mr Mabuza’s evidence relating to the disciplinary processes.    That were instituted against several of Eskom’s executives when he took office.  And after that Chair we will go to the other transactions of concern to him and of course of relevance to the commission that he canvasses in his statement.  We will add one or two…    More transactions which do not appear from the statement but which from the body of open source information.    Are the subject matter of investigation.   Certainly by the SIU.  So subject to your permission Chair I would proceed in that order.    Yes Exhibit U5.    Mr Mabuza good morning.    You confirm that you are still under oath?   Yes.  When we adjourned on Friday Mr Mabuza we were talking about the topic that have described in your statement which is U1 from page 18.  You do not have to go to U1 for now.  I am merely orientating you to tell you how far we have gone with your statement.  And you have done so with reference to the contents of Exhibit U5.  U5 is that blue file prepared by the attorneys of Eskom and we have gone up to page 27.      No of Exhibit U5 the blue file ja.  The one that you are looking at.  If you go to page 27.      No of U5.    That blue…    Are you there?    Yes remember we – you – we have dealt with the various emails that had passed between Mr Koko and several individuals especially the emails that were sent to infoportal1@zoho.com.  Remember that?    And those were the emails that were the subjects matter of the first charge brought against Mr Koko?    Most of the emails that you have talked about were sent on 20 July 2015 and we have talked about them at length.  They begin at 15.1 on page 27.    Up to 15.4 on the same page.  Remember that?    The date of 20 July has some significance in relation to the employment history of Mr Koko.  What significance does that date have to your knowledge?    I can assure that so far as the question of the trip to Dubai is concerned that will be one of the charges that I will ask you to deal with.  On the same file it is raised at page 34 paragraph VI but we will get there unless you want to talk to it generally as part and parcel of the historical context you want to give  - to give.    Thank you Mr Mabuza.  What I want to do now is to look at the body of the emails which are referenced as Annexures to the charge sheet.  If you are at page 27 you will see that the first email is sent on the 20 July 2015 at about    We have dealt with that email as part and parcel of the annexure but on Friday we did not look at the body of the email and I would like you to go to the body of the email itself.  It is in that bundle that we have handed up this morning to the Chair.  As far as I can pick up that email is …    Yes U1 as supplemented.    Page 453.    You will see that…    453.    So Chair what I suggest you do is to go to page 453 and at the same time open U5 page 27.     And Mr Mabuza I suggest that you do the same.    Because you will see that 453 is marked SM1, do you see that?    So that is a document which is referred in U1 15.1.  Now can I ask you to take us through that document beginning from 453?  It is an email on the face of it where does it come from?    Yes.    That is one of the executives who you say was suspended around March 2015?    Now why – why does the document refer to controlleddisclosure?  What does that supposed to mean for non-Eskom employees such as ourselves?    Thank you Mr Mabuza.  Just to make sure that I understand your answer to the earlier question I put to you about the meaning of controlled disclosure as appears on page 454.  What does controlled disclosure of documentation mean in Eskom?    So it is a document [intervenes].    Yes.  I have looked at the document and I am not too sure if there is any specific aspect of it that you would like us to consider in detail, but my understanding of the document is that it looks at different cost elements of Eskom’s operation and suggests how those costs should be contained.  Do you confirm that that is the substance of the document [intervenes]?    Yes.  The next email as I pick it up.    Yes.  Mr Mabuza as I understand so your evidence as you indicated earlier on, it is not that a mere disclosure of one document on the face of it leads to the type of conclusion you draw.  You look at the documents in the context as a whole and draw some conclusions.  So what I propose to do is to take you to the documents first.    And having completed the documentation invite you to draw whatever conclusions that you would want to make in the light of the investigations and allegations.    Yes.  Chair if I may proceed.    On that premise?    We have dealt with the first email.  We have now established the substance of the annexure to that email.   Can I invite you to go to the second email which is SN2 as referenced on your one page 27 paragraph 15.2.  That email as I pick it up in EXHIBIT U1 is from page 467.    You will see that it is there identified as SN2.  Who is it from?    We will get to the attachment, but it is quite interesting that that email comes almost a minute after the first one was dispatched.    Now look at the attachment to that email.  It is from page 468.   What, what is the heading of that attachment?    Yes.  Can we get some names to the titles?  Who was the Acting CFO?    And who was the Acting GE at the time?    And the document.    Edwin Mabelane.  He is one of those Executives who was also suspended?    Yes.    In March alright and then you say   Paragraph 2 refers to your budget and it says   From your investigation have you seen such a budget yourself?    And who is BP, BPP?  What is BPP savings?    And what does it supposed to indicate?  I know you maybe au fait with this, but we are not.   Right.  Thank you.  Paragraph 3 refers to National    This paragraph as I read it suggests that there had to be compliance with National Treasury instructions relating to the situation of the Top Engineers Program.  Do you see that?    What conclusion do you draw from the fact that as early as July 2015 the conditions that had been agreed to between the CFO and the Group Executive of Eskom of course acting at the time made it quite clear that the Top Engineers Program had to be executed in accordance with the National Treasury instructions?    I understand, but what I find difficult to appreciate is this and please forgive my ignorance.  That at the point of disclosure of this document the internal Eskom Executives are aware that there is a need to comply with NationalTreasury instructions relating to procurement.  Those who receive it albeit without authorisation also are brought to understand and appreciate that there is a need to comply with National instruction, Treasury instructions on procurement and yet the whole contract is infected by these allegations of non-compliance.  Are you able to explain to us why within Eskom there will be a clear need and appreciation of compliance and outside to those who received this confidential information they too are told that if you want those opportunities in Eskom you must comply, but in the end there is wholesale and non-compliance?    Mr Mabuza I, I still do not have an appreciation why the contract would be executed the way it was in the light of this document, but leave it.  Let us go to the next document.  That is the document which begins at 470.    Yes indeed.    That is what I am trying to understand.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair thank you very much.  Mr Mabuza the next email is at page 470 and in the interest of time you will see that it is from Mr Matshela Koko.     Yes, it is, it is, it is the same as the previous one and it attaches the same.    Documentation.    And you come to the conclusion that it is a resent.    Why do you come to that conclusion?    Yes.  The next email is on page 472.    Yes.  What is curious about the time is that it is more or less simultaneous with email at SN3 which you describe as the resent.  Do you see that?   Almost to the same time two separate emails with different attachments are sent.    Yes.    Yes.  I would like to take you through the contents of theattachments.  Obviously on the face of the email they are described as Exco Resolution pdf.  Now let us look at the first attachment.  It beings at page 43, sorry 473.  I take it that you have read that attachment and I take it that you know what it deals with?     Yes.    Yes now on page 475, paragraph 1.3 the document indicates how Eskom should go about procuring external support for implementation of the top engineers program.  I would like you to deal with it, if you don’t mind.     Yes and if you go to page 477 you will see that several resolutions are called for and I am going to ask you to deal with three of them if you don’t mind, it’s up to you, you can deal with the rest but in the interest of time can you deal with the one in paragraph 2?     Three?     And who is the consultancy ...(intervention)      Alright and then the next one that I would like you to deal with on the record is paragraph 7.     Who was the Group, who was the Divisional Executive for Group Technology in Eskom at the time?     It was in July 2015.     Well when the resolution was signed ...(intervention)      20 March 2014, if the signature of Mr Dames is anything to go by.       I understand that and I would like you to apply to one key question, that I am going to ask you to deal with at the end of these documents, because the sequencing of all of these formal decisions is around March 2014, whenthe Top Engineers program was approved, when the relevant business case for its implementation were made and nothing happened and we pick-up the resuscitation of this very project somewhere in March, April, June, July 2015.  Please park that question because I would like you to deal with it once I have completed the sequence of the documentation relating to 2014.  We have completed the first resolution that was required to be adopted by Exco, on my papers it is only signed by Mr B Dames on page 477, and if you go to page 478 you will see that it refers to other executives but mine is not signed, how about yours?     So Mr Mabuza as I understand page 479 up to page 484 it’s the same document that we previously dealt with.  The only difference is that when you compare page 477 and 484 you will see that the rest of the executives signed that resolution on page 484.     Yes there is a script at the bottom, and I must confess that I can’t make head or tail, maybe it’s because of my four eyes, if you are able to read it can you read it for us so that we understand what it says, and I will ask you some few questions about it.     I thought that you would be able to tell us who made these annotations, if you don’t know we should not waste time about it.    Yes.    And Eskom’s internal processes were fully executed by the Executives involved who supported that program.  That was in, at worst case scenario, May 2014, do you agree with that?    My question is this, we now know that nothing was donerelating to the appointment of the consultants, until that program is revived in 2015.    The question is this, if you agree, why all of a sudden the archives of Eskom are raided in order to trigger this program and cause Eskom to execute it when it was left in the archives in 2014?    Chair can I move to the next email?    It is on page 493.  It is Annexure SM8, do you see that?    We have dealt with it by simply describing it on Friday but I would like you to deal with the contents of that email.  Again it is from the same email address but the date is different, what is the date?    What time was this at?MR JABULANE ALBERT    And the body of the email?    No, no.  Turn back to page 493.    Yes.  Alright.  Can we now look at the body of the attachment?  It begins at page 494.    Yes.   Now insofar as the dates are concerned can I ask you to rush ahead to page 501.      And you will see that the document is signed on the 8 August by two persons, who are they?    Yes.    Yes.  Chair that document I have referred to is the check list which accompanies the submission.    I merely wanted to draw Mr Mabuza’s attention to the date but the body of the submission itself Mr Mabuza as we said starts at 494.  The signature certifying that submission is at 499, do you see that?    Who signs it?    When did he sign it?    So he is responsible…    Yes it is on page 499 Chair.  So he is the person you would call the sponsoring executive?    Yes.  Now Mr Mabuza we have now established in relation to that document that it represents a submission sponsored by Mr Koko to the EXCOPS with a view to a further submission to the BTC, the Board Tender Committee.    On the 8 August 2015.    And these are the documents that are attached to an email which goes out.    In the evening?   Given that sequence of events and the timeline why do you think Mr Koko would send these documents to a third party such as infoportal1@zoho.com? What reason is there you can think of?    Chair I believe that my colleague Mr Ngcukaitobi would like to address you?    Address you on this issue.    Chair can I proceed?    Mr Mabuza the next email is on 515.  As I have it it is SM15, are you there?    In fact I must Mr – sorry I think I mislead you.  I skipped SM10.  If you do not mind can you back page to 512.  Are you at 512?    It is dated 21 September 2015 again it is from the sameperson to infoportal1@zoho.com, what is the subjects that side of that email?    And do you know who this intention to suspend in pursuit of disciplinary processes relate to?    Alright. Chair you will see that on page 513.      Who is Mr Phetla P-h-e-t-l-a as far as you know?   And do you know why was he suspended?    Yes.  Chair I believe that Ms Hofmeyr will give you some details regarding this suspension as was implemented against Mr Phetla and others including the late Doctor Van Riet who has made a statement to the commission before his untimely departure.  I am not going to explore that issue further other than to ask…    Mr Mabuza why would Mr Koko informinfoportal1@zoho.com of this suspension as far as you are able to help the commission on that score?    The next email Mr Mabuza is at 515.      Again it is from and to the same parties but what is the date of that email?    And what is the subject of that email?    Well.    Chair you will see that there is an attachment to that email on page 516.  The one that was given to us on Friday was not clear and I asked the lawyers of Eskom to give us a clearer copy.    And best available copy has now been given to me. Forthe sake of the record and before I hand you a copy can I ask Mr Mabuza to take us through that email so that we have it on the record?    Alright.  Chair two things I am not going to ask Mr Mabuza to speculate about why this letter was sent.  I would merely want him to confirm that this was an exchange between the Chair of the Board and the relevant executive authority to whom the board reported and that this letter was sent by Mr Koko to a third party?    Or expert who will give you an appreciation of the background to this letter of who drafted it and how ultimately it got to be sent to the relevant executive authority at the time.      So subject to all of those qualifications I will during the tea break ask your Registrar to replace the ineligible copy of page 516 with the one that we now have.    But for now we have Mr Mabuza’s evidence on record about this letter.  I see that he wants to say something in addition.    Yes.    Well Chair I think Mr Mabuza is working from…    The file that is rather fancy from Bowman.  But I suggest we work with the numbers at the top.  The pagination.    You referring to 447.    Let us work with 447.    Yes.    It is U1 Chair.    Your one visa is out.    Alright.  Mr Mabuza you see the actual visas appear from page 450.    450.    451.    And 452.    451 being Mr, 450 being Matshela Koko’s visa and 451 being Ms Elizabeth Koko and 452 being a visa of Mr P Koko, son of Matshela Moses Koko.    Mr Mabuza there have been speculations about precisely who is the person who utilised this controversial email address of infoportal1@zoho.com.  You have come to the conclusion that it is the email utilised by Mr Salim Essa.  Can I put the version of others who were confronted with the veryconclusion that you have now expressed before the Commission and ask you whether you know about this?  Of course Mr Koko has a version about who this email belongs to.  Do you know about that version of Mr Koko?    No.  I.    Yes.    Are you aware that Ms Daniels herself was confronted about that version of who is the precise user of inforportal1@zoho.com during thedisciplinary proceedings instituted against her?    Yes.  Chair, I suppose we can leave that to the tea adjournment and resume thereafter.    No, no we can proceed.    Until we are finished.    Mr Mabuza would you just come back to us on that issue after you have refreshed your mind?    The.   If you go back to 498.    U1.    Yes.  You remember this is the attachment to infoportal1@zoho.com the one that went in the evening of 20 past 10 on 8 August, but I refer you to 498 because that page contains commercially sensitive information relating to different suppliers from whom Eskom procured or sought to procure services relating to the vending transaction.  If you look at that page you will see that the names of thesuppliers are mentioned.  I am not going to repeat them and ask you to mention them by name here given questions of confidentiality, but you will see that the names are given with the level or the degree of charge [indistinct] and the estimation of the contractual amount over a spread of a period that Eskom would be required to pay.  Do you see that?    I struggle to understand why such commercially sensitive information relating to Eskom’s actual or potential suppliers would be distributed by an Executive of Eskom to third parties.  Can you think of any reason why would that be the case?    Mr Mabuza we have dealt with the emails up to 30 November, 30 September 2015 at page 515.  I would like to complete the rest of the emails relating to the first charge against Mr Koko before we take the tea adjournment.  The next email is the one of 14 November 2015.  You will find it at page 517.    Alright.  You confirm that it is the exchange between the same email addresses?    And the separate letter.   We will get to the one of 25 November.    I am merely asking you to identify the attachment to the email.    Now it, it gives the history of load shedding in Eskom and we have conversed that history with the Chairperson beginning from the enquiry by NERSA in 2008 and have also reflected on the investigation and preliminary findings of Dentons in 2015.  I would like you to take, I would like to take you to the body of the    You can start from the beginning.    Please.    You have done investigations relating to the import and significance of this attachment as was conveyed by Mr Koko to third parties.  Can you sum up the results of that investigation insofar as there is a description of the way forward and the conclusion expresses in this document on questions of load shedding and the game changing nature of how Eskom would deal with it going forward?    Yes.  Chair this pointed question on this is I mean you, you disclosed this email and the attachment to us.  I am struggling to understand why would you have done so in the light of the phases you have of the exchanging,exchanges between Mr Koko and Mr Businessman.    What, what should we make of it now that you have disclosed it?    Chair I left it that because.    I do not know whether the document on the face of it is an Eskom document or is just the views of Mr Koko expressing his own professional.    Or personal views about load shedding.    I cannot make any judgment call on it.    Because remember the charge against him.   Which includes a reference to this email is that he disclosed confidential information.  So I am not too sure whether this document.    Falls within that category or is something else.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair, I will take it up with Ms Norman who is in charge of that part of the arrangements.     Chair I also take it that today we are aiming at closing shop around two pm.    So that it may be necessary to steal liberties off the lunch adjournment to complete Mr Mabuza’s evidence.      Mr Mabuza before we adjourned I had asked you to reflect on the question whether you know what the version of Ms Daniel was in regards to the operator of this Infoportal1@zoho.com, you remember that?      Are you able to help us on that score and if I may guideyou, can you go to the smaller blue file, which is U5, in it you will find the findings of the Chairperson of the Disciplinary Committee.      That is our colleague Cassiem, and he talks about ...(intervention)       76.      He canvasses the charge against Ms Daniel from page 76 from paragraph 60 onwards, with reference to those paragraphs can you just take usthrough what the Chairperson of that enquiry said?       Can I ask you to then go to page 64 where the Chairperson begin to analyse questions of probabilities.     And then may I ask you to turn to page 78, paragraph67 where the Chairperson expressed his conclusion on the probabilities.       Yes but the text of the document I referred to was in 518 and 519.      I have not and that’s the point because there’s one mail which is the last email at page 28 15.9 which I wanted to take you through because it says something which in common language of exchanges between executives or professionals is unheard of.  You will find that email at page 521.      Yes and then you will see 15.9 refers to Annexure SM19.      And I merely ask you to make a note to cross-reference and say SM19 is to be found at U1 521.      Yes, I am grateful for that.  Mr Mabuza I mean to be quick, because time is not on our side, it’s exchanges between the familiar characters      Have you made any investigation as to who is the bossreferred to in this email?  If you have not let us know, but if you have we will welcome your input.      If you go to page 523 there is more by way of figures, which is given in respect of those mines.  You will see that the names begin on the extreme left hand, and then the next heading or column deals with the type of fuel provided from the mines, which is called assets and the next heading says acquis value, I suppose it’s acquisition value.  What is that supposed to refer to?      From those mines.    And it will generally be for the third parties to account forthe values of those mines in their books and financial statements.  How does it happen that this information is relayed to someone is Eskom?  Is there a transactional obligation between the mine operators concerned and Eskom to give out these values?    Yes.    Yes.  Do you know Mr Koko disclosed this information to infoportal?    Yes.  Chair I have completed the emails insofar as they relate to charge 1.    And unless Mr Mabuza has anything further to say in relation to charge 1 I will move onto charge 2, Mr Mabuza and after I have completed all of these charges I will ask you to tell us what the response of Mr Koko was to thesecharges.    Yes the emails relating to Mr Singh as far as I picked them up begin at page 399.    U1.      399 they are in different parts but the first set of emails they are in Exhibit 3 – Exhibit U1 page 399.    I think Mr Mabuza is elsewhere but let us go to where Mr Mabuza is Chair.    Because we…    401.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Can I –     Yes.   Yes.    Can I stop you there if you do not mind and I am sorry toderail your train of thought but I just want to place it and facts in context.      Thank you Chair.  Your view is that this Resolution was drafted outside Eskom and was sent by someone from Regiment Fahiema Badat.    To Mr Anoj Singh who then forwarded it to Mr Koko.    One matter of context I would like you to reflect on.  Is that as far as we have been able to establish as at 8 December 2015 Regiment was not providing any profession management or consultancy services of any kind to Eskom?    Why would Regiment be involved at this stage via these emails in advising Eskom’s CFO about a resolution?    Yes.  And we now know that from that Round Robin Resolution provided the estimate for the acquisition of the assets was 1.6/1.7 billion?    The email discussion is taken up further on that topic from 48 – from 408 as far as I am able to pick up.     And that is two days later on the 10 December?    Can you just present to us in the way you consider appropriate the flow of the emails on that day?    Yes.   Yes.    Minister Van Rooyen.    Mr Mabuza you can take comfort from the fact that we have specifically placed that issue before the Chairperson and we will deal with it when relevant witnesses come.    1.7 billion.    Ja if you go to page 408 Mr Mabuza and someone hadgiven me a very useful way of considering email.  You start from the middle or the bottom going up.  You will on that page the first email comes from Emerentia     Van Eisland at    Yes.  And it comes in at about 9   It is sent to Mr Anoj Singh?    And it is copied to Lee Zulu.   Yes and the subject is 1.7 billion guaranteed, do you see that?    And you can read the body of the email or summarise it.    Yes.    Yes.      Alive.    Yes we have dealt with that issue.    Now the template Chair you will find it on page 410 and 411 just to complete the email concerned.  After that email was sent and assuming it was received by Mr Anoj Singh he then refers it to someone else and you will see that the trail resumes right at the top of page 408.  Do you see that?    Ja why would Mr…    No apology Chair after you.    Thank you Chair.  And then the trail of email continues and this time I pick up the immediate next time line at page 415.  Right at the top you    Okay.  And it says sent from iphone which is a forwarded message and that is a message of the email from Emerentia.vaneisland@barclays.com we have dealt with this email.      So my reading of this trail of the email on this page is that Mr Anoj Singh also forwarded that email from Barclays to Ms Daniels?    And then Ms Daniels takes up the conversation betweenherself and Barclays on the preceding page which is 414.    And then the question of the CP’s is dealt with on page 417.     And as he is sending this email to Mr Wood he is forwarding a message from Ms Daniels?    And that agreement appears from page 419 up to page 422.      The question is why would Mr Singh send this agreement from Ms Daniels to Mr Wood of Regiment?    Yes Mr Mabuza unless you have anything further the rest of the emails deal with the content of the guarantee and the guarantee application form which was filled on behalf of Eskom.  Chair you will see that the form of the guarantee is at page 430.  And it ends up at page 432.  They are exchanges between Mr Zulu or Thuli Zulu with the rest of the of the Eskom people including Mr Singh.  I am not going to take you through them unless you want to say something about them?   Alright, we have seen how the email flowed from Mr Koko to Mr Woods concerning this guarantee, but there is another email that I would like you to look at.  This time it is from Mr Woods to Mr Singh.  You will find that email on page 433.  I am not too sure why you have given this email to us.    433.    Subject to possible explanations around fake documentation.  On the face of this email appears to be on the letterhead of Regiments from Mr Wood as the Executive Director.  Do you see that?    What is the date of that email?    Who?    The question is, I mean if at that point in time Eskom had been discussing with its banker that is Absa about the nature and template of the guarantee why would Mr Woods on the same day give to Mr Anoj Singh banking details of a different bank?    Okay.  We will leave that.    Hopefully Mr Singh will be able to explain to us why that was the case.  Mr Mabuza unless you want to say something about the exchange of the emails on the 1.7 pre-purchase or banking guarantee relating to Tegeta.  I would like to move to a different set of emails relating to Mr Singh and that I pick up from page 524, Chair.        Yes.  That completes the exchange of confidentialemails that formed the subject matter of charge number two against Mr Koko?    Hm.    Yes.  We now deal quite quickly with the email exchanges relating to charge three and you remember charge three was formulated in U5 page 34.  These are the email exchanges relating to the trip to Bali and Dubai?    You have dealt with some of these emails if not all ofthem.  You will see that if you go to page 34 of U5 paragraph 25 refers to Annexure SN29 and Chair in this fashion I ask you to cross-reference SN29 with U1, 446.    U5 page 34 paragraph 25.    On U1 it will be page 446.    Onwards.    Mr Mabuza you referred earlier to these emails in order to make the point that the connection you have made is that Mr Salim Essa who was using that infoportal1@zoho.com, is there anything further you would like to say about these emails with reference to charge number three?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  The last charge is number four.  You will find it at U5 page 35 and page 36.  I have looked at it.  It does not refer to any confidential exchange of information.  It merely relates to the allegation that Mr Koko deceived Parliament when he dealt with his role involvement in regards to the McKinsey contract.  How the despite on the invoices were ultimately settled on the mandate of the Board. Do you confirm that it does not relate to disclosure of any confidential emails?    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    No, no, no.    No.  We.    We are not at your statement.    We are at the, U5.  The, the, the file that was given to us by Bowmans on Friday.   The one that sets out the charges.        I think it is that one Mr Mabuza.    36, 35 and 36.    Yes.   Yes.    Are you there?    We have conversed the nature of the charge and we have drawn your attention to the fact it did not involve any allegation of exchange of confidential information.  That Chair completes the four charges brought against Mr Koko by Eskom.   And the substance of the evidence Eskom sought to rely to support those charges.  I would like to round up on the, those charges by asking Mr Mabuza whether he knows what the response of Mr Koko was to those charges.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair that completes the, the, the, the charges.  I would like to go quite quickly to the charges relating to Ms Daniels.   Mr Mabuza they are formulated in U5.  The very dark, the very bundle that you had.  They start from page 39 and you will see that on page 39 going to page 40 the first charge relates to the question of the very controversial email of “Businessman” at infoportal1@zoho.com.    You have talked a lot about this on Friday.    Do you have something more to say in relation to it?    Yes on.    Yes.   Yes and the figures concerned are mentioned on page 51 paragraph 4.2.    Yes.  Do you know what her response in relation to that charge was?    Yes.    Mr Mabuza I have read the findings of the Chairperson fairly quickly.  I could not find any response of Ms Daniel to this charge.    Chair finally can I deal with questions of emails?    As they appear to have been exchanged betweenMs Daniels and other third parties.    Mr Mabuza they begin at 531 of U1.    Are you at U1 page 531?    You will see that it is an email from Ms Daniels.    Do you, do you, do you, do you recognise that email address?    Well can I stop you there.  I mean Mr Howa sends an email to Ms Daniels at her private email and then it relates to the session and assignment of the coal supply agreement between Optimum and Eskom and then she then sends that email from that private email to Eskom’s official email.  The question is why would Mr Howa send this email to Ms Daniels?   Alright, I’m still unclear about why would Mr Howa do so, I mean he is not an employee of Eskom, he is not an official of Eskom.    And give a semblance that those were – they appear to be the decisions of Eskom?    When in truth and in fact they are not?    Page 533, there are two emails which Ms Daniels sends to different persons, let’s start with the top one, it is from her official Eskom email, correct?    The date is?   The time is?    It is sent to?    And the subject matter is?    Okay and more or less the same time an email is sent toa number of persons, can I ask you to go through them fairly quickly.    It is marked of high priority and also confidential.    Do you see that?    So that’s on all considerations, everyone to whom it is sent will know that it’s a confidential document and it is of high priority.  Now if you go to page 535 you will see an email from who – who does it come from?    The date?    And the time?    That would be more or less two hours after she had already sent the confidential email to board members.    Yes, give and take two and a half hours.   And what is the subject matter of that email from businessman to Ms Daniel?    And what does it say in the body of it?    No, no you’re correct Chair, by this time Businessman had received the statement, he had reviewed it, he’s making his input and he is lining anarrative which you know by now is the (indistinct) in July.    And he is advising Ms Daniel if she is happy with her input then she can go and that’s what Ms Daniel says right in the next email    Indeed, in the statement.    And again Mr Mabuza we have dealt with the fact thatas between Ms Daniels and board members that was a confidential statement.    But for reasons not yet explained Businessman has the right or interest to make an input in it by running a narrative and you will see in the middle of that page if you add 535 Ms Daniel responds.    And what is her response?    Yes.      The next email Mr Mabuza is at page 535 for the boardroom, it goes to page 536.  What is the document, where does it come from? MR JABULANE ALBERT    Right, and you will see that it’s sent from a Samsung device.    And Mr Mabuza I see a repeat of the emails that we have dealt with on the same page, 536, I’m not going to take you there.    And then I see another email on page 538, I can’t make sense of it, are you able to help us what that email is supposed to be.  If you can’t I’ll take you to the last email exchanges on this score.    Yes, 539 it’s an email from Ms Daniel, it’s 13   It is sent to the Chairperson and the Board members that you have previously identified and again it deals with the statement of the Chairperson, it’s marked high priority and it addresses the Chairperson do you see that?      Yes, that’s as far as the email exchanges on thestatement is concerned and the body of the statement as I pick up is from page 541 to 542 and you will see that the eight points listed on page 542 there’s nothing for the present purposes which turns around that I think those are the matters that have been confirmed in the email. Mr Mabuza let’s skip something, you can take it for granted that I have explored your evidence relating to the exchange of emails and the charges that you refer to in your statement.  If you are happy that you have said what you wanted to say on those matters I will then quickly take you back to your statement.      Yes.    Chair it remains for me to conclude the evidence of Mr Mabuza with reference to is statement.  I have explored with sufficient details the matters that you deal with from page 18 paragraph 51 up to page 24 paragraph 66 of your statement.      Mr Mabuza are you comfortable that we should now round up with reference to your statement?    Yes, from page 24, paragraph 68 you deal with deficiencies in Eskom’s procurement processes.  We are grateful for your suggestions but these are the matters which the Chairperson would reflect on when he considers appropriate recommendations flowing from such funding as he would make.  Then from page 27 you deal with specific transactions and I would like to go through each of them fairly quickly.     The first is New Age, do you see that?    We have already told the Chairperson that this is amatter that the legal team will deal with as a cross-cutting matter because it affects also procurement in other State Owned Entities.  Is there any matter that you would like to raise with us concerning TNA Media?    The next transaction is the one that you have talked about at length, it’s the McKinsey/Trillion transaction, we have looked at it, we raised with the lawyers, we raised with the lawyers of Eskom one matter arising from that litigation.  It is before the Court, is there anything that you would like to share with us insofar as your evidence is concerned?    Thank you for that correction because the reference to Mr Govender caused great consternation of over the weekend.  The next transaction is the Impulse International Pty Limited.  We have reflected on what you have said there and the sum total of it is that you have reported this transaction to law enforcement authorities including the Hawks and the SIU.    Chair I don’t think anything further arise from this for the present purposes and the last one is the accounting services or auditing services relating to Nkonke Incorporated and it’s her accounts KPMG amongst others.  Quicklycan you take us through what your concerns are in that regard?    Yes, thank you Chair.  Mr Mabuza we have indicated to you earlier on that that issue the Tegeta acquisition of Optimum Coal will be dealt with in the course of the coming days.      Yes.    Yes.  You have indicated that the commission should look into the conduct of the ex-group CEO in relation to the Oakbay/Tegeta’s acquisition of Optimum Coal as a matter of concern to you, correct?    Yes.  I wanted to assure you that the commission will do so.    There is another issue that the commission is looking at in relation to him and this is the question of the payment of the pension retirement which is now before the courts.  Maybe you can elaborate on the status or the currentstatus of the court process, do you know?    Chair we will investigate the current status but you did invite us to give you a copy of the full bench judgment.    Yes we will.  Yes.    Mr Mabuza I was at Nkonke.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair we have looked at the affidavits and we thought we had looked at enough of them.    But we were told when we met the [indistinct] that thereare supplementary affidavits also.    But the quantum of documentation starts from the one end to the other end of a table.  We do not want to trouble you with that for now.    But we will certainly canvass the affidavits and the stance taken by the parties.    When hopefully McKinsey takes the witness box for you because it relates to them.    And it relates to Trillian.    Insofar as Trillian is concerned we will canvass the issue as and when the relevant [indistinct] of Trillian takes the witness stand.   Yes.    But we do not want to trouble you with.    Yes, yes.    No we have and I am sure my colleagues working on the Transnet.    Evidence they have also done it because it has this continuous contractual relationship between the two state owned entities.    Mr Mabuza I was at Nkoke and I had asked you to sum up quite quickly what your concerns are in that regard?    Page 37 of your statement.      Thank you for that.  We have some suggestions to make to the Chairperson how the matter should be taken forward without prejudicing the SIU investigation and or the Hawks investigation.  The last transaction oh no not the last – ja the last transaction is – no the second last is Warung.  You have dealt with this issueat length when you were dealing with the disciplinary proceedings instituted against Mr Maritz.  Is there any other issue you want to add in the light of what you have said on Friday?    Yes and Chair we have had discussions with the lawyers of Mr Maritz and they have preliminarily indicated that they would want to participate in the commissions processes with a view to present his version.       So there are logistically arrangements that are being made …    In order to facilitate that level of participation.  MrMabuza the last one is Dong Feng and it is also a matter which is before the courts Chair.      I can tell you Mr Mabuza that I know a little more about this because of my involvement in it.  So we will leave it in the courts until the courts pronounce on it.  I have been asked to correct a statement that you made that when Mr Maritz signed the Warung letter or sort of contract or letter the Chairman at the time was Mr Zethemba Khoza and not Mr Ben Ngobane.     Yes.  There are two other transactions which I have not picked up from your statement and I would like your comment on them.  Because there has been a historical assessment of those transactions by amongst others Dentons in relation to the far reaching cost over runs relating to Eskom’s capital expenditure arising from those transactions.  The first is the new billed project relating to Kusile.    Off the cuff do you know what was the initial capex for that project?    Where is the cost?    As we speak today?   Which is twice more than the…    Give or take.    I take it that Eskom you have made investigations on why there is this time and cost over-run of this scale?   Mr Mabuza I picked up somewhere I am not too sure whether it is in your statement or other public documentation that Eskom had been concerned about those two projects to a point where it has laid criminal charges and or referred the matter to the SIU for investigation?   Do you know the status of the investigations concerned?    Mr Mabuza I have explored what I wanted to ask you.  If there are any concluding remarks you would like to make the floor is yours.    Five past two.    Mr Mabuza has had an occasion – sorry an opportunity to consult with his lawyers now.    And I am sure he would like to make closing remarks.    Chair that concludes today’s proceedings.    And tomorrow you will hear a lot about Brakfontein from Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV  VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes but we can fairly proceed on the basis that the executive signed ...(intervention)     Yes, what follows thereafter is a submission document, you will find it as part of the attachment from page 485.  It says submission to Exco, do you see that?    And then I’ve looked at it quite quickly and I see that at the end at page 490 that submission is dated 24 February 2019 and it is signed by Mr Haron, do you see that?    In his capacity as Group Executive Technology and Commercial.    In terms of time I mean this submission seems to predate the resolution that we have looked at.    So if one were to reasonably speculate about the sequence of documents it would mean that this submission went to the Executive Committee members before they signed the Round Robin Resolution?    Alright, it deals in substance more or less the same issue about ...(intervention)     Correct.   Yes Chair.    No, no Chair remember the evidence of Mr Mabuza is don’t look at the review dates because the documents are ...(intervention)     If you go to page 490 Chair.    Indeed.    Thank you Chair.  Finally Mr Mabuza the submission by Mr Lacmia Haron was accompanied by a checklist which you will find from page 491 and 492 and that checklist is certified by him on the same date he signed this submission, which is the 24th of February 2014, do you see that?    Now back to my question and to sum up in order to contextualise that question, it becomes clear that somewhere February and May 2014 Eskom’s internal processes were triggered to get a final approval from the executive committee on the desirability of the Top Engineers Program. 
MABUZA:   This document comes from Baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com, Baldwin Ngubane I believe the Chairman of Eskom here 
MR NGCUKAITOBI:  Thank you Mr Chair I simply indicated to Mr Maleka asked himwhether or not he would like me to respond but there is very little to respond to other than to record our apologies and to note that if something of the sort happened it will not happen again.    Thank you Mr Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning DCJ.     Chair at your request may I intervene to place on record certain matters that need in time to be finalised.    You will recall Chair that on the 12th of February 2019 Ms Mentor gave further evidence before you.    During the course of her evidence reference was made to two video recordings, one taken by representatives of the Commission of a tour of the Gupta residences and certain matters dealt with during that tour, and reference was also made to a video taken by representatives of the Gupta family, and it’s in relation to that latter video that I address you.    You will recall that informally at least it was suggested that that second video, for the sake of convenience may I refer to it as the Gupta video, be admitted in evidence.    You made two informal rulings, or you gave certain clear directions in that regard to counsel representing the Gupta family.  The essence of what you said was that in the first place you would have to be persuaded that counsel for the Gupta family had standing to address you on the issue.  If that effort of persuading you was successful then you would need to be addressed on the merits or demerits of thevideo being admitted.    That has been communicated in writing to the attorneys representing the Gupta family.    In response there was a long letter raising various issues and I won’t detail the contents of that, it is not necessary at this stage, but on receipt of that letter a clear communication was sent by the Commission to attorneys representing the Gupta family, which in essence notified them of what you had said on the 12 th of February 2019, attaching the transcript of the relevant passages.   Saying that the quest to have it admitted in the letter of the Guptas was not a formal application that complied with your requirements and that if they still wished to have the Gupta video admitted in evidence they would have to deal with it in a formal application.      Separately there have been communications between counsel but it’s not necessary to deal with those before you.  So the position now Chair is that the attorneys for the Gupta family are on terms to make a formal application should they wish it to be admitted.  I may say that from our own observation as a legal team such an application is unlikely but we cannot be sure, so the intention is to put them on terms, to bring an application by a certain date and if that is not done we will assume that no application will be forthcoming. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SCU: And what does it tell him? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Indeed.    Chair we have made arrangements with the witness to be here at ten o’clock.    We were not aware of an early start for tomorrow.    I do envisage needing more than the ordinary hours of sittings.    So I think ten o’clock should be fine.    Thank you Chair.
