CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Chair today we going to briefly present the evidence of Doctor Ramontja.  Fortunately we are not going to work with huge bundles of documentation.    Yes.    Oh ja.      Well it is marked but it is marked on the spine.    And it has got his name.    But when you look for the statement itself and you look at the index you look for affidavit by Doctor Ramontje in re you see at the top something that says affidavit of Snehal Nagar.    And then a lot of annexures that are marked but nothing tells you there one of those is a statement by Doctor Ramontje so I had to look and look and look and then ultimately I stumbled upon it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes but I think what should happen is the index should indicate the names of statements for example just like all affidavits just like Mr Nagar’s one because if all I am looking at is this file, this lever arch file so I see in the spine there is the name of Snehal Nagar and Ramontja so it means their statements are in here.    So then I page through and then I see there is an index.    Then I want to see on page I will find Doctor Ramontja’s affivadit.    Or statement.    I look at the index I see there is the index tells me about Mr Nagar’s affidavit and it tells me where to find it and then for the rest it says it is annexures.    So I do not get to know that one of the annexures is Doctor Ramontja’s one.  I think the index is the one that needs to be amended or corrected.    Or unless or otherwise on the spine something must say annexure so and so.    Then I will know and look for that annexure and then find the statement.    But I did find it.  It did not take too long.    But I hoped I did not have to spend a few minutes looking for [indistinct].    Ja maybe.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja I think what – what may have to happen is either maybe apart from the member from the legal team maybe the people or the leader of the people who do this part of the job needs to be present when maybe I explain exactly how I would like things to happen.  But I would have thought that it should be easy but it does not prove to be easy.    Ja okay alright.    Yes, ja.    Yes.    They do not seem to …    Yes.  No, no that is fine.  So maybe arrangements will have to be made for that.    Okay thank you. I had indicated that I would deal with Mr Van Rooyen’s application for leave to cross-examine.    And I think I must dispose of that quickly.    Mr Van Rooyen.    Ja okay.  No that is fine.      Oh they are all present?    Okay no that is fine.  Let me quickly – Mr Van Rooyen brought an application for leave to cross-examine Mr Fuzile.  I suggested to all parties that it might be a good idea if I deal with the matter in chambers and therefore without oral argument and everybody agreed to the suggestion I have considered the application and have reached my conclusion.  The conclusion is that I do grant Mr Van Rooyen leave to cross-examine Mr Fuzile and I will indicate at the commencement of the cross-examination the amount of time that I will allow for that cross-examination.  And I do also grant leave so far as it may be necessary for Mr Van Rooyen to give evidence himself as well.  And in due course arrangements will be made to fix the date for both the cross-examination of Mr Fuzile by Mr Van Rooyen’s counsel as well as for Mr Van Rooyen to give evidence.  That is how I dispose of that matter.  We may now proceed with today’s matter.    Thank you.    In which file?    Oh okay.    Ja no I have got the two letters as well as the transcript which I do not think you will need today.    You just need this – just the two letters?    Okay. Yes.    The oath?    Okay.  Please do the necessary.    Yes.  Thank you.    Ja.    Ja.    Because of the commission?    Oh oh.  Doctor Ramontja.      Yes no let me encourage you to explain the circumstances surrounding your stepping down.    Because to the extent that they may be relevant to what the commission is investigating it is very important that we get told what happened and because we must know as much as possible.  We must know the truth and we must know all that information because we may have to or we have to at some stage confront the question why did those things happen.  And why did they happen at the time that they did happen?  We have to confront the questions of what is it that we could have done differently?  What is it that somebody else could have done?  Are there circumstances that put pressure on people not to do things the way they would have like to be done and if want those things not to happen again and not happen to anybody and not to happen in our own country, not to happen in government departments what must be done and the commission must look at that so that if at all possible pain that may have been suffered by certain people, certain individuals, certain people who may have been committed to the right things to doing the right thing should not happen again or should not happen to others in the future.  So I just want to encourage you that if it is something that is relevant to what the commission is looking at please talk freely and inform me as much as possible of what may have happened.    Thank you.    How do you spell Kuben?    Okay.    No I do not remember at all.    Oh okay.    Oh I remember Moodley I did not remember the name, I remember the surname.    Ja. Okay, yes, thank you.    Yes I remember Mr Mabaso yes.    Did you say Miss?    How do you spell the surname?    Thank you.      Did you know them before – were they people that you knew of or that you had met before?    You have never met them before.    Yes.    Okay, okay.  Yes you may continue.    And that was reassuring?    Hm.    Hm. Yes.  Yes, continue.    In terms of telling us the circumstances around your stepping down.    If there is still more to tell.    Was that December 20?    2015, ja.    Okay.    When you were called the impression or your understanding was that you were being called by the Minister?    Okay.    Yes.    This is the 10th?    Of December 2015?    And he had been sworn in when?  He had been back for some time.    Oh, of 2015?    Okay.    It was a shock to you?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    And those would have been speeches for the Minister or what?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    DG.    Ja.    Yes.    Did you ever speak to Minister Zwane on that day when his advisor told you that he wanted your resignation letter within 20 minutes?    Ja.    Hm.    And prior to this day when his advisor said the Minister wanted your resignation letter had there been any discussion between the two of you at all about a possibility of you stepping down?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, but do you recall about when that flight was in relation to?    The date when you were asked to put in a resignation letter?  Is it a month or a week’s time?    Oh, okay.    Ja, but what was his reaction to your statement in the flight when you said you think you should step down?  What was his reaction to that?    Okay.    And then the next thing was this particular day when Mr Mabaso said the Minister.    Wanted your resignation letter?    Okay, alright.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.  If I could ask was your decision to decline it connected in anyway with the fact that you may have thought that the two of you did not have, had not been able to achieve a good rapport with each other?  You said earlier on that you.    Could tell that there was no good rapport between the two of you.    Was it connected with that or it was simply because you had other arrangements/    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No, thank you Dr Ramontja for that, but there is just one part which I would like you to expand on if you are able to.  You did say that the role that Minister Zwane’s advisors were playing in the department was not the role that they should be playing.    So I would like you to expand on that and tell me more in terms of what it is that they were doing at a factual level which really should not have been done by advisors should have been left to you or other officials and so on.  I would like you to.    Expand on that if you are able to.    Oh.    Hm.    Hm.    And when you say it was centralised in Minister Zwane’s office what do you mean?  Is that where certain decisions were being taken or what exactly do you mean?    As DG?    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    You said you referred to when they went, even when they went to Zurich.    Okay, explore it.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay, alright explore it.    Or you want to lay a foundation first?    Okay, no that is fine.    That is fine.    Okay.    Okay.    But let us do this, so you have finished the circumstances surrounding your stepping down as far as you are concerned in terms of giving us?    Okay.    Okay.    Maybe before that Mr Maleka I do not know whether you recollection is correct to the extent that you say it was after the appointment.  My recollection was that one of the things that was intriguing was that as I understood it Mr Fuzile said he had that conversation with Mr Godongwana before the announcement was made.    And the intriguing thing was how he would have known in advance.    Ja.    Ja.    Or maybe let me put it like this.  As far as I can recall Mr Fuzile testified that I think on the day on which the announcement for, the announcement about the dismissal of Mr Nene and the appointment of his replacement on the day before that announcement was made and if I recall correctly it was made in the evening in terms of the evidence and he was on his way I do not know whether he was on his way home in the afternoon or somewhere and he received a call from Mr Godongwana and in their conversation Mr Godongwana talked, I think they had already been rumours that Mr Nene was going to be fired and Mr Godongwana said that Mr Fuzile was going to get a Gupta Minister and that the Gupta Minister would arrive with advisors and that that Minister would not even be knowing those advisors and he suggested that Mr Fuzile should talk to you.  My impression was that he, Mr Godongwana, was saying to Mr Fuzile if you want to know more about what I am talking about or about these situations talk to Dr Ramontja.  That was my impression of the evidence.  So I think in that context, it is in that context that Mr Maleka is asking whether there is anything that you are able to tell us on that order from the basis for Mr Godongwana to think that you could assist Mr Fuzile to understand what was about to happen in his department.    Yes.    Let me try and find it.  Is U 3 an annexure in the same file?    Because behind the statement there is no annexure.    And this is not a file where you can tell me a paginated page number, where to find it.    Well something really needs to be done about these things.  I have got TR12.  You said TR14.    Ja, something just needs to be done with regards to even the pagination, you know.  It is quite convenient if there is a pagination that covers the whole lever arch file, because then that makes it easier.  Okay, I have got it.    You said that your department began to be involved in – on issues relating to Optimum during Minister Ramatlhodi’s time.     During Minister Ramatlhodi’s time who was dealing with those issues, I mean you just told us that if I recall correctly issues relating to Optimum became centralised in Minister Zwane’s time during Minister Zwane’s – in Minister Zwane’s office during his time.  During Mr Ramatlhodi’s time were they being handled by the Department’s officials in the normal course?    And was keeping you informed?    Yes.    Okay, going back to the trip to Zurich so did your DDG go with the Minister?    The one who was dealing with issues relating to Optimum?    Yes.    Into the meeting?    Do you know whether that DDG is still there?    Ja, what was his name again?    Mr Joel Raphela?    Okay.    You are telling us what happened when he started.    Ja. Do.    Maybe before that let’s talk about Mr Koko’s letter to you, you said or at least maybe your statements says you don’t remember how it got to you but it got to you at a certain stage, is that right?    The letter addressed to you from Mr Koko.    Your statement says if I recall correctly that you don’t recall how it got to you but it did get to you, is that right?    Yes now did you at any stage give it to – or a copy thereof to the Minister, Minister Zwane or any of his advisors or any of his staff?    Yes, and before you signed your response to Mr Koko at the time that you did were you aware that maybe some – the Minister might be having this letter or somebody, or one of his advisors might be having it?    But you didn’t know for sure.    Yes, but ...(intervention)     But wouldn’t  normally the letter show that it’s been copied to somebody else?    That’s what normally happens.    Okay Mr Maleka you can take continue.    Was it normal for you to as DG to receive draft letters from the Office of the Minister or any of the previous ministers in circumstances where you had not known in advance that somebody would prepare a draft for you.    Was it normal for you to receive draft letters, draft responses to letters addressed to you from any of your officials in circumstances where you had not discussed the possibility of them doing a draft for you?    But I’m talking about the circumstances where you had received a letter, in other words somebody had addressed a letter to you, somebody from outside maybe to be specific, and then you have not discussed with anybody the possibility of that person drafting a response for you and then suddenly you get a response, a draft response.    Because I see, I can understand as DG you just said a while ago that as DG you can’t be everywhere and you can’t do everything, obviously you have to rely to DDG’s, you have to rely on other officials and I can understand that very often maybe on a daily basis one or other official is dealing with a matter where they need you to make some decision or they need you to do some – write some letter to somebody, and therefore they might draft it for you, that I can understand so I am more concerned about the situation where you receive a letter from outside the department, that is addressed to you, and then you get a draft response from somebody without that person having had any discussion with you or you having had any discussion with that person about the possibility of them drafting a response for you.    Okay, thank you.  Mr Maleka?    Yes.    Yes.    Before you answer that.  Please do not forget that question.    Mr Maleka intervened while you were telling me something, had you finished telling me about the relationship between Eskom and your department?    I want to give you a chance to finish telling me that if there was still if you had not finished.    Okay.    Ja if it explains more the relationship tell me.    Oh the one you signed?    Ja.    So you had – although you had signed the letter.    You had not intended it to leave your office as yet when it left?    And that is why you had not put the date on which you signed it because you wanted to revisit it?    From what you have said before.    So you did not authorise it being sent away, sent off to the addressee?    It was taken from your office under circumstances that you do not know?    And you tried to find out afterwards by asking your secretary whether there had been any recording as to when it was taken and you could not find anything?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Before you do so – so there is something quite strange about these letters.  The one that was addressed to you by Mr Koko reached you but if I recall correctly you said you do not remember who brought it to you, is that right?    Do you know whether it came to you by – it would have come to you through the normal mail – post or –or it would have been delivered by hand or anything, do you know?    So the one from Mr Koko was also not recorded?    And your PA also did not know how it came to – to be on your desk or …    But at that time did you ask her that time or you only asked her recently?    Oh at that time you did not ask her about how it came?    Yes.  But the one that you signed in response you did ask her about whether anything was recorded about how it left your office?    That one you did ask her at that time?    Only recently?    But what – what I – what I am trying to understand from your side is if you received – if you receive a letter such as the one you received from Mr Koko and you did not know how it came and then the next thing without you having spoken to anybody about the contents of that letter and having asked that person to draft a possible response for you you find a drafted response on your desk without knowing who brought it. You sign it.  You do not put a date when you signed it. You intend to revisit it. Before you revisit it it disappears.  All of those things seems strange to me.  I am wondering why you should not have been quite concerned and take steps to really establish what was happening?    I can understand being caught up and forgetting.    That there was a letter that you wanted to revisit that I can understand but I am concerned about a situation where at some stage you remember that there was this letter which I had signed but I did not date it because I wanted to revisit it. But it is no longer there and I do not know who took it.  And I did not intend that letter to leave my office as yet because I still wanted to satisfy myself about certain things that is why I wanted to revisit it.  It is gone.  You do not know who has taken it and well you do ask your secretary and she gives you an answer that suggests that she does not also know who took it.  And then you do not follow up. I mean – when you received that draft or the response or the draft you I think you said that you – you realised that it was saying enquiries Mr J Rapella.  Now that was your DDG who was dealing with matters relating to Optimum as I understand and or Eskom.  So I would have expected that he would have been the first person or at least one of the people you would approach to say I got a draft response which was left in my office for my signature. I read it.  I signed it but I did not date it because I did not want it to go yet. I was – still wanted to revisit it.  It has disappeared.  Do you know anything about it because you are in charge of Eskom issues or Optimum issues?    Okay Mr Maleka I see that we are…    About 19 minutes past.    Let us take the short – the tea adjournment and we will resume at twenty-five to.      We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes you may proceed Mr Maleka.    Yes.    Oh, yes.  I actually forgot about.    That part, okay.    Yes, okay.  Alright.    Well as you heard from my questions before the break I am also concerned about the fact that after you became aware that this letter that you had signed on the basis of assumptions and you did not know had brought it to your desk and you had not asked anybody to draft a response for you and it disappeared from your desk under mysterious circumstances.  You did not even as I infer from your evidence you did not phone Mr Koko and say Mr Koko you wrote me a letter and there was a response that I had signed to go to you, but I did not intend it to leave my desk yet and it had left my desk.  Have you by any chance got it?  Please do not act on it, because I had not intended to leave yet.  I still wanted to revisit it or something like that.  You did not do anything like that?    Hm.    And that concerns me, you know.    Particularly in circumstances, if it was your own letter in the true sense.  You had drafted it, you knew exactly what the whole thing was about and it left, but you knew that there was nothing for you to continue to look at that may have been fine, but you presumed that certain people had discussed certain things that were dealing with Optimum, Eskom and the letter says certain things will be done and it says them under your own hand and you do not even know whether those things will be done I assume, because you do not know who drafted it and there is no assurance that what you say is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    But you see my point is exactly that.    That because on your own evidence you have said that the situation was not normal.    Issues relating to Optimum had been centralised in the Minister’s office.    You were marginalised.  You were excluded from decisions that were being taken, you know, and you own DDG whereas before Minister Zwane’s time when he spoke to you about issues falling under him he would talk to you and update you properly.  On your own evidence you have told me he was now whispering to you about what was happening.  All of these things I am suggesting to you should have put on the alert and to have been even more concerned about a letter that you had not authorised to be taken out of your office having left without your knowledge in circumstances where you had not dated it.  So I am saying those strange and abnormal circumstances that you have told me about are the very circumstances that should have made you more worried and if you were more worried you ought to have taken steps to say well that letter whoever took it must be stopped, because it did not leave my office without, with my authorisation and you know who it was addressed to, Mr Koko.  So whoever took it must have intended to send it to Mr Koko and there is no reason why you could not have phoned Mr Koko and say disregard such and such a letter if it comes to you, because I have not, I did not intend it to leave.  You will see it does not have the date when I signed it and that is because I was still going to revisit it.  Maybe I will respond with another letter or something like that.  So I just want to mention that and to give you a chance to say something and I am mentioning it simply because I am quite concerned about it.    Thank you.  You should may proceed Mr Maleka.    Of the bundle in front of me?    Ja, just read.    I have got it, but you can just read.    Yes.    Ja, you may proceed.    Thank you.  Dr Ramontja, this letter is not dated, but do you recall more or less round what date you would have signed it?    The one to which you were responding was signed by Mr Koko on.    6 December 2015.  So, and on 10 December you were asked to resign, to put in your letter of resignation    But you only left at the end of January.    So are you able to say more or less around what date you think you must have signed it?    So.    Around the 7th?    Just after the 6th?    Yes.    It was.    Around.    Yes.  Okay and in preparation for coming here, did you ask Mr Raphela about whether he ever knew anything about this letter?    Yes.    Yes, thank you.  Thank you Dr Ramontja for coming.    To give your evidence.  I am going to excuse you for now.  Should a need arise for you to come back we will ask you to come back.    Thank you, you are excused.    Thank you.    Ja, no that is fine.    Will five minutes be enough?  Shall we say five minutes?    Okay.  Let us say we will resume at 10 past 12.    We adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius?    Good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good afternoon Mr Nene, thank you.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Yes Ms Sello, some of us who have been working from quite early know that it is afternoon now.       Yes.    Yes that was my recollection, so what is it doing here?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    I don’t what they are.    Let’s deal with this properly.  Is this in respect of the supplementary statement or the original statement.     Okay, so just take me back what had happened then?    Yes.    Yes, and what were those reasons?    And the statement was supposed to have arrived when?    So in other words how long was the delay?    Yes, just tell me what it says?    Yes, yes, it ended up arriving on the 2nd of October?    Okay, so the delay was about two weeks.    Yes for the reason that you have given.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja, I may not need you to hand them up.  I just need you to tell me whether you sent out the notices, when you sent them out, whether there has been reaction to them and when that was.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes okay, no that’s fine.  The REQUIRED CONDONATION IS GRANTED.    Yes Mr Pretorius, I think ...(intervention)    Just administer the oath, thank you.    I understood Mr Nene it was end of last year that you had injured your foot, I hope it has fully recovered.    Thank you.    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Oh, I was looking at ...    We might have to take a short adjournment, let’s take a five minutes adjournment while that is being attended to.      We will adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes Mr Pretorius?    Didn’t they before, or maybe – well let them do it, it’s okay.    Oh, okay.    Thank you very much.  Yes, you may proceed.    What page is that Mr Pretorius?    Okay, I see it ja.    Ja okay.    Thank you, thank you for coming back.    Ja no that is fine.  Issues that fall under the PIC will have to be looked at carefully in the light of the fact that there is a commission chaired by Justice Mpathi which is looking at certain issues relating to the PIC so the legal team of the commission will need to apply their minds to the question whether it is not appropriate for those issues to be dealt with exclusively by the PIC commission to avoid a situation where same issues are dealt with in two different commissions with the risk that may arise of different findings being made.  The legal team will need to apply their minds to those issues because if and when they come before me I will ask for argument on those issues.    Yes.    Yes.    YEs.    Yes.    Yes no that is fine but you might need to do more than just relying on your understanding of the terms of reference because I seem to remember reading in the media and I do not know if it was true but I seem to remember reading in the media that that commission had taken the view that its mandate is wider than what seems to be generally understood. So some communication might be necessary to understand whether there is a different understanding of the terms of reference whether that is based on a different interpretation of the terms of reference so that we can be fully informed before we make up our own minds.  Ja okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja thank you.    Okay.    Well let us rather find out what the problems are because we see we are still online.   Will somebody talk to Mr [indistinct] Stimella     Oh he does not know?    Oh okay then we may as well take the lunch break we are five minutes before one o’clock and hopefully those who need to attend to it will attend to it even during the lunch hour so that when we come back we can resume and proceed smoothly.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn.    Yes you may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Mr Pretorius.    I am sorry.  Do you want to let him finish properly before you follow up?  I thought you had not finished, Mr Nene had you finished answering that question?    Oh, okay.  I just want to be sure that you have been able to answer.    Fully, okay.    I am sorry.  Can I ask you to?    Go back to your first sentence in answer.  I did not hear some of the words in your answer.    No, just this last, the last two sentences I think.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja, you may do so, but just remind me again when was your reappointment of Minister of Finance [intervenes]?    And soon after appointment you received a request or application from the Governor of the Reserve Bank or when you were reappointed it was already pending in your office?    Okay.    Yes.    The decision had not been taken yet?    You were going to be the person to make a decision?    Okay.  No, thank you.  You may read the SMS.    And what was the date of that SMS?    So it was a week or two, within a week or within two weeks after your reappointment?    Okay, did you say around the 10th.    Okay thank you.    You seemed to be reading from something just now, is that something that’s part of what we have here or is it something ...(intervention)     No that’s fine.    Maybe before you do that can we just get the dates if possible that the first visit may have been around, what time and the last time around what time, if at all possible?    Yes, if you do cover it somewhere you can just mention, I just want as you give the explanation I just want to know what period we are talking about.    And in particular it would have been after also the landing of the aircraft at Waterkloof because you became Minister of Finance as I understand for the first time in 2014, is that right?    And I think the landing of the aircraft was in 2013 based on some of the evidence, yes.    You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    No, no continue.    Thank you Mr Pretorius.  I am going to want to talk more on the last topic that Mr Pretorius asked you a question on but before that I just want to ask a few questions in regard to other aspects of your evidence.  You said that you have been able to establish that you visited the Gupta residence 8 times, is that right?    Yes.  Six times when you were Minister – Deputy Minister of Finance and two times when you were Minister of Finance.      Yes.  Now that seems to me that – that seems to me to be quite a few times and I think you used the word several times a while ago and each time at the residence, is that right?    Oh ja , ja.    But basically at their places?    Ja, ja.  Now that may be concerning to some people to say was that not too many times.  What would you say if anybody thought along those line?    Yes.    Well I think you are right to say in principle a visit to somebody even at their residence as a minister on its own you know should not be a problem.  But I think in the context of this family there may be part of the concern might be in the minds of some South Africans might be that we have heard evidence in this commission for example and I think it was in the media even before this commission that members of this family would sometimes boast that they call Ministers to their residence whenever.  So partly when one has regard to evidence or allegations along those lines one then gets concerned if there are many visits to that family.      You understand where out of the concern maybe it might not be just a visit but the more visits there are to the family in the context of allegations such as these then the greater the concern might be.  Do you understand that?    You hope it is not you?    Ja.      Do not proceed.  I do not know what is happening today.  I think we will just have to take a few minutes adjournment again.      Okay maybe it is what you said.    Okay let us continue.  You were making the point that they were saying whatever you read about or you heard in the media about them the allegations they were not true.    But you did stop accepting invitations from them and when you stopped I guess nothing had been proved in court about them?    So why did you stop?   [inistinct]    Ended up…    You know what I want to understand is for a certain period of time part of the explanation you gave for going there was your desire to be accessible number 1.  Number 2 saying that you know there may have been allegations against the family in the media but nothing had been proved in court as yet and therefore you know your attitude was well there is nothing wrong with the visits as such as long as you did not do anything improper during that visit – during those visits.  So but I am saying then at a certain stage you decided no I am not accepting the invitations anymore from them.  So had that view changed about because about saying look the allegations have not been proved?    Yes the investigation that was conducted by the – by the National Treasury which I think you said was in 2013 when was it concluded do you remember and what was the outcome of the …    Yes.    Would National Treasury after concluding the investigation have briefed you on the – on what had been found or would they not?    A briefing on it ja.    Ja but normally it is something that they would not do when they have done certain investigations to make sure that the Minister is briefed maybe anything goes to law enforcement agencies?    Normally they would do that?    You just do not remember whether in this particular case they did it.o not remember whether in this particular case they did it.    Ja.  Now with the eight visits my understanding of your evidence is that the Gupta family never asked you to do anything for them really, is that right?    Yes, yes, yes.    And these meetings or these visits when you visited them it was just discussions on economic – the economic situation or other issues connected with the economy and so on and maybe personal – just personal issues or – I just wonder how you can describe the topics that were being discussed because the evidence that I have heard from some witnesses suggest that they were very vigorous in trying to get government business that is the Gupta family.  So I am just wanting to establish the kinds of issues they discussed with you what they were other than issues of the economy?    Do you recall your first visit to them, do you recall how that came about, what the reason was, did somebody phone you and invite you, was there a formal invitation for some function, how did that come about if you recall?    While you were Deputy Minister?    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    On the other occasions what was the reason given for the invitation?    Yes okay.    Something along those lines?    Yes, yes.  Now I heard evidence from Mr Masego last year in the  - in this commission where if his evidence is true what appeared to have happened is that the Gupta family was really fighting hard to get more government business and if his evidence is true they even or one of the Gupta brothers threatened him or said made a statement to the effect that either they would sort him out or they would deal with him and my recollection of Mr Masego’s evidence is that the circumstances under which that statement was made according to Mr Masego were that they must have seen him as not co-operating with them to make sure that they got business – more government business.  And that was early in 2011, that was early in 2011 and Mr Masego’s evidence further suggested or was to the effect that when he was subsequently moved I think in October or thereabout 2010 he – a threat was made or statement was made that he would be dealt with or he would be sorted out and in late January or early February of 2011 he was transferred from the GCIS where he was Director General and he was transferred to DPSA Department of Public Service and Administration in a rush and his evidence was that he heard from his then minister, Minister Chabane that the former President – former President Zuma had called from outside the country because he had been outside of the country and had called and had a conversation with Minister Chabane and according to Mr Masego Minister Chabane told him that the former President had said to him, by the time he came back Mr Masego should no longer be there as Director General of GCIS and Mr Masego made it clear that at no stage had either the former President or Minister Chabane complained about his job, his performance and he said Minister Chabane was very sympathetic him and he acutally said something to the effect that he was feeling for him because he knew he had not done anything wrong.  And he said he would try and organise something for him and an arrangement was made in terms of which Mr Masego was transferred to be DG of DPSA and according to Ms Masego the transfer was all done so quickly that the Minster of DPSA at that time Minister Baloyi apparently had not even been consulted.  Mr Masego might have said he doubted that Minister Baloyi was consulted I am not sure but that is what had happened and that was 2011. So if that evidence is true then – and I do not know if it is true I will decide that much later if that evidence is true then already in 2011 this family was acting very vigorously in getting government business.  And indeed maybe were intimidating and threatening people who seem to stand in their way and trying to make sure that they were removed.  And actually it was Mr Masego who testified that when he had a meeting with Mr Ajay Gupta at the – at Saxonwold I think he said Mr Gupta made a statement to the effect that Minister – they call ministers to their residence and actually that the former President would do what they wanted.  I hope I am remembering the evidence correctly.  So if that evidence given by Mr Mashigo is true would it not be strange that when they had the opportunity of meeting with the Minister of Finance they would not want to talk to him about you know getting business or facilitating things.  Maybe particularly because we, I also heard evidence now I cannot remember from whom which suggested that Treasury was seen as a stumbling block in regard to certain issues and you may well have given evidence to that effect as well.  So I am just looking at this.  I wonder what comment could be on this.  So just, seeing one would expect that people, if this evidence by Mr Mashigo is true people who acted like that already in 2011 would really want to talk business with the Minister of Finance if they were talking business with other Government officials and so on.    Subject to the question of roundabout when it was when you started declining their invitations one would have expected that their thinking would have been we need to approach the Minister of Finance rather than the Deputy Minister if we want somebody who is going to do, to help us.  Why go to the Deputy Minister but of course if they had tried with the Minister of Finance and failed one could understand them going to the Deputy Minister because then by then they would be wanting to have the Minister of Finance removed, but somehow one would have thought that at some stage they would have tried with the Minister of Finance before they got to, they went to the Deputy Minister, but you say they never tried?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Well the other point I want to raise is this, you said also in your evidence that I think part of the reason why you went to see them was that you did not want antagonise the boss’ friends.  Now I am a little surprised by that because the impression I got from your evidence last time was that you would stand up to even those friends boss when you thought that you were not comfortable with doing something like the nuclear deal.  You would stand your ground even when it was clear to you what he wanted, which direction he wanted the whole thing to go.  You would stand your ground.  So I wonder whether that can be reconciled with that kind of Mr Nene.  Namely going to the visits because you do not want to antagonise them whether that can be reconciled with the Mr Nene who according to the evidence I heard last year in Russia stands his ground and comes back in here, stands his ground against the nuclear deal.    No, I think my point is this when you say as I understand you have said I went to, I honoured these visits these invitations in, I am not going to say wholly because you did not want to antagonise the boss’ friends, but maybe in part because you did not want to.    To antagonise the boss’ friends.  That can only mean because you think the boss’ friend will talk to the boss if he is unhappy with you and there may be some consequences.  Otherwise I would not understand why that would be a factor to you.  In other words I would, the manner that I heard about last year in regard to the nuclear deal would only have gone, would only have honoured these invitations if he thought there was nothing wrong not because he thought I do not want to antagonise the boss’ friends.  I thought that manner would have said well let the boss’ friend be antagonised if he is antagonised.  If I am uncomfortable going to his residence I am not going.    No, no you did not say it is the only reason.    No, you did not say that.    But I nevertheless.    [Intervenes].    Yes.  No that is fine.  Then the other question before we talk about the last topic that you dealt with is, did you understand why this family was so interested in having this good image to you that they are good corporate citizens and they were not doing business with Government which on the evidence that I have heard if it is true could not have been true.  As at the time that you were Minister of Finance because already if that evidence was true already in 2011 they had some business, Government business and they wanted more.    Did you have an understanding why it was so important to them that they should have this image with you that they are good corporate citizens and they are not doing business with Government?    So as at 2014 when you became Minister of Finance, maybe 2015 depending on when you stopped accepting the invitations, you were not aware that they were doing business with Government.  You accepted what they told you that [intervenes].    Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine.  Then on the last topic that you dealt with when Mr Pretorius was asking you questions, it is indeed quite difficult to attract as many people particularly in Government who ought to know quite a lot of things that happened to come forward.  As Mr Pretorius indicated there, there have been a number of people who have come forward and you are one of them.  You came forward without any hesitation last year and you supported the Commission and there are other Ministers who have come forward, past and present, but when one has regard to the numbers of Ministers who people who have said there are Ministers during some of the years that we are talking about and at the moment one thinks that there ought to be you know a much greater number of Ministers who have come forward and Directors-Generals, past and present, who have come forward and said no, I know something.  I want to help the Commission.  I want the Commission to get to the bottom of what was happening.  So it is quite difficult and you have given some of the reasons that you think might be behind that.  We will be going to elections and some of the people who are Ministers who probably know something and should have come forward might well continue to be Ministers and it is difficult to accept that out of so many Ministers who have not come forward there are not any who really know things that happened that should be brought to the Commission and it is a pity because they should be, because of their leadership role and the positions they occupy they should be exemplary to the rest of the people of South Africa.  I do not know, you might know.  I do not know whether there is a possibility that some of the people who know something and should be coming forward do not come forward because maybe they, if they give evidence they might be seen to be putting their organisation or their Government in a bad light.  I know that the ruling party has said many times that people must come forward.  The President has said many times that people must come forward, but they are not coming forward in the numbers in which one would expect them to come forward, but I guess that you have said what you have said and you appreciate the difficulty and among other things you think people might be feeling that they might lose jobs and so on, ja.    And it is very possible that part of the reason why certain things happened and happened the way they did in the proportions in which they did in this country and for as long as they happened, it is possible that part of the reason is that people who could have made a difference, who could have helped to stop certain things happening did not stand up because they may have been concerned about the kinds of things that you have just mentioned.    And now there is an opportunity, there is a Commission which seeks to find out exactly what happened, who could have helped to stop things and they know things that happened that were wrong and some of them may have taken the oath.  Some of them may have maybe going around saying they have the best interest of South Africa in their hearts, but here is an opportunity for them to come forward and they are not coming forward and people want to help rebuild the country and people are not coming forward because maybe they are just concerned about among others the things that you are talking about.  It is a great pity.    No, I do not know if there is anything Mr Pretorius [intervenes].    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Thank you.    Thank you very much.  Nothing further Mr Pretorius.    Okay, alright.    But you say you have nothing further to ask?    Okay.  Mr Nene thank you very much for coming back to the Commission.  From what I was told earlier on it appears that nobody has applied for leave to cross-examine you as yet although what I was told suggests that maybe Ms Joemat-Pettersson did right letters that may suggest that maybe she might want, I am not sure, she might want to but she has not submitted any application.  So you are excused.  Maybe we will not ask you to come back.  Maybe we will, but you are excused and thank you very much for coming.    Thank you, thank you.  We have nothing further for today?    And tomorrow it is Mr Jonas’ evidence?    And is he the only witness tomorrow?    Ja.    Ja.    Oh, okay.  Well maybe we, ja maybe we can just start at half past nine.  That I fix for this week at the request of the legal team and then we will see when we finish.    Ja.  We will adjourn then the proceedings for today and we will start at half past nine tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chair.  Good morning.    He has submitted a statement which is Exhibit U3.  Chair you will find it in File 2 which was part and parcel of the bundles that were presented when Mr Mabuza started his evidence.    I have been assured by your Registrar that it has been marked at the back with the name of Doctor Ramontja.    Yes and the last statement.    The last statement in the doc – in that file.    And the next one.    I am sorry.  But Chair you remember when we explained to you right from the beginning that U2 has separate statements.    Beginning with the statement of Mr Mabuza.    And thereafter you would go to the statement of Mr Nagar and the third one which is U3 it is the statement of Thibedi Ramontja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes    Well it seems as if the public lecture has failed there is a need for a private lecture.    For the.    Admiinstration responsible for …    Arranging the documentation.  We have tried.    Regretfully we have failed.    Yes.    We suggest that a private discussion would help Chair.    Because we tried the best we can publicly to convey.    Those concerns and messages and…    And we failed maybe it is because we are not the holders of the purse.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. I believe that the legal representative of     Mr Van Rooyen is present.    And also for Mr Fuzile.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Chair can I suggest before the oath is administered to Doctor Ramontja that you also have at hand and ready the letter which we canvassed with Mr Marsden yesterday from Mr Koko to Doctor Ramontja.  It is ES152 Annexure MMK20.      It is part and parcel of the documents which were presented when Mr Marsden testified.    We have brought an extra copy in case you would need one.    We do not need that.    Yes.  One only.  The one which is marked MMK20.    I believe that Mr – Doctor Ramontja is ready for taking the oath.    Yes.    Doctor Ramontja good morning and welcome and let me start by apologising for delaying your evidence.  We had no control over those processes.  Doctor Ramontja before you there will be two sets of documents.  The first is the statement which you made at the request of the legal team of the commission.  Do you have it before you?    Can I establish whether or not you stand by the contents of that statement?    So it is fairly clear for anyone who read the statement that you intended to refer to December and not November?    Yes especially paragraph 23 on page 5.    Yes.  So subject to that amendment and Chair can I suggest that paragraph 15 we strike out November and replace it with December.    Because it is quite clear from the reading of the statement in total that he intended to refer to 6 December.    Sadly we have not come across any letter of 6 November.  What we have come across is the letter of 6 December.    Subject to that qualification do you confirm that the contents of that statement are true to the best of your knowledge and belief?    The next set of document is that letter of 6 December that you presage in the paragraph that we have just corrected.  It is a statement which had not been included in the bundle of documents made available to us, correct?    We have placed it before you.    Can I establish why you did not include this statement of 6 December in the bundle that you made available to us?    Oh I see.    Doctor Ramontja can I establish fairly quickly your background?  Let me start with your qualifications that you are willing to disclose to us publicly.    And when did you obtain the doctoral degree?    And when was it more in less in terms of dates?    2018?    Yes.  You seem to be a man of excellent qualifications.      That is an extraordinary commitment to the work of the commission which of course we welcome even at the loss of the University of Free State.  But beyond your academic qualifications can I establish your work experience?    Can you speak closer to the mic.    When did you start working for that company?    1980.    Okay.    When was it?    1997?    So it was post-independence.    Yes.    Who was the Minister at the time?    Yes.    You indicate in your statement that you took a decision and communicated it to leave as the Director General of Mineral Resources sometime in October 2015.    And at that time the relevant executive authority was Minister Zwane?    When did he leave pursuant to that decision?    It seems to be a painful moment that you were going through at that point in time.    I wonder whether you find it in your heart to take us into your confidence and share with us what was the painful moment that led to your decision to leave the Department of Mineral Resources.    Can I interrupt you?  I am sorry to do this to you but can you give us the details of the advisors?    Chair you have across this name during the course of Mr Sinton’s evidence.    And you remember the context in which you came across this name?    It is a person who Mr Sinton said that he introduced Regiments to McKinsey.    And he was paid a fee of 5%.    Yes.    Who else?    And again you have come across this name when Mr Fuzile testified.    Yes.    And again I am sorry to interrupt you.  When did you for the first time know that these individuals were advisors to Minister Zwane?    Yes.    In your statement you said October.    I cannot exactly recall the date.  Maybe, ja I cannot recall.    Chair I would like to explore that topic in detail.    So if I can get to it in time.    Get to it in time.    If you do not mind.    Yes.  Well.    Yes, I want to discuss other background issues.    If you do not mind I will get to it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair thank you.  Do you know Mr Enoch Godongwana?    Yes.  So it is someone who you would fairly know well and have had some communication with?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Fuzile came here and to say something which was communicated to him.    By Mr Enoch Godongwana.    I wonder whether you had followed what his testimony before the Chairperson was, because it was a public testimony.  Do you know what Mr Fuzile said to the Chairperson about Mr Godongwana?    Well let me recap it for you.    So that at least you would be able to comment it as closely as possible to the accuracy of his testimony.    Chair as I recall he said that after Minister van Rooyen was appointed, remember after the fateful 9 December 2015 announcement Mr Godongwana called him and said to him you are going to get a Gupta Minister and that Minister would come with his advisors or her advisors and generally he or she would not know those advisors and if it is necessary he, Mr Fuzile, must ask you about those things.  What I want to establish, of course we will call Mr Godongwana to come and put his version in due course.  We are making arrangements in that regard.    What I want to understand is did you ever have?    Oh, yes you could be correct Chair.    Yes.    And that is the only issue I want to explore.    Thank you for that reminder.  So what I want to establish is did you ever have a discussion with Mr Godongwana about the appointment of so called Gupta Ministers and the advisors?    No, we understand that, but the point is the pain that you are going through in the department at that point in time.  Did you ever discuss it with anyone?    Anyone.    Chair I would like now to move to the substance of.    Dr Ramontja’s evidence.  Dr Ramontja you were called by the Commission to explain circumstances leading to the letter that was sent to Eskom under your name.  You annexed that letter as TR1 to your statement.  Chair you will find TR1 on page 13 of U3.  Are you there Dr Ramontja?    You will see if you go to.    In the same file where you find the statement of Dr Ramontja.    Oh, my word.    Paginated page number on my documentation is TR13 and TR14.    13 and 14.    Can I ask you to go to page 2 of that letter which is TR14?  Do you see that?    You will see that your name appears on that page.  Correct?    And there is a signature above that name/    Is that your signature?    I therefore assume that you signed this letter?    But there was no date to that letter.  There is provision for dates, but it had not been completed.    Do I take it that you signed the letter without putting the date to indicate when you signed it?    We will come to the circumstances.    But all I want to confirm at this stage is that you did not put a date.    To indicate when you signed it.    Correct.  We will get to the circumstances and I am not trying to exclude you from explaining the context and circumstances why you did not put the date, but can I remind you of this context?  That you signed this letter as a result of a letter that was sent to you by Eskom under the hand of Mr Koko.  That is the letter that I asked you to look at.  It is not part of your statement.  Is that letter which is marked MMK20?    And you will see that page 2 of MMK20 is signed by Mr Koko on 6 December 2015.  Correct?    So your letter TR13 and TR14 was an attempt to respond to Mr Koko’s letter?    We will get to the context, to the contents of, but let me establish matters of context one of which we will deal with a topic the Chairperson raised and I said I will like to deal with and that is a trip of Minister Zwane to Zurich.  The context at that point in time as I understand is that one of Eskom’s coal suppliers, Optimum Coal Mine, and I take it that you know that mine.  You know who operates it.  Correct?    You also indicated in your statement that Minister Ramatlhodi tried to intervene in regard to attempts by Optimum Mine at the time to reduce their staff.  Did you know at that point in time that Optimum Coal Mine was under business rescue?    When you received the letter of Mr Koko?       Yes, and yesterday the Chairperson heard the evidence of one of business rescue practitioners, Mr Marsden, had you met him during the stage when Optimum Coal Mine was in business rescue?       When you received that letter it was after Tegeta had made an offer to purchase amongst others Optimum Coal Mine and that offer had been accepted by Optimum Coal Mine and it’s line of current companies, including Glencore, were you aware of the fact that there had been a sale agreement?       When you received that letter Minister Zwane had five days earlier had gone to Zurich to meet with Mr Glassenbergh who at the time was the head of Glencore, were you aware of the trip?       Indeed because you are the accounting officer.       So the costs relating to that trip to the extent that they will be paid by your department you have to authorise them.       And I take it that you authorised them and you became aware that Minister Zwane was travelling to Zurich?       The Chairperson received evidence that at that meeting when Mr Zwane met Mr Glassenbergh he was accompanied by someone called Mr Salem Essa who – let me first ask you this, do you know Mr Salem Essa.       Had you met him before?       Mr Essa was introduced at that meeting with Mr Glassenbergh as the advisor to the Minister.  Do you or don’t you know that Mr Essa at some or other point played a role as advisor to the Minister, Minister Zwane?       You have looked at the documentation relating to that trip, you know the costs and we know who is going there, did the documentation ever indicated to you what was the purpose of the trip to Zurich?       It did not have those details?       Could you because it is important to understand precisely whether you as the DG knew what was the purpose of the trip.       The Chairperson received evidence from amongst others a witness called Mr Clinton Ephron who indicated that the sale of the Optimum Mine was discussed at two meetings in Zurich, the first was the meeting of 1 December 15, the second was the 2nd of December 2015, do you know anything about those meetings?       What I find surprising is that an important project such as Optimum Coal Mine was something that you were involved in during the time Minister Ramatlhodi was Minister and when Mr Zwane takes over you are not involved in that project.    Can you explain to us why you as the DG did not become involved in that project during the Ministerial position of Mr Zwane?    No, no with respect, it is not the Minister who runs the Department, it is you as the DG who runs the Department.    I understand.  Chair with your leave I would like to probe this question further.    I understand the difficult and the oppressive circumstances you are working in, okay, I am apprised with them, don’t misunderstand me, but it seems to me from what you are telling us that there was a takeover of your functions and duties as the DG to run the department, is that a fair reflection of what happened during that time?    Beyond the style of Mr Zwane as a minister to interface with you as the head of the DMR can you think of any reason why the Optimum Project will be excluded from your line of responsibilities?    And I suggest to you that that must have been the reason because when I look at the letter of Mr Koko and your response to that letter your letter talks to things which Mr Koko did not raise at least expressly in his letter to you.      We will get to the precise details of how your letter raised things which even Mr Koko did not raise.    But do you accept as a general proposition that your response was talking about detail which were not in Mr Koko’s letter.    Before we get to those details can I ask you to simply explain to us the process of formulating this letter because I sense from your statement that you did not prepare that letter.    Can you just take us through the basic steps as far as you can recall, who started with the draft, how it was presented to you for signature.    Thank you Chair.  Can I ask you to turn to the letter that you signed, and again before I get to the contents of it I would ask you to clarify for us how this letter was formulated, in other words did you sit behind the computer, dictate it or type it or did someone present a draft to you?    And do you know who formulated that draft?    Alright, so you knew nothing about who formulated the draft, did – do you know who gave it to you in draft form, as far as you can recall?    In-tray?    And was there any expectation that you should look at it and sign it as a reflection of a response to Mr Koko’s letter.    Thank you Chair.  Dr Ramontja you are quite correct, when you look at the letter of – the letter that you signed right at the top does indicate that enquiries must be directed to Mr J Raphela and his email is given so that’s the assurance that gave you that you could look at this letter and deal with it.    Fair enough.  Now I am going to take you through the contents of that letter and I am going to do so on the premise that you are quite comfortable that someone formulated the draft without talking to you and someone formulated a draft on matters that you have not been previously involved about Optimum Coal Mine.  Is that a fair premise to proceed from?    Look at paragraph 1, the unnumbered paragraph, Chair I am at TR13.    It says receipt of your letter addressed to the Department pertaining to the intervention required from the Department refers, correct?    And it was quite clear when you read Mr Koko’s letter that he required the Department to intervene broadly in all the coal supply problems Eskom had regarding various mines and various power stations.    And then the second unnumbered paragraph reads as    And secondly it doesn’t even request the department to intervene on an urgent basis regarding a mining right, correct?    So that that part of the response drafted by someone without your engagement it responds to something that had not been asked by Mr Koko, correct?    Yes, let’s proceed then   It doesn’t even talk about an urgent approach to the Competition Commission, correct?    There is nothing in that letter referring to the importance of National interest relating to an urgent approach to the Commission, correct?     So in sum from the beginning to the end this second paragraph responds to nothing that Mr Koko had requested by way of intervention from the Department, correct?    Why then as far as you are aware someone would ask you to sign a letter purporting to respond to the urgent intervention by the Department, requested by Mr Koko and raise issues which Mr Koko did not seek intervention on, can you think of any reason why that would happen?    That is a heightened deception by whoever formulated this letter.    Thank you Chair.  Chair I would like to go to the next part of the letter.    TR13 and I would like to do so quickly, because I promised my colleagues who are waiting in the wings.    Yes.    They are waiting for your attention Chair.    Dr Ramontja you are still at TR13.  The letter that you signed.  I would like to deal with the last paragraph of that letter.  Are you there?    It reads as follows   That letter did not even request Eskom to intervene at all.  Sorry, it did not request DMR to intervene at all regarding questions around financial liabilities of OCH.  Correct?    The letter of Mr Koko did not even suggest that Eskom would have to play an active role in any project.  Correct?    And yet this paragraph talks about a request to Eskom to play an active role in some project.  The question is did you understand what project this letter was referring to?    Yes.    Yes.    No, I understand, but you were here yesterday when Mr Marsden testified?    And you heard his evidence?    He made it quite clear that at that point in time when your response was formulated.    OCM did not require any support at all, because its parent companies had decided to take it out of business rescue and they had decide to make sure that it will comply with its obligations under CSA.  So in hindsight having heard Mr Marsden it should be clear to you now that OCM did not require any assistance whatsoever.    Oh, yes.        Chair can I ask you to go to page 227 of Mr.    No, of Mr Marsden’s file.  If you do not have it let me read it out to you.    It is Clause 12 of the Sale Agreement.    Yes and maybe for the benefit of Dr Ramontja.  It    Yes.    Indeed.  Were you aware when you were called upon to look at this letter and sign it what were the estimate liabilities or OCH relating to the Rehabilitation Trust Funds of both OCM and Koornfontein?    Yes.    Yes.    Indeed.  Without even responding to Mr Koko’s letter?    Yes. Chair I am going to move to the next part of the letter, hopefully the last one.    It begins at the end of TR113.  If I may read it out to you    “…and driving formation.” Mr Koko’s letter does not even talk about transformation.  Correct?    “We would like to propose that consideration be made for some prepayment to be made for up to one year of coal supply.” Let me stop there.  Mr Koko’s letter does not even talk about prepayment in order to accommodate whoever was running the mine at that point in time.  Correct?    When did you become aware for the first time that Eskom had arranged a prepayment to be made to Tegeta?    And we now know that on record it is about R659-odd million.    Before that you did not know?    And then it proceeds as follows   Correct?    In fact it was used to provide for the shortfall for the purchase of Optimum Coal Mine.  Correct?    So this representation in this letter is false.  Of course you did not know, but whoever wrote this letter at that point in time was misstating the facts.    Do you agree that whoever formulated the letter at that point in time without your knowledge was simply misleading you as the DG?    Chair two concluding remarks.    Two concluding remarks Dr Ramontja, the first is we now know from your evidence you do not know what happened to this letter?    Do you know whether or not this letter yours and the preceding one of Mr Koko were ever used by Tegeta in order to accelerate fulfilment of the condition precedents in the share sale agreement it concluded with OCM, OCH with the support of Glencore?    Are you aware whether or not this letter could have been presented to the Competition Commission with a view to aid it to accelerate the merge assessment and approval of the OCH transaction?    Are you aware whether or not this letter could have been presented the Bank of Baroda in order to ensure that Tegeta would comply with its obligation to fulfil the condition precedent?    I am not saying that they have done it.  I am just asking you whether or not are you aware that these matters?    Yes.  There must have been a purpose to this letter and I am not going to bore you with what I consider to be the purpose.  When Eskom through Mr Koko presents a situation of crisis and your department responds to this situation in a manner that does not relate to Mr Koko’s request the two are not talking to each other.  In fact I suggested to you that there is a clean deception.  Eskom’s letter deceives you.  Correct?    And this letter that we have seen you have written.    Deceives.    Eskom.    Because it does not talk to its requirements.  Correct?    What do you think is the reason for this scale and scope of deception?    From our part I agree with you.  Chair that is the end of our questions to Dr Ramontja.    Chair, may we ask for a short adjournment for our colleagues who are going to deal with Minister Nene’s evidence to set up and    Prepare themselves.    Shall I suggest 10 minutes?  So then you should not move in and out.  I am doing it for a convenience, but we may not be ready.  We have to go and.    Thank you Chair.

DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Thibedi Ramontja.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes. ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC   Yes it is my statement.    Certainly so I stand by the contents of the statement except on paragraph 15 where it says “Eskom’s letter of 6 November” it should be Eskom’s letter of 6 December.    Yes because in other paragraphs I have referred to December.    Yes.    Certainly so.    Yes.    Okay.    No I just thought you have the letter because the investigators just said I must respond to the letter.    Okay.    Okay.  I have a certificate in geology.  I have a BSC Honours in geology. I have a MSC in engineering.  I have PHD in mineral economics.    During my time at the Department – during my time when I was working at the Council for Geoscience.    It was – it was around 2008 around there.    Yes.    No not necessary Chairperson I am a person who likes academic environment so I continuously read in fact not to distract you I had even registered for an MSC at the University of Free State this year but because of this I cancelled.    Yes I cancelled it.  I had registered the last week they said was 13 – this week you must attend I said look I am pulling out.    I started at the bottom of you know the career in mining.  I started as a technician working for a company called Southern Sphere Mining and Development.    Working for a company called Southern Sphere Mining and Development then I went to the University of the North to go and further my studies.    It was in 1980 around there.    Ja.    And then in 1981 I went to the University of the North. I studied BSC and after my BSC I then did my Honours in Geology. After that I then went and worked in private sector and in private sector I went – I worked as an exploration geologist. I also worked as a mining geologist going underground all those mines in Carltonville I worked on them I know all of them.  I then worked as a research geologist for a company called Goldfields it is still operating.  And then after some time I joined a friend of mine we worked as consultants in the geohydrology environment that is ground water looking for water for rural development.  And I then joined government.  That was the time when the government was actively recruiting black professionals.     That was in 1997.    Yes.      Certainly so we were amongst the first black professional to join government and I worked there as a Director of Mineral Economics because mineral economics was my area when I was working on my PHD.  And then I in and around 2002 I was then – no in around 2000 I was promoted to Chief Director Mineral promotion within the Department of Mineral and Energy.  Okay and that was one of my you know exciting times because I was even awarded a prize for being the best senior manager in the Department of Mineral and Energy by the then Minister [indstinct]    And then in 2002 I was appointed the Deputy CEO Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Geoscience.  The Council for Geoscience is a national research institution which does research in geology across the whole country.  And then in 2003 that is a year after that I was then appointed the Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Geoscience.  I served there for 8 years until 2011 when I was appointed the Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources.  I did my service there.    That is Minister Susan Shabangu.    And I worked under Minister Susan Shabangu I then worked under Minister Ramatlhodi and then in 2016, January 2016 I left the service of the department.  The then Minister was Minister Zwane.  I really you know enjoyed my environment in public service it was one of my greatest times there and it was close to – I spent plus minus 19 years working for the public service and I worked under seven ministers all in all within the you know family the mining industry.  And then I when the time came to leave I realised that I have to leave.  It was sad for me but I had to leave.    Yes.    Yes.    Well you know when Minister Zwane arrived that was after about five weeks or so plus minus around there I remember we were flying I cannot recall the exact time but we were flying together to Cape Town.  I was next to him and – on the plane.  I then said to Minister Zwane, Minister Zwane I want to step down for health reasons.  Okay and we never concluded our discussion.  The discussions were concluded on the 10 December.  To me it was one of my saddest days in my life.  I have worked in private sector.  I have worked in the public service.  I have worked under many, many, many bosses if I may use that word Chairperson but that day it was one of my saddest day.  It teared me, I broke down.  But I know that what happened that day it was not caused by the government of South Africa, it was not.  It was not.  I knew that I knew.  I knew government.  I knew the Department of Mineral Resources.  I know government, I know everything.  You know I know it was just some people.    Yes.    Well when Ministers change you know it is always not a very comfortable environment.  I will be lying you know.  You have got to adjust to the environment, adjust to how a minister does things okay.  And some time when the situation is very difficult even your health gets affected and I just realised look I have run the race let me just step down and move on with my life and do other things Okay.  But the 10 December – let me explain it.  I have already explained this to the investigators Chairperson.    Okay.    Okay.    Thank you Chairperson.  I think from day 1 I could see that you know we - the rapport between myself and Minister Zwane it was not as I expected.  And there were advisors who came in.  These advisors basically they were running the show.      Okay one was Kuben, Mr Kuben Moodley.    K-u-b-e-n.      Mr Malcolm Mabaso.    And then later on there was a third advisor Ms Zarina Kellerman.    Miss yes.  Zarina – Z-a-r-i-n-a Kellerman.    K-e-l-l-e-r-m-a-n-n I can just double check it later and give it to you.    Well on the first day at the swearing in at the Union Building I went there to receive the Minister and you know – that is what we do.  We go there and the Minister is sworn in and they were already there at the Union Building.    Not – I have never interacted…    It was the first time I saw them.    Yes.    And Chairperson as I say you just see it if – you know Minister and the DG they have got to really be close.  They have got to work very closely.  But during that time I want to be honest I had to work through advisors.  Can you see?  I had to work – got messages from advisors.  And I just felt [indistinct] in the way.  There are many things whereby advisors were talking to my staff okay or the staff in the department and you do not know what is happening.  You are basically lost.  You operating in the misty environment and every time you try to connect the dots you know that is what you are doing it is one of the most frustrating environment because advisors are not supposed to run departments. Advisors are not supposed to get in there and call officials of the department.  If they had an issue they should go the DG and say DG Minister want this and this and this okay.  Then I interact with the minister that is how it is supposed to be.  I do not report to the advisors as a DG.  I report to the minister and also politically to the Deputy Minister okay. Advisors are there to advise the Minister that is all, okay.  Getting into the department issues, admin what is happening, no.  It is not supposed to be that way Chairperson.  I have been in the department which is responsible for mining for 19 years.  I have worked under seven Ministers.  I know how things are done.  I worked under Minister Ramatlhodi.  He had an advisor, Mr Morphie.  I know how they interacted.  Mr Morphie would not go and just interact and not with my staff.  He did not come to me and say you know DG, how do you see this and this and this.  Then he goes to the Minister and we used to talk, Minister Ramatlhodi to say you see DG that advisor you are not reporting to that advisor.  You report to me.  He used to tell me that and that is how it should be.    Department of Mineral Resources.  Eskom 1 does not report to the Department of Mineral Resources that is number 1.    Eskom reports to the Department of Public Enterprise okay.    2.  A DG of any department cannot give directives to Eskom.  In fact I could have just not signed this letter.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    The relationship between the Department of Mineral Resources and Eskom is an indirect one. It is indirect in the sense that the Department of Mineral Resources regulates the mining industry.  Okay.  Including the coal mining industry.  So Eskom gets coal from the mines to generate electricity.  That is the relationship which is there okay.  I – also I am surprised now that I hear that Advocate Maleka says a letter was not even sent to the Department of Public Enterprises.  It is actually bringing certain things to me how I thought maybe they also sent something like that asking for assistance.  So that is why I am saying Eskom cannot even get a directive from a DG of Department of Mineral Resources.  Even from the Minister of Mineral Resources.  The only person who can give a directive to Eskom is the Minister of Public Enterprise in terms of corporate governance issues and the Minister of Energy in terms of policy issues.  Okay that is how it is but this issue now would be a corporate governance issues any directive that comes from the Minister of Public Enterprise.  Even then the Minister of Public Enterprise would have to take that information and give it to the Chairperson of the board of Eskom.  Who would have to give it to the board and discuss it and say this is what is in front of us what do we do?  So after signing this letter and maybe I must touch on something else when…Is it fine Chair?    Okay.  And the letter will just – I do not know how it went out of my office that is one thing.  And…    Yes.    I did not know how it went out of my office and I spoke to my former secretary and I ask her to just to find out and trace because what happens in my former office is we used to record incoming mail and outgoing mail. But this one she could not find it, it is very strange you know.  And I just – you know I was busy with other things and I just heard that it is effaced in Parliament when some officials of Eskom were defending their actions using this letter.    Ja.    No.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no, no.    Yes.    Very strange because especially letters coming from outside where we record that this letter came in on such and such a date, this went out.  So there is a record which is kept in the DG’s office you know.    Yes I did not.    Yes Chairperson.    It looks now that it has been delivered by hand but as I said you know we have got a system in the DG’s office when I was still a DG whereby all the mails would be recorded as they come in and they go out.  Very few mails maybe you know of the corporate services because we on the same floor the DG corporate service would come to me and say DG there is this thing then we look at it.  But generally especially mails from outside they would have been recorded it came here.  Mails from the Ministry would be recorded then as it goes out it would have to be recorded.  So strange when I asked my former PA to investigate that she said no there is nothing, you cannot trace it.    Yes.    She cannot recall anything I spoke to her after I…    No recently yes.    No I did not ask Chairperson yes.    Yes I did ask her.    Yes.  No not at that time.    Only recently.  As I said Chairperson if my – if I may add?  But after that I just you know continued with my work until these things effaced in Parliament.  I just said what is this now?  You know.  Ja.    Chairperson I agree with you and in hindsight I should have looked at it differently but as I said you know after I signed it I thought I could revisit it but then I got caught up with other things in the office you know.  And until…    Yes.    Ja I think Chairperson in hindsight one could have done better.  One could have been vigilant.  But sometime you never expect that people can use a government system for their own ulterior motives.  But these things have happened.  Perhaps they saw weaknesses somewhere in the system and it looks like some people had their own ulterior motives and when you look at the two letters Chairperson you can clearly see that there were people you know working on these things without the department especially myself knowledge.  So in hindsight perhaps I should have revisited this and done it better than I did and I accept that that I could have done it better Chairperson.  I did not do it as I should have done.  As I think now I would do it. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.    It was reassuring.    Ja.    So.    Ja, so that whole environment Chairperson I just realised that look, this is the end.  My health will be compromised and let me just leave the environment as it is.  There will be other things which I can do in my life and then on December I was called to the office of the Minister and.    2015.    Yes.    I was called to the office of the Minister.  When I arrived there I was led into the office of Mr Mabaso, the advisor, okay and he said.    By the Minister.    Yes.    Okay.  So when I arrived I was led into the office of Mr Mabaso and I sat there with him.  We chatted, we always chatted with him now and again.  Then he said to me the Minister says you must resign.  I said what.  He said you must resign.  He wants his resignation within 20 minutes, okay.    The 10th.    Yes.    23 September.    2015, yes.    Then I said what is this.  Where is the news that the Minister.    Yes.    Okay.  Where is the Minister?  The Minister was in his office.  About five metres, plus/minus five metres from the office of Mr Mabaso.    You see the office of the Minister is a big office with sub offices.    So the Minister would have his own there.  A secretary there.    A PA and then the advisors there.    So the Minister was in his office.    Maybe five metres.    From where I was.    So here am I and getting fired just like that.  Then I said to Mr Mabaso, Mr Mabaso I want to leave then.  I will leave now immediately.  You said you want a resignation, the Minister wants a resignation within 20 minutes.  I will give it, but I am taking my things.  I am going home today, okay and he said no, no DG.  Can you not just wait and so things will fall apart, you know.  Let us make sure that things are smooth when you leave.  I then looked at it.  I thought about it.  Once more I said let me do it for my country.  Let me stay.  It is not about some people.  It is about my country.  It is the department I have worked for, for 19 years and I said okay.  I will go and sign that letter.  I went to my office there and put it together.  I have one of my colleagues in my office helped me type it together, put it together.  Then we finalised it.  I signed the letter.  Then I went there.  Within that 20 minutes I made sure that I do it within 20 minutes and Chairperson I knew my rights.  I would have said no.  I would have gone to CCMA after going to the, I would have taken legal advice, but I just said you know what this is good riddance for me.  Let me do it in that 20 minutes of theirs.  Then from there I said okay I will service notice until 31 January 2016 and I will see what I can do, assist them and I did it.  Even after I had left, okay.  Some of the staff members would call me and say Dr Ramontja can you assist us with this and this.  I would drive to Pretoria with my own petrol, never ask any cent.  I did it, because I was doing this thing for the country and I just made peace with the situation and say one day, one day things will be fine, okay and I used to go there.  Remember I think in some speeches, they saved some speech I could look at it, work on it.  After I had left and therefore I sent it back to them.  I said look it is fine, but then I was never bitter.  Even today I am not.    Ja, I think, I cannot recall properly.    I have got some emails.    If you want some of the things I looked at they sent to me.    The acting.    DG.    He used to communicate with me.    Yes.    Not at all.  After he was given my letter and I was going out.  As I said it is just in his office.  He was walking.  I saw him there.  He had a phone something like that, if I can recall.  I think he just said DG, DG and that is it.    That is it.  Not even saying to me DG I want us to part ways.    That is it.    Yes.  As I said I was, we were flying to Cape Town and I was seated next to him.    I told him that I want to step down.    Ja.    I.    No, it is about a month.  I think it was around October.    Yes.  I said in around October there.    He; we never concluded.  He said when.  I said look we can talk about it.  We can talk about it ja, but we never concluded.  We just left it as it is.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    And.    To conclude that part of.    Mine at the department.    And then sometime in January he said to me DG I am offering you a job as a CEO of one of the entities, South African Diamond and Precious Metal Regulator.  So I declined the offer.    I declined the offer. I said thank you so much Minister.    But I am fine.    I am fine.    Ja.    Ja.    No, I did not have other arrangements.    Nothing.    I just reflected over it during the holidays.    I reflected it.  I remember in my, if I can recall my family went on holiday.  I did not go holiday.    I just stayed alone.    During the holidays.    I reflected on it and then I said let me start a new life.    It will be there.    And I am glad that I started a new life.    I am working as a consultant.    In South Africa and outside South Africa and also.    I am an Honorary Adjunct Professor.    At the University of Witwatersrand.    I sit on the Advisory Committee.    Of the School of Mining and Engineering to advise them.  So there are many things which.    Are happening with my life.    It took time, but you can see that things are happening.    There will always be possibilities if you work hard in life.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.  I think Chairperson the heart of everything is you cannot work via advisors as a DG, you know.  You have to directly talk to the Minister.  You have to directly talk to the Deputy Minister.  You cannot work through advisors.  It just becomes impossible.  It does not work and that is the gist of everything which I experienced, you know and maybe that is how he wanted things to be done and maybe it is how he wanted that is fine, but it is difficult for me.  It was difficult then for me to accept that.  Then I said look I cannot, but three are other things which I heard after, you know.  At some point I was told that the advisors would tell the Chief Inspector of Mines, okay to go and inspect mines, you know and maybe the Chief Inspector can explain that, you know because I was marginalised.  Nobody came to me and tell, but he told me that look I was supposed to, I have been asked to go and inspect mines.  I said what, what is this.  In fact when you look at those things they are not supposed to be done that way.  I cannot even tell the Chief Inspector of Mines go and inspect this mine.  It is not right, okay.  The Chief Inspect of Mines has got powers in terms of the Mine Health and Safety Act.  He is the one who must decide and they have got their own program and once you start to say go to this mine, go to this one.  It is not the work of the Minister.  It is not the work of the DG.  It is the work of the Chief Inspector of Mines which rules at the DDG level.  So when he told me this I said hey, what can I do.  It was a very, very, you know it is one of those things and there was this project maybe we will cover, the Optimum Project okay.  The Optimum Project Chairperson during Mr Ramatlhodi’s time okay it was run by officials.  The DDG responsible for it Mr Joel Raphela was the one who come to me and tell me what is happening DG and you know we understood what was happening okay, but then when Mr Zwane came on board they centralised that project inside the office of the Minister.  There is.    Yes.    Yes.  It was centralised.  I was not aware what was now happening.    Yes.  That was how it was.    I was in the dark.  I was.    As DG.    I was totally in the dark about what is happening.    Totally, totally and the DG would come to me and almost whispering to me, you know we were there you know and I said what is happening, you know.  We were there.  There is this thing.  I think we even went to Zurich.    And you know there was, you know the environment was just.    For me I think the style was not the way I expected.    And I cannot force a Minister to operate in a particular way.    It is up to the Minister to decide how he or she wants to run.    Her or his office.    Yes, I have.    I have Chairperson.    I have.    Yes, I know him very well.  He was at some point advisor to Minister Susan Shabangu when I was the DG.    Yes.  He is a leader within the ANC and I would interact with him.    On many issues especially in terms of mining issues because he was responsible for economic issues.    So we would talk and talk about issues.    Okay.    Yes.    I missed that, but my brother told me and said he, I did not hear what he said, but my brother mentioned something like Mr Fuzile phoned Mr Godongwana and Mr Godongwana if you want to know more about these issues go and consult.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    No, Chairperson I cannot recall.  I cannot recall, ja.  I cannot recall.    Chairperson we never discussed this with Mr Fuzile, no we never discussed that.    With Mr Godongwana?    No, my family, I discussed with my family mostly, but my staff in my office they knew it.  I think the corridors people would see it, ja.  I did not discuss it.  I cannot remember discussing it with anyone, but I discussed it with my family.  I said this what is happening and what can I do.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Certainly so, Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    Well when I signed this letter I then thought that I could revisit the letter.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.    Yes.    At what time?    Okay.  Yes I know because it was in the news, the Department was involved and the issues of Optimum in fact started to come to the Department during Mr Ramatlhodi’s time and I remember at some point I was even in a meeting where Minister Ramatlhodi was there there was Dr Ngubane, there was Mr Molefe and my DDG, Mr Raphela, was also there so we were four in that meeting, then when also they discussed this issue, so I knew that there were issues.     No I never met him, my DDG, Mr Raphela, was the person who was busy interacting with all the stakeholders which are involved in this, which was natural, it’s his area so he was the person who would be interacting with them.  I don’t know if he did meet them one to one, but he used to tell me that they’re holding meetings and these things are happening, it’s fine.     No I was not aware.     I was aware because the way it works in the Department when the Minister goes overseas he gets commission from the President then the Minister will then decide who she wants to accompany her or him, and in this case my DDG was asked to accompany the Minister so the documentations which I signed to this effect which we will come to and we recommend to the Minister for the Minister to approve the DDG to go abroad, and also I will be sort of approving the costs which will be incurred.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No I don’t know him.     No, no.     No, as I said there were two advisors, then there was this third one also, when I left but she was not fully appointed also.     No, that’s why I said it did not specify the issues of Glencore, it was like Ministers going abroad, I think if I can recall, this thing happened long time ago, that they are going there to meet investors, I am speaking under correction but it didn’t have the details about Optimum what-what no.     Yes as far as I can recall I will have to really look at it, but I can’t remember having those things in that, there will be a meeting whereby the Minister will meet with people of Optimum together with the people of Glencore, I can’t remember, I will have to double-check that.     Okay.     No, no, no.  Chairperson when it comes to the issue of Optimum it was basically run in the office of the Minister and things would come in drips and drabs to me you know and that’s how that was the situation.       Yes.     Certainly so Chairperson the DDG Mr Raphela was driving them, but you know ...(intervention)      Oh so much, he will tell me there’s this meeting, they ‘re meeting the unions, there’s this thing so it was so transparent that you get comfort and that is how you must be because as a DG you can’t be everywhere, you can’t attend all these meetings but he used to tell me there’s this and this and also I remember at some point there was even a block consortium which approached me, we were in a meeting so at the Department and they said look we want to acquire Optimum, can you just assist us DG.  We don’t often get involved in those things but I then said look I will see what I can do if there are challenges, let – especially if it is a black-owned company let’s see if we cannot assist, to address the issues of transformation and I called Mr Ephron, Mr Clinton Ephron and I discussed this issue with him, and he said okay fine, it seems they don’t have money those people, and then I left it there, the two gentlemen who were interested, Mr Sipho Dube, and Mr Peter Demane.     Yes, so that was – everything was transparent, I knew what was happening, it was fine, Minister Ramatlhodi would be informed about issues, he would come in when you know there are serious issues which have to be tabled, but he would leave everything to us ja.     Certainly so Chairperson, he ...(intervention)      Yes and if I may add Chair?     And then some time after he came back, I can’t remember which day, he came to my office, we were talking about other things and then I said look how was your trip there, and then he said yes it was fine and we went to Glencore but he was not allowed to enter into a meeting.     Yes so he was outside, so this is the environment so I just left it as it is, I said okay, that’s fine.     No the DDG is no longer there.     Mr Joel Raphela.     Yes.    Yes.    It perplexed me Chairperson, I just thought that’s the style, I mean Ministers have got powers to decide how they run a department, okay.    I agree Chairperson but then ...(intervention)     Yes, there are certain things you can do as DG Chairperson but there are certain things if your Minister wants to do things this way you can’t stop that person, so when they decided to centralise it there I just said what can I do, there is nothing I could do but it is what happened, I’m just relaying what happened.    I think yes to some extent, not all functions but to some extent this one was one of the projects which was basically taken away from me.      I don’t know why would this happen but with all this enquiry happening we started to say look you know perhaps some people had to be favoured you know I don’t have clear evidence but now you to start to put, to join the dots now you start to see with this enquiry say okay this is – this looks like perhaps the Gupta people were basically being assisted – sorry for using that word – Mr Gupta’s family was trying to be assisted that’s how I view it now.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Sorry?    Yes.    Certainly so Chair.    No, I did not, I did not.    It was my presumption ja.    Yes.  It can happen that a letter comes to me, there’s a copy of it going to the DDG or to the Office of the Minister.    But I just assume that ...    Yes.    Yes.    No, it came as a draft to my office.    I don’t know who formulated the draft.  I just assume that it comes from the office of Minister, because they had been working on these issues.    No, I found it in my in-tray.    Yes.    Yes you know when you get into your office you find documents, you look at them and you assess the risk associated with that document, you sign it or sometimes you say look let me clarify and sometime I used to take work home and go through the things over the weekend and some of them I signed, some of them I go and get clarity on them, so this is the situation, I saw it, I looked at this letter, I looked at this letter of Mr Koko and I knew that there were issues which are happening with regards to this project and I just said look let me just see if this cannot help.  I just signed it.    It’s not normal and what also comforted me when I looked at the letter it also had the name of my DDG as enquiry, then I said okay perhaps you know they’ve been working together on this thing, that is what comforted me.    No it’s normal, we can find, maybe there’s a project they are waiting on, and they will discuss issues and say let’s prepare this letter for the DG to sign.    It’s the – the abnormality, it’s not normal and you know the way things are we could see that there’s something not right.    It’s not normal Chairperson, it’s not normal, it may be it could have happened but it’s not something which is normal.  What was normal is what you refer to earlier, that was – it’s common.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    I agree so, I agree he doesn’t refer to that.    Yes, it doesn’t refer to that.    Okay, that’s fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well the reason would be that there are people who have been discussing this issue of Optima and they then said let’s come with a proposal, let’s come with a letter to be sent to Eskom and that is what I would say, there would be people who would be looking at all these issues discussing them and they said okay let’s respond to this letter in this manner.      Certainly so Chairperson when I look now, where I am now, I looked at the letter of Mr Koko, the letter of Mr Koko I mean I had no reason to distrust a person of Mr Koko’s stature, standing, he was the head of Electricity Generation in the country, so when you get a letter like this and the letter paints a very dire situation for the country, if you look at that letter it basically- it was a precarious environment for the country that is coming, it has got deadlines, that I mean by end of January 2016 it will be the end of the end for this country in terms of electricity supply and now you can see that these things are connected.  He painted that there are at least three power stations which are at risk of not supplying electricity to the country if urgent issues are not addressed, if no interventions are put in place.  Hendrina he say 2000 megawatt is at risk, he talked about Arnot power station that come at end of December the contract is at risk and when you look at the letter it says the only available coal which will suit them is coal from Optimum I think or something like that and then he talks about Komati Power Station also at risk, so it painted this dire situation for the country that when I saw this thing I say hey you know what can I do, maybe this thing can help and I’m saying this Chairperson because I have in the past been involved in addressing issues, crises issues, okay.  We have gone out to look at issues of saving jobs and this also touched on saving jobs, because Optimum had plus minus 3 700 I think employees including contractors who were working there. It was also a dire situation from my point, not from the electricity situation, the electricity situation Mr Koko then talked about it, but from our side was can we save  jobs, so there were two issues which I looked at when I saw the letter, that’s the issues of the job, I said you know if this thing can help let me sign it, okay, because in the past we have done unconventional things and conventional things to save jobs.  In 1999 for instance if I may expand on that Chairperson there was a gold crises in the country, the gold price was at around 290 and now I mean today it’s about 1 300 dollars so jobs were lost and I was appointed to be the Secretariat to address this.  We did conventional things, Ministers were meeting every Monday you know, we went to the mines, things which we often never did.  In 2014 I think – so 2014 – ja 2014 or so there were about 14 000 jobs which were going to be lost at Anglo Platinum.  We did a conventional thing, I stopped whatever I was doing, I sat with all the stakeholders for two weeks, we find alternatives to job losses.  In fact at the end of it when we signed that agreement we had almost saved all the jobs, okay, so unconventional things have been done in the past.  So when I saw this letter I reflected on what we have done and said as long as things are done within the law Chairperson it’s fine, and I want to address the issue maybe right now of the relationship between us and Eskom Chairperson.  Okay as a Department of…    Yes, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson    Yes, Chairperson.    Okay.  The project I took it that, you know, the people who had been involved in the discussions they are basically discussing on how they could rescue Optimum or whatever at that point and I thought that could be the project which they are referring to, but it was just the mist in my mind.  I was not sure exactly what are they referring to.    But then I just said look let us see, but obviously there were people who came together, discussed, constructed the letter.    So I said they probably have got other things which they are working on.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    No, Chairperson I agree with you.  I mean things are now getting revealed.    And then it was a different environment.  It is like there was a crisis.  I have never, I mean if you reread the letter of Mr Koko it just paints a crisis of crisis for the country, you know.  I do not know why would a person draft a letter like that and now this are now clear that there is something not correct in the whole scheme of things.  Things are not fine Chairperson.    Not, yes Chairperson.    I did not do that.    Okay.    If I may come in Chair.    I think Chair at that time and as I said you know earlier on the communication channels.    In the department had changed.    And you know I do not want to repeat this.  There was like a mist, you know, in front [background of noise].    So when things come you just get discouraged.  You do not know what is happening.  You are trying to add the dots.  In a normal environment Chairperson, in a normal environment every single person who would be in the Mineral Regulation Branch, okay assigned to this task would transparently relate it to everybody.  So you will probably have your DDG who will work on something and say DG here is a problem, let us solve this.  Here is another.    But the way things were operated they were totally different.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Chairperson I think as I said earlier I in hindsight when I look at it I should have done better.  I should have been more vigilant than I was then, but I never thought that there are ulterior motives which are associated with the letter and it is said that now with all these things coming to the light you start to see that you know people can use the system of Government for their own benefit and I think I should have done better.    Yes, I accept so.    It can only come from within the department.    At that time I was not aware, because I would not be involved in the details of each and every mind what is the financial provision.    So I was in the way.  Those things, it means someone actively went and checked it, because even if you go to a Regional Office now and say there is mine X.  Regional Manager tell me what is the financial provision he would not know or she would not know.    She will have to go and look at the documents.  So that means there was someone who actively went and looked at those things and look at the values and say let us put this in this letter.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Shoo.    When it was in the news.    Yes.  No.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Hm, ja.    Yes.  I agree and after listening to yesterday’s statements which were made here I now, with regards to the letter from Mr Koko, I now see that you know there were some ulterior motives associated with the two letters.  It is quite clear from where I am now I do not want to make conclusions, but that there were people who were working on the two letters and unfortunately it is when I saw this statement I said what it is, I understood the letter to be saying that this is a proposal, okay and I will also go back to my statement Chairperson of saying Eskom cannot get a directive from the department or another department.  Can only get a directive from the Department of Public Enterprise and the management of Eskom if they want to say that was a directive I have got a problem with that.  They do not understand how corporate governance works, okay.  This I just saw it as a proposal and said look there is a crisis.  When is a crisis, which was painted by them by Mr Koko, when is a crisis you can do, you can look at other innovative ways of addressing the crisis.  We have done it in the past in a department, you know, when we did things unconventionally within the law to address the crisis.  So I looked at this letter.  I assessed the risk.  To me there was nothing illegal on my part in the letter.  There was nothing which I saw that you know it is not, it is untoward.  I just thought this can be a proposal.  A proposal which will help the country.  We have gone through power cuts, load shedding in the past and I just said if this man is painting that there will be load shedding, there will be power cuts, perhaps this letter can assist, but I knew the corporate governance if they had to implement anything there they will have to go through the processes of Eskom.  So I just left it as it is and I am surprised now that they did not have contact their department on this issue.  They only contacted the Department of Mineral Resources, very strange.    Ja.    No, I am not aware.  As I said I was not privy to these issues totally.    I am not aware.    Chairperson this is news to me.  I.    No, I am not aware Chairperson.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No, I agree.  I agree.  I agree Chairperson, yes.    Well with what is transpiring now you can see that it looks like to me that there were people who were trying to favour Tegeta to acquire this asset of Optimum and this is just my perception Chairperson and they used the system of Government to try to do that, okay and with the letter why did they go to the Department of Minerals to do this, I do not know why they did that.  Maybe it was an easier route for them to do that or they were part of whatever they were planning, but it is quite clear that there is a linkage of some kind and the enquiry will probably find out those linkages.    It is around.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    It was before I submitted my letter of resignation.    Around the 7th, around there.    Ja.  Just after.    Ja, just after the Minister.  I think they had gone to Zurich.  I think they came back on the 7th.    So it is on the 6th.    Around there.    Those dates.    I tried now because when I was with the investigators I asked them.  I said I can contact Mr Raphela, because I know at some point when that letter surfaced in Parliament.    I sent it to him, but we never went into its details.  So, but when the investigators were discussing this issue I asked them, I said can I contact people to prepare for my responses.  They then said yes it is fine.  Then I tried to phone Mr Raphela.  He did not return my calls, yes.    Okay.    Thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTA:  I did not have any plans. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Yes.    Indeed.    And that is a point Doctor Ramontja.    That the request for intervention.    Is sent to your department.    Which you were the head at that point in time.    And yet it is not sent to the executive authority who is responsible for Eskom for intervention because normal Minister to Minister protocol relationship …    Would have required that any intervention ought to begin with that executive authority responsible for Eskom for him to approach your department for any possibility of intervention.  Here is Eskom approaching you directly for intervention and yet it is not doing the same thing to its Minister.    Mr Ramontja – Doctor Ramontja we will explore later on whether this letter had the authority of the board of Eskom or even the Minister of Public Enterprises.  I am not going to ask you to comment on this but I am grateful that you have tabled the governance process around how Eskom should officially communicate with your department.  Now Chair I had raised yesterday with Mr Marsden the condition precedents relating to the sale of agreement requiring the approval of the Competition Commission requiring the consent of the Minister of Mineral Resources for the transfer of the mining right.    And also requiring the consent of Eskom to the transaction.  All of those things in terms of the agreement had to be achieved.    By the 31 December – 31 January 2016.  And you would recall that that agreement imposing those conditions precedents was signed on the 10 October – sorry 10 December 2015.  Of course Doctor Ramontja does not know anything about this.  But what I find surprising is that even at that point in time when this response is sent to Eskom the obligation to implement these conditions of precedent – conditions precedents had not yet kicked in so the response is anticipating matters in the agreement which had not yet been included.  So it seems if I may suggest this to Doctor Ramontja against the context of what I have raised with the Chaiperson.  That someone who was writing this response must have had some understanding of what was required in terms of this agreement relating to the approval of the competition commission, the consent of the Minister and also the consent of Eskom.  And that is why that paragraph I have read to you talked to those matters even though Mr Koko did not raise them.  Of course you did not know anything about these things?    Okay.  Chair I would like to go to the next part of the letter unless you have some questions?    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good after DCJ.    Chair you have before you or should have before you Exhibit K2 which is the second bundle now dealing with matters relevant to former Minister Nene.  There are three bundles here and they have been bundled unfortunately into one file because of stationery issues but I won’t bother you with that Chair.    There are two applications for condonation, one of which at least is now moot, being an application for postponement, that postponement having already occurred.  May I ask Ms Sello to deal with the two applications before you and then I will lead the supplementary evidence of Mr Nene.    It is perhaps appropriate given the lapse of time to swear the witness in.    Thank you.  Mr Nene in the file K2 before you after the second divider you will see a document entitled supplementary affidavit of Nhlanhla Musa Nene signed, do you see that?  It’s after the third divider.  That part of the bundle has been separately paginated and if you would go to page 15 please.  Whose signature is that on page 15?    And the statement pages 1 to 15 is that your statement?    Are you aware of the contents of that statement?    Are they true and correct?    Before dealing with the contents of your statements it’s perhaps necessary to explain Mr Nene why you are here today.  You gave evidence before this Commission on the 3rd of October 2019, you obviously recall that.    However in the one or two days before you testified several things took place, firstly an article appeared in electronic media and the press making certain what appeared to be serious allegations against you.  In the bundle before you they appear, and I will refer to them in detail in due course, from page 50 and following, all these articles to which I am now going to refer were provided to your legal representatives in order to allow you an opportunity to consider them. Secondly on the 2nd and 3rd of October the Economic Freedom Front, the EFF released public statements also making quite serious allegations against you, these appear at page 59 and 61 and we will refer to them in a moment, and then various other allegations appeared in social media for example the allegation at page 69.  Now on the 3rd of October – and we will come to them in a moment Mr Nene – on the 3rd of October there were discussions between the Commission’s legal team and your legal representatives, the result of which was that you were informed by the legal team that it would be unfair to confront you with these allegations at that stage when you had not had a chance to consider them and to consider your response, and in response to that information you undertook to come back to give evidence before this Commission for two main reasons, one so that these allegations could be put to you, you having had a chance with your legal representatives to consider their detail, and secondly to allow you to put your own response to what is contained in these allegations, and that is the purpose of your evidence today. If I can take you then to page 50 so that we may understand these allegations, on page 50 and it appears that this is an article that appeared in Business Live and it was derived from internet sources, its source is less important for the moment at least than what is said in the article.      The second allegation that arises in this particular article is a quote from a former employee of the Mail & Guardian newspaper, one Zukile Majova, and he apparently circulated the following on Facebook and that statement appears later, once again Chair we seem to be offline.  Chair we seem to be offline?    Yes, perhaps the allegations be ...    Thank you Chair.    Thank you DCJ.  I’m told that I omitted to inform you that the legal representative of Mr Nene are before you, may she put herself on record?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Nene before the break we were dealing with the allegations that appeared in the article that is on page 50 of the bundle before you, and we were referring to a report that was circulated on Facebook,    We should note that Amon Bongani subsequently denied that they were the source of this report, although Mr Majova purports this report to be an Amon Bongani press release, is that correct?    Then on page 51 and I am not going to read the whole of these allegations, but just to highlight the important ones, in the middle of page 51 reference is made to a damaging narrative abroad that Nene pressed Survé, Iqbal Survé, to consummate the agreement with the Gupats and that he did that because the Guptas had something on him and then reference is made to an accusation made by the EFF, Mr Malema, that he, Mr Malema has got a scandal that they’ve got on him, that’s Mr Nene, that involves his daughter which they gave to him and they never reported it, that too you deal with in your statement, is that correct?    The Majova Facebook report appears in the following pages in small print but in the terms that have just been read onto the record, it appears at page 58.  Do you see that?    Page 58, that is the Majova report that appeared on Facebook, it’s printed in smaller form on page 58.    And we’ve read that onto the record.    And then on page 59 is a press release at the hands of the EFF headed “our case against Nhlanhla, and we will come to that in detail in due course and the allegations made in it, but it was released on Tuesday 2 October 2018,    And then in the middle of the page the EFF make the    And then at the bottom of the page in the last paragraph    That is then copied to Siyabonga, Nene, your son I believe, who acknowledges receipt and you deal with allegations in relation to that project as well in due course, is that correct?    Those are in short the allegations that were brought to your attention by the legal team that you were then given an opportunity to consider and form the background of your presence here today.  May we then please go to your statement, at page 1, and if I could just ask you to express your sentiments in your own words is there anything to add, or that you would wish to add about why you are here today, other than what we’ve already dealt with, and what may appear in paragraph 1.      May I just add Chair that the work of the investigators is ongoing, issues relating to the PIC will be dealt with by a separate work stream and obviously political parties including the EFF will have an opportunity to give evidence, but I may say that we have not received from any party any evidence to this – at this stage, or until now in regard to the allegations made, other than our own investigations.    Yes Chair.  We do know – I do not have the terms of reference of the party commissioned here.    But the terms of reference do restrict.    Their own work.    To a particular time period commencing 2015.    So insofar as there is evidence before that period relative to the work of this commission we may need to deal with it independently.  But we are aware of the possibility of duplication.    That will be thoroughly examined.      For the moment     I am reliably informed …    By the legal team.    Whose sources are ordinarily impeccable Chair.    If we may then go to page 2 of your statement Mr Nene.  What position did you hold between the dates 8 November 2008 and 25 May 2014?    Now would you then please deal with the allegation that you knowingly acted to promote funding from the PIC to benefit your son or any business in which your son was involved in at the time?    Alright before you go on this issue was also the subject of a – of an investigation by the current Public Protector.    Resulting from the a complaint lodged with her by the Democratic Alliance, the DA.    We will deal with that in a moment.    You say that in your capacity as Chair of the PIC you were not aware of any financial assistance given to your son or to any business in which your son was involved at the time, is that correct?    Did your son ever tell you about any business benefit that he might have received from the PIC?    Ja we will come to that in a moment.  Did you ever attend a meeting of the board of the PIC where a decision was made to fund a business in which Siyabonga Nene was involved?    And did you ever receive any information from any official or board member of the PIC that such an application for assistance from the PIC was being considered by the PIC?    Do you know whether at the time or did you know let us split that issue up into two what you knew then and what you know now.  At the time you were chair of the PIC did you have any knowledge of any grant to your son of any benefit from the PIC?    What came to your knowledge after you took office as Minister of Finance and after your relationship with the PIC board had come to end?    Is that M-i-r-z-a?    So you knew your son was involved in businesses at the time you were chair of the PIC?    Just bear with me a minute Chair please?    I am informed Chair that once again technical problems have arisen and that we have been asked by our support team to request a short break.  I am not sure what the problems are and what affect they will have.    Yes he has spoken to us Chair and asked that.    At home?    Well apparently Chair although we are “live” here everything else outside is dead so that is the problem in a non-technical sense.  I do not have the fancy words to describe it.  But apparently the feed is not operative.    Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Thank you Chair.  Mr Nene we were at paragraph 7 of your statement.  You would have at some stage read the news report or the news reports to which we made reference earlier today and particularly the statement regarding your alleged role in the PIC.    Did you speak to your son about those allegations once you had read the report?    When did you discuss his alleged partner Mr Mirza?    Right.  Did he tell you what his relationship was with any business in which Mr Mirza might have been involved when Mr Mirza might have received funding from the PIC?    So did your son break with Mr Mirza?    Yes.  Did you receive a communication from the Public Protector during October 2018?    And did that complaint or did the communication refer to a complaint received from the Democratic Alliance particularly Mr David Maynier?    If you look at Annexure NN1 please which is on page 16.    That is a letter which appears to come from the Public Protector’s Office addressed to yourself and it is dated as most public documents or communications are date at the end 24 October 2018.  That appears on page 18.    Yes.  The complaint, I might as well just go there, is in    You responded in writing?    Did you attempt to respond in any other way?    Did you ever have a one on one meeting/    Alright.    Would you look at page 19 Annexure NN2 please?    Is that your response?    It reads in paragraph 2 or three   Well did you know of Indiafrec Trade & Investment (Pty) Ltd or any investment in the Mozambique Oil Refinery by a concern in which both Mirza and Siyabonga Nene had equity?    At the time it is alleged to have been made?    Right.  What did your son tell you about the allegation?    In the paragraph above.    Alright.  Do you know whether that company in which Mr Mirza had equity ever received a benefit from the Public Investment Corporation?    Did you then invite the Public Protector to engage the PIC directly on the matter?    And you offer in the last paragraph or the penultimate paragraph to meet with the Public Protector?    The communication that we have just referred to is dated 26 November 2018.  Do you see that?  That is on page 19.    Since then have you heard anything further from the Public Protector?    Right.  In that document on behalf of the Public Protector you are thanked for your assistance.  Has anything transpired since?    Right.  Let us move onto paragraph 11 please.  Annexure A is dealt with in that paragraph and the paragraph that follow and Annexure A appears at page 50.  We have summarised the allegations in that already.  Generally speaking what do you say about the allegations made on page 50?    And on the following pages up to page 52.    Alright.  It is a rather general allegation, but requires a response nevertheless.  You were alleged to have had meetings with quite “dodgy business people” and the EFF states that it has a record of these meetings.  What is your response to that/    What about the allegation concerning Iqbal Survé and the Independent Group?  Now one of the underlying facts that might be relevant is that we know that the PIC invested up to R1 billion in the Independent Group of Mr Survé [intervenes].    This might well be a matter that is currently being dealt with by the Mpati Commission.    Dealing with PIC affairs and according to press reports that is in fact the case.    But let us take it step by step please.  Did you have any role in bringing about the transaction which led to the investment in the Independent Group?    What role did you play in relation to Mr Survé and Mr Ajay Gupta or the Gupta family?    Right, would you speak up a little please.  I think [intervenes].    Alright.  The news report refers to a letter that you    Whilst you were Chairman of the Board of the PIC would you have ever had occasion to write a letter to the PIC asking for people to get money?    Right.  After that period did you ever communicate in writing with the PIC?    When this article was published had you been asked to respond to its contents?    Right.  You have said that you did advise the Guptas that they were not prevented from entering into a partnership with Mr Survé arising out of any establishment by him in the Independent Group?    Other than that did you ever facilitate any business transaction and I use facilitate in its most general sense for the Gupta family?    Let us deal with the Facebook posing please apparently by one Zukile Majova and that appears in legible form at page 53.  This contains some far reaching allegations.  Perhaps you should go to page 58 where the legible version is please.  Firstly it purports to be a quote from the press entity amaBhungane.  Now we know that amaBhungane from other information in this bundle have denied their    It follows   And.    Alright and the person known as Kingdom?    Right.  It says that these two persons were funded by the PIC for an IPP Project approved by Nhlanhla Nene.  Is that correct?    Right.  Is it correct that Dabengwa was at a time a member of the Eskom Board?    Well what you say of the at least implied suggestion here that you were somehow influential in bringing Mr Dabengwa onto the Eskom Board?    Following up from your being made aware of the statement?    It is then says   Then there is a reference to “they” presumably Mail & Guardian “…even have traces of money through Dubai same banks as the Guptas.  They say Nhlanhla Nene was not only linked to the Guptas but instrumental in funding many of their business deals.” What do you say to that in particularly the allegation that you funded it through a bank or funded the Guptas businesses through a bank in Dubai?    Then it says apparently   Right and we will come to those circumstances.    In due course.    Right.  Then if we go back then please to paragraph 18    And then in paragraph 18 you deal with the fact that your wife does not have an offshore account.  Is that correct?    And again you invite evidence to this effect?    You repeat in paragraph 19 that you were in anyway instrumental in funding any business owned by the Gupta family.  Have you ever been blackmailed by any member of the Gupta family?    Yes.  There is a reference to a scandal involving your daughter.  Do you know anything about that?    Again you invite that evidence?    It is also alleged that you were appointed Minister of Finance on 24 May 2014 in exchange for a promise to deliver benefits to the Guptas.  Is that statement correct?    Generally what do you say about the contents of the EFF press statements of the 2nd and 3 October 2018 as annexed to your statement?    Alright, well let us just pause there for a moment, before we get there.    There was an accusation in the press reports that you failed to respond to a parliamentary question put to you by Mr Floyd Shivambu of the EFF on 12 June 2018.  Do you recall that allegation?    Right and there is an email chain at pages 40 to 41 which assert the hand delivery of the response to the questions?    And at page 42 is a letter addressed to Mr Shivambu which goes on to page 45 which on the face of it at least responds to his questions.  Is that correct?    Alright.  Now if you were asked why do you think the EFF or anyone else for that matter, but in this case the EFF would want to publish allegations about you shortly before you came to this Commission to give evidence?    Sorry what was your role in relation to VBS at around this time?    Just in relation to this, do you have personal memory of having received the sms in these terms?    You do have that sms any longer on any of your devices?    Where does this – did you forward this message to anyone?    And that message is still on his phone?    In any event your evidence as I understand it is that you had certain responsibilities in relation to the VBS Bank which you duly carried out in the period before and after receipt of that sms.    Is there any other reason that you can think of that you might have been a target at that time?    So in short during 2018 and before your resignation you under your watch as it was Minister were responsible for dealing amongst other things with the matters related to the South African Revenue Services?    Did you play any role in the decision to appoint the Nugent Commission?    In your last answer you mentioned the name of someone who had allegedly supported the EFF in relation to the matters raised by you regarding SARS, we may have lost that on the record, you spoke very quickly, what was his name?    Mazzoti?    Did you support the establishment of Nugent Commission in your role as Commissioner, in your role as Minister?     Then at the instance of the legal team we’ve asked you to deal in more detail with your visit to the Gupta residence and the Gupta business at Sahara Computers, do you see that at the bottom of page 7?    You do deal with it in your statement of 5 October 2018 on pages 47 and 48, but what I would like to emphasize please is two points, which you deal with in that statement and perhaps when you deal with your reasons for the visit you can deal with these two issues, the first is why would a Minister visit businessmen at their residence and without accompaniment by any Treasury official, and secondly why would those visits take place after allegations in the press regarding the at least questionable business dealings of the Guptas, so would you tell the Commission please in detail of your visits, why you visited, and deal too with those two issues that I’ve just highlighted please.    May I just stop you there, this is a general explanation you’re giving together with some detail of your visits, I think the Chair would prefer you just to tell him without necessarily reading the statement.  You say you made visits to the Gupta family on a number of occasions, can you recall how many?    Let’s go back to paragraph 25 if we may, you say there you made six visits when you were Deputy Minister of Finance and two visits when you were Minister of Finance, is that correct?    Yes, the two visits that you made when you were Minister of Finance would in all probability have been after the press releases dealing with the Guptas business dealings?    When you made these six visits as Deputy Minister of Finance and the two visits when you were Minister of Finance did you go alone.    Yes you give your view in hindsight of the advisability of that and we will deal with that later.    Why would you visit as Minister of Finance firstly to their home and secondly unaccompanied by any Treasury official after the Waterkloof landing or after the scandal or alleged scandal had appeared in the press.    At the time these visits were made did you know or did you have reason to suspect that there were allegations of influence being exercised over the former President and government officials?    Well the allegations were pretty overwhelming, particularly when seen in the light of the landing at the Waterkloof Airforce base was it not a good idea to stay at arm’s length at that stage?    Alright.  You will recall last time you gave evidence here in October of 2018, notwithstanding politicians, certain politicians view to the contrary I did ask you a series of questions dealing with probabilities, let me put them to you again in case they weren’t hurt.  We know from the evidence that the Gupta family is alleged to have made not one but several untoward approaches to senior government officials and politicians asking amongst other things for favours, raising expectations and even offering money in return there for, you know of those allegations?    Now to the extent that that evidence is accepted by the Chair it would seem quite improbable that similar approaches were not made to you, quite apart from the Iqbal Survé approach, what do you say to that, do you have anything to add to our answer given last time.    Can I just – what was the position in regard to any influence sought to be exercised over yourself apart from the matter you’ve raised in connection with Independent Group and Mr Survé?    Did you ever have a discussion with any of the Guptas at one or other of their premises, residential or business in regard to the launch of the television channel ANN7?    What happened?    Then just to provide the detail insofar as the detail may be relevant I understand from your statement that you visited the Gupta Family on about eight occasions, six visits while you were Deputy Minister of Finance and two visits when you were Minister of Finance, and those visits were at the home in Saxonwold and at the Midrand offices.    Once you were Minister of Finance did you have occasion to visit the Saxonwold home of the Guptas, and I’m at paragraph 39 of your statement.    And was it on one of those visits that you were asked to intervene in a dispute between themselves and Dr Iqbal Survé.    And then the second visit?    Right.  You will recall at the beginning of your evidence we referred to the email chain at page 70 of the bundle.    There appears there to be at least on the face of it some relationship between your son, Siyabonga Nene, and Duduzane Zuma in relation to a project called the Brakfontein Project, would you tell the Chair about what you knew of that and your interactions with your son in that regard please?    So did your – firstly this series of emails as they appear on page 70 were they drawn to the attention of yourself and your legal representatives by the Commission’s legal team?    Right, and you were asked then by your legal team to respond to this issue that had been raised by the legal team of the Commission?    And you say that as I understand it there was in fact according to your son at least contemplation of a project involving your son and Duduzame Zuma and perhaps others called the Brakfontein Project?    But it never eventuated.    Why did you resign after giving evidence Mr Nene?    Did you consult the President in relation to your resignation?    Mr Nene your statement, public statement to fellow South Africans is at page 47 and 48 of the bundle, if you wish to I am going to invite you to read it because you deal there with at least two questions raised in relation to your relationship with the Guptas that we’ve discussed in evidence, the fact that they were visited at their private residence and secondly at the time in relation to at least some of the visits when there was public controversy regarding the Guptas.  So if you wish to read it onto the record it will take a minute, you may.    Well certainly paragraphs 2 and 3.    In that paragraph you set a standard that you say you should have adhered to and public office bearers should adhere to and then in the final paragraph the statement of paragraph – on page 48 you encourage anyone who has evidence in regard to the work of this commission to come forward and hand it over to the commission, do you see that?    A question that has been raised and perhaps I am pre-empting a question that you would ask Chair so stop me if I am.    The invitation has been made several times by the Chair for people in government and people who have been members of the executive to come forward to the commission and to tell the commission what they know of the matters which this commission is investigating.  The response has been present but hardly overwhelming.  Can you explain from your own experiences why this should be so?    Well not in the quantity that the Chair I think would have liked and the Chair has expressed that very sentiment this morning in a public interview.    Thank you very much Mr Nene.  Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair two issues.    As a matter of some controversy both within the Commission and outside in the public eye, I would just like to summarise with Mr Nene at least a view of the questions that we have asked both on the first occasion now and the questions that you have covered.    And then I would like to put a request before you on behalf of Ms Hassim.    And I will deal with that second.    Mr Nene just to summarise the position in regards to the visits to the Guptas.  We know of eight visits to residence and business of the Guptas.  We know that those visits were made alone and at least in relation to some of the visits at a time when controversy surrounded the Guptas business dealings.  We know those as fact.  You have said that various topics were discussed including the Iqbal Survé interaction, but you have said and I think this the crucial point around which some controversy arises, you have said that no influence was sought to be exercised over you by the Guptas.    Now in relation to that we have no evidence to the contrary.  The only evidence that we have of what happened during those visits is your evidence and it is perhaps unlikely that we will get any other evidence to the contrary.  We have though evidence from amongst others Messieurs Mashigo, Jonas and Ms Mentor which is evidence which would strongly suggest that it is very improbable that when you visited the Gupta residences and businesses no attempt would have been made to exercise influence over and you have given your explanations in regard to that.  Of course the legal team can only put that to you as evidence rather than as factual findings of the Commission because those factual findings have not been made, but we must conclude that there is at least a question mark albeit a qualified question mark concerning the probabilities as to whether influence was sought to be exercised or not and that is as far as we can take it and I presume you will accept that that question mark must remain?    That is an avenue that we might well explore then.    Chair I have a request from Ms Hassim to ask three questions.  The regulations do allow re-examination.  Technically this would not be re-examination, but we would support it.    Well it is public knowledge and they themselves said it was public knowledge that they were friends to the former President and the President had also gone public to say that they were his friends who had offered his son a job when nobody wanted to employ him.  So I did understand them to be very close to the President.    Yes Chair.    There is three minutes to go Chair.    Nothing further.    No Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thus far Chair.    I was previously informed that he may well take the whole day.  I have received a message.    From Mr Makwena who says that might not be the case, but at the very least there is no need for the Chair to start early.    As you please Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair.    Chair it’s morning until the sun goes down.  Chair based on what Mr Pretorius has just said perhaps the best place to start would be with the second application for postponement, the one he says is moot, it is under tab 2 of your file, of K2.      That was an application that was filed on behalf of Mr Nene for a postponement due to ill-health and just to place on record that that application was actually heard on the 15th of November.    It so happened in the compilation of the file these two have always been together and I think the error occurred in duplicating both of them for purposes of K2.  It really should not be in the file Chair.    So that one has been granted on the 15th of November so it is deposed of.  So what I stand to address you on primarily Chair is the application brought by the legal team  for non-compliance with the provisions of Rule 33 and that would be under Tab 1.    Now just to briefly give you a background Mr Nene testified on the 3rd of October 2018 his statement having been received on the 1st of October and the annexures thereto, the complete annexures on the 2nd of October.  This made it impossible for the legal team to comply with their 14 day 33 notice  The notices were however issued immediately upon receipt of the complete file and they appear as Annexures B1 to B4 in your file.  The reasons for the delay are well articulated in paragraph 14.8 and Chair we submit that they are reasonable under the circumstances.    At paragraph 14 point 8 at page 17 ...(intervention)    No it is in respect of the original statement.    Okay let start with the date on which Mr Nene appeared before you Chair, that was the 3rd of October.     If the Chair would have regard to page 17 of the bundle at paragraph 14.8 the legal team states that the statement was only received on the 1st of October and the complete annexures on the 2nd of October when Mr Nene was due to testify the following day, on the 3rd.  That meant that the legal team could not comply with the requirements of the 14 day notice period in terms of 33.   From paragraph 14.8.1 also on page 17 we set out the reason why the statement was late in the first place.    The reasons were, a few reasons, it was – apologies, Minister Nene’s busy work schedule at the time, he was doing a whole lot of travelling, there was – the issues he had to deal with, the volume was increasing and he had to apply his mind thereto, the availability of his legal representatives to complete the statement including the voluminous issues that were raised subsequent to the first draft and then there was ...(intervention)     The statement was supposed to have ...(intervention)     If the Chair has regard to paragraph 14.5 that’s where we set the timelines.    It says that on 29th August 2018 it was contemplated that Mr Nene would give evidence on the 10th of September.  The date was later changed to the 14th of September in light of Mr Nene’s unavailability and on 7 September a new date was arranged for the 3rd of October.  So if one then has regard to the 3rd of October which is the new scheduled date the statement should have come, should have been received by us as a bare minimum 14 days prior to that date, that would have been mid-September, around the 15th of September Chair.    It arrived in two parts, the statement itself arrived on the 1st of October and the complete set of Annexures to the statement arrived on the 2 nd of October.    The delay was about two weeks Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Now the persons implicated by Mr Nene’s statement former President Zuma, Mr Mahlobo, Ms Joemat-Pettersen and Ms Nkoana Mashabane.    If you permit me Chair I am going to hand up a few documents which were received after the compilation of the application which are the responses from the various implicated person,    Let me start with former President Zuma, there has been .  Notice was delivered in terms of B1 of the file and there has been no response.  Ms Nkoana Mashabane responded on the 19th of October to indicate that she had received the notice, perused the notice together with the attachments and in particulars 58 to 6 and she drew her conclusion that she is not implicated by the allegations made by Mr Nene, so that was the position she took and no further correspondence has been entered into.  The second one Chair would be Mr Mahlobo, Mr Mahlobo’s view was to confirm that he did receive the notice of the 12th, and he too draws the conclusion that he is not implicated by the evidence of Mr Nene, he therefore elects not to give evidence, to call any witness or to cross-examine Mr Nene.    He however indicated that he has no objection to the granting of the condonation application that we sought to bring.      Lastly communication was received from Ms Joemat-Pettersen’s attorneys, it was a fairly long letter, basically requesting a range of documents much along the lines of better discovery to enable her to deal with the Rule 3.3.  She confirmed however in that letter that she had received the notice, together with Mr Nene’s statement and the annexures thereto, requested this list of documents, which we considered irrelevant for purposes of Rule 3.4 and should she be interested to receive those further documents she is at liberty to get in touch with Mr Nene’s attorneys to receive them directly.   In light of that – of that long list, she then – she indicated that the 14 days period hasn’t started to run against her, we indicated that everything that the Commission received from Mr Nene on the basis of which we issued a 3.3 has been made available to her and that under the circumstances we are of the view that she is able to make a determination whether to invoke her rights in terms of the rules, and we haven’t received a response thereto.  In her original response she had however made indicated her willingness to appear before you and to answer any questions that the Chair may have and that is the status of the implicated persons Chair.    I am indebted to the Chair.   
WITNESS:  Nhlanhla Musa Nene.    No objection.    Yes.    So help me God. 
NHLANHLA NENE:  (duly sworn states) 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair it is 97.3% recovered and I called in the benefits of old age, I turned 60 a few months ago, so it takes slightly longer for a person of my age to recover, to head.    It is my signature Mr Chairperson.    It is indeed my statement.    I am fully aware of the contents.    Absolutely.    That’s correct.    I do.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct.    That is correct Commissioner.    Indeed I do.    That is correct.    That’\s correct sir.    That is correct.    Thank you Chair.  There isn’t much to add on the statement because as I indicated that I would be quite prepared to return to the Commission in order to answer on these matters and that these matters be put to me but I also at the end of the term, submission, I did deny the allegations being levelled against me by the Economic Freedom Fighters and others and that it had any basis in truth, I therefore agreed to come back and be able to – and that is the reason why I am here today.    I held the position of Deputy Minister of Finance and I was also the non-executive director and chairperson of the PIC board.  And as stated in the statement so although this is not required by law it has become practice that the deputy ministers serves as chair of the Public Investment Commission board or Cooperative board.    These allegations were made as you have correctly pointed out in the media before I appeared before this commission that I acted improperly concerning investments made by the PIC in particular that I knowingly acted to promote funding from the PIC to benefit businesses that my son Siyabonga Nene is involved in.  My response at that stage and it remains that I did not promote any financing from the PIC to any companies involving my son and I go further to say that I was not aware that the PIC funded a business that my son was involved in during my tenure as Deputy Minister and Chair of the board and he had never shared any information with me either.    Public Protector yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.  That is correct.    Not during my tenure as Deputy Finance Minister but he did share this with me at a later stage where he was indicating that they had applied for funding with the PIC and I do cover that in the statement.    Not according to my recollection and I trust the PIC board records would bear me out on that.    No.    No I did not.    Well that was after I had actually taken office as Minister of Finance after I also left the board my son and his – my son informed me that he himself and his business partner Mr Mirza who had applied to the PIC…    That is correct yes.  That they had applied for financing of an investment in Mozambique Oil Refinery and I reminded him of my previous admonishments that he could not be involved in business with government because of my role in government that I also would never use my position for the private benefit of myself or any family member.      Yes Sir.    That is correct.    Indeed I did speak to him and he assured me that he never received any benefit from the Public Investment Corporation and [intervenes].    Yes.  We did and he did indicate that Mirza may have benefitted but the extent of the benefit is unknown to me because it was now through his company where my son was not involved.    Look the relationship originally when they applied for funding was that they were partners, but when it reached a point of whatever benefit might have accrued to Mirza my son was no longer party to that.    Yes, from the company that was doing business.    That is correct.  I did receive a complaint from the Public Protector.    That is correct.    Yes, I [intervenes].    That is correct.    Indeed I did respond Commissioner and the response is attached as Annexure NN2.    I did, yes.    In the letter the Public Protector had indicated that she would be amenable also to a one on one engagement and I had preferred that, because I thought that would answer all the questions, but then she felt that perhaps I just need to respond in writing if there is a need for a one on one we would be able to do that.    No, we did not.    Since she was not available for a one on one, but I submitted the written response.    Yes, correct.    That is my response, sir.    That was the allegation, but also what I was stating in the letter was that I had not tried to influence the investment process into this company at all.    Indeed I had been informed later after my departure from PIC as Chairperson.    At the time, no.    He.    He informed me that he derived no benefit from the investment by the PIC in the oil refinery and also that subsequent to them having applied for financing he had also resigned from that company, but also whatever benefit might have accrued, would have accrued to the company that his partner alone was.    I am not sure sir.    Absolutely.    That is correct.    Yes, the NN2 of that document.    Indeed I did receive an acknowledgement of receipt from the Office of the Public Protector I think two days after that.  I think it is NN3.    No, nothing sir.    Sir.    Categorically I deny all allegations made in Annexure 1 of this Commission’s questions and I truly can only describe this report and social media commentary as baseless and unfounded.    Again my response is simply that I never had any meetings with those dodgy business people and I invite the EFF to provide such evidence to the Commission and to myself.    Again I would perhaps refer the Commission to the processes that are followed by the PIC and I strongly refute any allegations that I might have anything to do with that, but the processes of the PIC would also, you know, bear testimony to what role as a Chairman and at that time personally and what Chairman is supposed to do in that instance.    Absolutely.    Correct.    Absolutely none, sir.    Because I stated in my, when I appeared before this Commission that around August 2014 Mr Gupta asked me whether an arrangement or an agreement between the PIC and Mr Survé would preclude the family from participating in the deal and I was able to confirm that that was not the case and that is about my only involvement in this matter.    I am saying as I stated in my submission on 3 October that during August Mr Ajay Gupta had asked me whether an agreement between the PIC and Mr Survé would preclude them from participating in any arrangement with him and I was able to explain to him that was not the case.    I have never seen such a letter and I have no doubt that there would not be such a letter, but I would again invite Mr Malema to produce that letter, because it might assist in clarifying.    Absolutely not.    No, sir.    No, I was not asked and I mean it would have helped if I was, because I would then have been able to explain my side of the story.    That is correct.    None whatsoever.    I have dealt with that sir.    That is incorrect.  As I indicated also in my statement that I only Mr Dabengwa as Sifiso Dabengwa because he was Chief Executive of MTN, but I have never made any personal contact with him.    Let alone being friends.    Kingdom is not known to me as at all unless he trades under a different name, but I do not know him.    It is not correct and I do not understand how I could have approved an IPP Program.    I would not know, but on investigation I think he was, I mean earlier last year or late in 2017, I think he does feature because we only did that when we were checking on the records because when we saw his name we wanted to check whether he ever was on the Board, but it is not something that I knew prior to this allegation.    That would be incorrect, because as I said I mean also in my capacity I do not understand how I would have actually influenced his appointment, because at that time I was not in Government and when the Eskom Board was appointed and I only knew about his appointment when I was actually following up on whether he ever was on the Board.    Correct.    I did not see it in the Mail & Guardian.    That Chair I also did deny this under oath before the Commission and goes on to say that my wife also received money in a foreign account and judging by how often my wife is broke I would have really, I would have really celebrated if she had a foreign account, because I would also share on that one.    That was only in October last year.    Correct.    Yes.    That is correct, yes.    That is correct, sir.    Absolutely.    Definitely not, sir.  I cannot remember or recall any such blackmail.    Not that I know of, but you know I mean any issue involving my daughter would actually be private and, but as far as I know there was no blackmail, but I mean if there is a need also to.    Absolutely.    It is definitely not correct, sir and again if there is any evidence to that effect.  It would be appreciated.    Look I mean it is, I find it very strange and I must say that it can only be speculation that I suspect one that this might have been political more than anything and as you have seen in the statement it does indicate that it goes further to say that there is no one who is clean in the ANC and the only solution to this would be to remove the ANC from power and elect a revolutionary force which is the EFF, but also sir I must indicate that while though this is speculation among other things that I was involved in it is common knowledge that there was a link between the EFF and VBS at some point where it turned out it is common and public knowledge that Mr Floyd Shivambu’s brother benefited from the.    Ja.    I do recall that allegation and I have provided evidence that that was also not true, because the parliamentary question was responded to and there is evidence of that.    That is correct.    That is correct.    As I said I strongly believe that there might have been an attempt at tarnishing my integrity before appearing before the Commission and therefore bring my evidence into question, but also these attacks on the National Treasury and myself in particular and other members of staff at the Treasury had actually started mounting even prior to that.  There is a; as I was beginning to indicate that it is common knowledge and public knowledge that one of Mr Floyd Shivambu’s brothers or his brother had benefitted from the VBS matter.  A matter of which.    I.    I had, but I think the second question also links quite [intervenes].    Ja.    I am comfortable Chair, thank you.  You know, my role was as Minister of Finance putting a bank like the VBS in that situation was the task of the Minister of Finance which is what I did a few days after I had been appointed and.    Yes.    It started from my role.    Okay.  I said one of what I needed to do as Minister of Finance was to put, it was going to be my duty as Minister of Finance to take a decision  on whether to put a bank like the VBS with its challenges under curatorship.    So the application that was made by the Governor of the Central Bank was sent to the Minister of Finance and during that weekend a few days after I had been reappointed as Minister of Finance one of the things I had to do to engage with was dealing with VBS and I have it on record here that there was an SMS that was or a text message that was sent to me by Mr Floyd Shivambu and I have made a copy of the transcripts and my legal team will be able to provide you with the transcript of that SMS and if I.    And if you allow me I would, it is not very long.  I can actually just read it out to you.    I was reappointed as Minister of Finance on the 20th, I think 28 February 2018.    No the application was, when I was appointed I am sure the processes were under way.    Because a report had already been received that the Bank was facing liquidity challenges.    But the process had not reached.    Correct.    Absolutely.    And the short SMS which was copied also to the National    This was received either on the 9th or the 10th of March because it was copied to the DG, the DG was able to confirm that and when we met on the Saturday of that weekend we met at the airport because I was travelling to the UK for the first road show and we had to take this decision, but when we met both myself and the DG had received this communication so it was part of our discussion when we met on the Saturday prior to our departure.    After my reappointment, that is correct.    The 9th or 10th of March, either Friday or Saturday.    That is correct, yes I do.    I do not have it on my devices but we were fortunately able to get it from the DG’s cell phone who was copied on this one.  When I left the National Treasury I needed to clean my phone of all the information that was on the phone so that I don’t leave with confidential information from the Treasury.    We had a discussion because the DG had the message, I also had the message, it wasn’t forwarded.    On his phone yes.  So this is but one of those reasons that I think might have actually, because I did not succumb to this kind of pressure because this was meant to influence my decision based on something that I don’t think Mr Shivambu understood what was the reason because putting the bank under curatorship was not because we actually wanted to destroy the bank which was black-owned, the purpose was actually to make sure that we close the leakage because if we didn’t do that come Monday that bank would actually have collapsed, so the purpose here was to actually remedy the situation and it was a decision that I found strange that somebody would want to influence my decision on that.    That is correct.      Look I mean though it is also mere speculation but I would really want the perhaps the Commission to look into the issue of SARS of which I was also responsible for assisting the Presidency in terms of putting together the terms of reference, because as we all know that at the beginning the EFF was in support of dealing with issues at SARS but all of a sudden there was a change of heart and they were defending the then Commissioner of SARS and the first point I would like to put on the table is that it is known that a gentleman by name of Adriano Mazzoti was under investigation by SARS during Minister Gordhan’s tenure and it is now known and admitted by Mr Malema that he had funded and supported the EFF, but also that the investigation into this particular gentleman was stopped when Mr Monyane was Commissioner of SARS and it’s also known that the EFF has now vigorously defended Mr Monyane against his suspension and eventual removal.  I would really love the Commission to look into the matter because these are some of the things that in the course of doing our work we might have trampled on people’s toes and the vicious attacks might have been necessitated by some of this.    Chair it is not, it  was just a reminder of the facts that I would want to bring to the attention of the Commission.    That is correct sir.     Well our role was to assist the President and put together the terms of reference and assist the Presidency also in identifying Commissioners so the National Treasury under my leadership was directly responsible for supporting the President and assisting in putting that together.      It is a gentleman known Adriano Mazzoti.    Correct.    Absolutely yes.    That is correct Chair yes.    Yes Chair as I indicted at my previous appearance to the Commission that I visited them on several occasions and when I did that of course there were other occasions when I got the invite that I was not able to honour the invitation, it was not always honoured, but it was difficult not to honour an invite because it is public knowledge that the family were friends with the President and they personally stated that they even provided employment to his son, so you know your – it is not easy to antagonise your boss’s friends, but having met with them they had also claimed to be advising him on economic matters and that Mr Ajay Gupta had served in the Economic Advisory of former President Thabo Mbeki and it was for those reasons that they invited me to – I mean that we were invited to events as they would, but also that they would invite me to have a conversation on these matters.    We were able to obtain these from a – because I mean it was not something that I kept a record of but we were able to obtain proof from my protectors’ logbook during that period in order just to try and ascertain as to the number, it turned out to be about eight times, eight occasions, but again in response to your original question ...(intervention)     The dates are not very clear but I would imagine as I have said when I obtained it from my protectors diary but I do try and cover that in the subsequent paragraphs as to ...(intervention)     In my statement in paragraph 30 I do indicate that I was invited twice to have a tour of the Sahara Computer offices in Midrand in 2010, and we were informed that he was an economist and an advisor to President Zuma, I recall that he specifically told me on the first visit also that they – which is one of the points that I would like to emphasize that they don’t do business with government, but the purpose of the invites and the engagements were mainly to portray themselves as good corporate citizens, paying taxes but not doing any business and try to dispel the notion that they are getting favours from government.    That’s what I was able to establish from my protectors logbook yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well as I said it would mainly be with the protectors but I was indeed alone yes.    That’s correct.    Look as I have also indicated even in my letter or public statement that I made after the appearance to the committee, or to the Commission, in hindsight I do think that perhaps that was an oversight and an error of judgment on my part, but I must also indicate that you know in the spirit of being accessible and not passing judgment on people only because of media reports, at times you continue to be – to remain accessible even to you know the people that you would rather prefer not to but it becomes difficult if you have paid visits to particular individuals and I must say there are quite a number of people that one does visit and when you are invited it’s not always that I would take somebody with, all in the interest of being accessible, because you know one of the things that we are accused of as politicians or people in the position that I occupied was that of not being accessible and I have always thought that you know engaging with a person does not immediately constitute any form of impropriety unless I do something improper that arises out of that engagement and I mean perhaps it is my nature that I remain open to engagements even with people that perhaps one should actually try and keep a distance of, and I was talking to the legal team the other day, I said maybe I have read too much of Sanzo’s book on the Art of War of subduing your enemies you know without necessarily antagonising them, but I think in hindsight and I do say this with all the humility that I think perhaps one could have done differently.    Look I actually took their assertion of not doing business with government at face value, but the only time that I got aware of them doing business with government was when I realised that National Treasury in 2013 was investigating the matter of the Daily in the Free State and at that time I actually you know had an indication that it might not necessarily be correct that they don’t do business with government, but I did not want to raise that as an issue since there was a formal investigation that was on and I did not want to raise that in an informal setting when people invite you to say by the way you guys are being investigated for this because that would actually send the message that I already have – made my conclusion without allowing the investigation to run its course.    I would imagine that was the reason why after that that there were only two of those visits and after that I declined most of the invites.    Correct.    Again I would have thought that it would not have been easy for them having portrayed themselves as these good corporate – because it seems like they employed a tactic of they charm offensive on the others and I am not too sure how many of my other colleagues may have actually been subjected to a similar approach, but it is unlikely that you will get any volunteers after the price I paid, but they would actually have those approaches, the charm offensive on the other side but on the other side also being arrogant and actually demanding favours from the other colleagues and just ...(intervention)     Other than that I think all they needed to do was to play this I mean PR exercise of appearing to be good corporate citizens and I think if they actually even made any attempt of an approach it would have actually been contrary to the view that they had actually been – or the projection that they have been putting forward.    Yes they did allude to that.    Well again they had to, they told me that they are going to be launching this TV channel and seeing that the ANC administration was under severe attack from the current media houses they would want to launch a TV channel and they were in the process of launching it, which would give a completely different perspective, they would give a balanced view of government, which is what according to Mr Ajay Gupta was what they would want to do once the new channel has been launched.    That is correct.    Indeed in 2014 as Minister of Finance I did and again as I indicated it was just casual business.    That is correct ja.    Again it was to respond to the matter and I would imagine that was the last one.    That’s correct Chair.    Again this is a matter that only came to my attention when this email was forwarded to me, it is only then that I again engaged my son who then informed me that whilst they were looking for business opportunities they came across this opportunity where the owners were selling a stake in the mine, and they then embarked on a process of due diligence which led them to not proceed with the transaction because the mine was overpriced and a number of things that would not have made business sense.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    That is correct.    No it didn’t.    Chair you would recall that after my appearance ENCA played a previous interview which I had given three years ago where I had not disclosed my formal engagements with the Gupta Family and I felt that the office that I occupied should remain beyond reproach and it’s integrity should be unquestioned and realised that I did not respond honestly in my previous interview with ENCA after my dismissal from the position in 2015, I felt that it was inappropriate of me, you know if it wasn’t a position of Minister perhaps I would have asked for special leave so that I have time to clear my name, but I felt that due to the nature of this impropriety of having not been honest at that time and although I say this message came, this question came as a number of questions as I always put it, from a journalist who otherwise had indicated that the discussion was only going to about what I’m doing after my dismissal and I had thought that it is not appropriate, it was not the appropriate time for me to discuss some of those issues but when the question arose I think I took an easy way of not being honest at that time and I felt that it is inappropriate for a person occupying my position as I first issued a public apology and after that public apology judging by how unforgiving South Africans are I felt I would rather vacate the position and make life easy for the President rather than – because as I say if it was another position I would asked for special leave, but being a minister appointed by the President I’d rather make life easy for the President and ask the President to release me.    I did, over that weekend sir I made several attempts to get hold of the President who was not reachable until the Monday after.  You would know Chair as it appears in the statement that during that Monday or Tuesday I was supposed to be travelling to Bali for an IMF World Bank meeting as a representative of the country I felt that it would be inappropriate of me to leave the country on such an important trip and assignment having not cleared this with the President and in my attempts to reach the President the communication was very clear that whatever it is that we do should be in the best interests of the country and I would strongly believe that with this cloud hanging over my head perhaps I should vacate the position but the President was unreachable until the Monday when he did come back to me, I shared this with him and he said I must give him a bit of time and then he returned and said you know with a heavy heart well he agrees with me, perhaps he should accept my resignation.    Chair would you want me to read me the entire ...(intervention)     Yes, well in the – in this media statement I said   That is correct yes.    You mean why the other office bearers are not coming here – forward?    Well I can only speculate again Chair that we are not wired the same.  There is always a price to pay and I do not think we are all prepared to pay the price.  We also have you know having taken the oath of office to be contentious in what we do our consciences might also not necessarily be the same to lead us to come forward and own up if there is any wrongdoing on your part.  But also there is – I would want to say that there is fear of you know – you know the positions at times become more important than us.  The titles we are given some of us would like – would want to die for.  You know and it becomes therefore difficult for some of us I am only – I am merely speculating Chair.  But also for fear of retribution and what might come as a result of that and I always believe that there is nothing as liberating as being able to go to bed with a conscience that you can live with but also we are parents you do also want to be able to say to your kids if there is anything untoward that you have done own up so that we can move on.  And I do not think I can be able to do that if I do not own up myself.  So I do not have a direct answer to your question but I think you know as a nation these are some of the things that if we want to build a society we should all do some introspection into how we conduct ourselves.    About 8 times yes.    That is correct Chair.    Each time at their residence but also I think that includes the visits to the – to their businesses.    Ja.    Mostly yes.    Chair I might say that you know as I said earlier that perhaps it is in the spirit of being accessible and I can attest to – I mean I can say without fear of contradiction that there are other you know business people I might have visited more than those times.    Because I did not see anything wrong in visiting them.  Of course with the controversy around them I think – around this particular family I do think and it is for that reason that I say perhaps I could have you know limited that.  But if you get an invitation from somebody as I say I do not think it is only – it is just the visit that matters.  I think it is what comes out of the visit that matters.  And if I am invited to your house Chair and we have a casual chat about what you do especially people who would always say look I am in this kind of a business and this is you know my contribution to the economy but I would like us you know to have a conversation because of my experience in business because of my close proximity to government in terms of advising you know the president economically so it is important to hear those people out but not necessarily that and I am not – I can assure you that it was for me there never was a real issue with whether we can engage or not.  But we never – I never got that advice except things like when you talk about a deficit that you know your officials are too concerned with a deficit you know countries run as huge deficits as they possibly can.  You do not have to be concerned so much about the deficit.  And with the little experience that I had I would actually be able to you know have such a discussion and explain the reason why a huge deficit can be a risk and what is it that we are doing as a country but other than that you know a casual discussion that you know translate into some kind of engaging with regards to how the economy is run for me I thought it is something one could handle.  Of course the number of visits and as I say that on hindsight perhaps I could have limited that.    I do.    No I accept that Chair but I think the point I was making earlier was that prior to the commission and prior to some of the evidence that has surfaced other than the media reports you actually would not be able to say we think you guys are guilty of an act of impropriety and therefore it was – it was  the difficulty one had was of how do you then suddenly when you get a call all of a sudden you say no I cannot come to you you guys are you know in the media as having done XYZ but with no evidence.  But at the same time as I said that the whole purpose of the engagement would mainly be from their side all these things that are about us in the media are not true.  So unless there is a particular matter either before the courts Chair I see the TV has switched off I hope …    I hope I have not done anything untoward.      I do not know whether I should – I should proceed Chair or…    It is back on Chair.    Ja. Whatever it is I will not repeat it.    That is correct Chair.  And of course at that time I did not have any evidence to say but you know these matters are either before the courts or wherever but you know other than that – and I actually cannot rule out and it is for that reason that I actually regret having not heeded you know or having you know done things differently because one would have thought that when people keep on inviting you you would not even know whether you are even being filmed as one of those people that are you know the regulars here.  And your name could have even been used to say look he is a frequent visitor here.  So all of that I do not think one was alive to what they – what the consequences of that might be.  The – around there is a lot of name dropping when people drop your name and there is evidence that you are a frequent visitor here.  It makes sense which might have been the reason why you get invited just in order to demonstrate that you know I have got him on my side.  But without necessarily asking for any favour from you but making sure that as long as you a regular here then I can always drop your name.      I did Chair and I must say…    And I must say that it was on realisation that perhaps it is indeed not appropriate because it could not continue indefinitely.  This was now as I said in 2013 there was an investigation already on the [indistinct]    Yes on the dairy farm but again in 2014 and as I said when I declined an invitation it would not be just declining an invitation because I think you guys are corrupt it would actually be very polite you know I am unavailable because of the work schedule as well as Minister then which was different when one was Deputy Minister but as Minister the responsibilities were you know also much more heavier.  But it would be very polite declining.  I am not too sure whether if they had persisted I perhaps would not have again paid one …    One or two visits again but ja.    Look the allegation were actually getting stronger and stronger Chair and I – one needed to actually draw a line as to how long you actually would want to be associated with people who are always in the media for the wrong reasons.  But again as I said it would be a very polite declining of the invitation with the hope that that would not – they would not draw not any inferences with regards to whether I have already found them guilty which – because I had not.  But I felt you know there needs to be a line you need to find the right balance between being accessible but also a – between being accessible and your accessibility being abused for reasons that you believe might actually arise out of that.    I am not sure other than what ended up being in the public domain as well.    But I am not sure whether it – because once the investigation had been concluded by the National Treasury whatever wrongdoings had been identified had then to be referred to the law enforcement agencies to deal with the matter.  I would not have the dates but I would imagine that the National Treasury would be able to provide us with the dates.    Chair I cannot recall whether there was – because there were a number of investigations that the National Treasury was working on and I am not sure whether – I cannot recall a briefing on this particular…    Not on this particular one.    Yes under normal circumstances.    That is correct.    That is correct, yes.    That is correct other than the one that I mentioned where they wanted me to clarify…    Ja.    Look as I said earlier I think it would have been difficult for them to talk about any business with government after they have portrayed themselves as not doing business with government.  And I would want to believe that they wanted me to also buy into the story so that even if I hear issues of them having done business with government I would be under the impression that but they do not business with government.  So I do not think they would have been able to say anything about doing business with government.  But other than that Chair they would actually be very casual and I know for a fact that trying to promote their publications I remember in one of the engagements there was a request that I do a piece in their magazine The Thinker which is you know still in publication you know. And I do not remember where we left that matter but it was one of the discussions that you know it would be good to do a piece that would feature in their publication.  But also when the – their newspaper was in circulation it would also be one of those opportunities to market themselves as – you see the stories that we write you know are publication are presenting a different narrative from what we would see in the you know media in general which means we i.e. a [indistinct] you know be publishing house.  But also that it is important for the public to get this different view.  So it would actually range from those issues without any particular matter other than on specific ones like I said when one was invited to the Sahara business to show how many youngsters they employ that are in the technology space and what they produce and what they you know – what their contribution is to the economy both in terms of building this young and nurture this young talent but at the same time promote business.    The first visit arose I think out of the encounter that we had at one of the government functions when …    Whilst I was Deputy Minister yes.    When we  - when he introduced himself and told me what he does and then he indicated that we must meet for some – for tea sometime.    Yes and then I got a call some time later.    I think a few months or a few days later inviting me for tea.    Ja.      It actually would be I would say it has been some time we have not met, do you mind popping in for tea?    Ja it would always be popping in.    Absolutely.    I think, as I said earlier I find, I think it was their style of playing differently with different Ministers.  As we explained also what the role of the Treasury is.  I think it would be difficult for anybody to think that you can influence the Treasury, because the best way of doing that would be to influence a department that would be approaching the Treasury rather than trying to influence the Treasury, because the Treasury normally does not initiate processes.  Treasury would be approached by various departments and I think one of the reasons why I think it would be difficult for them to do that is precisely because of the image they were trying to project that they do not do business with Government and that they are this good corporate citizen.  So that I mean I think in their minds it was that if anything comes to the Treasury if you are a good, you know, if you are in good terms with them then you would be, you know, you would have a soft heart if anything comes your way, but they never got around to be able to say exactly what they would and I would imagine that they would either depend on the Ministers they have spoken to or in some instances perhaps that the former President would do their bidding and in our view we actually had very clear processes of dealing with things and focussing on the processes would actually be our best line of defence.  It is only after Deputy Minister Jonas’, you know, story that when he came to me in 2015 when he actually explained what they had said because of my refusal to do something which I did not know had anything to do with.  So my question was but in my view this had nothing to do with them.  It is a matter that we were dealing with, with the former President and not them.  So if they now are in a position to be able to advocate for my removal only because of that refusal it actually sounded very strange, but from their side I think they actually steered away from trying to influence directly rather than using either the other Ministries or perhaps even the Presidency to get through to the National Treasury to.    They did not try and think they probably must have got the word from the highest office that there is no way you are going to crack this one.  I mean I am not sure I do not want to claim to be that powerful, but.    I suspect that they actually that was the only reason why.    They felt if it cannot be cracked from the highest office.    Then they must find other ways, but.    Ja.    Yes.  Again Chair I think it depends on whether they had raised anything, because if they had I would have stood up, but having not raised anything directly with me you know there was nothing to stand ones ground, to stand my ground on, because if there was nothing put on the table that this is perhaps the favour we would want you to do for us I would have been able to deal with that but you know having these light conversations without knowing what the underlying, you know, motive might have been one would not have actually just simply decided no I am not having a conversation with you.  Unless if they raise something which I think was in conflict with my principles and what the law requires of us to do.    Hm.    Ja, but maybe as I am saying Chair I might have put it badly just saying that could be the only reason.  That was not necessarily the only reason.    Yes, but.    Ja, but it.    Ja, but it was it was one.    Of those things were you think why because there is nothing that you think is behind the invitation would you want to do that.  If these people are in a good relationship with your boss why would you all of a sudden say I mean I cannot accept your invitation, but I do think that perhaps I mean it is the manner in which you know it came across, but that is not necessarily the reason the only reason?    Well.    I think it was a matter of actually getting a person in my position to understand things differently other than what is portrayed in the public domain and portray themselves as these good corporate citizens when indeed it is clear that they were not, but at that time as I said earlier other than the media reports most of the stuff had not been tested in any given environment like we do have the evidence now.    With Government entities no, I had.    I did not have any.    Evidence of that.    Yes Chair I think that what I have said is about all I can say on this matter, because I said we are not wired the same, but also that for some of us our positions and our titles are actually much more important than us as human beings and you know without these titles perhaps we are nothing.  Forgetting that at the end of the day we actually acquire these titles for a reason and that is why we actually take an oath which we should live by our Constitution and our oath of office should actually be the guiding principle, but at times and as I said earlier we are able to perhaps this is one of the reasons why I always say I would not make a very good politician, because I do not believe in the language that say I was quoted out of context.  I believe in having not been honest and there is a need to be honest, but always coming forward to assist a Commission like this is an opportunity for our country you know to deal with issues of the past and be able to move forward and I think it is indeed tragic that we are not getting many of our colleagues coming forward, but again as I said earlier South Africa is very unforgiving.  So if you are prepared to pay the price that your fellow colleague has paid you can join in, but if you are not prepared to pay that price you might as well stay far from this Commission unless you are subpoenaed.  Well that is unfortunately the position.    [Intervenes].    I could not agree with you more Deputy Chief Justice.    Correct.    Absolutely.  I do not have a problem with that Chair, but I would imagine perhaps linked to the point you made earlier with not enough people coming forward because I would have thought that the approach that the family used to me might have been used on some of my colleagues but who have not come forward because you are not getting enough of that, because if there are some of my colleagues who are willing to come forward to testify that they were on the, you know, invited for casual visits and could not were not asked for any favours or coerced to do anything that would have helped, but it is unfortunate that I also cannot you know be able to encourage and I actually would want to use this platform to encourage some people who actually might have had similar experiences like the one I did, because that would help to put this into perspective because I have no doubt that I cannot be the exception the only exception to not being coerced but being used, you know, to project a completely different [intervenes].    Absolutely.    No, I did not.    That was in 2013.  Exactly as I said that was the time when I began to be, you know, weary of the relationship with the family.    I did, yes.    I think there is a parliamentary record where there was a question that was posed in Parliament that would be useful that there were people who attended.    He did say that they do play an advisory role in terms of the economy.    Not really other than as I said that for me being accessible is one of the things that I actually you know do without at times checking even the blind spots and on hindsight I would really think that perhaps as I said I could have avoided that.    No, I did not.    No, I was not offered by the Guptas any position.    Crystal clear.    Thank you Deputy Chief Justice. 
ADV ADILA HASSIM:  Thank you Chair, that might have been on behalf of Mr Fezile the last time.    I appear, together with my learned friend Ms Rajah for Mr Nene. 
MR STIMELLA:  [indistinct] because there is a technical glitch with the vans outside the SABC vans have got a challenge they are tripping to give the live feed at home but we are live here but at home is a problem    Ja if the [indistinct] are not coming through. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Thank you Chair I will be very brief.    Mr Nene did you attend the wedding of a Gupta family member?    Why did you not?    Did you receive an invitation to the wedding?    Are you aware of any other of your colleagues, Government officials who did attend the wedding?    And what did you understand at the time when you first visited the Gupta family what did you understand to be their relationship with former President Zuma?    Were they advisors to the President in any form?    Did you have any personal expectations from these visits?    Did you receive any payment or gifts from the Gupta family?    Did the Gupta family or any one of the Guptas offer you the position of Minister of Finance?    And are you satisfied as we stand and sit here today that your conscience is clear?  Is there anything else you would like to saying relation to your resignation?    Those are my questions.
