CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody.    Good morning Mr Montana.  Thank you.  Are we ready?    Okay alright.  Please administer the oath again.    Thank you.  Yes we may proceed then.      Okay.   Okay.    Okay.  Okay.    Well I just want to say once again Mr Montana I know that were asked at short notice to avail yourself today and you agreed so that is – that is – that cooperation is appreciated.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Ja.    Okay.    Yes.   Must be on the real issues ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  Well let me say this Mr Montana.  Last week we adjourned on the basis on which we adjourned but for some time I have been trying to allocate dates to different witnesses and there are limited dates –days available because we are trying to finish all oral evidence by end of May.  So when I spoke to the legal team and said they should try and check whether you could make today it was within that context.    Yes.  Ja but – so that is the one point.  The second point is that you – you – we know that when we parted last time it was on the part of the basis was that it would be desirable to have something in writing from you that deals with the issue of properties and you do say thatyour affidavit has a section that deals with that and that you – you would like to read that into the record.   Now even if your affidavit is not before the commission as yet if that section can be dealt with as a standalone I do not see a problem and assuming that the issue – the problem with annexures does not affect it – now of course I do not know whether it does or it does not.  Mr Soni where – have you got – would you like to say something about that?    Eight?    Ja.    Well I got the impression when last week Mr Montana talked about the issue of properties that he may be seeking to say his involvement in the properties that you– you are focusing on.    Should be seen in the context – should be seen in a wider context.  Of his involvement even in other properties.    That is the impression I got that he is saying well maybe if you look at those particular properties you might get certain impressions but there is a wider picture that should be taken into account and when you take into account the wider picture you may take a different view.  Or that – I thought that is what he might be wishing to say.  So I guess that one will only take a view when one eitherreads or hears what he has to say about the other properties how they come in – into the picture.But in terms of him reading into the record that section of his affidavit that deals with properties subject to the issue of relevance you do not have a problem?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja so – so no that is fine.  Then the next thing is just the right time to do that.    Ja.  From your side is there a particular time that you – you would submit should be the right time?   Ja.    Ja.    The bigger picture.   No he is here to do that.  He is here to do that ja.  Mr Montana you are here to do that?    Ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Ja.   Okay alright.    Yes.   Ja.  You just said you are not funning away.    Ja.    Ja no, no, that …    Ja.    Yes, no that is fine.  As you know I have asked Mr Soni whether he has any particular time that he thinks would be appropriate he says he has no particular time. So I think I will give you a chance now to put your side of the story on the properties basically reading into the record what is in your affidavit that is not before thecommission but it is fine to just read that part. So after you have finished then Mr Soni can put questions to you.    Mr Soni you wanted to say something.    In due course.    No that is fine.   Actually what you know what we could do – now I remember even our discussion las time because I had said it would be better if one has read your – what you are going to say before we start it makes things easier.  Is it not possible that for present purposes we could so to uplift from his affidavit that section that deals with the properties and then maybe we could adjourn – let me read – read it Mr Soni you can get a chance to read it and thenwhen we come back then he – he reads them into the record or whatever but at least we know what he has to say.    Can – is it fine if we do it that way?    Ja – Yes. And that section could – because it is a stand-alone could even be an Exhibit on its own.  It could be admitted as an Exhibit .    You know on its own.  Shall we just adjourn so that that can be done.  How long would that take to – to do?    You have got it here.    Okay. It is a stand-alone.    Stand-alone okay.    Then – then let me adjourn and then copies can be made.   We – it is fifteen page you said. It is fifteen pages.    Okay we have – Ja it might – I do not know – I do not…    Yes it will expedite matters.  So – so let us see once I am done or – well – I will let you know.  That might take about maybe thirty/forty minutes I am not sure.  Depends on how – how fast one can read.  But let us – let us try that.   So let me adjourn and that copies can be made then I will be given a copy I will start reading and then we can resume after that.      Okay we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Are we ready?     Okay alright.  Let us continue then.  Well, I saw in the statement, Mr Montana, that there is a reference to, maybe one or two, annexures.  I am not sure.  Are those annexures available?     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     Yes.     Ja.     Mr Soni.     Yes.    Will supply them.     Okay alright.  Okay let us continue then.     Mr Montana, you can then read into the record ...[intervenes]      ...your statement.       H’m.     Ja.     H’m?     Yes.     Maybe, Mr Soni, we should admit this as an exhibit.    Do you have a suggestion what exhibit it should be?     I think we should – I am going to writeon mine ...[intervenes]      ...I will write – I will simply write Mr Montana’s version on the properties as read into the record today.     No, we can admit it now because ...[intervenes]     ...because it is a standalone.     And then the annexures can come later.  Mr Montana’s version on the properties as read into the record on 10 May 2021.  And then what exhibit should we make this to be?     Exhibit SS-18(b).  Capital letter B or small letter B?     Small letter.  Okay.     You confirm, Mr Montana, that this isyour version?  This document contains your version on the properties and that it contents are true and correct?     Okay.  This document will therefore be admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit Ss-18(b). WITNESS, MR MONTANA’S STATEMENT ON PROPERTIES (WITNESS’S OWN VERSION) IS SUBMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT SS-18(b)     Okay alright.  Okay you can go ahead then Mr Montana.     H’m.     It is two comma ...[intervenes]      ...twenty-five ...[intervenes]      Ja.     I want to limit you now because we aredealing with the properties but I wanted you to …[intervenes]     Show the connection, ja.     Yes, you …[intervenes]    Yes.  Okay, alright.  Now at least you got a chance to put your side of the story and now Mr Soni can begin the questioning.     Ja.     I do not know what your approach is going to be, Mr Soni, but in the light of the variousexplanations that Mr Montana is giving in regard to the properties and I think some of them, the explanations affect different properties and are interwoven.  It may be that it would be helpful to take one property at a time.     And move from one to the next.     Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.     Yes, ja, no, no, no, obviously those are the only ones that you will question him on.     I am sorry, Mr Soni, when I came here this file was opened on a certain page and that is not the page you are on.     Yes.     We will be using bundle H.     PRASA bundle H and to what page mustI go?     Page 4, okay.     Yes, ja.     Yes.     No, no that’s fine…[intervenes].     I think, Mr Soni hasn’t reached the point where he is talking about what he may have said, he’s simply looking at what Mr Oellermann said in his report because the second sentence of the first paragraph of yourdocument says,  “In its so-called preliminary report on PRASA the Commission’s investigator, Clint Oellermann and evidence leader Advocate Vas Soni told the Chairperson of the Commission blah, blah, blah”,So, in other words, I think the understanding is that you are saying both Mr Soni and Mr Oellermann – and in regard to Mr Oellermann in his report, preliminary report this is what he said, and I think that is what Mr Soni is trying to clear up.  So – and he’s doing so by going to the report because your sentence says, “in the preliminary report”, you understand?  He’s still going to come to the question of what he may have said as opposed to Mr Oellermann…[intervenes].     H’m.     But the question, I think is, let me put it this way.  Is your statement in the first paragraph of the document that Mr Oellermann said in the preliminaryreport, that you purchased properties of over R36million within a year, correct, is your statement correct insofar as it refers to him and the report?     H’m.    H’m, within a year?     Yes.     Yes but I think, Mr Soni wants you tomake it clear whether you are sticking to the statement in terms of which you attribute to Mr Oellermann’s report, preliminary report, the statement that you purchased properties of over R36million within a year, whether you stick to that or you say…[intervenes].    That’s different.     Yes, no, no so I’m saying, I think he wants to see whether you’re sticking to that or whether you accept that, that doesn’t accurately reflect what was said in the report and then take it from there.     But remember we’re talking about -we’re looking  at this one that you have – that we, at least, I have seen that’s the one that you read into the record.     Ja.     H’m.     But hang on, Mr Montana, in order for us to make progress, this is important.  Is my understanding of the second sentence of paragraph one of the document you’ve read into the record, incorrect?  Namely, that it says – it says, among other things, Mr Oellermann said in his preliminary report on PRASA that you purchased properties of over R36million within a year, is my understanding of that sentence correct, at least in part?     I’m reading yours, no your document.  The first paragraph, the second sentence.    Ja.     Yes, okay, alright.  Okay, now I think what Mr Soni is going to say it, can you help us – show us, where in the preliminary report, Mr Oellermann said that, said what is written in that sentence?     H’m.    Ja.     Ja.     Yes.    But remember, remember now I don’t know whether the question you say I asked, I asked while Mr Oellermann was giving evidence, is that correct?     Did he say the same thing as well, because I don’t know whether I was asking him or asking Mr Soni on that issue when that response was given?    Ja.     Ja.     No, no but that’s fine.  So, that was not in his written report, that was in his oral evidence?     Ja.     Yes.     In other words, you accept, do you not, that if one goes to his written report, one will not find that sentence to that effect?     No, no, no the transcript is a different matter.  If you say, look I’m not saying he said that in the report – in the written report but he said in his oral evidence and that will be in the transcript, that can bechecked if necessary.     Yes.     Ja.     I think, where we are, and I’m saying this so that you can tell me if I’ve misunderstood you, I think where we are with regard to Mr Soni’s question, is this.  One, you accept that in the preliminary – writtenpreliminary report Mr Oellermann did not say that you purchased properties of over R36million within a year but you are saying that, in his oral evidence, he did say that, is my understanding correct?     Yes.     Ja.  It says what you are saying here…[intervenes].     Yes.     No, no, that’s fine but as you answer the questions just bear in mind, or try to make a distinctionwhether it’s something that was in a written documents, such as the report or it’s something that was said during oral evidence because I think part of Mr Soni’s question was to say, here you talk about the written report.  Okay but you have said there is somewhere in the written report, where he says what you say?     Ja okay, Mr Soni?     Okay.     Let him finish first, finish, are you done Mr Soni?     Okay.     H’m.     No, no, face me.     But let me – I want to say something ja…[intervenes].     H’m.     H’m.     No let me explain why he was saying what he was saying, Mr Montana.You know the Commission, you know, certain things in a Commission happen in the same way they happen in a Court of Law,whether it’s a criminal case or civil case but of course there are certain differences but also we – I’m a Judge, he’s a lawyer, most of the time we spend our lives in Courts and we – that’s where we spend most of our working lives.  Now, one of the – one of the rules of fairness that I think I would rather call it that, rules of fairness in a Court of Law is that if you are questioning a witness, and you, later on, argue in a certain way, if you didn’t do certain things and you didn’t  explain certain things to the witness you might be held to have been unfairto the witness.  So, to avoid being said to be unfair you want to explain those things.  So, I think what Mr Soni is doing, he is saying, I will be asking you questions, I advise you to deal with them head-on but if you don’t deal head-on with certain allegations I may have to argue later on tothe Chairperson that, you were avoiding them, or something like that but what he’s doing is, he wants to make sure that if you decide not to deal head-on with certain allegations you must know that there might be this risk so that it can’t be a situation where he’s seen maybe, to take advantage of the fact that you might not have known that, you might have explained things in a certain way and this is particularly more important when you are not legally represented because sometimes when you are legally represented one can assume that your lawyer wouldhave explained certain things and so on.  So, that’s the context, so robustness is not a problem and so on but I think that’s the context in which he was asking.     Yes, ja.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Yes, no, no I don’t think he’s threatening you, I think that’s just what he – that’s the context of what he was saying.  I see we are at five to.     Ja, no.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja, maybe also to just mention to addthis, Mr Montana, you see the best way to prejudice you, if an evidence leader wanted to prejudice you would be, not to explain what Mr Soni has explained to you and ask questions and then you don’t deal with allegations head-on, he moves on next question, next question, next question then we are done then you go then when he presents argument he says, you see, he was not answering questions he was avoiding.  I asked him questions he was telling me other stories and so on but when he explains it like this, you are able to say, okay, I’m going to be alive towhatever allegation and I’m going to make sure that I don’t have the situation where, I leave it without answering it head-on.  So, I think, let’s adjourn on that basis and then let’s take lunch and then we’ll come back at 2 o’clock.     No, that’s fine, we adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    Ja no that is fine.  In the meantime, did you get those annexures that we talked about Mr Montana?    Did you get them during lunch?    What is the position Mr Soni do you know what is happening in regard to this particular document as opposed to in regard to the affidavit?   Because I thought that the ones that are mentioned in the document that he read into the record we could get those admitted together with – admitted so that we are done with that part.    Ja and then – the rest they can deal with in terms of the process.   Well during the lunch – before lunch you remember – before he read into the record.    I – I raised the issue.  I said something along the lines that hopefully there are no annexures relevant to – to this.    I think Mr Montana – I got the impression he was nodding at the time but after I read it I saw that there were references to annexures.    So before – when we came back from the adjournment I said I noticed that there are two references orso to annexures and I think he said during lunch he could bring them – or after lunch or something.    So what I had in mind is that those that are referred to here.    Those could be handed up and all the others that relate to the rest of the affidavit can be dealt with in terms of the process that has previously agreed.    That is what – that was my – what my understanding was.    Ja.   Yes.  Simply because we are already admitted this.    Therefore whatever is referred to here we should try and admit if we can.    And so that this is complete.    Or we can deal with it during tea break.    Ja.    They are done.    Well it is not a question of him handing them to her – those that – the annexures that relate to the document – this document he can hand them to you.  I wantthem to be handed up.  Ja.    Yes.  So there – those should not be subject to that process that has been agreed on.    Ja.    So – but what we can do is let us continue.  Either when you are done or during the tea break.    Then it can be attended to.    Okay, alright.    No that is fine.    It can be sorted out ja.    Okay.  Alright.     Oh the one dated 21.    August 2012.    Okay.  Alright.    Hang on Mr Soni. It will be convenient aswe deal with each affi – email just to state who it is from, who it is to – what date it is.    What the subject matter is if possible before reading that will just help. Whoever reads the transcripts.    Ja.    Oh how do you pronounce that?    Hm.    Ursula. Okay alright.  Okay that is the one you are talking about ja.    Okay alright.  And you have just read the second of two paragraphs in the email?    Ja. Okay.    At this stage Mr Soni we are not dealing with any specific property or are we?    Oh that is what I wanted.    Parkwood.    Okay alright.  Okay continue.    I am sorry that is a letter from – that is an email from Ursula    Will – Willis dated 30 October 2012.    Oh are you going back to the one we dealt with earlier?    Or is it another one?   Oh okay.  I am sorry.  Oh page – at page 42.    Yes okay.    Yes.    And the subject is Private – Private 1 Security.   Held.    Okay alright. Ja you can continue.    I am struggling to – to see where you are Mr Soni.  Are you still at page 42?   Okay.    Yes I can see that.    Okay you see I was looking a sentence that says something like here is or something like that.    Okay that was.   Okay.  Valuation amount R3.5 million.  Right.    Bond amount is it R2 million, is that right?  The bond was R2 million.    Is that correct?    Ja okay.    I think the 198 on my one is written by hand.    Is it?    Ja so look for one that is written by hand Mr Montana.      Ja.    One second.  Mr Montana how is your Afrikaans?   It is good enough for this.    Okay.    Ja.    Oh.    Okay I think – I think Mr Soni will tell you what it – what it says but I think what the legal team should obtain is an English translation.   Of the letter ja.    Okay.      Hang on I was also still trying to go back to 198.  Which item?   Okay.  Alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.   Okay.      Ja.    Yes.    Ja.   No that is fine.    Where you are able to say something youwill say where you are not able to say you are not able.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja okay.      So I guess – I am sorry Mr Soni.     I guess the point you are making or part of the point you are making Mr Montana is where the statement might be saying Montana payment do not take that as if it means I was paid that amount.  You would accept that mighthave been paid in respect of that transaction but you are making the point that it did not come to you.    Ja.   Ja.    Ja.     Ja.    No, that is fine.  Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     [laughs]  Ja.  Well, unless there was anindication in the evidence that TLM was understood or referred to – was meant to be his acquisition – his initials.  What did the – Mr Van der Walt’s partner said about it?     H’m?     What is written in the letter.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    H’m.  Okay.  No, I think – I think, Mr Montana, what Mr Soni is saying is.  What - the items we are looking at 190, that he points out, we must read – we must understand them in the context of the letter.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.    Ja, ja.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.     H’m?     Yes.     So the number you do not question but the relationship between each payment and for examplethe Parkwood property that that you have no problem with that?     Ja.    Yes.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja.    R 2.25 million.     Ja.     H’m?     Okay.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.     But you have got those emails or you do not have it anymore?     Oh.     Oh, okay.     H’m?     H’m?     Ja.    Ja.     H’m?     When was that?    This weekend?     Sometime back?     H’m?     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Yes.  Mr Soni.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     PRASA.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.  Ja, okay.      H’m?     Sorry.     Okay.     Ja, ja.  Okay.  Let us take a five minutes adjournment and two, so that they can deal with the technical problem.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay I hope they have fixed the problem.    Sorry.  Is that affidavit the one that is being fixed in terms of the annexures or there is another one?    Oh, at the high court?     Ja.     Oh, yes.  No, now I understand.     So you are saying there is an affidavit that you had filed – you had also filed in the high court? MR     Okay.     Ja.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja.    Yes.     Ja.     That is an issue for you.     Ja.     Ja.     No, no it is fine.  The one thing, though, that I want to mention is that you said that Werksmans, I think you said, has got all your emails including emails that you would have exchanged with Mr Van der Walt.     And you say some of those would show or support what you say about these properties, your dealings with him.     Ja?     Ja.     ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     No, no let that is fine because you have made your point.     I think that, Mr Soni, to the extent that Mr Montana is saying there are emails at Werksmans or there should be emails at Werksmans that will show that his relationship with Mr Van der Walt was an open one.  I think, one way or another, it would be good if those can be obtained.  Now...  So I think maybe you can apply your mind to that because I do think that one of the issues that arises is whether it was known at PRASA.  That kind of thing.  What are your thoughts on that?     Yes, ja.     Ferreira.     Ja.     Ja.  And you think that started in 2012>     Ja ...[intervenes]      H’m.     H’m.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.  I wanted to just round off that issue about emails at Werksmans.  If the Commission were to obtain them and there are too many, you will be fine with having access to them and looking for those emails that might support what you are saying?     Ja.     H’m?     Ja.     Ja-no, what I am thinking.  I mean, I do not know how many there are but you know one could find a mountain of emails.  I am thinking that with the time    [laughs]     Okay.     Alright.  Mr Soni, let us continue.     Yes, ja.  No, that is true because it will tell...     In all probability what he would be saying here ...[intervenes]     ...is what he - has already been said in the affidavit.     Ja.    Yes.     But that affidavit, as you speak, you have a copy in your car or here?    Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.    Yes.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.     Ja. ADV VAS SONI     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, ja.     That particular one, ja.    Yes.     Okay no, that is fine.    That is fine.  We are at quarter past three.  There is the question of obtaining them.  There is the question of reading them.  What is your suggestion, Mr Soni?  We ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Ja.     Ja.     No, no, no.  Do you suggest we have the break now ...[intervenes]      ...to obtain that and then we will resume?  How much break are we talking about?     Maybe 20-minutes, 15-minutes?     Ja.     Okay we will adjourn and let us say 15-minutes for now.     And if we – if that is not enough, we will take it from there.     Okay we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES     Yes, Mr Soni?     Yes.     Yes but in the document are there references to so many?  I thought it was a few in thedocument.  In the document itself, the references to annexures.     Or maybe let me ask him.  Mr Montana, I thought it was only a few that we referred to in this document.     As long as when one reads this and wants to find the annexure that we hear one would find there.  That is the important thing.     They are marked.     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Corresponds with that, ja.     Ja.  Okay.  No, that is fine, then maybe we should deal with that formality and get it out of the way.     Of having them admitted.     Is that fine, Mr Soni?     Oh, okay.  Well, I am not doing – you do not have copies at the moment yourselves.     Okay.  But you would need to – you may need to ask him questions about the annexures, is it not?     But you would only know that once you have …[intervenes]    Ja.  Then maybe there is no – we can have them handed up and then you can make copies in due course.     Ja.     Ja, let us get the formalities out of the way.  I am thinking that the proper way to do it because this is not an affidavit.     Is to admit them one by one.     Ja, to say reference is made in paragraph so and so to annexure whatever.    And then let him confirm that that is the annexure that is referred to and we admit them one by one like that.     Affidavit, yes, ja.     Yes, ja.  That would need – ja, it would need some reading.     Ja.  Okay, well why do we not get thisout of the way and then talk about what should happen with that, ja.     Yes, I can see that.     To Mr Montana, yes, yes.     Ja, ja, ja.  Oh, because there are no copies.     Mr Montana, the second page of your document, paragraph 1470, TLM160 is supposed to be a copy of an email from Mr Riaan van der Walt intimating the relationship between the two of you.  Have you got that email?  Okay, is it marked TLM160?     Okay, alright, I think that we may have to admit them, Mr Soni, as EXHIBIT SS18B1, B2, B3 3.so it is going to be easier that way.  This email from Mr Riaan van der Walt to Mr Lucky Montana, dated 29 October 2015 will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT SS18B1. EMAIL FROM RIAAN VAN DER WALT TO LUCKY MONTANA DATED 29 OCTOBER 2015 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT SS18B1.       It is a document that has got two pages.  Okay and then?     Have you got that, Mr Montana?    Yes, thank you.  Registrar, you might have to wait here and no go to your seat until we are done with this process.     Yes.  The statement by Mr Montana dated 8 February 2016, which is marked TLM – oh you see there is TLM14 and TLM16 or 161, that will cause some confusion.  Maybe I think I should cross out the TLM14 for purposes of this one so that we use TLM161.  Mr Montana?    Yes, 1480 says TLM161.     I have got in this document that I have been give, I have got TLM161, that is written in the middleof the page, first page.     But at the corner of the same page, top corner, it is written with a marker TLM14 and S16.  I am saying the two may cause confusion so I propose to cross out the one in the corner.     Ja, so that there is no confusion but otherwise, therefore, this statement of 8 February 2016 by Mr Montana on allegations of corruption levelled againsthim by PRASA Mr Popo Molefe will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT SS18B2.  This statement has got – I think the pages are not paginated but I think I will cross our these numbers written with a marker so that they do not cause confusion on all the pages, ja.     Yes, no, I understand, I understand.  I just want to make sure.  Okay, that is the second document.STATEMENT BY LUCKY MONTANA DATED 8 FEBRUARY ON ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION BY MR POPO MOLEFE HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT SS18B2     Yes, that it will be necessary just to say that so that it goes into the transcript.  Mr Montana, so that it goes into the transcript that you are now handing it up, so I am saying that will be important.     Ja, okay now?     The letter dated 31 August 2009 addressed to Mr T L Montana.  I am looking for the end ofthe letter, Mr Montana.  The last page here cannot be the last page because it ends “and”.     That is TLM162, is that how it is supposed to be?     162.     You see, at the beginning it is like a letter, it is addressed to you and it says “Dear Mr Montana” but it looks like quite a long letter but it is just that the pages are not numbered at the bottom but it is not completed, ends with 12.2.3 at the bottom, that is aparagraph and with the number that appears at the top corner is 509 but I do not know where it comes from, who is the author.     The terms.     Yes.     Ja.  Well, I do not know it may be that whatever we do not have is not material, we do not know.  But I wanted to make sure that…     Ja, that you understand that the pages…     Yes.     Okay, alright.  So that letter will be admitted as EXHIBIT SS18B3.  Ja, I have got that.     Yes, ja, okay.  Maybe I can just mention that it is how many pages – it is 7 pages.  Okay, let us continue. LETTER FROM ABSA PRIVATE BANK DATED 31 AUGUST 09 (7 PAGES) ADDRESSED TO MR.

COMBINED SUMMONS IN CASE 34349/2019 MIDTOWNBRACE (PTY) LTD V LUCKY MONTANA HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT SS18B6.7     Okay, that is done.  As well as the properties, we have got all of that, so you will make copies for yourselves and so on.    Okay, now we need to talk about the affidavit.     Yes.  Did you recall how long the affidavit on its on is, Mr Montana, more or less?     Ja, okay.     Does that sound right more or less, Mr Montana?  You cannot remember?     Excluding annexures for now.    That should be correct, ja.  Okay, I guess you cannot deal with that without having read it first.  Ja.  So should we not do this, that to the extent that there may be – I know that properties was your last topic, is that right?     Ja.  It seems to me that on properties you may have to read that first before you can proceed inany effective way.  If that is correct it may be that one, you cannot deal with that today.     Ja.  But, two, it may be that we can do one of two things.  Mr Montana, during the days that you have been questioned, I got the impression sometimes that some of your answers might not have been full because you intended to – or you were hoping to refer to your affidavit, I am not sure.  What I am looking at is, we are tight for time in terms of finishing and I was thinking that tothe extent that there may be some issues that you have been asked about where you felt your answers might not have been full you wanted to do that, maybe we could use this opportunity for you to do that because – so that what would remain is simply the issue of properties.And on the issue of properties, if it is possible to be ready tomorrow, we could proceed tomorrow.We fortunately can have time tomorrow.  In my schedule of the hearings I remember there was an issue of Ms Ngoye coming back and maybe Mr Holele.  So the idea was that if you were to finish your evidence today, depending what time you finished, then Ms Ngoye and Mr Holele could take the witness stand and deal with some of the issues you have raised, if they didn’t deal with them today they could deal with them tomorrow, I think they are available fromwhat I have been told, but so – but if you are able to deal with whatever you think you haven’t been heard fully because you – for whatever reason, you could deal with those and we finish that part.If you cannot do that now and Ms Ngoye or Mr Holele or one of them is available we could slot them in this afternoon and then tomorrow you could then deal with whatever is left plus the properties.  So I don’t know from your side Mr Soni have you got an particular preference?    Ja, okay, no.     Okay no that is fine, well then if Mr Montana has some issues that he has been asked about or since he started appearing where he would like to supplement his answers he can do so, we can use this time for him to do so, but then tomorrow we continue.     Then with the properties after you havehad a chance to read and depending what time we are finished then Mr – Ms Ngoye and Mr Holele could also come.     The Transactions, the ...[intervenes]     The actions.     Yes, ja.     Ja, then we can focus on those issues that are issues.     H’m.     Ja.     Okay, so there are two ways of doing it Mr Montana, the one that Mr Soni is proposing is that if you already have had time to apply your mind to all of those you might be able to say I don’t have any issues with this one, that one and that one, this is where I have issueson so then we can focus on that, that is if you have not had time to apply your mind to them, the other – we could have a situation where maybe when you come back tomorrow you have applied your mind and you are able to say these are not – there are no issues on these ones, this is where the issues are, as far as I am concerned.What do you think of that?      Yes.     Okay, okay.     Oh so you would be able to comment ...[intervenes]      Oh, I see, excellent, excellent, then in that event we should at least do that part.     And then what will remain can then bedealt with tomorrow, but that part can be done.     Okay, let’s do that then, that’s fine.   Mr Montana do you want to ...[intervenes]      Ja.      Ja.     Ja.     Yes, okay.     Yes, okay.     Yes, because I wanted to say to you what you have been telling me it is fine and it is important in terms of it being part of your answer to the allegations, but I think Mr Soni had in mind that you could clear up in terms of saying – in terms of these bank statements and so on I have got no issues with everything, these are the only things you have issues with, so that we get that out of the way, but in terms of what you – finishing your part of the story that is fine, subject to the understanding that on properties we will still deal with this aspect ...[intervenes]     Yes, you will come here.     Ja.     Yes.     You said you want to make two points ...[intervenes]      We can then have clarity on the bank statements.     Okay, alright.      You talking about Exhibit SS18(b)1.  That email.The letter that was terminating the relationship, is that right?    Yes.    Well that letter says   Okay.    Okay I want to stop you there.  Mr Soni Ithink it is going to be better to do it the – in the usual way.    Ja.  I think it is going to be better for Mr Soni to take you through the transactions.    So that for purposes of simply saying I have no issue with this transaction yes I have no issue with the fact that so much appeared to have gone from that account to that account or maybe that it was in connection with that particular property or whatever you want to sayand then when we deal with the – when we – when we have read your affidavit and Siyangena then whatever else you want to say to complete the picture in relation to properties you can then deal with.  But we can put aside and have a clear picture on where the issues are on the payments.    I think one of the points you are making is – is that a lot of the payments maybe you say all of them but a lot of the payments that are dealt with were not payments that were coming to you.  I think that is one of thepoints you make, is that right?    Ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Yes ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    You cannot – yes.    You …    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja I think Mr Soni maybe the best way might be this because you would – you probably have an idea that the various bank statements reflect 1,2,3,4,5 such as on such and such a date there was a payment from Precise Trade to whoever or from somebody to PreciseTrade.  If you put those series of propositions based on what is reflected on the bank statements Mr – maybe even without going through each one Mr Montana can say well I have no problem with all of those propositions because my point is simply this.  Then maybe it might be faster.      I am just thinking you might have a different way I am easy I just want to see how we can move expeditiously.    Yes    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  Ja.    Ja.      No, no that is fine.  I think you deal with itthe way you – you are happy with it.  From your side Mr Montana when he puts any proposition or question if you are able to answer because you do have knowledge you answer.  If you say I do not know because it is somebody else’ account that you say you do not know and you can – we can move on.    Ja    Yes, no I also do not think so.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    The bond.   Ja.    Ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    No, no.    That is fine.    Ja.    That is fine.    Ja.    Ja no, no where he – where he has issues with you saying you do not know because he thinks you know he will – he will put that to you.    Okay.   Okay alright.      I am sorry Mr Soni I see we are at five to five.    I think we – we should just take an adjournment ten minutes adjournment.    I think   No, no I – I agree.  I did not realise that we are already close to five.    I thought we were still close to four.    I was thinking that maybe we should go up to six but it may well be I think I can be guided by you because that may be a lot of reading to do.  It may be that we should stop so that there is enough time to read.  It may be that we should go maybe up to six.  What is your sensebecause there is the reading as well?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Maybe it is better we adjourn.   Ja.  So maybe it is convenient that we should adjourn or – and then tomorrow start at a little earlier half past nine I do not – what is your sense?    Yes, no what I mean is in terms ofwhether we adjourn now or later.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Montana you – you have given usa lot of – a lot of paperwork that must be read.    Until twelve midnight.    Okay yes.  Yes should we start – should we stick to ten or how – do half past nine but sometimes we start at half past nine like we did I think on Friday but I ended up needing to have a longer lunch because therewere some things that needed my attention.    What is your sense.    Ja. Then let us start at normal time ten o’clock.  Ja.    My sense is that we should start with you. I do not know.  Mr Soni – ja let us start with you we continue and try and finish with you.  We- I would like to – to finish with your evidence.    Tomorrow if we can.   Well in respect of everything.  But if – if we do not achieve that despite our best efforts we will take it from there to see what can be done.  As I say I do have – my schedule of hearings and witnesses up to end of May it is almost full you know – actually it is full.  But let us see how far we can go and we do our best efforts but if we come to the end of – of – and I do have an evening session tomorrow.  So if we come to five o’clock we see that we are not done and we have done the best we can we will take itfrom there.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.   ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Ja.  Ja   No, no that is fine.  You will – you will remember that earlier this afternoon I said if we park theproperties issue I could give you a chance to – to deal with whatever issues that you have been asked that you – you have not given a full answer or – so – so …    I take that into account.    Ja.  Okay let us adjourn for the day.  There will be no evening session this evening.  We will resume at ten tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson.    We are ready.    As you please Chairperson.    Chairperson when we were last here a week ago we were going to deal with the properties.  Now I want to adopt a slightly different approach to this issue instead of dealing with Mr Oellermann’s report I just want to put certain documents to Mr Montana and ask him to – or put the contents of those documents through him for the record>    Most of the documents are annexures to Mr Oellermann’s report or annexures to Mr Loubser’s affidavit.   Now Mr Montana can I firstly ask in relation to the Parkwood property you have seen the relevant part of Mr Oellermann’s report.    Chairperson I have read Mr Montana’saffidavit and I am just setting out what the difference is between the evidence that is intended to be led and what is contained in Mr Montana’s affidavit and Mr Montana can comment after I have given my – what my submission is in regard to those issues.Mr Montana in his affidavit deals with all the properties that he owns and they are – if my memory serves me correctly about eight properties.    Eight.    We deal with only four properties.  These are the four properties that in some way or the other based on the documents that we have Mr Montana and Mr Van Der Walt were involved.  That is all we intend – that is the onlyevidence we intend producing to you Chairperson.Now we do not accept that Mr Montana’s evidence on the other properties is relevant to the Terms of Reference of the Commission because there is no connection between Mr Van Der Walt and Mr Montana – and those properties.  So that is the first point of departure.  The second point of departure is that Mr Montana in his affidavit does not deal with the issues as they are set out in the annexures to Mr Oellermann’s affidavit and once we getpassed that issue Chairperson – in other words if for example there is as there is a – an agreement – an offer to purchase and an acceptance of the offer therefore an agreement to purchase the property or to sell the property.  That is a matter that we would like Mr Montana to confirmand in respect of each of the properties we have that. We also have the background to how those agreements arose and also the method of payment for those properties.Now those are the facts that we submit ought to be placed before you.  What inferences are to be drawn from those facts – what conclusions on would draw from them – whether there is anything improper – whether there is anything irregular is an entirely separate matter but we cannot reach that either in respect of what Mr Montana saysor what we say unless there is agreement on those basic facts.And so the purpose for this – although we do not have Mr Montana’s affidavit the purpose was – the purpose is just to get the facts before you when Mr Montana wants to comment on what inference is to drawn from them then we can deal with that which is contained in his affidavit.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    No, no.    Not at all Chair.    Not at all.   Yes.    Chairperson I really do not have a problem with when it to be done I do not want to be unfair to Mr Montana.    If it is to be done at the outset but there must be one condition to it Chairperson.    That after Mr Montana sets out what he says are the…    The bigger picture – what he says is the bigger picture then he must answer the questions that are posed in relation to those documents.    Just – I am going to deal with the contents of that in a moment.    In due course.    But what I would just like from Mr Montana is I do not know whether the affidavit he submitted earlier is the same affidavit because I understand that he has drawn up a new affidavit.  I – I am not raising technicalities I just do not want there to be a disjuncture between what hereads into the record and the affidavit that may become part of the commission.    Yes.    As you please Chair.   Is this the same as – I am asking.    Yes.    It certainly would expedite matters.   As you please Chair.    Thank you Chair.    As please Chairperson.  Chairperson I have explained to Mr Montana what I am going to do now is inrespect of each of the properties forget the report because I understand Mr Montana’s concerns about the report we just want to look at the supporting documents in respect of these properties.    Done with that yes.    Yes.  I was not aware that there was that distinction Chairperson so it is not something I …    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I – I accept that Chairperson it is not something I …    Sought out independently.    No sure.      Yes.    Chairperson may I – may I suggest a way forward and that is we…   We could deal with this and then as soon as…    The questioning is finished on this.    Mr Montana can hand those to Ms 00   Yes.    To that process yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Montana we would be able to get – they are at the end of your affidavit so we will be able to takethem out as a pile – those annexures.    Now Mr Montana in regard to the Parkwood property you will see that there are certain annexures referred to OR – Annexure OR1 to Mr Oellermann’s affidavit.  I just want to refer to the annexures.Annexure PP1 is a series of emails and I just want torefer you to two emails. If you could please turn to page 44 and 45.  You will see at the bottom of page 44 there is an email from you dated the 21s t of August 2012, do you see that – right at the bottom at page 44?    Yes.    2012 yes.   And you will see on the next page at page 45 it is addressed to Ms Willis – Ursula Willis who I understand was your personal banker, is that correct?  Sorry Mr Montana if you could…    And then you will see at page 45 in the     Yes.    Is reading yes.  As you please Chairperson.    So the one you are looking at now is at page    Ursula yes.    Ursula.    Ursula.    That is the one.     That is so Chair.    Then Mr Montana can I ask you to turn topage 42.    We dealing with Parkwood.    Yes.    Parkwood.    At the bottom of page 42 you will see thereis an email from Ursula Willis also dated the 21s t August about 45 minutes after your email to her and it is addressed to you, is that correct Mr Montana?    Okay and then if you look at page 43.    Ursula Willis.    No, no right at the bottom Chairperson 21s tAugust.    No, no.    This is the reply at page 42.    Yes right at the bottom.    You will see it is sent 21s t of August 2012.    At 9   Private 1 Security.    Held    Yes.  And this is in answer to your email Mr Montana and about in the middle of the page next to the number 3 it is dealing with ERF 359 Parkwood Johannesburg.  Do you accept that?    And she gives the address as 10 NewportRoad, that was the address of the Parkwood property, is that correct?    And then she says   Yes.  It is just under the physical address you will see valuation amount R3.5 million.    Right.  And then of course this reflects as per your request she reflects the amount of the bond – I think it is between – oh sorry for R2 million.  Saying – just under valuation amount.    No 43 Chairperson.  This is the – the substance of the email from Ms Willis to Mr Montana.    Right at the top she says   And then she deals with the information in regard to one of the properties in Waterkloof or two of the properties in Waterkloof and then number 3 she deals withERF359 Parkwood.    Oh.  Sorry    That is right at the top.    That is so.    R2 million yes.  That is correct Mr Montana?    Yes.    Alright then I just want to ask you then to look at PP2 which is page 40 – starts at page 46 – this is the offer by Precise Trade – well perhaps I should just describe what the document is.  It – the title of the document is Offer to Purchase Full Title, is that correct at page 46?    And it is a document which is a – an offer byPrecise Trade to purchase from you the property which is 10 Newport Road, Parkwood.  And that you will find at page – oh sorry 1. – paragraph 1.2.  Is that correct?    Right.  And then it is the Terms of theAgreement are the purchase price is R6.8 million. That is what you said already.  And the payment was going to be way of a deposit of R2.5million to be paid within 30 days – that is at paragraph 2.2 and at 2.3 the balance of the purchase price to be paid to Loubser Van der Walt Incorporated Trust Account within 90 days after the signature.  Is that correct?    Okay.  And they say at paragraph 2.4   Now Loubser Van Der Walt is obviously Mr Van Der Walt’s legal firm – I mean he was a partner in that legal firm.    Yes.  Well now can I just ask you quickly I want to come back to PP2 but I just want to get this overwith.  If you look at PP3 which is at page 53 – it starts at page 53.  This is the Deed Of Transfer in respect to that property, is that correct?  Page 53 Mr Montana and you will see right in the middle of that page it is a Deed of Transfer.    Alright and you will see at page 56 the property was transferred on the 20t h of February 20015.    Is that correct?  Now Mr Van Der Walt has given an explanation of the payments made in regard to this property.  It is contained in Mr Loubser’s affidavit.  Can I ask you then to please turn to Bundle G – Annexure SS16 which is Mr Loubser’s affidavit.  And can I ask you to please look at page 198.  This is the black numbers now – page 198.      198.    Yes.    Yes.    Have you got it there?    Yes.  It is dated the 28t h of January 2016.    I will just tell you what this is.  This is theevidence given by Mr Loubser.  He says after the – after articles were written about the property deals they asked Mr Van Der Walt certain questions about the deals and he wrote to them.  This is a second letter he wrote to them on the 28t h of January explaining all the transfers – or all the payments that were made in respect of the different properties.  We are only dealing with four of them.  Now at paragraph 2.2 of page 198 of the letter of the 28t h of January he says in his letter that the purchase price of R6.8 million this is in respect of Parkwood property waspaid as follows and he sets out the date of payment and the amount on each of – the amounts paid on each of those dates.  Now can I ask – well can I also ask…    Sorry it still page 198.    Paragraph 2.2.  He says   We will Chair.    Yes.      So it says at paragraph 2.2 the purchase    Yes.  Well that is the evidence I – you know it is not.    Now I – why I want you to look at this is I want us to compare what is said by Mr – in that letter with entries in the bank account.     Oh sorry on 198.    Alright so we can just concentrate on that.  Now if we look at an entry in the bank account which is at page 1…    2.2.1 Chairperson.  The 18 t h of June.    2014.    And the amount reflected as being paid isR2 250 000.00.    Alright.  Now Mr Montana can – and Chairperson can I ask now we turn to page 190 and you will see the third entry on the bank account is for the 18 t h of June 2014 and it is reflected as a withdrawal from Precise or by Precise Riaan Loan.  You see that Mr Montana? The third entry on page 190 Chairperson.    Yes.     You see it says withdrawal value date 18t h June and Precise / Riaan loan.  That is the description given to that entry.  Do you see that?    Right.  And the amount there is R1 250 million?  Mr Montana. At page 190.      Yes.    Yes.  We are going to deal with each of them Mr Montana.    Alright and according to Mr Loubser the word guarantee was written by Mr Van Der Walt at the time the document was given to Mr Loubser.    No, no, no this is a Debit in the account.  I am just trying to draw a link between what he says at page 198.    And what is reflected in the bank account.   Okay.    So I am just saying he says that amount was paid on the 18t h of June and when you look at the account you will see that that account – that amount was debited to the Precise Trade account on that day.    Okay.  Now I just want to alert you to two – the two earlier entries of the 18t h of June.  There is a deposit– the first entry is a deposit of R1 850 million.  Do you see that?    And then there is another deposit of R4 million.  And in his handwriting Mr Van Der Walt writes TMMloan.    Then if you look at – go back to page 198.    You will see 2.2.2 on the 18 t h of July 2014 he says a payment of R110 800.00 was made to you.  You see that?    And then you will see that when you look at page 190 on the 18t h of July there is a withdrawal ofR110 800.00 and it is marked Montana payment.    Okay.  Now I suppose I should ask you with regard to each one.  The R2.25 million is that a payment that was made to you on the day reflected?    No now I understand – I understand perfectly.  Alright so the first payment was – was – you accept the first payment would have been made in respect ofthe property but it was not made to you and when you put the full picture or taking the full picture into account you think it was a payment made to the bank?    Do you recall it was R2 million.    But I mean that was the year earlier so it (talking over one another0.    But Mr Montana all I want us to agree on isthat Mr Van Der Walt says that the payment was made – that payment was made in respect of the Parkwood property.  I accept that you say it was not made to you so we must accept that it would have been made to the bank.    No sure.    And – and if you dispute any particular payment place that on record.   Alright.  Then on the 2.2.3 he says same on the 18t h July 2014 a payment of R350 00.00 was made and if you look at page 190 a withdrawal of that amount is madeand he marks it Montana payment.      You see that – yes.  Alright then at 2.2.4 on the 24t h of…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes    Yes.  And Chairperson I do not want us torun into difficulties.  What we have is a statement or a letter from Mr Van Der Walt.    Who is asked tell us about the Parkwood property.   And he says it was bought for R6.8 million and these are the payments I made.    Now he does not say he made the payments to Mr Montana.    What he says is here is the bank statement and in the bank statement you see a correlation between what he says in his letter and what is reflected in the bankstatement    Now the difficulty we have is that when he says TLM or Mr Montana reading it with the letter of the 30 – 28 t h of January 2016 we say that that is a payment made in respect of his indebtedness to Montana. It does not mean that he paid it directly to Mr Montana.  Now of course we are now in this difficult situation because Mr Montana’s point is well I do not know about those it may have my name but I cannot confirm this.Now in a sense Chairperson we are running around in circles because instead of Mr Montana saying because – and this is an issue and I am going to put to Mr Montana in a moment.  I buy something from well Mr Van Der Walt buys aproperty worth R6.8 million from Mr Montana.  He says I made these payments.  Now that is Mr Montana’s property he must know if those payments were made or not.  Whether it was made to him or to somebody else because they are payments due in terms of the agreement which we have already looked at.    So – but that is the proposition I am going to put and that is as far as we can take it.    If I recall we were at 2.2.4 at page 198.    Yes.    Yes.    Chairperson there is – while proceedings were going on there is something that occurred to me that if we go on late into the evening today it is going to be impossible for being meaningfully to deal with these matters.    Yes.    Yes.   Chairperson there – there may be things in the affidavit.    And I have not seen the annexures yet.    So it is going to be another issue.    That …    Yes.  And I just do not know how to – because we need to make copies as well.    No, no the – the problem though Chairperson has that we would have to make copies this evening so that we are able to deal meaningfully with what is contained in these affidavits.    I think we should adjourn now Chairperson.    Because this is – and it will into…    Yes.        In view of the reading we have as much time that we have to prepare would be appreciated.    Thank you Chair.
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.   Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath binding on your conscience?    Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so helpme God.    All rise. 
MR MONTANA:  Tshepo Lucky Montana.    No.    I do.    So help me God.    Chair I must say I come as an unhappy witness today because I thought – I even asked the teamover the weekend why am I being called because the last time the – the Chairperson summarised the discussion on this matter.    Was that I quickly sort out my affidavit.   So that we – we can deal with these issues in the full context.    Especially the fact that Chair I stated very clearly we are working on Mr Oellermann’s report which – what I have said I do not accept Chair and I think it should not even be before the commission unless he had filed the proper affidavit.   You see – it cannot be that some of us file affidavitsunder oath and then somebody files a report; attaches reports and other things. There is a context Chair.    And I think you probably allow me before we go to the specifics of the documents because I think so that the Chair can appreciate why I am aggrieved and the unfairness.    But I have also said Chair because I have been cooperating with the commission and the team I do notwant to bring administrative issues here.    We will continue dealing with them in the background.    So that the focus on the hearings must be on the hearing.    So I am not going to stop you Chair but I think at some stage before – before we even go to the details I do not know when but maybe Mr Soni wants to finish the Parkwood.    And then I indicate particularly because I think Chair the – the section on my affidavit on propertieswhich I think I have worked with the team it was done and of course it has not been before the commission as yet. Because I think that as we discuss the issues of properties my affidavit is not – it is not here.  We are discussing these issues – I want the part of my affidavit Chair to – to read it out – it is not long.    So that – so that we can then – I can – we can deal with this issue in totality Chair.  So that – that will be my request Chair.  I do not know at what point you wouldallow me but that is my request Chair.    No I appreciate that one thank you Chair.    Chair I – none of the – I have seen previously these documents.    And I am here Chair.    I would have asked that – I would have asked for another month to study the document to consult.  I here Mr Soni.    I will answer.  But Chair I think let me dealwith three issues – small issues.  You see the commission owes me an apology Chair.  In fact if we were – if I did not respect the Chair and the commission I would have actually refused.  Mr Soni and Mr Oellermann stood and you asked an important question.  I think it was on the 2 n d of July Chair I cannot recall you wanted to clarify how much – how much – how many properties and how much.   Chair the response from Mr Soni at that time was that Mr Montana – he corrected – he corrected the Chair and said Mr Montana bought properties for R36 million andthat is why Chair the process we are going to follow – because that is – that is not correct. Okay and that is why in my affidavit I deal with these properties dealings Chair because they are not – they are not illegitimate – they are unlawful.   Why Mr Soni set it up in the manner that he does it is basically Chair and sustaining that false narrative and I think it is very important Chair for your benefit – I am not saying I am going to deal with that – broad picture.    I am going to deal with the specifics today Chair.    So – so I think that for me I raise two    And I am going to answer it.  So I think what should happen now.    Chair I am here.    I am here and I think Mr Soni can grill me the whole day (speaking in vernacular) I am here Chair.  But I think it would be fair considering what has already been put on record that these parts of my – of my affidavit I readit in – into record and then Mr Soni takes me out on each and every issue that he wants to grill me.    And then the other context of how we come here.   And other attached documents.  I will speak with the – I will speak on them in the course of the – of the testimony Chair.    Thank you – thank you Chair I really appreciate it. Thank you Mr Soni.    No, no I am happy Chair I think that – that would be the right way.    No, no it is – I have got it Chair I – I havegot it here.    I will give it to the team to make copies quickly    It is a stand-alone Chair.    Ja.    Chair I think it is about fifteen pages.  I think it is page 311 to – to page – ja I think it is about fifteen pages Chair – I think to page 3 – 327.  It is not a lot Chair.     Yes, Chair they are available.  Just to explain, as discussed with Mr Soni.     Chair, you will see I have given – I thought I had the commissioned affidavit but it will be here by lunchtime, Chair.    So I gave the copies so that we can proceed, but it is exactly the same as you have.  The annexures are also available.  So we will make those available.  And we have agreed with Mr Soni that over andabove that we will pull out this section with the annexures so that I hand them to the Commission.     So that we know we are done with this particular matter.     Ja.     Thank you ...[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  I think – I really appreciate Chair and I think this matter has been, not only before this Commission, but throughout the country to the nation about this properties and everything.  And that iswhy I wanted to put that on record before Chair.       And you will see, initially, Mr Soni mentioned that I am talking about four properties – all my properties.     And that is four, Chair.     But this statement explains Chair, you will see, it explains how the – actually the entire sevenproperties which I used to have Chair.  I do not have them today.  I think it is very important.  That those properties how they are financed.  All the other properties that we are referring to.  And I think it is very important because it is at the heart of what we do Chair.     You will see that, Chair, is – so it is – the heading is, My Property Dealings.     I think they took – that after I have submitted with the affidavit at lunchtime, Chair.     Now?  Okay.     Okay.     Yes, I do Chair.  Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, let me be heading to the document, to that document you just     I was saying, Mr Soni, that as an Africanman I will not allow a man to trespass at my father ’s(?) house and do as he wishes.  Mr Myburgh was trying to do, Chair, he trespassed.  He was there inside my – inside my yard.  And this property, as you can see, I bought it before I worked for PRASA, Chair.  So that is the first issues here.Then there is another property, 1242 Waterkloof.  Chair, this property was purchased in 2005 and again I was not working for PRASA, Chair.  This was financed by the bank through the very same private one bank facility. Chair, the important point – two points – let me finish reading it and there are two important points that I want to highlight for the Chair. “I had done major renovations and extensions to the property.The property was valued at R 8.5 million in 13. However, the property was sold for R 2 750 000,00 to a family that owned one of the properties purchased by Riaan van der Walt in Brooklyn...”So when he talked about two Brooklyn adjacent properties, Chair, you will see, I will explain this point.  So it relates to the second property that they are not part of the four that Mr Soni...  I want to demonstrate, Chair, toyou that in each and every property dealings I got involved I owned a house.  I either sold or put it into a scheme.   “I have taken the risk of letting go of the property at a hugely discounted price.   This was to facilitate for the consolidation of the properties and development in the future. The development would have involved Precise Trade and myself. Precise Trade is a company that is owned by Riaan van der Walt...”So here is this family, Chair.  Why I bought – and these properties are in the same street, by the way Chair, in Waterkloof.  When I was Deputy Director General in the Department of Transport, I was staying in a house.  My house was attacked by warlords or Inkhati(?) from the taxiindustry because one of the programmes I was running was a Taxi Recapitalisation Programme.And the State Security, National Intelligence at that time, agency, came and do a security assessment and     Two ...[intervenes]      R 2.25 million, Chair.    Now Chair, just for you to make the connection.  You can see that I am – there are two – this remain – remaining extent of Erf 161 Waterkloof and then there is Erf 161 Waterkloof.  You can see these are twoproperties.  So I owned the properties in front.  So the property has been sub-divided.  So when I sold Parkwood property, Chair, I then     Yes, Chair, but let me …[intervenes]     Sure, Chair.  The issue I am saying is that all these lies about my properties, they come from a criminal gang that wanted to extort money from me and other people and then they went to write – afterwards that is when this 22 affidavit came and accused me of all sorts of things and that is why I want Mr O’Sullivan, I wantWerksmans here.  And you know it is going to be very interesting, Chair, because I want to use that cross-examination to expose the real criminals.  But I will not end there, I actually want to show how they link to the structure of power in our country and, Chair, I have madeup my mind, I am one of the people who are going to spearhead the fight against the structure of power that actually use criminal – including [indistinct], Chair, so I am inviting them to apply to the Commission and say want to cross-examine Montana, I will be here to engage with them, Chair, to assist this Commission to understand.   That is why, Chair, let me read, as my conclusion, what I said in the conclusion to my statement to this Commission.  I think it is very important, Chair, that I do that.  I said – I thank you, Chair, in this statement but I say    I am going to assist you with the real criminals, Chair, thank you.     No, no, Chair, I am not making allegation, this is what you answered the Chair.    It is a statement of fact, Chair.     Chair, the Chair – the Chair asked for confirmation and asked you, Mr Soni, and you are the one who answered to say no, he bought properties for R36 million.     Chair, can we play a clip, I’ve got a clip, Chair, you ask a question, Mr Soni doesn’t answer – he’s actually dealing with it differently.  I said the Chair asked the question and you said, how many – you even said, is it R30million, Mr Soni said he boughtproperties for R36million.  Now, he’s reading a different thing, he’s not telling me about what I’m referring to.  I said, what Mr Sonisaid, in response to you Chair, he said, actually he had even a smile that Mr Montana bought – and I brought the clip so that we can play it…[intervenes].     And then we don’t have the dispute about that.     Yes Chair, but I was referring to,specifically, what he had said to you, Mr Oellermann was in full agreement, he was nodding Chair, that is why I say that – you recall, initially I said, the Commission owes me an apology.     It will be earlier on, so Chair, I’m referring to that and Mr Soni …[indistinct] the issues. I see the paragraph that he’s reading there but I’m saying that,  you enquired from them, they confirmed to you they didn’t even give this…[indistinct] and it was even like a joke, nohe bought properties for R36million …[indistinct], so that was the statement, Chair.     Yes, Chair, he’s saying in the report in paragraph four that we just read he says – this is different Chair,  “Mr Montana was involved in arrangements for the purchase of three properties for a total of more than R36million”.     Correct?     No, Chair it doesn’t say within a year.     What I’m referring to, is what they were saying, they were not saying I’m involved in arrangement for properties of R36million, is that I bought properties for R36million Chair and that is factually incorrect, that’s what I’m challenging.     No, no Chair, I stick to that, that is why I’m…[intervenes].     Sorry Chair, sorry for interrupting you.     No, no Chair, I think my statement in my – the one that I submitted as part of my evidence – of myaffidavit is actually a correct statement, Chair.     No, no I see it Chair but I’m saying that we are – we seem to be confusing issues here.    Let me clarify it.     I didn’t say, Mr Oellermann, in hisstatement, I mentioned the report.  I’m saying Chair that, in its so-called preliminary report on PRASA the Commission’s investigator, Oellermann and evidence leader Advocate Soni has told the Chairperson okay and I clarified during the testimony you asked a specific questionChair, and that response is not consistent – contradicts number four.  You see number four says, Chair, I was involved in arrangements for the purchase of three properties, that I accept, it’s correct Chair.  The statement that was given to you Chair, was that I Tshepo Lucky Montana bought properties for R36million. You know, throughout, I’ve explained Chair, in my statement that I’ve worked with people, you can say you were involved in when that property was bought, Chair, I will admit that but if you say, Montana bought properties for R36million, I didn’t buyproperties for R36million…[intervenes].     Are you reading mine or Oellermann’sstatement Chair?     My document?     Yes.     Chair, my statement there is correct, I’m sticking to that statement yes.     No, no Chair.     I think, it shouldn’t be me.     The evidence leader is supposed – when we were discussing that, the question to – the question you asked was the properties I bought. You see, I’m saying number four is correct Chair, I mark it, I agree with it.     I was involved in even more properties than this, I don’t have a problem with that.     But when you asked the question Chair, okay, they even said – they even moved beyond that statement – so this statement was changed so in writing they say this but to you, Chair, there was a massive misrepresentation.  Firstly, Montana bought properties forR36million, secondly he didn’t have the money to buy those properties.  This is what both of them said in the…[intervenes].     Yes, Chair.     You were asking Mr Oellermann.     Mr Soni answered on his behalf, he came in to clarify.     He nodded, he agreed, Chair and that is why Chair…[indistinct] so we can close this thing.     Yes, no, Chair, during that – I think it was– you asked in the course of him presenting his report.     That’s what I’m referring to Chair.     Yes.    No, Chair, I agree except that we know that we’ll take this and we’ll also take the transcript isn’t it?     Chair, I’m happy with number four.     Because it’s saying Montana was involved with people, that’s fine.     But that is different from saying Montana bought properties for this amount of money, that I reject Chair, and that is why I wanted to read my statement in the beginning so that you can see that this is not one and thesame thing.     No, no Chair.  I think number four, I’m happy that’s what he’s saying.     When we go – it’s just that I didn’t mark it Chair, as we have the discussion during the course – I’ll draw it to your attention.    Where he actually even move away from four and I think that could be…[intervenes].     It’s saying what I am saying Chair, and when you asked Chair, because you wanted clarity.     They then, both of them confirmed Chair, and that is why I’m saying, probably Mr Soni will look atthe clip at that time, the team can help him get that clip and ask your question, you’ll see Chair, they are saying, I bought properties and I take an exception to that Chair.     Yes.     I’ll do that Chair, I’m more than happy to do that, I’m glad that we are going to be robust today and deal with these issues, Chair, I’m happy.     Chair, can I object to that very strongly?     Chair, can I object to that?     You know,  Mr Soni has told me about thereport that he’s bringing to you, I’m not here for that, Chair.  Mr Soni can write whatever he wants to write and present to you, the Chair will apply his mind.  I – Mr Soni write whatever you want to write.  I’m not here to convince the Commission to take my version, I’m here to assist the Commission and present evidence.  Chair, Mr Soni was wrong, okay. Let me talk about your role, Mr Soni, is to assist the Commission to reach the truth, to find the truth. It’s not to pursue or to push a particular view.  Chair, in that particular instance – and that is why I’ve kept over 20,over 20, Chair, of the clips where Mr Soni was talking to Mr Oellermann, here when he was leading him in the evidence and Mr Soni forgets, he’s still has to lead my evidence here, okay, it’s going to be very interesting.  Chair you must also see those clips and say, let’s go back, Mr Soniwas not facilitating for Mr Oellermann to tell his story he was making assertions, his own assertions okay, there are so many.  So, Chair, you have invited me here, and let me put it very clear because I’m not one person who comes and want to please the Chair so that a favourable – I’m not asking you for a favourable report.  I’ve just read my statement and my statement proves beyond any reasonable doubt, okay Chair, he’s going to ask me, that the story presented to this Commission, that I bought properties I didn’t have money, some people – it’s all false, it’s notbacked up by evidence.  I’ve given – and I hope he’s going to ask me Chair, about the breakdown that I’ve given to him about – because you see, he wanted to deal with four properties, yet he knows the other properties I’ve sold were actually the basis of my involvement or possible partnerships in these other four properties.  He wants to restrict you there, that is why I insisted on coming so that, Chair, you understand the context.  So, Mr Soni cannot threaten me Chair, I can never be threatened, I’m one person who can never be threatened.  So, Mr Soni canwrite, I mean even where I proved, previously in my other testimony where he said things – you can see on the evidence of Martha Ngoye and the thing, he said, I’m going to write.  Mr Soni let me face you and not face the Chair…[intervenes].    No, but I want to say it to him in his face, Chair.     Okay.     My last sentence, Chair.     Chair, you know, when I wrote to you in19, July 2016, I said in my letter I want to – before it became fashionable I want to assist the Commission’s work and I want to demonstrate that those that make allegations of corruption against some of us are, in fact, the most corrupt and they are involved in wrongdoing.     I believe this Commission is very important for the future of our country.  So, if Mr Soni, as he has shown, demonstrated throughout that he serves a particular view, a particular narrative and he threatens he’sgoing to – let him write Chair, because ultimately these things will be tested in Court, will be contested, I’m not here, Chair, to guy the Chair ’s face, I’m here to assist the – that is why I’ve been fighting to come here.  So, for me to be told that I’m going to write this thing, so he’s going to– Chair, why don’t we stop this session because what he’s saying, is that despite the fact that I told him that I put R2million there, R2million there, I got this facility from the bank, he’s saying I’m still going to write so that I can – so we’re going to fight today Chair, I’m ready for this fight, I’m ready for this fight, but I’m still going to assist you, Chair.     No, Chair, I accept that, Chair I made a commitment.     You see, I didn’t …[indistinct] Chair.     Because I’m not that kind of a person.     I’m here, Mr Soni can tear me apart and he must accept my response.     But, Chair, I make it very clear, I can’t be threatened.    Chair, I accept your guidance on this issue, my point has been made, I’ll come back after lunch to come and answer this question Chair, thank you very much.    Chair I have then bu…    Chair I have received everything but I have since been told that I submit them after this when I meet withthe – with Ms Rangata.    No, no Chair I have got everything – they are here.  I just asked the team at lunch time in line with your instruction but they said no, no it is fine we will deal with it later.  So I just put them back safely in the car Chair.    But I will give them to the team then.    Ja.    I am on page 45 sorry Chair.  Okay.    I am on page 44 ja.  I see that.    That is correct ja.  Sorry, sorry.    Ursula.    I see that Chair.    I accept that Chair.    That is correct.    Is that on page 42?    That is correct.    No I am happy – I am happy with this Mr Soni.    I see that Chair ja.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    He was a partner indeed.  He was a partner.    Ja.   Ja.    198.   Ja is this the one with the amounts inAfrikaans?    I have got it Chair ja.    What page is that?    We still on page 198.    Not …    Ek praat net kombuis Afrikaans DCJ so.    So –  particularly I see here – I think itwould be – but I trust the commission’s – I have read this affidavit.    But not this particular letter.    So I do not know – I do not know but it is fine Chair.    Well I hear Chair.    I accept that ja.    Where – are you still on 19?    On 198 ja.    I am on 190 Chair.    Ja, okay.    Yes I see that.    Chair I see – I see the – I think that the above 4 I see R350 400 linked to Montana.  Oh I see at the bottom R2 250 I see that Chair 18t h June.   Ja.    But this – so this is a guarantee given to the bank – to ABSA.    Ja.    In the statement ja okay sure.    Ja.     Okay.    I see that.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    No, no Chair.  I suspect Chair I do not know – it was not made to me but when I see that I think it is linked to him settling the bond with ABSA for that amount. Because that was the – that was the bond amount that I had so when has bought the property the first payment must goto – it must go to the bank.  So I think that is what it reflects Chair.    Chair I think – look Chair I – I think this is consistent with my statement that I have made but I would not know what is the – because when I saw the affidavit and made contact with Riaan to say what was this and he says no but these were my statements when I was using the money around. But that is he – he is the one who must come and account to – about how he used the money at PreciseTrade.  But when I look at the amount of R2 250 I think let us go back to the email – the email from Ursula Willis I do not know how much did they say they recall but…    Ja I am sure.    That was the year earlier.    It should have been made to the bank. Chair the risk of course of doing that I think Mr Soni should – let us continue taking me through    But I am being asked about the financial statements of another company not about mine.  I think it would have been good if we had my own bank statements.    Because I think if you look at the R6.8 the bulk of the money did not even come to my account.    As I explained earlier I said pay there – pay there -  pay there.  But you would record it as a thing.  How you got the money – who shift monies around.  I would not have the details Chair.    So I think that the – so I think let us go through them as you say.    But I .    Absolutely Chair.    No, no on this one Chair I cannot because it is not my statement.      I do not know them.    I am seeing them as they are tabled here.    Ja I see that yes.    No, no Chair some of them may not have come to me.    Particularly the big amounts I think that is when he was – he was settling the banks and all of those things.    So it is his – you can see that he had written a lot of notes.    Because he is dealing with in that statement he is dealing with ...[intervenes]      ...or by the company.  So ...[intervenes]      So, but I will take you, Chair.     That this accounting for the six-hundred and...     ...R 46.8 million when he bought the properties from me.  Ja.     3, ja.     H’m.    So this one, it says TLM, Nola(?) Montana.     So how do you know, Chair, it is ...[intervenes]      The letter.  No, no Chair I accept that fully.     I accept that fully, Chair.    I think the only problem ...[intervenes]      ...that I have and I think the numbers are very clear there.     I do not have a problem with...     He was explaining to his partners.     Now, Riaan and I had a much broader relationship.  We are dealing with other things and you will see in my annexure that I attached where we ended up a relationship.He said to     And in some instances they are recorded as Montana.     But in the – say for example, I would say pay someone for this work.     Or I remember when he bought theParkwood property, there were certain things that were not     Would have been that after his partners has questioned him, he then went to the statements andthen put everything under the Parkwood property and explained it as such.  So that is a possibility.  But again, I cannot speak on his behalf.  The issue is that we had the relationship with Riaan van der Walt.  We were involved in many developments or transactions and so I think I will not question the – whether the numbers ...[intervenes]      It is not in my – so I do not know.     No, no Chair, the Parkwood property ...[intervenes]      ...he paid me R 6.8 million.     But that money, as I have said, it did not come to me ...[intervenes]      ...in that way.     So what happened is that, I said    So the bank was paid two plus.  And now that is why I am saying I assume ...[intervenes]      ...two five(?) zero.     You know, Chair, in fact – no, no.  In fact, I think the two point two five zero may be linked to the Waterkloof property after the sale.     So that is why I do not see the two millionwhere he was settling the bank.     So I think and I am not sure how many accounts he was using and all of those things but I assume that the two point two five – if you look at the price of theproperty in Waterkloof, the amounts correlate.     You remember I said earlier on paid that property after – from the proceeds of the sale.  And there are emails, Chair, by the way, that Riaan and I have been exchanging.     And these emails were available.  I am surprised that they are not included because they have given a proper context of each payment and whathappened to the proceeds of R 6.8 million.  So it did not come to me.  He paid various entities and ...[intervenes]      ...processes.     No, no I do not have, Chair.     You remember those emails, I wrote them when I was still at PRASA.    But the investigators, Chair, they have got those emails.  And you know what happened?     Then they went on cherry(?) picking(?).    So all my – all my emails at PRASA were downloaded and what has happened, Chair, is that they were downloaded by Werksmans.  From Werksmans, of course, later on they moved to the Commission through Mr Oellermann’s report.  But you can see, Chair, my emails in their entirety are not even provided – indicate here.  And that is why when I look at my emails with Riaan, I wrote them while I was still working for PRASA.  And I say the relationship was not a secret,because when I was being investigated they downloaded the emails but what cleverly has been done here is to select what portray a particular narrative and leave others that do not.  But I think, I agree with Mr Soni’s method where he says there is an – there was testimony, a partner came and he said here is a letter.  That also I cannot Chair that if I had a relationship with Precise, okay?  I understand when the partners ask him about the activities of the firm, of the law firm but if Precise which they we did not have control over.  We did not evenknow about it.  So maybe he was trying to give them assurance, I do not know, but I think some of them do not correlate to me Chair.  But if we ask ABSA, Chair.  I was banking with ABSA.     Surely, ABSA ...[intervenes]      I was told – I read the statement in the Sunday Times, by the way.Mr Soni, where the Commission said they are going to subpoena my bank statements.      And I think, Chair, we could go back to that ...[intervenes]      It was in the Sunday Times, Chair.     No, no not the – I think ...[intervenes]      ...it was earlier in the year.  And I said I welcome the opportunity for the Commission to subpoena these bank statements and look at that because then we can do a three-way exercise.       What Van der Walt says, what this lettersays and what my bank accounts are telling us Chair.     And I will give permission to the Commission to ask for those statements from ABSA.     They should still have my statement, Chair.     I do not have access to them.     Chair, no, I do not want to dispute what Mr Soni is saying.  I do not have a problem with it.  I am glad that you are saying there is that relationship and there is – note that there is a distinction.     But Chair, let me tell you.  When these documents – when the Commission asked ...[intervenes]      Sure.    Okay alright.  Let us continue.     Yes, Chair, I was saying that Mr Soni made the distinction between the Commission and the investigators.  I accept that.  The issue that I have consistently raised was the fact that when the Commission requested information on the documents, on the case of Siyangena, I filed an affidavit and that affidavit wasignored.  That is the first issue.  Okay?  The second issue is that ...[intervenes]      No, no I am saying in regard to Siyangena.  It is not in relation to this.     At the high court.     You remember Mr Soni was saying the source of the information from the Commission is ...[intervenes]      Yes.    ...to get all the details that I am today presenting to the Commission.     But also, there is information where – I think the affidavit of Siyangena, if I recall well, it even    Now Chair, if I accept that, Mr Soni, but ifI do accept that, there is no reason Chair why Mr Oellermann - the very people who are accused in this thing they are actually not even interviewed.  He says he has seen the properties from outside, took picture during his testimony here but the first person that it is alleged the properties were bought from Mr Montana.  Surely, Chair, there is just no reason.  So I do not want to fight over it.     But I want to place it on record.     That is one of the reasons Chair why I will not accept Mr Oellermann’s thing.  Now we are dealing with the statements and we are dealing with the other annexures and some of them I have got problems but I think in the course of the issue.     Yes, I am not putting them as one.     But if someone does not interview me and take allegations from the very same people, as I see it,and put them as part of the report(?) of the Commission, that is not acceptable Chair and so that is the issue that ...[intervenes]      ...but I accept the ...[intervenes]     ...do not treat us one as – like Werksmans ...[intervenes]      ...and other things.  I respect that, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.    Chair, my dealings with Mr Van der Walt ...[intervenes]      ...is a very open thing.  The issue before the Commission is a different matter, Chair.     Is because I have never – in mystatement of 8 February 2016, I was responding to Mr Popo Molefe’s – it is the second annexure in the document that we have dealt with.  I dealt with that Chair.     And we spoke about the nature of therelationship.     The issue before this Commission is the fact that this report, what it does, it tries to say – and that is why I say we are guilty by association.  Montana worked with Van der Walt – with Van der Walt.  Van der Walt is paid by Siyangena.  That is the issue here, Chair.     And I am saying – and they say, therefore, as a result of that because Van der Walt has gota relationship with this.  He has paid for Montana’s properties.     That is why I then reading my statement early the – to say no, no, no.       I have a relationship with this man.  I have sold properties,  I am in partnership with him, and let us look at all of them.  So one of the first transactions we did was when he bought the property from me.    But ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Thank you, Chair.    Shu, Chair.  I suspect it was in 2012 and if I remember well, it was at the – I was in...  It was a big event.  I think it was at the Portuguese Club in Pretoria.  That I think should have been 2012, Chair.  Ja.     PRASA.    That is correct.     The CFO of ...[intervenes]      Ja, Thomas Dubek, ja.      That is correct, ja.      Ja.     Well, Chair, I do not know the discussion between the other people.  So I cannot confirm or reject but I am saying that the relationship I had between myself and Riaan was our relationship.  I think he is correct insofar he is saying they do not know about the relationship.  And we will see in the many emails that I am talking about that there was a relationship, we are writing – and I am was writing on my system as the PRASA CEO.  They are publicly available Chair, and I think it should be drawn to confirm that.  So the other conversation I do notknow.  I do not know what was discussed between Van der Walt and the CFO and mister ...[intervenes]      ...Ferreira but what I know is that Chair I have entered into a relationship with Riaan van der Walt. He had his own properties.  I had my own properties.  We wanted to go into joint ventures on things.  And where he was not involved like LLM(?), he was not involved but we asked him to be – what is called the conveyance side, that his law farm becomes the conveyancers in line with the affidavit of Mr André Wagner.  So I think Chair, I know Riaan.  I am saying it is common cause here.     I know him, I have worked with him, I trust him, he trusted him, we were doing property dealstogether.  That we must accept Chair and that I am confirming to this Commission.     I think it did start in 2012, Chair.     Chair, I do not think so.  I think that it is possible but I think what – I remember when I met – at the – this big club.  At the club they had a big event, Chair, and I think that a lot of people including from PRASA wereinvited there.  So I think that – I cannot recall specifically who it was but I met him at that event, if I remember well, Chair.     It was on a Saturday afternoon.  It was a big event, Chair.     And I was introduced to him and then thereafter, me and him hit it off and we went to work on properties.    Chair, I think the Commission should have everything.     The point I am making is that those commissions are available – these emails are available. They were used in specific instances.     But I know that they have downloaded all those emails.  So used others and kept others.  But I think in the interest of what this Commission is all about, itsTerms of Reference, I think that Werksmans and PRASA should find it within their good hearts to hand them to the Commission.  And I think you will analyse them, Chair, and say these are the inferences we are drawing from there.     And I think they will tell a different story to the noise that we have been hearing in the media, Chair.     No, I will assist the Commission in its work, Chair.     That is my starting point.     [laughs]    Oh, no I...  Thank you, Chair.  Sorry, Chair.  Yes.     Chair, everything is there.  And I think last week, Chair, you requested that I submit a full affidavit.  It is part of the annexures that I have preparedfor the Commission.  I do, yes.     Well, Chair, I am happy that the Commission will do its own investigation and talk to me so that I do not come here and be confronted with reports that were written that are factually incorrect like I have been doing with the Oellermann’s report.  So I would be more than happy Chair.     Ja.     Yes, Chair.  Actually, I prepared three files.     They are available, Chair.     We can...     After the break, I can bring them here, Chair.     And we can deal with that.     No, that I put separate with the annexures.     I think it will be ...[intervenes]      ...to present with them during the break, Chair.     No, Chair, my car is parked outside.      I can get it quickly.     No, no, Chair, indeed, ja, that is why it is a small thing but there others where you may find that in one subject there are three letters.  For example, letters from Ms Ursula Willis from ABSA.  So those would be put let us say under 162, but you will see that – I will indicate that there are about three documents there.  But these are merely letters or documents confirming – showing a bond. So it is not – it is a small purchase, it correlates exactly with the annexures in the document we admitted, Chair.     They all correlate, Chair, and I think thisis based on the guidance from the team.     I met with them, we did them in that way.      So each number in that are a copy ofthat affidavit, correlates to the annexure.     Corresponds, Chair.     Yes.     That is correct, Chair.    I have got that, Chair.     I can hear you, I am looking at 1480.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Ja, that is correct, Chair.     I pulled them from another affidavit, Chair, that is why I have that problem.     162.     Thank you, Chair.     That is 162, Chair.     It should be, Chair, I think the big issue there is the – that is the ABSA Private one, Chair, 162, is it not?       Ja, it should be a full document, Chair.    No, this comes from the bank, Chair, that is a letter summarising the …[intervenes]     If you look in the paragraph, ja, that is a letter from the bank.     And that is what I have, Chair, so I amnot sure if…     That is correct, Chair.     The first four, five pages summarises the facility from the bank, Chair.     And I think that is what is material for theCommission.     No, no, I confirm that, Chair.     Ursula Willis.    No, no, Chair, I think we are continuing,page – to continue the proper page, we are going to page 321 of the affidavit in that document, Chair, I think we are actually the next page.     Ja, page 322, Chair.    Paragraph 1518.     That is correct, Chair. I am just removing the divider, Chair.     I am just removing the dividers quickly.     That is correct, yes.  Sorry, Mr Soni, that is correct.       (a) to (h), Chair, they are all under that agreement with Midtownbrace for the Hurlingham property, Chair.     That is correct, Chair, yes.     On the properties, yes.    I will check it now, Chair.  Sorry, Chair, I cannot recall, it was a long affidavit.     No, Chair, I think – I thought that the entire file was the affidavit.     Annexures, okay.  That should be correct, Chair.     Chair I will take the – again Chair I repeat I am here to assist the Commission to gather information.    And also to put my version on record, so I think I will be willing to take the route that Mr Soni had proposed and comment on both, because I have looked at them and ...[intervenes]     I have looked at them Chair.     No, I do ...[intervenes – speaking over one another]     Yes.     Yes.     Should I proceed Chair?     Thank you Chair, the – let me start first with how most of these affidavits of course have come about and all of this Chair, you recall that some of them are in a way filed in the Siyangena matter.   Let me just puton record Chair because I did approach some of the people and asked them on what basis did you file this affidavit, while I understand at the Commission, but I am referring before they reach here Chair; people were told and they were threatened Chair, I asked Mr Louis Green can you tellme about your affidavit, because I want to take you to Court and he said no but you signed copies of the interactions, of emails that were there, that is why I am referring to them Chair, that they should also be here but they were used there and people were told by Mr O’Sullivan at that time Chair that it is part of  Hawkes and if they do not file these affidavits against me they will be arrested Chair.And so people were threatened.   Now, and that is why Chair I am emphasizing that the Commission can workon the basis of something that had been obtained legally but I am not afraid to get into the issues Chair, and let me deal with the three affidavits, because in essence ...[intervenes]      ...in essence Chair what I am saying to the Commission a big issue I am saying that I confirmed that I have had a relationship – I have had a relationship with Mr Riaan van der Walt, I think that the first annexure that you have taken, in fact he talks about the partnershipbetween myself and Riaan van der Walt, that is the first issue I am making there.The second issue Chair that – so you can see in the press statement that I made in 2016, I made a press statement to say no I am working with this man, there is noissue there, and I don’t want them to do that.   The second issue Chair that I have always said, I have always rejected of course the relationship, I think that they said there must be an inference, can we draw a link, okay.  I said there is no link, other people say there is a link and Chair I have seen not the Commission but some of the numbers were sent to me at the time when Mr O’Sullivan raised, put the – or rather lay a complaint at the Brooklyn Police Station.Now the numbers they deal with the numbers there, but I must check this thing because it doesn’t deal with me,it deals with the relationship like Robert Neethling has done between their relationship on the different properties, and I said give me the numbers precise and Lucky Montana had a relationship with Precise Trading, and this relationship speaks to the development of properties, it has got nothing to do with anything.Chair I don’t want to take issues with the – with Ms de Beer, but I think she didn’t answer – she didn’t answer the Commission Chair.  The reason why we had the ups and downs about how do you buy the properties, because Iam the first one, we had agreed after – remember Chair we don’t make an offer for the property.  We realise that the property has got business rights, in fact I think that the agent who spoke to me, told me at length about some of the bookings for example, I think he mentioned one of thembut sometimes we will ...[indistinct] this, because Ms de Beer was not living in the house, it was used as a guesthouse, so this was a guesthouse, it had business rights located and in Waterkloof Chair with embassies, you have business all the way.  That is our interest in that business.Now the first time Chair I dealt with this property was the fact that – was the fact that in Rose Street, she wanted R11million.  I made an offer of R11million Chair, or R11.5, there was no issue at that time, not to her, to heragent, I didn’t know her, she didn’t know me Chair.   Some of the things that she spoke about here that the Commission was leading her on I mean they are so petty, they don’t speak to the real issue.   Why didn’t I buy the property Chair, just one reason, the bank came back to me and said in the evaluation of that property the property is valued at R7million, remember I wanted it for business, okay, and I said I will use my – there is a what is it called, minor property trust, I said no it is fine, my participation in thatproject will be through my kids, my children’s trust.   I see Chair that in some of these they say I paid R3million, I never paid any cent into the property, the bank rejected and she doesn’t tell it, but she said the property is very important, the development and the opportunities that isthere huge, at the end then we said look Riaan can buy the property Chair and we will get that thing so it is not my property.She spoke here about I saw Montana in the last days that he come and fetch the keys, Chair all of those things happened, there is no issue there, the issue is that she says, she says and Mr Oellermann in his affidavit in his testimony she says I got the impression – an impression Chair, sometimes ...[indistinct] Chair and you get your own impression, she get that impression that it isMontana’s property and she has got the right to say that, but she doesn’t know the factual basis there, there is no factual basis but I have seen Mr Montana, she wasn’t there by the way when I went with Mr Riaan van der Walt to her own property, because I have been there twice or thrice before even – just to look at, to get the details about the property and what opportunities, which embassies book in there and all of those things Chair, okay.So it was business, I was doing business Chair.  But when the bank said to me we cannot finance it Ms deBeer was angry okay, and that is why Riaan and I had to discuss even if – even if the bank doesn’t want, so for me of course I am using a facility, for her she is involved in other things, she says no it is find, I will take the property and I will raise the money for this particular property, so...[indistinct] Chair one of the key things that I think were never explored Mr Soni in great length is the partner to Mr van der Walt, his testimony.You see it is very important that we know what is it that we want to take from an affidavit, what message is coming out of there.   What – he was saying two things from what I can gather, and I listened to his testimony and I have read his affidavit.  Two things are very clear Chair, the first one is clear that they were unhappy with the fact that Mr van der Walt had – and he said it actually veryclearly – he had other business interests outside of the firm which didn’t agree with them as partners, and they only learnt for example when he was transferring some of the properties to then use the law firm, even though the relationship was not – so they had a problem with that and the problem arises from questions asked by the media, that is why they are asking that question.But the second issue, the second point he makes which is very important, when I ...[indistinct] Chair in the way that I like the – Andre Wagner ’s affidavit Mr Soni.   Heis basically saying that in Precise Trade Mr van der Walt, Mr van der Walt had other partners or investors into that business, okay.  The allegation Chair that say no these are Montana’s properties, I have confirmed in black and white, I played a part in us identifying those opportunity, it doesnot make those my properties.  The properties that are my properties are registered in my name.For example if you look at the property in Hurlingham registered in my name, the bulk of the money didn’t even come from me Chair, because I had to find an investor and that is why Mr Louis Green in his testimony here, he said something very important, and I think you and Mr Soni ...[indistinct] but he made a fundamental point which I want to raise and I was so happy because I think it was courageous Chair, you tried to probe this thing and hemade an important – it is not unusual, he made that point Chair, it is not unusual that Montana can arrive, identify a property and when we register, because it has to do with where the money is and how do you find the money, in Pedi say Chair these people who didn’t investigate because they were targeting me [speaking in vernacular] so they just Chair wanted to make sure that no he is guilty as charged and not looking at the details.Now Chair one of the two things the ...[indistinct] of State Capture you know I love them Chair these people,they say you must follow the money.  Chair but Mr Oellermann said he went to the property in Sandhurst and it seems there are people there, after hearing that he called and said who lives there, and the property had been rented out to somebody by Mr van der Walt, okay.  Themost next logical step is that this rental income where does it go to, because it will tell you who is the real owner of the property.  They don’t do that, they jump that point, okay, they jump that point Chair because it doesn’t assist what they are trying to get to, that he is guilty as charged.If you look at it Chair going back to the Rose Waterkloof, Waterkloof property.  Then she was angry and she says terminate this relationship.   Ms de Beer when I think there was a guy, if I remember very well, his name was Daniel, the agent, Daniel went back to her and said nohe went, he took my offer, not Riaan’s offer, my offer, I say no look let me put an offer and I go to the bank, the bank sent a team for valuation they say no that property, but of course the bank was wrong, she was right to be angry, not of course she shouldn’t have been angry with me, but with the bank because the bank they were looking at this building, but they were not looking at the income generation in that particular building so they undervalued the property.  She was angry because the time share that I first made contact with her, and we agreed with Riaan and isaid no let’s find a way, let’s get money for me to get the bank’s amount or rather valuation, and get an additional R3.5, and I said to Riaan will you then lend me the R3.5 so I can then say to the bank don’t give me for R11million, just give me for R7million in line with your valuation andthen I will put the additional money in there Chair.Of course  I realised it will not work, I think the bank did not have an appetite for that, and then that is why we said look this presents a lot of opportunities, it’s in Waterkloof, Embassies are keen on doing that, and it has got business rights already, that is what it is.Now Ms de Beer as I said Chair she talks about in her affidavit very small things, she doesn’t know the relationship between Lucky Montana and Mr Riaan van der Walt.  She doesn’t know how these things are funded, so Iam surprised that the Commission would bring Ms de Beer here who actually doesn’t add value to this Commission and leave out Mr Andre Wagener, I know Chair you have explained the thing, I am not opening that, I am just simply saying that she doesn’t know Chair, yet she talks about something she doesn’t know, she doesn’t know – she knows nothing bout the matter, how the nature of the relationship with Riaan and that is why Riaan then said no I will deal with that and I will raise money and I will take it under Precise Trade so that that opportunity is not lostChair.That is the most important thing, that is how we are involved in business we do Chair, strategy, very strategic from where it is in Waterkloof, and Chair when the first people to break that house, to start the work Riaan askedme and I went to fetch people from Mamelodi and say no break this property.  So the things the details that are defined are detailed there.  They are true, but they are not telling the Commission the story because she doesn’t know, she is incapable of doing that and that is why when people beat up drums, they want to fetch the keys and everything but how is the property financed, because that is what it tells us.  If you say Santez, yes Chair even the Santez property I was playing a major role, so I don’t – whatever they say doesn’t tell the Commission anything, itis a story what you must tell, tell us about the money, you will actually see that Montana is not involved in that, you can actually see from my first annexure I say Riaan is – he came here, and we met I say 1.3, I say no, no but if we calculate in fact I should be getting ...[indistinct] because partners do that all the time Chair.If you look at Hurlingham property they issued Chair – what is it called – Midtown Brace.  Riaan was not involved except that Chair as a lawyer we asked him to put a deal for us, for me and Mr Andre Wagner.   I put, I askedhim to put the money there for me, Mr Wagner brought in the other money, the other difference was money for development Chair.Now the development didn’t happen and it didn’t happen because then I couldn’t bring the other R9.5millionfor development, the R10million that I spoke about from FNB that I said that I went to apply and they told me they are politically exposed, they are not going to consider extending any facility to you.  It is FNB.  I thought I would go in because the lady who was – as I explained earlier, who did my properties at ABSA from Tygervalley in Cape Town she had moved here and she told me I said I want to do business with you, that is the property that I went first to her.   I actually asked her from the bank can you give me my application so that I can attach it here,unfortunately they said no, we didn’t – it was declined, one credit didn’t accept it we are not keeping those documents because we are not having in that respect.They took  me to court Chair and you will see the letters I have attached, there has been to and fro, until they issued summonses against me, Midtown Brace.  ...[Indistinct] we then agreed in response to let’s sell the property and that you get what you get and I get something out of that because we both put money into this property.We then took the – and that is why Chair you willsee one of the things I touch is what you call the Power of Attorney, I then had to sign a Power of Attorney to Midtown Brace so that they run an auction, they ran an auction Chair and the prices were ridiculous and you will see there we said no let’s not even accept it, okay.Now my document Chair confirm the affidavit of Mr Andre Wagner, he is directly involved, he put his own money into this thing so he knows the story, but when you compare to Ms de Beer I think Chair she wanted to – I was irritated with her, not angry, irritated, because, and you could see that she wanted to talk about what car Mr Montana drove and everything to convey a picture of a corrupt man, okay, what I came out there, she is not focusing on the issue that I want to buy a property because we want to do business there Chair, so her affidavit we cango, my view is that I am not even denying anything, there is nothing to define, to defer, to deny, the affidavit tells the Commission nothing about the nature of the deal, it says I saw Mr Montana, he was wearing this, this, he was driving this car, but Ms de Beer only saw me Chair towards the end, after all of those things and that she can see Chair with the partner to Mr Riaan van der Walt.  It is basically telling this Commission that in fact Precise was Riaan was the sole owner and director.  In all these dealings it had investors, which meanspeople that he was borrowing money from to finance all the different – and that is why Chair I think from the information I picked up ...[indistinct] the liquidation of Swifambo, the liquidators of Swifambo here, let’s get the liquidators there and see who did they speak to as thepeople who lend money there, you will actually be surprised Chair, these are not the people that are mentioned in the newspapers, because people know they are not interested in the truth Chair, so the long and short of it Chair when you talk about Ms de Beer she was – I don’t know whether, I think at that time Chair she has been probably told and primed on what to say or it was just an absolute show of racism, I am not saying but perhaps Chair, fascinated by this black man who wants to buy a property of R11million, who is driving this kind of a car andall of those things.Chair there is nothing, there was nothing unlawful or irregular and people are taking this thing too far, because they are trying to say Riaan – if Riaan was the owner or shareholder of Siyangena I would understand, he is there, he has got nothing to do with ...[indistinct – dropping voice], his mentors was now if the – the allegation was that no and as I think Mr Oellermann in fact said it during his testimony, he said Chair the owners from which these properties were bought had an understandingthat the properties were bought by Mr Montana, there was a plan to all of those things, but the fact that I ultimately didn’t buy the property tells you there is a story, so I was not using Riaan to buy properties.Then if the property is owned by Precise are myproperties what is the status of the lenders to Precise or to Riaan, I don’t even know them Chair, I was saying – I saw their names for the first time when this affidavit was deposed there.   Would they take a risk of putting money into Precise to somebody that they don’t know, and I think Chair that you can see that what Ms de Beer was saying, of course it is up to the Commission to evaluate evidence, but did he tell you about the nature of Mr Montana’s property dealings, no she can only describe certain parts when shesaw me and to want to present, so what does it matter that I am wearing a pink shirt, tell us to say no I think if you believe that Mr Montana is involved in corrupt activities and is buying properties.   She doesn’t say Chair I mean from 2016 I have been very clear, I have worked with Riaan, he is a good businessman Chair.        Chair let me make the last one with regard to ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]    Because that is also attached.     Or rather two short points Chair, because I want to finish with the financials here.    No, no, no Chair I am more than happy.   I will stay at this Commission for as long as you want me to answer these questions, if the Commission get other information and say Montana tomorrow wake up and come here I will be here.     I will be here Chair.     That I give you my assurance, because I have got nothing to hide Chair.   Chair Mr ...[intervenes]      Two points.    Yes, no I want to make one and then deal with the bank statements.     Mr Louis Green, I think Chair the – Mr Louis Green, Mr Andre Wagner they are their statements and I think that they are good.  Because Mr Louis Green said you are asking a specific question and he said when you ask him why did he – when Riaan Van Der Walt wrotean email and said do not get involved there – do not copy Mr Montana and Mr Van Der Walt Chair and rather Mr Louis Green unlike Ms De Beer she says look Mr Montana came, he was coming to look at the property.      Yes that email Chair that is correct.    Indeed Chair.    He then mentioned that amount and my understanding …   That is what I am referring to Chair    Now you have seen that loan – in that Chair he is referring to R1.3 now there is an issue about the relationship between the numbers that are mentioned here.You remember here Chair we are dealing with two things.  We are not dealing with money that came to me.  We are dealing with – it is quite clear to me that what Van Der – Mr Van Der Walt was doing with all the people who he was involved with he was – it was like some kind of a rotating fund which he gives to Montana here, he gives to Zondo – he got Zondo to pay this and all of those things.His notes say that and I have confirmed that with him Chair.  Now I have asked that can we deal with Montana’s – what is it called – statement especially the flowof money between Precise Trade and Montana.  What I have been presented here Chair we are dealing with what Robert deals with the relationship in respect.  He does not deal with Precise Trade.    Okay.    I have…    Yes Chair.    But the bigger issue I am saying.    We are dealing with Mr Riaan’s account.    Not my account.    Now – now the only thing I can do.    And that is why I said earlier on to Mr Soni.    A three way match is going to be very important.   We are starting to do – I am supposed to confirm statements which have – have even a whole range of other transactions.    So I can only note Chair – I can only note and that is why I am asking the commission.    Let us ask ABSA to give us my statement for the period then we can compare Chair because – andyou can see Chair you have got a statement that says Montana.    And then below it says R400 – it says TLM.  So if somebody is using Montana as his reference whywould he use TLM – and I thought I am the only one Chair but who uses the reference TLM to just to cover it.    And you can see even in how I have marked my documents.  So Chair in real times I can note but I cannot assist the commission specifically on those.  The only person who can assist that commission is not even Robert it is Mr Van Der Walt.    Because he can say tell us what the – whatdo you mean there?  The – or else all of us are left in the realm of – of what is it called – speculation.  And Chair I can only note them.    But I cannot – I cannot.    Unless if the commission says in your bank statement Mr Montana.    We see R400 000.00   It came from there can you confirm that?    Now then we are happy.  But I am being asked about somebody and this can you see Chair the upsand downs in that account.    It is not my account.    He is the one – he – they say he gave – he has written notes.    And I see for example Chair that when PRASA went to court one of the things they were trying to see they were trying to take the notes and said these notesmeans the money came from TLM and I asked Riaan did they come from TLM – he says no.  It tells me how I am using the money to that.   And Chair when I looked at the affidavit of Siyangena by the way including the affidavit that I think has been read – I am referring to the affidavit that has been read earlier by the CFO.  That – they are very clear in that – in that thing that they are not even involved. They have never even transferred a cent from Siyangena to – what is it called – to Precise Trade. They say we do not have a relationship with Precise Trade.  So – so Chair you can see that I am being asked about things – ask me about my relationship with how we bought these properties with Riaan Van Der Walt.  They are properties that I bought for development.  There areproperties that we bought and we had the bigger picture about what we wanted to develop and Chair so these are.    So I cannot answer – people speculating or drawing inferences from somebody else’ statement Chair.    Chair can I say.    Can I say something?  I do not think we are far apart Chair.   I think – I think we are in agreement.    Remember when I came to – in the morning when I came here Chair I wanted to demonstrate onefundamental thing.  The story that Siyangena or Van Der Walt bought properties from me is false.  And Chair I went through each properties and showed how much money I have.  That is the first thing I wanted to say.Secondly Chair I am confirming – I also confirmed to the commission Mr Soni that myself and Riaan had – were partners so I am not saying Chair that I am denying even the fact that I may – I may have said transferred R100 000.000 to pay somebody or – that is not what I am saying.   I am simply saying Chair you are putting me in a difficulty because you are not dealing with my statements.    You are dealing with a statement of somebody involved – where I say for example I said on the 2.2 million that Mr Van Der Walt paid.  I said I think – I said that – I think he may have been either settling the bond.    Facility or he may have been paying the property note – for the property note in order to – on my behalf.  That I accept Chair.    But I am saying the difficulty I have is thatwe are going to see R300 million he does not want to say it is Montana he say this is his reference.  And another one says TLM.  It is not my – I do not know because I did not know how Riaan for example was mobilising his own money to be involved with me and even other people Chair that is the issue.  And so – and so I am saying that it is becoming unfair but I think …    I think to be fair to the commission.    Let us go through that process Chair.    And if I do not know (speaking in vernacular). But if the commission cannot hold that against me and say because if the commission wants to hold it against me they say now Mr Montana here is your statements Chair.    Riaan and I had a relationship it involved money – it involved properties Chair.   But this had nothing to do – the issue here is that I said – they said in this report and many other allegations Montana did not even have a cent they – we bought the – Siyangena bought properties for him Chair.   And that is my – I am here to talk about that Chair.    And to demonstrate that it is so false.    It does not have 00   Now finally on this     On these statements Chair I think Mr Soni should take me through.    But he cannot expect me to know another man’s account Chair.   No, no Chair I am more than happy.    I think let us do that ja thank you.    Well Chair I was willing to go until ten.    They say the minute – the meeting with the President until two am.  So I am – no Chair it is fine I think I will – I will be here tomorrow that is fine Chair.    Are you starting with me or with the PRASA people and then I come afternoon Chair?    Thank you Chair.    That is in respect of properties Chair.    No Chair I am happy with that except that they kept on reminding the team.    Tomorrow it will be my sixth day Chair here.    And in all of them I have been responding to allegations made.    Against me.    And I have been asking the team when will I have the time to tall my own story.    Because I have been replying Chair – I have been responding.    So as long as the commission takes that – keeps that at the back of its mind.    I have to tell my own story and my affidavit Chair I am more than happy.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We are ready, Chairperson.    As you please.       It seems as if the annexures are not here at the moment but Mr Montana will make them available ...[intervenes]      ...at lunchtime or ...[intervenes]      Mr Montana ...[intervenes]      As you please, Chairperson.     It is ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.       Chairperson, I was just going to make a suggestion that it would be SS-18(b) because it is a response to Mr Oellermann’s ...[intervenes]     We can make it small letter B, Chair.     As you please, Chair.    As you please, Chair.     Mr Montana …[intervenes]     As you please, Chairperson.     Yes.     Chairperson, I am placing on record I am only going on the properties we have investigated.    Now, Mr Montana, in the first paragraph of the statement you read this morning, that is     I just want to – can I …[intervenes]     Well, let me – you did not only  say I said it, you said Mr Oellermann said it as well.     Mr Montana, I do not want us to go to and fro, I did not interrupt you.  I am going to ask you aquestion.  I would like you to please look at paragraph 4 of Mr Oellermann’s report which is bundle, H, SS18 and page 4 and I will just read the relevant parts of that paragraph,     Oh, sorry, Chairperson, it is a different page, yes.     It is page 4, Chairperson.     Bundle H.     Page 4, Chairperson.     Yes.  I just want to set the record straight on something.     We need not have a debate, if there is something, it will come up ...[intervenes]      But this is what Mr Oellermann saysbetween August 2014 and August – October 2014 Mr Montana was involved in arrangements for the purpose of three properties for a total of more than R36million.   Nowhere in his report, and you have made that allegation previously, I looked at the report over and over again, thatallegation that you purchased properties of over R36million within a year is not contained in his report, I’m putting that to you, Mr Montana.     Okay, Mr Montana, you’re going to come back some time.  I’m going to challenge you now,and I’m challenging you publicly and officially, I want you to show the Chairperson, on a different occasion, when you come back where that is contained in his report.     No, Mr Montana I want to also say this to you, the purpose of asking you questions about these matters is to give you an opportunity to respond toallegations that are contained in documents and so on.  Now, you either meet those allegations head-on or you avoid them.  If you refuse to meet them head-on, at the end I will argue to the Chairperson that those allegations stand unanswered because you have not met them head-on.  I’m only making you aware of the approach I am going to adopt…[intervenes].     Yes.     You must face the Chair, please.     Five to, Chairperson before we adjourn.  You perhaps, put it a bit more eloquently as to what my duty is to Mr Montana.  It was never meant as a threat, you would not allow me to threaten a witness.     And I would not threaten a witness but at the end of the day, Chairperson, we have a limitedtime available.     And if, for example – and I mean that’s all I was trying to do, is to say to Mr Montana I’m going to refer you to certain documents and you must explain what those documents mean to you and I will tell you what I believe they mean and that’s the whole purpose of this.     And to the extent, Mr Montana thinksI’ve already made up my mind.  I would not ask Mr Montana questions if I’d already made up my mind because the idea is to get his version, so that you can look at it.  It’s not me who’s going to look at it, it’s you.     As you please.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay.  Then 2.2.4.  Sorry, have wedealt with 2.2.3?     That is the 18 t h of July, the R 350 000,00.     And then you will see on the 24 t h of July, he says R 400 000,00 and he – there is a withdrawal of R 200 000,00 and it is marked TLM.  Those are your initials.  Is that correct?     [laughs]     Well, he – what we need to look at Chairperson is two things.     What – he says ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]    R 400 000,00.     On the 24 t h of July.     And then on the 24 t h of July, there is a withdrawal of R 400 000,00.     Chairperson, let me just say.  I know nothing about – there are two things ...[intervenes]      ...and I think I need to set the record straight.  Mr Montana says the investigators.  I think hemust make a distinction the Commission’s investigators and the investigators who conducted the investigation at PRASA.       This is in fairness to the Commission.  That is the first thing, I think, when he is talking about investigations and investigators.     But the second thing is, Chairperson.  We did not get anything from Werksmans.  We got - all theinformation contained in here, tells you what the source is.  The source is the Siyangena affidavit and – well, PRASA’s affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...in the Siyangena matter andSiyangena’s response.     We did not get anything from Werksmans.  So to the extent that Mr Montana thinks we may have left out things, give him the assurance that everything that was given to us of relevance was included but we did not have any dealings with Werksmans and we could not, for one reasons, Chairperson.  Complaints had been made against Werksmans.     Chairperson, sorry.     There seems to be a technicalproblem and I have been asked if we can have five minutes for them to attend to it.     Mr Montana is not me.      I just want everything to be recorded.     As you please.     They have, Chair.     As you please, Chair.  Sorry, Mr Montana.  You were saying something?     Chairperson, we can ask.  I –perhaps I should clear something up with ...[intervenes]      Mr Montana, can I ask you?  When your relationship with Mr Van der Walt start?     Mr Montana, it has been raised and I now need to raise it with you directly.  I said to you amongthe documents that we relied on were documents filed in the Siyangena application.  Now in the – in Siyangena’s answering affidavit to the matters raised by mister – by PRASA.     One of the issues they raised was your property – your relationship with Mr Van der Walt.  Is that correct?     Now in response to that, the person who filed the affidavit for Siyangena is their CFO, Mr Dubek.  Do you know him?     Of ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Now he filed an affidavit and I just want to read something to you and tell me whether you agree with it or not because it may just clear everything up on this issue and I am not dealing with the other issues.     He says at paragraph 176 of the     But is it also correct – sorry, Chairperson.     Is it also correct that it was Mr Ferreira who introduced you to Mr Van der Walt? Because that is the allegation that is made by Mr Dubek.     Mr Montana, if I could now roundup that issue.  You filed an affidavit in the Siyangena matter which was not used by the court.  We have been through that.  I see you shake your head.  That means yes.    Now in that affidavit, do you deal with all these matters, your dealing with Mr Van der Walt, how you came to know Mr Van der Walt, your communications with him, and all your dealings with him including any written agreements you had with him?     Alright.  So can I make the suggestion then, and I make it through you Chair this.  Is to say, let us look at that affidavit.  That will tell us the ambit of the further investigation we need to...     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Let us do that, Chairperson, so that at least we know ...[intervenes]      ...we have got the annexures relating to the properties ...[intervenes]      ...that Mr Montana has referred to.     And we have got that affidavit and then we know that almost everything in relation to properties ...[intervenes]      ...is in our possession.     And whether it is part of the overall affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...it is irrelevant.  We just look at ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, can I make the suggestion?     We are partly finished with the – withParkwood.     And can we make a decision after that as to ...[intervenes]      ...when we should, unless you want to decide ...[intervenes]      As it please ...[intervenes]     Well, how long will it ...[intervenes]      As you please.     Yes.     As you please, Chairperson.  Chairperson, in light of your suggestion, Mr Montana has now brought the annexures to the document that we dealt with this morning, that SS18B.     There are about 15 or 20 of them.     Yes, they are all – but, for example, what we will first do is one appearing 165, it is a, b, c, d, e, f, g.    They are marked.     So that difficulty is out now.     Yes.     As you please, Chairperson.  We willhand this to you and then we will make copies.  We do not have copies obviously.     No.     Yes.     Once we have looked at them.     In due course, yes.    Let me say in our part of the record.     No.     As you please to, yes.     Yes.     Because the other issue, and we will do that in a moment but I just wanted to get through the formalities.  The other issue you will remember is the Siyangena, Mr Montana’s affidavit.     It is a big document with manyannexures, so it is this file.     Yes.     Absolutely, yes.  Chairperson, you will see in SS18B that paragraph 1470 on page 312 at the bottom there is a reference to annexure TLM160.     Perhaps I should give this pile to Mr Montana.     And we can hand them up one byone, Chair.     Yes.     As you please.     Then, Chairperson, at the bottom of page 314 and paragraph 1480 there is a reference to TLM161.     And that will be 18B2.     There is a reference TLM162.  Mr Montana, you are handing that up now, 162.    That will be SS18B3, Chairperson.     And for the record, Mr Montana, you confirm that the letter on the record is incomplete, it is justfor …[intervenes]     And then on the very next paragraph on the same page, paragraph 1483, there is a reference toTLM163.     This is an email.     Will you hand that in?     That is an email calculating the payments to the bank, Chair.     SS18B4, Chair.     As you please.     The next one, Chairperson, on the next page at paragraph 1486 and that is annexure TLM4, is a letter from ABSA and you are handing that up as TLM164, Mr Montana and Chairperson that should be admitted as SS18B5.    Are those the – all the annexures now?     Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.     Yes.     Yes, sorry.     There, Mr Montana, you are handing up a joint venture agreement between Midtownbrace and I take it to yourself as TLM165 (a) to (h)     So you are handing that up as TLM165 (a) to (h), Mr Montana?  That is correct, is it not?     Chairperson, if this page can be admitted as SS18B6.     That concludes the …[intervenes]     Yes.     As you please.     Yes.     Yes, [indistinct – dropping voice]     The affidavit is around 49 pages.    Yes.     [indistinct – dropping voice]     Chairperson as I understand it, and it may have been a miscalculation on our part, we indicated to Ms Ngoye and Mr Holele based on what had happened just before lunch, that we would be busy with Mr Montana for the rest of today and in a sense we have released them...[intervenes]      From their commitment today.     Yes.     Chairperson may I ask, and I am asking this in -  during the part-hearing, from Mr Montana’s evidence today what he read out this morning it does not appear when one looks at the map – the documents I want to show him, for example when one looks at the payments that Mr van der Walt refers to, there doesn’t seem to be much dispute about that.If I could just – and I am saying this for Mr Montana’s benefit, but also for your guidance, and asking for your guidance, if Mr Montana can look at the  ...[intervenes]      The, the, well all the ...[intervenes]      For example if I could just say with regard to the Waterkloof Property, Ms Sally de Beer has an affidavit which is annexed, if he can just tell us which parts of the affidavit he disagrees with, so it will expedite thehearing itself.     And for example there were an extent in regard to the Sandhurst property, there was an exchange of emails between him and the ...[indistinct] which is referred to, and there are agreements in regard to thoseproperties which concerned Mr Montana or his trust but which then fell by the wayside and were effectively taken over by Precise Trade.All that we want from Mr Montana is yes this happened, Precise Trade took over because of thesereasons, that is if he agrees with what is contained in the annexure.     It would certainly save time and we can move on. 
MONTANA:I have also filed an affidavit ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONIC SC:   But all the annexures to Mr Oellermann’s affidavit, he needn’t – his report needn’t concern himself with the report. 
ADV VAS SONI:   So I don’t have to put each of the matters to him.
