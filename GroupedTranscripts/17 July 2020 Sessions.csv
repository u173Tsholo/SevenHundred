CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    I see that you seem to be optimistic that it is not going to be so cold.    Today.    Okay alright.  Let us continue.    Yes.  But Ms Hofmeyr makes it clear to you that she understands the part about it not being a requirement and maybe – and maybe one should say a requirement falling under a certain category maybe.  But she is saying or at least part of what I think she is saying is as amatter of fact you have Nkonki who had been doing that and if I am not mistaken you said yourself yesterday and – but you must tell me if I misunderstood it is a good practice to do that.  And I think her – her real enquiry is since it is a good practice to do this since another firm was doing it why did you not do it?  Ms Hofmeyr you – is that part of what you are looking for?    Yes.   Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes, actually I think that was the last – last point she was asking.    To say but if it is in that Evidence Gathering document.    Oh activity it – it says you are supposed to do it.   It might not be seen as maybe an essential requirement but you are expected to do it.    But when you say it was not in the file you are not suggesting that at that time that was not one of the steps in terms of which in terms of the firm’s policy you were supposed to take.  You are not saying that it was introduced after.  You are not saying that or are you – that step?    Okay. That step of media gathering.  I am saying – I am asking whether you mean that at that time when you did this audit you mean that this step had not been introduced by PwC as – as part of what you would do.    Is that what you are saying?   Yes when was it introduced – this media step?    But when was it – when was it added?    Had it been – had it been added already at the time you were doing this audit?    Was it added afterwards?    Yes okay.  I am trying to get us to a point where we are on the same place.  So that is why I was now using the word – the verb, added because that is the verb you used.  Now I am going to use took.  Now when did you as a team take this decision to have this step as an extra step?  When was that?   Yes.    So at the time when you were doing the audit in 2015 or for the 2015/2016 financial year was it there?  Had you taken the step to add this extra step?    Okay alright.      No, no, no.      Okay let – let us put this.  The step is media gathering if we give it an acronym, is that right?    Ja.  Ja news gathering through the media.    Ja.  That is the step.    So did you do that in the 20 – or the 15/2016 financial year?    You did?    2015/2016 financial year?    Okay.    Hm.    Is it 132 point 21.1?    Yes.    Okay.    But the question is a different one as I understand it.    Oh okay.  Alright.    I am sorry.    Please you will just have to raise your voice.     I have asked them to switch off the air conditioner so that one – I will see whether we will be as cold as we were yesterday and two hopefully, I can hear you better.  Please just repeat the points you were making andraise your voice.    How easy would it have been for your team to come across this article if they had done the gathering ofinformation from media articles?  Would there have been – is there any – big chance that you might not have come across it, do you know?    Having its – bearing in mind its source who published it and so on?    You might wish to take that further Ms Hofmeyr.    But – and you may have been intending to anyway.   But it is also important to see what the chances are that they would have missed it if they had done this exercise.    Did your team or would your team have taken notes of how Nkonki had done this before – in the year before and maybe checking the sources that they had used or would that not be something that your team would have checked?  I am just thinking that if somebody else has been doing a job the previous year and you come in you might wish to see how they went about things and if you came across the fact that they have also used – they gathered information from the media you might look at the sources that they were using – you know looking at all the main newspapers or TV or whatever and then saying, well are we going to do the same, look at the same sources or we choose some of the sources?  Or you might see that forexample maybe Business Day appeared to have been very helpful to your predecessors and therefore you might wish to – to ensure that Business Day or the Star is one of those that you look at?    Hm;    Ms Hofmeyr.    I do not think you mentioned the year or after April and the 31s t.   And I think you said after March 2020 instead of 2021.  If we are looking at the same ...[intervenes]     Ms Hofmeyr.    You might confuse the reader of the transcript in due course.  You have now been referring to the bundle as 19C.  [laughs]     Yes, but what I am saying is.  I think it is more accurate if you say exhibit rather than bundle ...[intervenes]     ...because ...[intervenes]    ...when you say bundle, people will look on the spine.    Ja.    Ja.    H’m.   I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.    I may have missed something.  Is this... does this come from PwC report?   Oh, okay.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Would it be correct to say, had it been available much earlier, there is no way you would have missed it?   Ja, my logic says to me.  If your External Auditors to an entity, it is to be expected but I could be quite wrong.  It could be expected that you would look at whatever the Internal Auditors have been doing.  See what they can give you.  What they have picked up.  Obviously, assess if they have, you know, picked up everything that should be picked up.  Still do your job independently but it could assist.  If you ignore what they have done, could miss something quite important.    Ja.    Is an important step?    Ja, okay.    Just to see if one can look what appears to be a difference in approach between yourself and Ms Hofmeyr.  Are you saying from an auditor’s point of view a liability, which Ms Hofmeyr is talking about and the commitment which you are talking about.You are saying you cannot talk about an irregular expenditure from an auditor’s point of view or as you understand it the position unclear or there has been... until there has been payment, until there has been expenditure on that commitment or that liability.  Is that what you aresaying?    Because there has been no expenditure as yet.    Yes, okay.    Yes, I have got it too.    Well, what do you say to the suggestion by Ms Hofmeyr that whoever would read the audit report would therefore be mislead by that?  What do you say to that?    H’m.    H’m.    Yes, let us do that.  We will take the tea adjournment now.  Shall we resume at twenty-five-past which is fifteen minutes?    Or just how...?    Maybe half-past so that ...[intervenes]       Ja. Yes, okay.  Alright.  We will take the tea adjournment and resume at half-past eleven.  We adjourn.    Okay, alright, thank you.  Let us proceed.     But I see on this file it says 23 and then on the first page inside it says 3.     It says EXHIBIT DD20C on the inside but outside it is 20D.     The first page is 1296.     It is not the correct one?     1804?     1804 are the two emails.     Is that the correct one?     So it is the correct bundle but there might be …[intervenes]     Ja.     Okay.     Well, the question is, do you dispute the – what Mr Sokombela is placing on record here?     Well, maybe Ms Hofmeyr you want to take him point by point factually?     Okay, let us go straight to the point.  Mr Sokombela seems to be saying here or seems to be suggesting that PwC did not do their job in regard to certain matters and in regard to this particular one.  Is that your understanding of what he is saying as well?     Or did not do it properly?     Ja, you can have a look at it to satisfyyourself because you need to reflect before you say you agree with my understanding or you do not agree.     Yes.     No, no, no, I do not think anybody is saying you did not do any work, as such.     Nobody is saying that.  In regard to this particular task that he is talking about under Share Trust,    Okay, I am sorry, I did not hear that?     Yes, but in terms of what he says here.     Apart from what may be happening in practice, in terms of what he says here, it seems to me that he is saying whether it is because of how little work was that you did or whether it is because of the quality, maybe poor quality of the work, whatever reason, he concludes that I cannot rely on this work.  That is my understanding of what he says.     You agreed to that.     Ja, okay.     No, no, that is fine but I may have heard what Ms Hofmeyr heard at some stage, I thought you said earlier in effect that, you see, the AG’s office, when it comes to auditing public enterprises they are the experts or they have the required expertise, they are the experts and my understanding of what you were saying was thatyou were suggesting that look, you should not be surprised if when the AG’s office comes in they identify certain things that we might not have identified.  Maybe that it not what you intended but that was my understanding.  I thought that you sought to say, you know, those people do – or audit public enterprises all the time, they are experts so we are not surprised if they see certain things where we might not have done things as well as they would have done.  That was my impression but this is the opportunity for you to clarify if that was not what you intended to say.    Yes.     Yes, so whatever expertise the AG’s office may have you are not suggesting that when you, as PwC, come in and do an audit of a public enterprise on behalf of the AG’s office you are not suggesting that youare not able as PwC to perform to the same standards.  That is not what you are saying.     Ja.       No, I think that is helpful because I was going to say PwC is a very big, you know, auditing firm and one would not expect that in terms of the quality of its work that it would not be able to – it should not be judged onany standard that any auditing firm or even the AG’s office could be judged on.  Okay, Ms Hofmeyr, I may or may not have helped.     Well, you see, Mr Mothibe, this is quitean important part of the Commission’s investigation, the role of auditors in the different SOEs that the Commission has been focusing on.  Indeed, we may also be looking at the role of lawyers as well.  Now with regard to auditors, when I heard evidence about what had been happening at SAA – was it earlier this year or last year?     I can tell you, Mr Mothibe, that one of the questions that came to my mind and, I probably articulated it at the hearing, was that when I was told that I think from 2011 or is it 2010?  2011, 2012 financial year for SAA up to I think 2016 that throughout that that period the auditors who were doing the work gave SAA a clean bill of health.  I said but how could it be in the light of what I was hearing?  How is it possible that year in, year out for four years, five years auditors could not find anything wrong when on what I am hearing there were serious irregularities that were happening, how is it possible that they did not pick these things up?  So I am just giving you my reaction at the time.  I am not an auditor.       I am not an auditor but I just want to sayif you feel that PwC during those years that it was auditing SAA that we are looking at did a good job or that whatever it did does not deserve criticism, feel free to defend it, this is your opportunity to do so.  It may be that some of the things that someone like me who is not an auditor is surprised by are things that I am surprised by because I am not an auditor.If I was an auditor maybe I would understand better but it is important that you make sure that these things are explained if they are explicable in a proper way, but as I sit here what is in my mind is still the question that I asked earlier this year or last year to say how was it possible that for four years or more auditors could not pick up at least some of these things because I do understand that auditors work on the basis of samples and so on, so I am just givingyou this picture so that you just reflect properly on what you – how you – what  you will defend, what you will not defend with an understanding of where I am coming from which might or might not be the same perspective that Ms Hofmeyr has.     I think you could continue to answer the questions that Ms Hofmeyr can put to you but if, in response to the remarks I’ve made, there’s something you want to say, feel free to say it.  If you say you’ll wait forthe question, that’s fine.     I mean, I’m not sure if that answered the question.     So maybe you might have to repeat.  Just listen carefully to the question Mr Mothibe.    You realised that, that’s an area where you fell short?      Isn’t that leg a very important leg?     Yes, but the way you testify around it, and I think that has been the case in regard to other areas where you acknowledged that you fell short, one gets the impression that you are trying to give the impression thatwhere you fell short in relation to something important, you say – you emphasise, we did the work, where we failed or we fell short is reporting that, as I understand it and I think you concede that reporting is very important isn’t it, it is part of your job and it’s very important is it not?    Yes.        Yes, you didn’t intend to say, it’s not important.    Yes okay.      Ja okay.     Before you do that…[intervenes].     Before we take this off ja.     Okay let’s go back Mr Mothibe to page 1826, that’s the last page you were looking at I think – oh you have put it away, ja let’s go back page 1826, that’s the minutes of the meeting between yourselves and the AG.     Yes, now that sentence that Ms Hofmeyr read to you earlier on in the middle of the page, the previous auditors were notified that there’s a huge risk on SCM and SCOPA might need answers from – it must have intended to say there’s a huge risk that, on SCM SCOPA might need answers, I think that is probably how it should read, from the previous auditors on why this matter was not reported in prior years.  That suggests that the non-reporting was not confined to one year, you agree?     Yes, how many years did the non-reporting in regards to this aspect relate to?     Three years yes, so they say there’s a huge risk, that seems to me that they are talking aboutsomething regarded as really very serious in the failure to do work that PwC was supposed to do, is that the same understanding you get from this, at least their perspective?     Yes, yes but after they had said this, I would have thought that you would have taken time to look at this aspect and PwC’s role or failure to report and youwould have made an assessment to see whether there is justification in any criticism of PwC’s work in relation to the failure to report in this regard, did you do that after becoming aware what they were saying, did you reflect and say, really did we – can we be criticised or can we not be criticised on this?     Now you may have taken that view before you heard what the AG was saying but after the AG had said this, did you continue with that position after reflecting or did you not reflect and look at the work againand still to the same position?     But was the view – did you accept, at that stage that you had not, as PwC reported what you should have reported or were you – did you think that you had reported at a factual level.  When the AG said there was this huge risk that SCOPA might need answers from you on why this matter was not reported in prior years, not in one year, in prior years, was your view that, factually, you had not reported or was your view that you had reported and I don’t even know whether it’s a view, I think it’s factual?  Had you reported in prior years on this matter, at least now you accept that you have not reported, I think, you accept but as at the time of this meeting, did youaccept that you had not reported this matter in the prior years? MR     Trying to go back but…[intervenes].     No I understand but that’s why I was saying to you, I would have expected you, when the AG’s office says this about your work, that the least you would do is go back and say, is there something that we havemissed, let us check, did we do our work properly?     But checking whether you had reported this or not would be an easy thing isn’t it, it shouldn’t even take ten minutes, I’d imaging you’d just go to the reports and check or is it more complicated than somebody that’s not an auditor, like me, thinks?  Is it not a matter of getting those audit reports for those years and checking whether you had reported or not?     Yes, but my question is, here the AG is saying there’s a huge risk that SCOPA might need answers from you on why this matter was not reported in prior years, so I’m saying when the AG says that, the first thing sitting in that meeting that should have crossed your mind is, did we not report in the prior years and you’d either know that you did report it or didn’t report or if you didn’tknow you would want to go and check at the earliest opportunity, maybe after the meeting to say, did we report this, because if you did not report, the next thing is, is it something we should have reported and if we – if it is something that we should have reported and we didn’t report, then if we must take responsibility we must take responsibility if we can defend it then we’ll defend it. So my question is, at that stage did you know whether you had reported this during those years or not?     You were aware that you had not reported?     Yes, and at that stage did you think itwas something that you should not have reported?  Ja okay, let me make sure we understand each other.  As I say I’m not an auditor, you are an auditor, as I understand there are certain thingsthat must be reported.     There are certain things that don’t need to be reported.     Now the AG says, here is something that should have been reported in prior years but was not reported, according to the – that’s how I understand this.     You see, what I’m looking at is, whether, when something was pointed out to you at that meeting as I understand it, as needing answers, whether at that stage there was a basis for you to think you did have a properanswer because you said you thought you were satisfied that you had done the job and you could answer, that’s how I understand you but I think you are agreeing, and you must tell me if I misunderstood you, you are agreeing that, as a matter of fact you ought to  have reported in those years but you did not report, you accept that?     Yes but you accept that as of today as you sit there, my next question is whether, at that time when the AG said this, you knew as a matter of fact that you had not reported or you did not know?     And did you think you had an acceptableanswer for not having reported?     And what was that answer?     Well – so is your – was your answer, at that time that you would say, we were not supposed to report during those – to report this matter during those years or was your answer, we accept that we should have reported but we have an explanation why we did not report?     You did not think you should have reported.     Okay, alright, Ms Hofmeyr.     Sorry Ms Hofmeyr maybe for the benefit of the transcribers you can just spell that abbreviation of IRBA for them. Otherwise they’ll write something …[intervenes].     So, is the answer that during the investigation by IRBA you continued to believe that SAA had complied with legislation until the outcome of the IRBA investigation that’s when you were convinced that you should have reported?     Hm.  What is it that the Regulator said that you had not been aware of that made you accept that there had been a failure in a certain respect on PwC’s part?  In other words what was new that they said which you had not thought about that – that made you see things differentlyafter the outcome of their investigation?    You know you said earlier on please Ms Hofmeyr do not forget your line.     You said earlier on and you have emphasised that you identified did you say the non-compliances?    Yes but did you not report that?   And the reason why you did not report them is that you did not think they were material non-compliances?    Is that right?    At that stage?    Ja. Now my logic suggests that if you have identified the non-compliances and you do not report them, we should look at when is a non-compliance material and when is it not material.  How could you have thought that these non-compliances were not material?  Can you deal with that for my benefit?  When is it material – when is it notmaterial?  Why did you take the view at that time that in this case these non-compliances with legislation were not material?    But – but will not – that will not answer the question of what is material and what is not material is it not?    Yes but you cannot use the fact that you spent most of your time focussing on a certain part of thework and not a certain other part of the work as justification for saying, we thought that other part was not material.  That does not seem to be logically to me.  You can use it seems to me your pre-occupation with that other part of the work to say I am sorry I did not get time to do that other work because my focus was on that other.  That I can understand.    Oh okay.  Okay.  No.  But if that is what you meant that is fine but it does not answer my question. My question is, you said you were aware that you did not report but you had taken the view that this was not the non-compliance with legislation that was involved here was not material therefore your non-reporting was justifiable or was acceptable.  That is my understanding of what you are saying and then I said so when is a non-compliance with legislation material and when is it not material?  That was my question.    But what – did you have a proper basis or the view that the non-compliance with legislation was not material?  What was the basis that you had at that time for taking that view?  Had – did you – did you look at the – at the criteria set by the AG and said well this is what it says and you looked at the non-compliances that were involved and said well it does not meet the cusp so it is non-material.  Or did you – that is not what happened?    Can I – Mr Mothibe…    Mr Mothibe.  Can I take it – can I take it that on reflection you are able to say you did not have a proper basis for the view that the non-compliance with legislation was not material?  I am putting this to you because I have asked you a few times that what I am looking for is the basis or the view you took at the time that the non-compliance with legislation was not material.  We have spent some time I do not seem to understand that you are able to give me the basis or that view so my question now is, can I take it that on reflection you are able to say looking back our view did not have a proper basis?  You nod is that yes?    Yes.    Okay thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr.    I am sorry.  I interrupted you when you moving to another file.    Is that where you are going?    Oh okay.   1672.    I am sorry are you suggesting that we take it out of the file?   Oh okay.    Okay. Okay.    Okay.  Okay.  And then which other file must we have?    Yes.    I am sorry.    Before you do that.    Which one is whose report between thetwo?    Yes.    Oh the other one is Auditors Report.    Oh okay.    Oh okay.    Okay.    I think – ja I was going to say move the microphone closer – towards you – yourself.    And – of the two scenarios that Ms Hofmeyr has alluded to from an auditor’s point of view and from the point of you maybe of the users of financial statements and auditor’s reports which one is the worst situation or is the position that either could be worse than the other depending on the circumstances.  In other words, in the one where there are misstatements it might depend onthe nature of the misstatements it could be quite a bad situation.  Or is the position that where you do not get given the information that is actually regarded as the most serious of the crimes so to speak?    In that way?    Ja.    Yes.  Ja but all situations are bad?  Are bad.    Generally speaking.    It is unacceptable.    Yes.    Okay.  No.  But of course, if you do not have the information it means you are – there is incompetence or you might deliberately be concealing information.  You – there is incompetence or negligence in keeping the records properly or you are – you may be deliberately concealing the information from the auditors.    Oh okay.  Oh am I too harsh?    No that is alright – okay.  Ms Hofmeyr.    Now you will have heard from what Ms Hofmeyr said when referring to what Mr Sokombela testified that his evidence included that he thought that the problem was so big that it must have been there in the previous years.  And my question is, was the explanation for PwC not picking up such a big problem for three years?    Ms Hofmeyr.    Yes.    I know we have taken much longer than we both thought but …    I think it has all been important.    Evidence so it was not wasted and I know we still have another witness.    But it seems to me that – it seems to methat we should just take normal lunch for now and come back at two.    And then try and finish with Mr Mothibe and then move onto the next witness ja.    Yes.    Ja.  Ja.  Okay let us take the lunch adjournment we will resume at two.  We adjourn.   Okay, let us continue.    Sorry.  I see the noise of the aircon isback.  Did we say it will come back or did we will decide?    Okay and see how it goes.    Okay let us see how it goes.    I am very aware of the fact that I have a certain benefit [laughs]     ...which other people do not have.  Okay.    Okay.    No, that is fine.  The part... part of the problem is that sometimes it makes noise in such a way that I cannot hear the witness properly but it is not all the time.    So let us see how it goes.    Ja.    [laughs] Okay.  In order to make sure that we do not switch it off. [laughs]     Okay.    I am sorry, Ms Hofmeyr.  I missed that.    You said something and he agreed and I did not get what-what?    That is correct Chair.    Raise your voice.  [laughs]     Well, I am sorry.  Well, I do not want to forget this because I forgot it earlier.  When we look at the auditor general’s report and we look at Mr Sokombela... Is it Sokombela?    Ja, ja.  When we look at his evidence and it transpires that... and we... we look at your own evidencetoday and yesterday where you say during those three years of whatever period that PwC was involved in auditing the SAA, you identified some of the problems.You did not include them in the report but you identified them.  Is there something I have said that you want to correct?    Oh, no.  Okay, alright.  You understand?    Okay, alright.  I would have assumed that if in the first year of your term at SAA, auditing SAA, you picked up certain problems, including the failure by the SAA Management to give your files and whatever other documents and information that were important for you to do a proper job.I would imagine that when you come the following year, you would look back and say, “what problems did we identify last year?  Have they fixed those problems now?  Because if they fix them, then that is fine but if they have not fixed them that might be something to look at quite seriously to say, “but we told management last year that this needs to be fixed.  This here is still not fixed”.And then if in the third year you still have the same thing, you would not fail to see that they have not addressed it and by then it might be difficult to say, “why did you notinclude it in your report because it is persisting year in and year out?”That is what I would like you to comment on.  That is what comes to my mind.  That one would expect that when you come the following year, having done the work the previous years, your starting point would be “what was wrong last year?.  Has it been fixed?  Blah-blah-blah”.    Ms Hofmeyr.    B, yes?    Yes, okay but ...[intervenes]     Oh, okay.    You are not going to come back to this report?    Okay.    You say here... you say B but ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]    ...with A on the spine but it might be the correct one.  [laughs]     Let me see.  It probably is the right file. [laughs]     I have got 30.5.    Ja, okay.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Now just to make sure.  So does that answer mean that you stand by this sentence as is or you are qualifying what is written here?    As is?    Okay, okay.   Now, you did explain the... you begin to explain the difference between the quantum of numbers and the quality of numbers but I do not think I got a full picture.  You made the example about the amounts spent ondrinks and you said if... you said R 2 million or... was spent on things.  The statement that R 2 million was spent on drinks remains valid, okay?  Now would that be the quality of numbers?    That is the quantum?    And the quality?    Oh, that is where quality would...? MR    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  H’m.But if... with reference to procurement.  You do not do enough work for you to state that the entity has been put at the risk of being sued for millions of rands.You do not say that because you did not do enough work to be able to say that, whether it is because files were not given to you or because you were focussing on something else.Then that would go to the quantity of work.  Where would that fit in?    Supply chain.    Yes.    Ja, in regard to supply chain.  That you said [laughs] supply chain a section of the work you were supposed to do.  Did you accept that in regard to that youdid not sufficient work?    Okay.  No, do not go back ...[intervenes]    I think your point is.  We did the work but we did not do the leg relating to reporting.    And that we did not do the leg relating to reporting, does not make the work that we did insufficient.    That is the point you are making.    Ms Hofmeyr.     Now looking back at the years that PIC (sic) was involved in auditing SAA those particular years and looking at the AG’s report and looking at Mr Sokombela’s evidence and remembering what I said, my reaction was to the evidence about SAA namely how could the auditors who preceded the AG during those years, namely Pricewaterhouse and Nkonki, how could they not have picked up all of these serious problems?  As you sit there are you able to say, looking back and knowing what I know now, I accept that we shouldhave picked up those problems and we felt shocked insofar as we did not pick them up, those that we did not pick up or those that we picked up but did not include in the report which we should have included, we accept we fell short in that regard.   Or is your position that maybe my reaction is simply because I am not an auditor and that there is no need to be alarmed at how Pricewaterhouse and Nkonki could not have picked these things up which the AG was able to pick up?  What are you able to say knowing what you know now?     Okay.  No, that is fine.  Unless there is anything, there is nothing?     Mr Mothibe, thank you very much forcoming to give evidence, we appreciate it.  You are now excused.     Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr, you would like about five minutes?     Ten, ja.     Oh, yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.  No, that is fine.     Okay, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes Ms Hofmeyr?     Okay.     That will be together with its annexures, is that right?     Oh, what about the A, B and C that ...[intervenes]      Ja no that is fine.   Mr Mkwanazi’sstatement is it a statement or affidavit?     Okay.  Excuse me – will be admitted and marked as Exhibit MM7, is that right?     Ja, okay.     Before you do that we haven’t done thisbefore other than when we – when I heard evidence from the international experts right at the beginning of the hearings in August 2018, so it is necessary that we don’t confuse the public about what we do and what we don’t do.     I understand that Mr Mkwanazi made a request ...[intervenes]      That his evidence be heard via Zoom or is it Zoom or is it ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay.   I have allowed, I have granted leave to that, I understand and you must just tell me your understanding, I understand that he had concerns about travelling because of Covid-19.    Yes.     Yes, but you indicated that for a long time he has been available and ready to come and...[intervenes]      Yes, so it is the Commission that has not been able to give him the opportunity so I have decided to allow that we – I hear his evidence in this way on condition that at a certain time when maybe the Covid-19 situation has subsided sufficiently he would be able to come before the Commission in person and confirm under oath in front of me the evidence that will have been transcribed by then.     So can I confirm that the recording will be fine, we will get a transcript.     Yes, and he said ...[intervenes]      He is comfortable.     Mr Mkwanazi do you understand all of that?     Yes, okay no thank you very much, and thank you for making yourself  available to give evidence to the Commission.    Oh, okay.   Is he with Mr Mkhwanazi or is he somewhere else?     Okay.     No thank you very much Mr Mkhwanazi.     No thank you very much. ADV     Yes, no, no that is fine, no thank you very much.   I do hope that nothing will happen that we require that we interrupt Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence foranything but if something does arise, we will deal with it at that stage.    I do want to say you mentioned you made reference to Transnet and Mr Mkwanazi the fact that he has tried to obtain some documents, or you have tried to get some documents.   I do know that soon the Commission will be communicating with Mr Mkwanazi with regard to some of the issues at Transnet and there are some documents that the Commission has asked for and obtained from Transnet, so there may be others that you may have wanted and you didn’t get or you did get, but I just thought I must just let you know that I am aware that the Commission will be in communication with Mr Mkwanazi in regard to some of the Transnet issues, and I am happy that his commitment to cooperate with the Commission and to assist theCommission has been reiterated by you as well.Okay, thank you.     Yes thank you.     I must just say that we will have an oath or affirmation administered to Mr Mkwanazi even though at some stage in the future he will take an oath in person here but we will do one today as well.   Thank you very much, I think then if we can have Mr Mkwanazi the witness appearing now on the screen.  Where is the person who is controlling, oh, okay, so it might not be as quick as one thinks.     Okay?     Yes, if you can rise and then either an oath or an affirmation will be administered, I think you can just listen.     Thank you very much, you may be seated.     Yes Ms Armstrong?     Do you want to properly place yourself on record for the first time?     Okay.  Yes, we have already done Mr Mkwanazi’s statement but for any other documents as andwhen you have to refer to them you will have to deal with them at that stage.     Well we said MM7, is that because you intend to make the others MM7B and onwards?     Okay, we will then amend what I said earlier on, Mr Mkwanazi’s statement will be Exhibit MM7A, okay.     Well on a lighter note I don’t know about you Ms Armstrong but I went to the same two universities too     Is this letter an exhibit on its own or is it an attachment?     So you would like it to be admitted as Exhibit MM7D.     Is it dated 16 ...[intervenes]      The letter on Transnet letterhead appearing at page 27 is it a letter or just a note.     It is a statement?     Ja, the statement on Transnet letterhead appearing at page 27 will be admitted as Exhibit MM7D, isthat right?     Ja, okay, that’s fine.        I’m sorry, just to connect this with something else, would it be correct Mr Mkwanazi to say when you became a non-executive director, chairman of the board in 2010, you were coming in together with a new board of Transnet?     Yes okay, thank you.    I’m sorry, the proper title would have been Acting Chief Executive or Acting Group Chief Executive?    But just out of curiosity is the position that whether it is written with an h or without an h it is the same people, so in other words ...[intervenes]      I was about to ask whether it was a Home Affairs error.  Okay, alright.     Well maybe let us say Mr Mkwanazi did you ever meet with the Guptas?     Ja, do you remember how many times you met with them?     Ja, interesting family.     Yes, okay, let’s talk about the times when you met them in their house, in their residence.     Tell us about the first visit to their house, if you visited their house, tell us how it came about and give me as much information about what you discussed with them as possible.    Maybe ..    Okay ja maybe let us deal with that first meeting and finish before we move to the next meeting.    Ms Armstrong.    Before you proceed Ms Armstrong.  You said that Mr Gupta – Tony Gupta said he got your cell phone number from…    From your – your details from Minister Gigaba, is that right?    Is it true that at that time Minister Gigaba was Minister of Public Enterprises?  Under which Transnet fell?Public Enterprises.   And Transnet fell under Public Enterprises Department, is that right?    Yes.  Now had you given Mr Gigaba your cell phone number before?    Tony Gupta.    You had given it to him.   Yes.    You had given him your number.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay alright. And you were speaking to Mr Tony Gupta as far as you know for the first time when he called you on this occasion or you had had some interactions with him before?    Before.  Okay thank you.   Ms Armstrong.    About ten years ago.    Ja.     Okay.     Let us ask you another question.  At this meeting apart from Mr Tony Gupta and Mr Duduzane Zuma and yourself was there anybody else?    Yes.  Okay alright.  You have already told me up to a certain point that you exchanged pleasantries.    Or – general discussion but then Mr TonyGupta then raised the issue of – or said that they were aware of Transnet’s marketing budget, is that correct?    Of R1 billion.  That is what they said, is that right?    Was it factually correct that that was the marketing billion – marketing budget of Transnet at the time?    Oh that is quite interesting because with regard to GCIS I heard evidence last year I think it was or it might have been towards the end of 2018 that from Mr Themba Maseko who was Chief Executive Officer of GCIS at a certain stage that when he met with Ajay Gupta in Saxonwold in 2010 Ajay Gupta told him exactly the correct amount budget that his department namely GCIS had and he was surprised at that.  But I think you are saying that certain what Tony Gupta said was not the correct budget for Transnet?   Okay.  Yes.  Now..    Yes.    I am sorry page 37?    34?    MM34.    You will find that most of the time Mr Mkwanazi we will not mention MM we will just say 34 but we will be meaning MM34.    Yes.    Ja okay.   Yes this would be Exhibit.    The affidavit of Livhumhuwami Tommy Makhode, L-i-v-h-u-m-h-u-w-a-m-i Tommy Makhode, M-a-k-h-o-d-e which appears at page 34 will be admitted and marked as Exhibit MM20 – no.    MM7    E.  Okay thank you.    Yes.   Yes.     Yes.  Ms Armstrong.    On that first meeting do you still have questions?    Before…    Before we move onto the next meeting you– did you say that they said that Mr Zuma who was President at the time used to visit their house once a week?    Almost weekly?    That is what they said.    Yes.  Now in terms of the discussion there you have been using they I think most of the time.    Was it both of them.    Was it both of them speaking namely to …    He never uttered a word?   Well it was Tony Gupta who was talking?    Yes.  Well that is interesting that you say that because I have had quite a few – I have heard evidence from quite a few people who said they had been to meetingswith the Tony – Mr Tony Gupta and Mr Duduzane Zuma at the Gupta residence and most if not all of whom have said during the discussions that they had at such meetings Mr Duduzane Zuma was silent and did not say much.  One of such witnesses was Mr Jonas who said he had a meeting with Duduzane Zuma and of course in his case there was also Mr Hlongwane and on his version that is Mr Jonas’ version there was also a Gupta brother there.  He could not say which one but it would appear that if there was – well actually I think Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane said that on the occasion when they met with Mr Jonas Tony Gupta was the only Gupta brother who was around.  So Mr Jonas said during his meeting with them Mr Duduzane Zuma did not say much.  Mr Dukwana a former MEC from the Free State also gave evidence of a meeting which he said he hadat the Gupta residence with Mr Tony Gupta and Mr Duduzane Zuma.  He too said Mr Duduzane Zuma did not say much in that meeting.  There must – I think there is another third person maybe even fourth who have given evidence along the same lines also that at these meetings Mr Duduzane Zuma would be very quiet and Mr Tony Gupta would be the one doing the talking.  So you are giving evidence to the same effect about Mr Duduzane Zuma.  Is that right?    Yes.  Now one of the things that you have said and you must just confirm in case I did not understand.  Did you say that they and I assume now I must say Mr Tony Gupta because you say Mr Duduzane Zuma was quiet most of the time.    Did you say Mr Tony Gupta said that sometimes when Mr Zuma would be in their house they would ask him to sing Umshini Wami for them, is that what you say he said?    Oh at their functions ja.  Yes.    Yes.  Okay thank you.    We can move then to the second meeting.  Tell me about the second meeting that you had with them?    But tell us who?    Just tell us who Advocate Mahlangu was?    Okay alright and before you proceed just tell us once again – tell me once again how the second meeting came about?  I seemed to hear earlier on that you were saying you asked for the second – another meeting?  So just tell me how it came about.    And... and ...[intervenes]     When you say no comment, you mean there was no comment from him?  You are not saying you are not commenting to the question? [laughs]     [laughs] You say there was no comment from him during the meeting?    Yes.  Okay.  Alright.    Was the purpose of the second meeting well-know to both sides, namely yourself and Tony and Mr Duduzane Zuma?  Did you have a common purpose as to what the purpose of the... Did you have a common understanding as to what thepurpose of the meeting was?  Or is the position that arrangements were made to meet and then we met and we talked what we discussed?    Okay, okay, okay.    In the first meeting, how did Mr Tony Gupta take your response to their request?    H’m.  Okay.    So the outcome of the second meeting was simply that, at least to you, it appeared that they acceptednamely Tony to... Tony Gupta and Mr Duduzane Zuma, they accepted that you could not be of assistance to them?    Did he confirm to them that how Transnet procures goods or services, was exactly the way you had stated?    Oh, okay.  Okay.      Okay.      Yes, okay.      But he was there.  He observed.  He witnesses what was discussed.    He did not say much himself.  And the meeting ended.    Thank you.    Did you say earlier on before you became a non-executive chairman of the Transnet Board, you had known Minister Gigaba for quite some time and you had known him quite well?    And you knew him quite well?  Reasonably well?    But you knew him?  Ja, okay.    H’m.  It is not just labelling.  You must ask that it be admitted ...[intervenes]     ... as an exhibit MM7...    EXHIBIT MM7... What is the letter?    F for fool?    Okay, okay.  The Business Day article at page 37 will be admitted as EXHIBIT MM7F. ARTICLE IN BUSINESS DAY NEWSPAPER IS HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT MM7F    Ja.   H’m.    [laughs]  Well, before we proceed.  Ms Armstrong, I cannot read a word.    In this... in this... on this page.    That is fine. Do that but see if it is possible later on to ...[intervenes]     ...get a clearly legible article in and obtain that ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Okay.  So I will rely on you to tell me what the relevant parts says.    I am sorry.  Before you do that.  Just identify the article.  What date, Business Day?  What date and so on?    Okay.  Alright.  Continue.    Ms Armstrong, did you mean successful in getting the approval of Cabinet?    Okay.  So you want to repeat your question and repeat it ...[intervenes]     ...with regard to that.    No, I am... we may be at cross-purposes.  I think Mr Mkhwanazi is going to still give you the same answer.  As I understand what he is saying.  He is saying, he does not think that Mr Gigaba succeeded in having him removed because he was not removed.    But what I thought what you intended tosay is that the article suggests that Mr Gigaba succeeded in ...[intervenes]     ... in getting approval ...[intervenes]     ...he be removed.    Whether or not he was actually removed is another matter.    Okay.    Maybe let us... just tell me what you understood the article to be saying and what your reaction was?    H’m.    H’m.    So prior to this article appearing, there had been discussions in which you had participated where the idea that chairpersons of the boards of various SOE’s could have a forum where they could discuss matters of mutual interest.  Is that correct?    Yes. And these discussions that you are talking about where this issue was discussed, did Minister Gigaba attend some of those discussions?    Of those meetings.  Yes.  So, but what was new to you when you read this article was that you were going to be removed as Chairperson of Transnet Board.    Yes. Okay.    H’m.    You want that to be admitted?    That will be the letter or the memorandum dated 25 May 2011, on the letterheads of the Ministry of Public Enterprises appearing at page 38 will be admitted... itis written “Cabinet Memorandum Number 4 of 2011” will be admitted as EXHIBIT MM7G. CABINET MEMORANDUM NUMBER 4 OF 2011 IS HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT MM7G    Which meeting?    Which meeting now?    Ja.     Did Mr Gigaba and you speak about this article after it had appeared in the Business Day?    Did you ...[intervenes]     Did you ask him whether it was true that he sought Cabinet approval for your removal from... asChairperson of the Board of Transnet?  Or maybe you did not put it like that but in effect, did you ask him to confirm whether that is true?    Directly?    Yes.    Did that response suggest that he was saying he had not as yet asked the Cabinet to approve your removal from Transnet?  I just want to make sure I understand clearly what he told you or what your understanding was of what he told you.   Yes.    Of course, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  But based on what he told you, was your understanding that he was saying he had not as yet asked Cabinet to approve your removal from... or is that something that ...[intervenes]     H’m.    Yes.  No, I understand that.  And when you answer these questions, feel free to reflect properly because it is many years ago, so that when you answer you are comfortable with your answer.  So leaving out what we know because we are looking atthese documents now but bearing in mind what the article in the Business Day had said.When you spoke to him, he did not say anything to suggest he had not made the approach to Cabinet that the Business Day article suggested in terms of what he told you and how you understood what he said?    Oh, okay.   Okay, thank you.  Ms Armstrong.    H’m.    When you read the article and when you spoke to Mr Gigaba insofar as in your mind you remained with the idea that if he might or Cabinet might be wishing you to be removed from Transnet, did you think that the reason might be... the forum that had been discussed or did you think it might be some other reason that you did know?  Did you think about why would they want to remove me ornot really?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes, okay.  Thank you.    But maybe before you do so Ms Armstrong.   As I understand it, this Business Day article was in June 2011.  Is that right?    So that was ...[intervenes]     That means that you had been with the Transnet Board only for about six, seven months.  Is that right?    You had been a member of various boards over a long period in different companies by this time.  Is that not so?     And when you have been a member of a board of a company for six months it seems to me that it is quite a short time to be removed.     Are you able to comment on that?  It is short.     Yes.  Yes, okay, thank you.     What is this document, just identity it, Ms Armstrong?     Ja, the article from the Mail & Guardianappearing at page 23 titled “Going off the Rails” will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT MM7C. MAIL & GARDEN ARTICLE “GOING OFF THE RAILS” HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT MM7C     Okay, okay.  Well, if it is with you right now?     Oh, not yet?     Okay, alright.       Do you want to first, Ms Armstrong, just read into the record the relevant part and then ask him?  The highlighted parts.     Well, let us deal with this head-on.  So you admit that you did say to the journalist who wrote the article or whoever may have spoken to you from Mail & Guardian that you had a personal relationship with the Guptas, is that right?     Yes.  You – as we speak today, do you stand by that description that you had a personal relationship with the Guptas or do you not?     But why did you use those words?     But that does not sound right that you would say you have personal relationship with them to dismiss the media if in fact you did not have a personal relationship with them.  What do you say to that?     Yes, okay, alright.  Ms Armstrong?     So the point you are making is youcannot be telling the board about all of these …[intervenes]     …many occasions when somebody or other has some discussion with you that does not end anywhere, that does not lead anywhere.  Is that the point you are making?     He did not see a need – if you want to say …[intervenes]     If – Ms Armstrong, if you think that there was – there were grounds for him to have seen a need you can explore those grounds.    But otherwise…     If he says he did not see a need, he did not see a need.     But if you say what about this, what about this, what about this, did not all of this show you that  there was need?  That is different, then you can do that.     I am sorry, I am sorry…    Mr Mkwanazi, did you ever have occasion to ask Minister Gigaba whether Tony Gupta was correct in saying he got your details from him?     You have never discussed, yes.  Okay.     Yes, okay, thank you.    Well, I am going to ask you to just repeat.  I think what you are saying may be important.  You are saying the ruling party did invite people to go to the ruling party and disclose what they knew and you say youfelt that you were not going to go there.  I just want you to say once again why you felt like that?     Okay, thank you.     Oh.     Yes, the …[intervenes]     Yes, they are attending to it and then we will ask you to repeat what you said but they are just attending to it.       Or just repeat.  .     Ja, repeat, ja. MR     The question.     No, I think he said earlier on his response to the Guptas was you are talking to a wrong person.     You must go to management, executive management.  That is what he said.  And therefore, if they went to management and management granted them whatever they wanted it would not necessarily be inconsistent with whathe said.     That is my recollection.  Is that what you said, Mr Mkwanazi?     Yes, yes.     Yes, we should try and finish because Mr Mkwanazi has waited for this time for a long time.     And I think - certainly from my side I think we can finish.  I assume that we should not be more than 30 minutes more or am I too ambitious?     How much time do you think we need?     About an hour?     Mr Mkwanazi , from your side you are happy for us to continue?     Yes, let us …[intervenes]     Thank you very much.  Then let us continue, I am hoping it will not take an hour.    But let us continue.     Ja.     We may or may not – we may at some stage need a short break.  What time did we start?  How long have we been…?     So we are close to two hours.     Maybe it might be the convenient time to take a short break.  We will take a short break, Mr Mkwanazi, and then we are going to resume.  Ten minutes should be okay?     We will take ten minutes.  My watch says it is ten past five.  So twenty past five we will resume.  We adjourn.     Let’s get him to be settled.   Mr Mkwanazi are you settled, are you okay?     Okay, alright.     Whenever she says page 8 or page whatever without mentioning MM you must know it’s still MM.     I’m sorry just repeat that Ms Armstrong I didn’t hear the question?     Yes I guess when you say you have no comment, Mr Mkwanazi, you mean you actually don’t know whether what Tony Gupta told you is true but what you have told me is, you had given Mr Gigaba your…[intervenes].      Yes, no, no, that’s what I’m saying that’s the reason why you’re saying, no comment but what you have said is Mr Gigaba did have your contact details, you had given him them to him, your contact details.  Let me repeat that, what you have said to me is that you had given Mr Gigaba your contact details is, that right?     Ja, prior to this – ja prior to this call by Tony Gupta.     Okay.     Okay it can’t be no comment because you do have comment which you have just made, is that right?  You are providing a reason why you would not have raised the issue with him, is that right?    Yes, so what I’m saying is, when you say, no comment it means you have nothing to say about his version but from what you have said I think you do have something to say and what you have to say, is you have an explanation why you did not raise the issue with him and that is, you are not the type of person who would raise this kind of issue with the Minister, is that right?     Ja okay.   Does it have Annexures?      It does?   Well tell me where the Annexures start first.       What’s 15?     That’s a confirmatory affidavit and then there is Annexure B and Annexure C, we’ll have to say the statement by Mr Malusi Knowledge Nkanyezi Gigaba appearing at page four – oh that’s the notice, that at page four, the actual statements starts at page six but the notice and the statement will be admitted and marked as Exhibit MM7 – what’s the letter?     B and that is the statement plus it’s Annexures.     Okay, thank you.  Maybe before you proceed Ms Armstrong, from what date did you become a Director, a non-Executive Director of Eskom to what date?     Okay, so going back to that Business Day article you did join the Board – you did join the Eskom Board as a non-Executive Director, the only difference is that you’re not removed from the Transnet Board?     Yes, okay, alright.     I don’t think he heard, so you must tell him again what Exhibit. ADV     Are you going to come back to this or not?     Did you say 349?    349?      When you are looking away from me Iwon’t hear you properly.     Yes.     I’m sorry where about on 351 are you reading?     Oh okay.     Just give the spelling for Mr Choeu for the convenience of the transcribers.    Ja.     I’m sorry, as I understand it, wasteful and fruitless expenditure is when an entity’s money is spent in vain as it were, the entity doesn’t derive any material value from that expenditure, would that be your understanding as well?    Yes, or the bridge is built halfway so that it can’t be used, that would still be…[intervenes].      Okay, alright, so you’re saying that whatyou were sure about at this stage was that this was irregular expenditure because the necessary approvals had not been obtained?     But whether it was wasteful and fruitless was something that you could only arrive at after a certain exercise had been done and at that stage that exercise had not been done yet?    Ja okay.     Well you…[intervenes].     You could have a contract without an exit clause, I’m now talking in general, let’s leave out this one provided when you look at its entire – you look at it in its entirety and the value you are going to derive from it is a party to that contract is good, the value you derive from it is good and you have built into the contract enoughchecks and balances to safeguard your interests it happens all the time, does it not, for example that you – an employer has a fixed-term contract with an employee and normally what that kind of contract means is neither the employer nor the employee can get out of that contract before the expiry of the fixed period except if there’s a breach of the contract. In the case of an employee, except if the employee conducts – misconducts himself or herself but other than that you are stuck there, both of you but it may be that as an employer you say, this employee has gotvery rare skills and he or she is in high demand they want him in other companies so I want to secure him or her for this period, are you more or less in agreement with that, that you can have that situation?     Yes, but you are saying in certain circumstances, you need an exit clause, that’s the point you’re making?    Yes, yes.  MR    Yes.     Of course even with this kind of contract that I was talking about, that is my putting an exit clause even though I normally think it doesn’t make sense but sometimes they can do that but I think that from your point of view the point you are making is, an exit clause in thistype of contract would have given you – or gave Eskom in the in the one before, some comfort that they could get out of it if there was a problem.     And from your point of view, the moment the exit clause wasn’t there it was a bad contract apart from the fact…[intervenes].     Also, because it was concluded when there was no budget for it, that’s another reason why you say it was a bad contract.     Ja, alright.    Can I ask this, you have been in the Boards of a number of companies and you had been beforeyour time at Transnet and Eskom based on what you said earlier on from the mid 1980’s you were already involved ..[intervenes].      Now, do you know of any circumstances under which a contract which has got financial implications for a company which is concluded when there’s no budget for it would still be regarded as good?       Yes.     So, if there’s no budget for it, it should be regarded as a bad contract?     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja just read out the full statement.     At least now it has been read in full, I think the next thing would be to just double check with Mr Mkwanazi, the witness, whether that changes anything in terms of the response that he has given.     I understand this statement too by MsLuthuli to mean that she was saying  1. Let us make sure as a board that the report reflects that we as the board did consider this contract. 2. Having considered this contract or the report must reflect that having considered this contract we concluded that this contract is not good at this time. That is my understanding of what she is saying.  Is that your understanding as well Mr Mkwanazi?    Okay alright thank you. Okay I think Mr Mkwanazi your understanding of the concept of ratifying might be different from Ms Armstrong’s understanding.  Now when you – you say the old board if it had time would have ratified the contract by taking disciplinary action against the two persons concerned, is that right?    Oh okay.  Maybe – maybe I was wrong to think you have a different understanding but let me – let me tell you what I understand when you say the board – the old board was going to ratify the contract if – conditionally if it had had time.    Now for me what that means is that you were going to approve the contract and of course you say conditionally.  We can talk about conditionally in due course.    Is that what you mean?  Is that what you mean that you would not approve.    Yes.  Now how – how can you say the old board was going to approve the contract when you do not know or you did not know what the outcome was going to be of the exercise that you talked about of establishing whether Eskom would get value out of this or not?    In other words my understanding is you would want to first find out is this contract worth anything to Eskom when it is worth anything serious and if you concluded or the exercise concluded that Eskom is going toget no value of this there is no way you would approve the contract.  That is what I think but you must tell me what it means.    But let us assume that the board undertook that exercise of establishing what value Eskom was going to derive from this contract of R43 million and the outcome of that exercise was that the value that Eskom was going toderive from this contract was R3 million.  Is the position that that therefore the R40 million would be viewed as… MR    As fruitless and wasteful expenditure, is that right?  You agree?    Yes.  So my question then is, how do you approve the contract – how was the board going to approve the contract before doing that exercise rather than do that exercise first depending on the outcome you might approve?    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Now if you approve the contract before you know how much value you are going to derive from the contract and whether it commensurates with R43 million or even close to it what happens if later on you find that the value is negligible are you not in trouble for having approved it already?   Ja please help me.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Tsotsi.    Zola Tsotsi.   Yes.    Hm.    Hm.  That I understand.    I think my questions arise from your statement earlier on that if your – if the board of which you were part had had enough time it would have approved.    This contract conditionally.  I think that is where – that is where my questions come from.  So I am saying.    How do you – how do you say this board was going to approve conditionally before that exercise is done?    Yes.    It is the processional one.    That is the processional affect.    Yes.    Yes.  I understand the two issues and maybe we – maybe we will not go further but if I was in a board such as the one in which you were in December – is it 16?    2014 I would say well before we – we approve anything on this contract I want to know fully about it.  What – why are we getting into this contract?  What are we going to get as Eskom?  That is where my questions are because I would want to say, this board must have nothing to do with this contract if I am satisfied that there is no value.  I would not even want to – to say I approve the – I condone the irregularity about procedure.  I would want to say, this board has got nothing to do with this contract.  The personwho entered into it without authority must face the music.  Do you think I was going to be too harsh?    I must just understand certain things.    Okay.  Okay.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Okay.  But ordinarily when say a Group CEO approaches the board about a contract that might need to be signed one of the things that the board would look at is, what value will our entity get from this, is that right?  At – even at that stage.    Yes, okay thank you.  Ms Armstrong.    There I think – I think his testimony is on    Ja on the irregular expenditure he says they were going to approve that.    Ja.  They could have.    They could have if they had time.    Ja.    But they did not because of time.   But the other one was still going to be investigated about fruitless and wasteful expenditure.    Ja.    Ja okay.    Yes.  Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer ja.   Yes.    Yes thank you.  I think one concern I had with the question is you did not lay a basis for asking for Mr Mkwanazi’s opinion on whether it would be a good governance practice or not so if there is no basis that is laid there might be a problem with that.    Maybe – I am sorry.  Maybe – maybe your problem is the reference to good corporate governance.    Maybe if you just ask a question.    Okay.  Hang on.  Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer – ja I think you understand maybe she is going to put the question in a different way.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes okay thank you.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    So – so you certainly can say they had an obligation to apply their minds to the issues that you had flagged as the – as the old board?    Thank you.    Okay no thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Mkwanazi the witness and thank you very much to Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer.      It appears that we have reached the end of the proceedings for today.  Of course, I am – I have no doubt you will come back Mr Mkwanazi to assist the commission further on other matters but for now thank you very much to both of you and thank you for being able to stay until late.  And thank you to the commission’s legal team and everybody who has stayed on so that we could at least finalise this part of Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence.  On Monday just in case the media are still here or are listening on Monday the commission will hear the evidence of a former Minister MsNonvula Mokonyane in regard to allegations involving Bosasa and during the week we will also hear other persons who were implicated in Mr Agrizzi’s evidence and some of them are Magistrate Naya of Pretoria.  I think Mr Linda Mti who was Commissioner of Correctional Services is scheduled also to come next week.  There might be one or two others.  Mr Vincent Smith was meant to come but arrangements have been made – he has been released.  He will come some other time.  And I think on Friday we will hear the – I will hear evidence from Judge Makhubela of the High Court in relation to PRASA matters.  So I thought I must just indicate that so that where we are able to, we indicate which witnesses we will be having and which work streams we will be dealing with.  Okay.    Oh yes.    Yes.    Thank you very much.    Ja.  Okay.    Thank you very much.  Okay we adjourn.    Thank you.  We adjourn.
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.    Yes.    I am trying to add something to the prospect so…   Thank you Chair.  Mr Mothibe when we concluded matters yesterday we had been looking at the press coverage from the Business Day in relation to the Ernst and Young review and I had asked you whether you could assist in looking through the working files in anticipation of today and whether you were able to find any media articles that had been collected by your team under the 2016 audit procedures.  Were you able to find those?    But then the facts are Nkonki your joint audit partner for the previous year collected extensive media articles each month of the year as part of the audit procedure but your PwC team in the subsequent year did not do that.  Is that correct?    Yes and in your year, the 2016 year ending31 March 2016 you did not.     But was it not a designed part of your audit procedures that you would collect media articles?    Mr Mothibe I accept subject to something I am going to come to in relation to reportable irregularities that it may not be a requirement of the ISIS but your own audit procedures that EGA that we looked at indicated that you would on a monthly basis and regularly check media articles, did it not?    Indeed.  Chair the only aspect I added is that we looked at that EGA the Evidence Gathering Activity.    Which has been designed in their own audit procedures.    And it stipulated that media articles would be looked at.    As a source.    Indeed.    Activity.    Indeed.  And then you did not follow in the 16 audit your own step?    And then in 2016 you did not follow thatstep Mr Mothibe.  Could we have just a clear answer to that question?    Thank you.  Was not followed?    Mr Mothibe.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Chair sorry just so we get the financialyears right.  As I understand it you did it for the financial year ending 31 March 2015, is that correct?    You did not do it for the year ending 31 March 2016?    And it was the year 31 March 2016 when PwC took over the primary performance responsibility for SCM compliance, correct?    Thank you.  Whereas the previous year it had been Nkonki’s performance responsibility, correct?    Thank you.    Mr Mothibe I said that I keep promising I am going to come to the reportable irregularities’ guides reference to the need to look at press reporting or third-party sources.  You indicated yesterday if I recall your evidence that you were aware of that requirement of the Irba guide for reportable irregularities.  Did I have your evidence correct?    So I do not then suggest we need to gothere but just to refresh your memory.  What the guide says – fell free to pull it up if you want to but I do not suggest it is necessary for you to go there Chair.  It is in DD19C at page 129.  It is a section of the Irba reportable irregularities guide    Indeed, Chair and I am going to try today not to ever go to a fourth point if I can possibly help it.   Because it is terribly difficult to find the pages.    So Mr Mothibe this is an article – a money web article that you will see if you just flip through it spans a total of four pages and it is entitled SAA Defies National Treasury and DTI Instruction.  CFO resigns.  Board persists with 30% procurement set aside and it is dated 17 November 15.  I would like to flag a few points in this article because had your team been doing this media checking it would have come across some of these pertinent items in this article.  I am reading from the middle of the first page and asked by italicized words. “The SAA board is persisting with efforts to have 30% of itsprocurement contracts set aside for transformation partners.  In defiance of express instructions by National Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry to stop this practice.  Against this background tensions between board and top officials who continued to war against unlawful practices is reaching breaking point.  This has become clear from a money web investigation into efforts to amend the SAA ground handling contract with Swiss Port International.So that is the introduction and then I will flag a few other important points over the page at 132.21.2 I will pick it   If you had followed.    Apologies Chair.    Mr Mothibe do you accept that this article sets out important information about what was going on at SAA? MR    Do you agree that those letters that National Treasury and the DTI wrote to SAA would have been something you ought to have considered if you had been aware of this coverage?    And do you accept that if you had implemented the procedure in the financial year ending 31 March 2016 to consider media reports this would likely have come to your attention?    Thank you Chair.    Yes.    I would like to suggest the chances are extremely slim Chair.  And the reason I say that is because in the six pages that comprise the media reports that they picked up for the previous financial year there are numerous reports from both News24 and Fin24 and I stand corrected but my understanding is Fin24 does publish the Money Webarticles.  So it was clearly on their radar to collect these particular news items.  I suspect you can assist me Mr Mothibe the way that they might have done it is a general review each month.  It seems to be monthly that they pull out important media reports that come from – that relate to SAA, is that correct?    Chair I must indicate I asked my learned friend Ms Armstrong to check me on my assumption that Fin24 publishes for Money Web that is not the case.  But there are numerous publications in the six pages of mediareports from the previous year and so my proposition to Mr Mothibe stands.  I put to you Mr Mothibe that it is very unlikely that an article with this in-depth attention to SAA published online by Money Web would not have been an article that came to the attention of your team if they were doing this work.  What is your response to that?      Thank you Chair.  Mr Mothibe you clarified for us yesterday that you only saw the board resolution relating to this contract at some point between April and 30 September 2016, is that correct?    Apologies but somebody in your team would have looked at it, is that correct?    Yes but I understood your evidenceyesterday to be you had received this particular board minute – at least resolution related to this decision.  Did I have your evidence correct?    And the person who was doing the review in your team would that be the person who was looking at all relevant board minutes and board resolutions?    You see if that team was doing this work in reviewing the minutes and the resolutions and were communicating with each other I want to suggest to you that they would have noticed that when the board usually takes procurement decisions the resolution talks about the process that has been followed.It talks about the BAC recommendation because the usual procurement process is coming from BAC to the board and then the board confirms whether it approves or disapproves the BAC’s decision.  Is that something you are familiar with in the governance structure at SAA?   And then they would have found this resolution of the 14 March 20 – sorry 14 March 2016 and would have seen that it reads quite differently.  So I would like to take you to it.  It is at page 132 in the same bundle that you are busy in DDC at 132.43, 43.       Do you have that Mr Mothibe?    So this is a resolution of the SAA board ofdirectors and it is entitled Request for SAA board to approve the terms and conditions for the Swiss Port SAA contract and note the contract duration period effective from 1 April 2016 until 31 March 2021 for ground handling services and cargo services to be rendered at Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and East London.  It says the board by Round Robin 2016/ - I think that is B05 as of 14 March    Yes.    Oh apologies sounds like.    Apologies let…    My error.  Let me go again.  So what they resolved to do was to approve the contract to be entered into with Swiss Port South Africa for the duration of five years, commencing on 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2021, coveringramp handling, PAU’s, wheelchairs, GPU’s and air site crew transport to be rendered at Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and East London with the following conditions. A. Swiss Port South Africa to acquire all the GPU equipment that has been purchased by SAAT.  (That is South African Airways Technical). B. Swiss Port South Africa to enter into a contract with a BBBEE company that has representation of black women, youth, military veterans and disabled persons from which Swiss Port will purchase all their equipment required for the SAA contract.   Well, you accepted earlier what the procurement process was in SAA.  Is that correct?    And if I say to you, you must take it as assumed for this, that other resolutions of the board when that procurement process is followed, is specific about “We approve the BAC recommendations which record that the award of the tender should go to whoever”.If that is what the standard resolution looks like and a member of your team gets this resolution, do you accept that this resolution would read differently?    And if your team had been reading the Moneyweb article, then the reference to the BBBEE company that is going to be getting a portion of this contract, mighthave raised a flag for it, might it not?    But that article was explaining how National Treasury and the DTI had demanded that SAA seize with immediate affect its endeavours to set aside 30% of its contract outside of the procurement framework.  Did you see that in the article?    Thank you.  Now Mr Mothibe, you haveindicated that there were no processes followed in the financial year ending 31 March 2016 to review media.  I accept that.  But can you tell me what your processes are for dealing with subsequent events that comes to your attention after the end of an audit year that you are doing the audit on?    But if something comes to your attention, despite the fact that your team was not looking at the media reports, but if somewhere between 1 April 2016 and 30 September 2016, when you signed the audit report about this contract and the concerns about it, would that haverequired your attention?    Did this contract and its irregularity come to your attention in that period?    Did you in the course of your processes look at what Internal Control within SAA was saying about the contract that it entered into?    And did you look at Internal Controls when you were doing your audit work?    And did you ever ask for the Internal Audit Team’s own findings on regularity, procurement and contract management to be fed through to your team?    So were you aware of the Internal Audit Team’s report on the 15t h of September 2016 that found that the Swiss Port contract had been concluded irregularlybecause no competitive process was followed?    Well, let me just take you to them.  It is the report that you find, it is next to the ...[indistinct] report.  You will find at page... in the same bundle, DD19C at page132.53.1.    H’m.    Chair, the file is actually 19C but that is because of the method we used yesterday and I am sorry it does not accord with what is on your spine.So ...[intervenes]     Indeed.    No, no.  That is where the error is.    Oh, that is fine.    Absolutely Chair.  I do apologise.    And to correct the record.  It is EXHIBIT DD19C at page 143.53.1.    So this is an excerpt of the report from a member of Internal Audit to... well, the Head of Procurement at that stage at SAA, Mr Lester Peter.  That is where we have picked it up in an email circulated on the 15t h of September 2016.  I will take you to that in a moment Mr Mothibe.But this is the report that is attached to that email and what it is headed there at the top of the page at page 132.53.1 under the paragraph 11.1 is, “Contravention of Treasury Regulations and SAA SC and Policy (Swiss Port Contract)”.And the audit finding rating is high.  And then what this document does is, that it sets out the legal requirements, Treasury Regulation 16A.6.1.  It records the resolution of the board in that block that says finding.  And then if you go over the page to page 132.53.2, you will see in the block third from the bottom that is entitled “Risk/Implication”.What the Internal Audit Team of SAA had determined    Do you accept ...[intervenes]     Sorry.    This comes from... no.  From the Internal Audit Team within SAA.    So they were reviewing their own tender compliance ...[intervenes]     ...and in September 2016, that internal audit... Internal Control Team ...[intervenes]     ... is saying, this ...[indistinct] [coughing] did not follow procurement processes.    And my question to Mr Mothibe was, did it come to his attention?  And he has indicated in his evidence it did not.  I think further, in fairness Chair.  Mr Mothibe, you make the point that your last... the last Audit and Risk Committee meeting had occurred in August.  So this comes later.  It is 15t h of September 2016.  So it was not brought to your attention in the August meeting.  Is that right.    H’m.    And if that would come to your attention, would you have confidently resolved that... this R 1,8 billion contract constituted irregular expenditure?   Is expenditure not incurred when the liability is incurred for the entity?    But the liability... there is a liability for five years on a stipulated bases and that liability was incurred when the contract was concluded on the 15t h of March 2016.   So each year of those five years when payments were made in terms of the contract, it would then have constituted irregular expenditure, correct?   And Mr Mothibe, if we can then go through the elements of the reportable irregularity obligation on you as the auditor in respect of this Swiss Port Contract.  You remember the first is that there is an unlawful act.  I understand your evidence to be that you have already accepted that this contract was entered into in a manner that was not compliant with the PFMA.  Is that correct?    And it would then have constituted an unlawful act, correct?    And was it committed by a person responsible for the management of an entity... of the entity.    And then after remaining three alternative requirements for the reportable irregularity.  I would like to focus on the material breach of judiciary duty aspect.Mr Mothibe, we have looked at the media articles that flagged this 30% set-aside policy which was in the view of National Treasury and the DTI an unlawful step for thecompany to take.  You accepted that was what the media reporting at the time, correct?    And you may have noticed in that article that Mr Meyer who was the CEO... CFO at the time at SAA, had warned particularly about the risks for SAA if it would continue to embark on this policy because it would have damaging consequences for the reputation of the entity, as well as, potentially expose it to adverse Audit Opinions.  Did you see that?    And you did not ever actually see those National Treasure and the Department of Trade and Industry letters?  Because there you have early informed the Commission that you were charged with disciplinary proceedings by the Regulatory Board of Auditors.And you have consented to accepting breaches of the Auditors Code and your obligations under the Auditing Professions Act.  Is that correct?    And if we go to your supplementary statement, you will find it in EXHIBIT DD19B which is in the first file that we are still working in and you will pick it up atpage 30.2.  Three, zero point two.      So at paragraph 7, you are referring to the draft charges that you received from IRBA and you are explaining here the basis for your entering into a consent order with IRBA.  Did that consent order include an acknowledgement of the fact that you have breached relevant provisions?    So what you first accept is that your failure to disclose material none-compliance with Legislation and Internal Control deficiencies for the year 2014 and 2015.  Is that correct?    And you accept that you do not distance yourself from your obligations as a joint auditor for those two years or be it that Nkonki performed the audit work on those aspect, correct?   And you have also accepted that there was none-compliance with legislations in Internal Control in the 16 year.  Is that correct?    Mr Mothibe, I try to make a note of exactly how you put it in your answer.  You said the aspects of compliance with legislation accept and Internal Control should have been elevated to the Audit Opinion.  Did I get that right?    I want to put it to you that it is worth and it simply should have been elevated and it was not elevated but that suggests there was something that should have been there that was not.In fact, what was there was false because you gave a clean bill of health on compliance with Legislation and Internal Control.So the outside reader of this auditor’s report for 2016, gets a false impression of the state of compliance with Legislation and Internal Control at SAA.  Do they not?   Mr Mothibe, that was not my question.  My question was, when an outside reader of your 2016 audit    And what you disclosed in relation to Internal Control was also not accurate, correct?    Yes.  Let us talk about when the errors in our auditing came to your attention because what is noteworthy Mr Mothibe is that it is only in your supplementary statement before this Commission that you have indicated your acceptance of these deficiencies in your audit work. Now I want to probe with you why you did not make that known earlier on in the process?  Because the evidence of the auditor general was that when the auditor general movedin for the 2016/2017 audit year, they took steps to engage with you and your colleague, Ms Masasa about the work that you have done.And in the course of those interactions, the evidence of Mr Sokombela for the Auditor General was that, the deficiencies in your approach to Supply Chain Management were brought to your attention.  Do you accept that?    Mr Mothibe, I want to suggest to you that it was not simply that there was slight disagreement or a difference between the manner in which you had approached Supply Chain Management and the approach taken by the auditor general.And I want to refer you to an email that Mr Sokombela prepared, recording the outcome of meetings that he had with you and Ms Masasa.  And for that purpose, Chair and Mr Mothibe, we need to move to a new set of files which is Mr Sokombela’s files.But Chair, I think just before the tea adjournment, maybe it is convenient for us to take it now and then we can get the new files arranged for you so that we do not have to take the time later.    Certainly.    Well maybe half-past will be fine.    Thank you, Chair.  Just for a bit more time.     Thank you, Chair.  What we did over the break is just made available to you the files containing Mr Sokombela’s evidence.  Now his evidence is contained in EXHIBIT DD20.  There are four files in DD20 and we have asked that what gets placed before is DD20D.  So, Mr Mothibe, if you will take at DD20D and …[intervenes]    That is incorrect.     Chair, just so that I can check the numbering, what page number does it commence within the file?     Ja, that is not correct.     No, we must have the last one.  Alright, no, I might just have moved my pages slightly.  What I need to take you to is page – let me just see here.  Page 1804.    Yes.  My learned friend indicated to me it should be in the file in front of you.     Correct, Chair.     That is the correct page.     There is some page at the front thatshould not be there.     So we will sort that out over lunch, if we may?     Mr Mothibe, do you have page 1804?     Thank you.  So I was suggesting to you before the break, Mr Mothibe, that there was not, as we understand the records of the meetings between the AG’s office and yourselves and Nkonki Inc, a small deviation between the approach that your teams took to the supply chain management  and the approach that the Auditor-General was taking to it and the reason why I say that is because what you find at page 1804 is in the bottom of thepage, bottom half of the page, an email from Mr Polani Sokombela, he is the auditor at the Auditor-General’s office who gave evidence before the Commission, it is an email sent on Wednesday 13 September 2017 to, amongst others, yourself, is that correct?     And you will see if you go to the     He then records    Yes, indeed.  So when he states that they would not rely on your work is that false?     So is it false that he said he would not rely on your work?     Did that – I am just trying to understand what your last comment means.  Does that mean you did not respond to say you are wrong, Mr Sokombela?     And is that because you accepted it?     Mr Mothibe, at the beginning of your evidence yesterday I have it that you accepted that when an external auditor like PwC comes into audit a state-owned enterprise it does that in a sense on behalf of theauditor general.  Did I have your evidence correct?     Because the Auditor-General is the default auditor for state owned enterprises, correct?     But now in your evidence you have emphasised that the Auditor-General has particular expertise in an area and I want to put it to you that that is not an answer to limit or reduce your obligations as external auditors of state owned enterprises because youstand in for the Auditor-General.  Do you accept that you must do as much as they must do when they audit state owned enterprises?     No, indeed you have.  Thank you, Chair, I am indebted.  Mr Mothibe, that was an email referring to a meeting that you had had on the 5 September.   If I understand it, there was a further meeting that was held on the 18 January 2018 and I would like to take you to the minutes of that meeting, it is in the same file, that is EXHIBIT DD20D at page 1825.  So it is a little bit further on in the file.  You will see that first page indicates minutes of a meeting, meeting with predecessor auditors dated 15 January 2018 and if you look at the attendees it is reflected that you were attendance.  Can you confirm that?    And can you just – do you recall this meeting, what was the purpose of the meeting?     And if I understand it as it is recorded under item 3 on page 185 the main purpose of the meeting was to discuss, amongst others, the audit outcomes of SAA which may have regressed since the AGSA – that is referring to the Auditor-General of South Africa, is that correct?     So which may have regressed since the Auditor-General took over the audit in the 2016/2017 financial year.   The fact that there may have been questions from the users of SAA AFS, that is audited financial statements, that might be asked why the opinion regressed and to try to formulate an answer to that question together as theAGSA and previous auditors, that is PwC and Nkonki.  Is that a fair recordal?     Yes, to share the outcomes but also to discuss with you the likely questioning that would come as a consequence of their audit findings because of this regression that had taken place.  Is that not so, Mr Mothibe?     But the Auditor-General was concerned, was it not, that stakeholders would have a number of questions to ask of the previous auditors based on what the Auditor-General had found in its audit of the 2016/2017 year.  Is that not correct?     Yes and so they in fact discussed with you what they thought the big areas were that stakeholderswho received the Auditor-General’s audit report for that year would likely raise because there was this discrepancy between the clean audits that had been received for five years and now a qualified audit opinion.  Is that a fair summary?     Yes, I am emboldened in putting that summary to you because it is actually a paraphrase of what you see on the next page at page 1826.  If you turn over the page at 1826, what the minutes record there from the     Both.     Mr Mothibe you’re aware that Mr Sokombela’s evidence was that once they’d looked back and received your audit files and looked at the work that you’d done, they could not rely on the closing balances you had determined it, for the 31 March 2016 year as their opening balance for their auditing purposes?     No.     Are you aware that the evidence of Mr Sokombela, before this Commission, was that he could not rely on your closing balance for the purposes of his opening balance?     Do you disagree with his approach?     Mr Mothibe if you would turn to page 1826 we were looking at the aspects that the Auditor General’s office had said stakeholders would be interested in and then in the middle of the page, I hadn’t quite got toit yet, there’s another recordal of what the Auditor     “And SCOPA might need answers from  the previous auditors on why this matter was not reported in prior years.  The previous auditors need to prepare themselves, especially on SCM if they’re called to do a presentation by SCOPA or Parliament,Do you see that?     So, this was in a meeting of January of 18 where it was brought to your attention that there was a huge risk on Supply Chain Management, is that correct?     And when you started engaging with the Commission, do you recall that the Commission indicated to you that one of their key areas of focus was SCM compliance?     So why didn’t you, in your firstinteractions with the Commission, come clean and say, yes there were deficiencies on SCM, we did not adequately check for whether SAA was complying with relevant laws and regulations?     But Mr Mothibe in September of 2017 the Auditor General said he would not rely on your work on SCM, in January of 2018 the Auditor General said there is a huge risk on Supply Chain Management and SCOPA is likely to be asking questions of how we could have gonefrom a clean audit opinion to a qualified audit opinion in the space of one year and despite all of that, is it your evidence before this Commission, that you only came to realise that there was Supply Chain Management deficiencies in your work, by March of this year?     I just want to pick up on the point that the work was performed.    Mr Mothibe you accept, in your supplementary statement that there were limitations placed on the scope of your audit because of, for example, the lack of tender files, correct?     So, then the work that you performed could not adequately determine, for example, whether the amount stipulated for irregular expenditure in the financial statements was accurate, could it?     I’d then like to look at what the Auditor General’s report for the 2017 financial year gave as it’s important elements and how they dealt with aspects like irregular expenditure and then I’m going to compare that to the audit report for the 2016 year which you signed off on and to do that exercise, Chair and Mr Mothibe, we’ll need to go – and if your registrar can just assist, just to give you, Chair Exhibit DD2B, we’ve been working in D you can put it away now I won’t go back there we’re going to Exhibit 2…[intervenes].    Oh sorry.     I actually think I need to be in D, so please keep D but please go-ahead Chair, thank you.     Thank you Chair.  So just to clarify, for the whole of 2018 you held the view that SAA had compliedwith relevant laws and regulations for the three years that you audited them, is that correct?     And then in 2019 you continue to hold that view, correct?     And then…[intervenes].     Of Course, indeed.     It’s I-R-B-A, thank you.  So, we clarified 18 you held the view that SAA had complied with laws and regulations, 19 you were telling us that an investigation by IRBA started, so what was your position in 19, had SAA complied?    And then the commission received Mr Sokombela’s evidence in March and I – as I understood your evidence earlier that helped to focus the mind.  Sorry they received Mr Sokombela’s evidence in February and then that helped to focus the mind and by March of 2020 you accepted that those indications that there had been compliance were incorrect.  Is that right?    Ms Mothibe in fairness to you I think I must put this for your response.  That passage of events suggests at least to me and I invite your comment on this that for two years until the shoe started to pinch, until the public exposure of the deficient auditing work by PwC – PwC was content not to come clean about the errors it had made.  And it was only when there was public disclosure inthe court at this – in the course of this commission’s work that you then had another think and have made the concessions that you have made.  Do you have a response to that?    Not at all.    Thank you Chair.  I would like to now go to the Auditor General’s Report for the year that they moved in and Chair you will…    Okay.  So before we move.    Before we move.    I would like to ask you just to get out of Exhibit DD20D which is in front of you.  The report of the Auditor General for the 2017 year and you will find that commencing at page 1672.      Yes and Chair in this [indistinct 00   Yes so that when we move to the next file you will have the two next to one another Chair.    Just because of the comparison exercise.    And then we will make sure we insert it.    Then you will have in front of you DD19D which is the second file of Mr Mothibe’s evidence. And just tobe clear that is Exhibit DD19D and there you will pick up page 601.  So what you should now…    Both have before you is the Auditor General’s Audit Report for the 2017 financial year and we will be able then to compare it to PwC and Nkonki’s audit report for the prior year.  But before we do that comparison, I do just want to do a little bit of background based on Mr Sokombela’s evidence before the commission.And it may be…    Sorry Chair.    Yes.    Okay.  Indeed.  So the one that has come out of DD20, Exhibit DD is the Auditor General’s.  You will see at the top it is entitled Report of the Auditor General.    So that is the one that is …    Yes.    So that you write PwC.   If you want.    Okay.  So – but as a precript to going to the comparison between those two I would like to just remind us about what Mr Sokombela’s evidence was of what they found when they looked at procurement processes in SAA.  Because we spent some time in his evidence looking at a table Chair you might recall it.  It was a table in the more extensive audit report where he identified the number of contracts that they tested, the number in respect of which they had found non-compliance, the numbers in which they identified irregular expenditure.  I do not suggest it is necessary for the both of you to have it in front of you I am going to just tell you what the highlighted facts are there.  MrMothibe if you want to go to it at any point you will let me know.  But the upshot of the Auditor General’s evidence was that when they did the Supply Chain Management compliance work for the purposes of their audit, they selected using the method that he described first high-risk contracts and then contracts pursuant to a sampling exercise.  And the total number of contracts that they selected for review was 96 contracts.  And that was to a value of R7.5 billion just a bit more but I am rounding off for now.  And in the course of that analysis of those awards theyfound that 80 of them – 80 – 80 of the 96 were awards, tender awards, contract awards where non-compliance was identified.  And that came to a total of R6.6 billion.  So 83% of the contracts that they selected for consideration were not compliant with legislation.  And then of those there were 62 of the 96 contracts where irregular expenditure had been identified.  So we understood from him that non-compliance was broader than simply irregular expenditure.  There is of course fruitless and wasteful expenditure as well and other non-compliance issues but of that portion 62 of the 96 were – which is 64% were irregular expenditure.  And Mr Mothibe despite having done that rigorous work and establishing that 83% of the contracts that they reviewed were not in compliance with legislation they still identified a limitation of scope.  Are you aware of that?   Yes because what they did was they – despite looking at those 96 contracts they were still not satisfied that they had obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to verify the amount of irregular expenditure.  And what does not come through in the audit report is the actual figure that they regarded as unverifiable of the procurementprocess and that was to the total of R279 million worth of the awards simply could not be verified because they could not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.  So – Mr Sokombela that is the background to – sorry Mr Mothibe that is the background of Mr Sokombela’s evidence to what he then ends up saying in his report and what I would like to then compare with what you disclosed in your report the year earlier.  And that for that purpose we will go first to the Auditor General’s Report that is in Exhibit DD20D at page 1672.  You will see there at the bottom there is a heading Irregular – well let us start – sorry.  There is a heading, Report on the Audit of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, do you see that?    And then under that there is a headingQualified Opinion, do you see that?    Now the Auditor General gave a qualified opinion you gave an unqualified opinion in the previous three years, is that correct?    We will come in a moment to what the difference is between those two.  But what then happens as I understand the report is the next heading is Basis for Qualified Opinion.  So now the Auditor General is telling uswhy did he regard it as appropriate to give a qualified opinion.  Am I understanding it correctly?    And before we go on just in terms of qualified and unqualified audit opinions can you help us with the following?  As I understand it but I like the Chair am not an auditor so we are going to rely on your expertise here.  An auditor will give a qualified audit in two scenarios and for this I am relying on ISA 705 and I just want to check that you and I agree on this.  The first is where he has or she I would like to add sufficient appropriate audit evidence but regards there to be material misstatements in the financials.  Does that accord with your understanding?  That is the one circumstance.    And then the second circumstance is when the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base the opinion but concludes that the possible effect on the financial statements of undetected misstatements could be material but not pervasive, is that an accurate understanding?    So for a layman like me this seems to suggest to me that there are two situations.  The one is you have got sufficient audit evidence but you conclude thatthere are material misstatements in the financials and that is to be compared with where you do not manage to get suitable appropriate or sufficient appropriate audit evidence.  The consequence of which is that you actually not able to detect whether there are misstatements of a material nature in the financials.  Is that a fair summary Mr Mothibe?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  So if we commence with the report of the Auditor General, we were at Exhibit DD20D at page 1672 we – we are in the section on that page where he sets out the basis for the qualified opinion and the one I would like to turn to is under paragraph 7 which is headed Irregular Expenditure.      You have got that.  And you see it references the relevant section of the PFMA, the is Section 55(2)Bi and it is recorded that that section of the PFMArequires the SAA group to include particulars of irregular expenditure and the notes to the financial statements.  The SAA group did not establish adequate controls to maintain complete records of irregular expenditure.  I was not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to confirm the amount of irregular expenditure to be disclosed by alternative means.  Consequently, I was unable to determine whether any adjustment to irregular expenditure disclosed in Note 42 to the consolidated and separate financial statements was necessary.Now what is – I want to just focus on in that recordal there is that the statement that the SAA group did not establish adequate controls to maintain complete records of irregular expenditure because there was a point yesterday in your evidence Mr Mothibe where I understood you to be trying to emphasise well the Auditor General comes in in another year and what he finds might be different to what we had in front of us.  Did I understand you to make reference to that?    You see this was the point that the Chair took up quite regularly with Mr Sokombela in his evidence because part of what we were trying to probe was exactly that. Is it just that something strange happened in the 2017 financial year that meant there was suddenly no records?  Imean maybe we were after some sort of massive fire in the building or some such thing.  Or was it the case that this was an endemic situation?  And I want to remind you of what Mr Sokombela’s evidence was there.  Chair I will just give the references to the transcript.So the first thing that Mr Sokombela said was that the contract register was entirely inaccurate and most contracts reflected there simply did not exist.  That is his evidence on the 21 February 2020 page 16 lines 1 to 5.  He then said this problem must have been going on for many years because ofthe magnitude of the problem.  And he said that on the same day page 15 line 16 to 24.  And he went on to explain that when they asked for tender documents to be located, they had to deploy an entire team to search for months and he described words as systematic and you will find that in the transcript of the 21 February 2020 page 67 lines 8 to 10.So Mr Sokombela what I am interested in is certainly – Mr Mothibe what I am interested in is Mr Sokombela’s evidence before this commission is it was not a once off.  It was a systematic failure, they could not even find the existence of contracts that were reflected in the contract register.  What is – what was your experience?  Did you just have a completely different situation when you were there?    Chair I see we have just gone past one.    I…    Not at all.    Indeed.    We do.    Indeed.    Indeed.  Chair I – I think that will work.    And we will complete both today.    Thank you, Chair.  Chair, before the break we have spent some time in the auditor general’s report or the financial year ending 31 March 2017.And Mr Mothibe had made certain concessions in relation to the approach that PwC and Nkonki had taken for the three prior years.Mr Mothibe, what I would like to go to now is your auditor’s report for the financial year ending 31 March 2016 and I ask you to have that in front of you before.  That was in EXHIBIT DD19D page 601.  That is where it starts.    I think we were going to try it.    Yes, indeed.    If it is creating an interference, we will ...[intervenes]     Ja. [laughs]    At least, it keeps us focussed. [laughs]     Thank you, Chair.  But please do let us know if it becomes an interference.  Then we will just ask for it to be ...[intervenes]     Okay.    Let us see how it goes.  Indeed.    [laughs] Thank you, Mr Mothibe.    So we are going to turn to your auditor’s report and what I would like to focus on in that report is on the second page that is the paginated page 602 because it is recordables on this page, which I understand from your supplementary statement, you have accepted ought to have been different.  Is that correct?   So let us pick up on irregular expenditure.    Apologies.    Yes.  Sorry, let me traverse that again.  What I said is your focus on the second page of the auditor’s report because there are recordables there which I understand Mr Mothibe in his supplementary statement to have conceded should have been different.For example, where they identify under compliance with legislation that they did not identify instances of material none-compliance.He has now accepted that should have read differently. Is that correct Mr Mothibe?    I would like to start the heading “Irregular Expenditure and Fruitless and Wasteful Expenditure” on that page.  It is just above the middle of the page in capitals.And what you record there when you... and you have    And what should you have said as you record it hear?    Thank you, yes.    Now Mr Mothibe, as I read your now revised statement of what should have been contained in your report.  It applies to the 2014/2015 and 2016 financial years.  Is that correct?    And there a limitation of scope in all ofthose years, correct?    And as a consequence of that limitation placed on the scope of the audit, you were not in a position to confirm the completeness of the amounts of irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure?  Is that correct?    Thank you.  It is also... you confirm that you... you confirmed that the contents of your supplementary statement are true and correct.  That means, you support what is stated there as having been the necessary revision to the auditor’s report.  Is that correct?    Okay.  It is just because when you answer“that is what is in my statement” it is not as clear that you support the revision in those terms.  So that is just why I am questioning.  Thank you.  So then I want to ...[intervenes]     Certainly.  Sokombela.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mothibe, I was going to pick it up earlier but then I have left it but you have madethe point again.  So I do just want to get clarity on this.You referenced twice the fact that at these Audit and Risk Committee meetings there was a representative of the auditor general’s office.  Is that correct?    Mr Mothibe, you do not give that evidence before the Commission to suggest that the auditor general is responsible for the errors in your audit report, do you?    Thank you.  Then I would like to go in your statement.  Oh, just before we move off your revised wording for the audit report.   I focused initially on the irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure but you also recognised that your statement in respect of compliance with legislation should have been different, correct?    And you also identified in relation to your audit work on compliance with legislation that there were limitations placed on the scope of your work.  Is that correct?    Chair, that is correct.    Yes.    But that is the section that starts with page 30.5.  So you will need... so I am just worried.  If you got B on the spine that is the second file.  You will need A on the spine.    But within it, you will go to page 30.5.    No.   No.     I know.  I know.    Well, I need page 30.5.  Three zero point five.    Oh, excellent!    Excellent.    That is within Mr Mothibe’s supplementary statement Chair.  And we are looking... I want to focus on paragraph 11 Mr Mothibe because what you did in paragraph , as I understand your supplementary statement is, you made the concessions about what the errors were in the previous audit reports for the three years.And you actually give us the language of what ought to have been reflected in those reports.  Is that correct?    And then what you are doing in paragraph11 as I read it, it effectively sum up the impact of the concessions that you have made about those errors.And what you say there and I will read it into the record,    Do you stand by that statement?    But there were numbers for irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure that you could not verify. MR    Mr Mothibe, I am going to come back to the amount of irregular expenditure that needs to be disclosed in the financial statements but the words in the sentence I want to focus on is.  You say you are satisfied that sufficient audit work was performed. I think you have already conceded before the Commission that sufficient audit work was not performed because there was a final step in the process that you did not complete.  Is that correct?    H’m.    Mr Mothibe, I have traversed that with you yesterday.  So I am not going to go over it again.  And I stress the importance of that last step.  But it is not possible to redo it today.So what I would like to just get your point on is.  Section55(2) of the PMFA makes it a requirement that the financial statements of a public entity must include the particulars of any irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure.Now as I understand it.  Part of an auditor’s job is to determine whether the disclosed amounts of irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure are accurate.  Have I understood that correctly?    Right.  And your changes to what yourreport should have said previously, concede that you were unable to perform that task because you had insufficient appropriate audit evidence.  Is that correct?    Yes.  So then why do you say in the sentence we are focussing on that you are satisfied that you had appropriate audit evidence?  Do you see those words?    And should it have been qualified your Audit Opinions for those three years?    But we looked at ...[intervenes]     Because we looked at the requirements for a qualified audit and we went through them previously.  I think it is ISIS 705.And one of the requirements for giving a qualified audit is.  When you have insufficient appropriate audit evidence, the consequence of which is, that there is a limitation of scope.  And you have accepted that both in relation to compliance with legislation and in relation with irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure, you had difficulties in the audit work, correct?     No, I understand you fairly, Mr Mothibe, to say it required qualification in respect of the areas of fruitless, wasteful expenditure and irregular expenditure and in the area of compliance with legislation, is that correct?     Right.  So I understand the emphasis you place in paragraph 11 on IFRS and its standards and its focus but you have no difficulty accepting that there ought to have been a qualified opportunity  in relation to those areas that you make the concessions on, correct?     So is it your evidence that the extent to which limitations of scope – limitations were placed on the scope of your audit in relation to irregular expenditure andin relation to compliance with legislation, those were not material enough for you to have qualified the audit?     How do you …[intervenes]     And how do you make that conclusion or judgment, give that judgment today without having properly assessed the extent to which those failures and insufficiency of the appropriate audit evidence youobtained what the materiality of them were?  How do you manage to do that today?     Mr Mothibe, the other aspect that the PFMA requires you to consider is the quality of internal controls in the state-owned enterprise that you are auditing, is that correct?    And in the three years 2014 to 2016 your audit reports indicated that the internal controls were adequate, is that correct?     So you may have found some but what you conveyed to the reader of your audit report is that youdid not identify deficiencies in internal control that were sufficiently significant.  Is that a fair statement?     Now, were you aware – do you know who Mr Siyakhula Vilakazi is?     Do you recall what position he held at SAA?     Right.     And you are aware that that tender was irregularly cancelled?That award was irregularly cancelled is that correct?     And are you aware that there were complaints lodged with IRBA and with the Internal Audit Regulatory bodies as a consequence of the irregularity in that tender award?     And so you do not have knowledge of the Internal Audit Regulatory body, is that right?     You are aware.     Good because in that process Mr Vilakazi provided an affidavit to the Institute of Internal Auditors of South Africa in which he gave an account of the state of internal auditing at SAA.  Are you aware of thataffidavit?     You see because Mr Vilakazi’s – and the competency of the internal audit function at SAA was raised in this complaint and in response to the complaint he produced and affidavit which we have subsequently obtained as the Commission and what that account that Mr Vilakazi, the head of internal audit at SAA discloses, is the following.  I am going to summarise for you in the interest of time but if you would like me to go to the affidavit you can request that, Mr Mothibe. What Mr Vilakazi says in that affidavit is that duringApril 2014 the SAA internal audit department was only one year and nine months old and most of its processes were still being formalised.  He said that in that affidavit that general documentation and filing processes regarding all the audits were far from perfect. He explains that towards the end of 2014 and independent audit firm was appointed to do quality assurance on the internal audit work at SAA.  Were you aware of that firm that was appointed to do that assurance work?    Did you call for that report of that independent audit firm?     And then were you were aware that they had found significant weaknesses in the audit working papers, documentation and filing?     To the outside observer, Mr Mothibe, I am putting myself in that category, that does not sound like an internal audit department that is functioning well.  Is that a fair observation for me to make?     Do did you regard it as your job to then check each year whether it was improving?     So when you state positively at the end of 2016 that you were not able to identify any deficiencies in internal control is that because you did not look at it?  Because you did look at it and you did not identify any deficiencies.     Mr Mothibe, we have looked at the provisions of the PFMA previously.  Do you accept that under Section 51 of the PFMA 1(a)(i) it is a requirement that the accounting authority of a public entity such as SAA must ensure that it has and maintained internal control.  You do not have a difficulty with that, do you?     And that it is also required to have and maintain a system of internal audit under the control and direction of an audit committee complying and operating in accordance with the regulations prescribed in terms of Section 76 and 77, is that correct?     And because you are required toconsider the internal control environment in the state-owned enterprises that you audit it forms an item in your audit report, is that not correct?     Yes, you see, your answers to these questions about internal control, Mr Mothibe, as I am  understanding, tends to suggest that internal control is not really something you are required to look at in the course of your auditing of a state owned enterprise which has PFMA obligations to maintain and have internal controlsystems in place.  Have I – am I unfair to you in your evidence that you are trying to suggest that is not a requirement of your obligations?     Okay, so you accept that you do have to look at internal controls?     Mr Mothibe, I accept you do not give assurance on those controls but you include a positive statement in your audit report for three consecutive years that you did not identify any deficiencies in internalcontrol.  Do you accept that?     No, I can read you the words.  It says    And then I put you but in 2014 that system at the admission of Mr Vilakazi seems to have been inadequate and I understood your answer to be it was in its infancy and it was improving, is that correct?     And then did you trust that it was improving in the consecutive years for 2015 and 2016?     You see, the reason why I asked whether you were tracking the improvement is because you finish in 2016, the Auditor-General comes in in 2017 and the Auditor-General found significant internal control deficiencies.  Is that because the whole environment had changed within a year?     Okay, so let me ask whether you found any of the significant internal control deficiencies that the Auditor-General spent many, many paragraphs of his audit report recording.Under leadership there had been instability experienced in the entity which resulted in suspensions and resignations in key leadership positions, instability in leadership contributing to the overall decline in the internal control environment.  Did you not encounter any of that in your years?     And did you find that leadership had adequately established policies and procedures to enable and support the understanding in execution of internalaudit objectives, processes and responsibilities?     And that the audit and risk committee had mandated implementing various IT aspects which then were not adequately put in place.  You had no difficulties with that?     And unlike the Auditor-General you didnot find that leadership had failed to implement effective processes to ensure that sufficiently skilled individuals were held accountable for non-performance?     But not enough for you to regard themas significant departures from the requirements for internal control, is that correct?     That is fine for my purposes, Mr Mothibe.  Chair, that brings me to the end of my questions unless there are further from you.  You will recall that we were going to ask just for a bit time before the next witness to get everything ready.    No, thank you, Chair.     Maybe ten, Chair.     Because we just have to check the communication with our next witness.    And we do not want to call you in and then have it…     Could I do it on this basis, as soon as I have been given the green light we can indicate to your registrar.     Thank you so much.     Thank you Chair, if I can just indicate to Mr Mkwanazi and your attorney Mr Mkhwanazi, we havecommenced the session and I am going to do an introduction and then I am going to hand over to my learned friend with your leave Chair.     Chair the next witness we intend to call is Mr Mafika Mkwanazi, his evidence is important and spans two State owned enterprises as well as the topic of the New Age, which is an aspect that we have been looking at in some detail in the Commission.   Chair as I indicated the evidence will be presentedby my learned, Ms Amy Armstrong.   Mr Mkwanazi will be giving evidence today via video link from a location within South Africa and Chair he will be visible to us on the screen on my right, your left.   He will be able to see Ms Armstrong and to the extent that he wishes to you we have indicated to him he should get a device to stream the proceedings.   Oh, apologies, there has actually been another device set up so he can see both you on his screen as well as Ms Armstrong, and Chair just to remind ourselves of Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence is going to fit in, Mr Mkwanazi was a member of the so-called old Eskom Board, that was the Board before the change in 2014 and it was the Board who had to deal with the TNA contract that the former Chief Executive Officer, Mr Majila, had entered into for 43million,when that contract was flagged as a reportable irregularity by the auditors of Eskom.   Now the Commission has previously received evidence from Mr Pamensky as one of the new Board members who ultimately had to take the decision to ratify that contract.   It has also heard the evidence of Mr Tsotsi, who was the Chairman of the Eskom Board and so who transitioned from the old Board to the new Board, but what we haven’t yet heard is a representative of the position of the old board, and it is Mr Mkwanazi who fills that positionfor us today, and so there will be some aspects of his approach to the TNA contract while an old Board member of Eskom that will be probed.Mr Mkwanazi was also at Transnet when as his statement indicate he was approached for a meeting with a member of the Gupta Family regarding advertising spend with the New Age, and Chair Ms Armstrong will spend some time probing that because that meeting happened at a time and in circumstances that bear a number of similarities to other accounts that this Commission has received in evidence about those interactions in early 2011 and late 10.   Chair three Rule 33 Notices were issued in respect of Mr Mkwanazi’s statement that was way back earlier this year, because Mr Mkwanazi had been waiting expectantlyto give his evidence before the Commission.  There has only been one response Chair and that is from Mr Malusi Gigaba, it is not an application to cross-examine Mr Mkwanazi, he supplies an affidavit setting out his version and as we have done previously when we have been fortunate enough on our timing to receive an affidavit before a witness gives evidence Ms Armstrong will traverse pertinent aspects of Mr Gigaba’s version with Mr Mkwanazi this afternoon.Chair Mr Mkwanazi is one of those witnesses whoseevidence, relevant to the Commission, spans more than will be addressed with him today.   As we have had to do previously with our focus on TNA withstands a number of SOE’s we focused in on the TNA aspects, we focused in with any associated meetings, we will look at TNA in Transnet and in Eskom, with Mr Mkwanazi but other aspects where he may have relevant evidence, particularly in relation to Transnet will be left for the Transnet work stream to deal with.Chair the last point from me before I hand over to Ms Armstrong is to request that Mr Mkwanazi’s statement be entered as Exhibit MM7, it should be directly in front of you.Now Chair it is a very short statement, which is then accompanied by ...[intervenes]     It actually doesn’t have annexures, it is so short and sweet that it comprises only two pages.     Yes, so let me explain that is in what we have previously been calling the other document section and it comprises the affidavit from Mr Gigaba, which is going to be put to Mr Mkwanazi today, and so those are theattachments to Mr Gigaba’s affidavit, and then certain additional documents.Chair my learned friend was mindful of the approach you took yesterday to want him to separately to identify the documents, so what we are going to suggest for today is we enter as Exhibit MM7 the statement of Mr Mkwanazi and then for referencing purposes, and that will be A, it will be MM7A will be the statement and then as Ms Armstrong leads you through today she will use primarily the pagination number to get to you to the right page but then she will give an exhibit number to each of the documents, because there are only a few and so she can do that actually while she is giving – asking the questions, if that is suitable to you Chair.     It is actually a statement, it is only signed.     Correct Chair.     Thank you so much, I am just going to quickly sterilise because I am about to ...[intervenes]      Yes, of course, yes.     He did indeed Chair.     It is actually Zoom today.     Yes, there is a concern about him falling into a risk category and with the escalating infection rate at the moment his request to the Commission was that he remain at his home as I understand where he is currently located and give the evidence from there.     It was particularly related to health concerns.     Yes indeed, since February Mr Mkwanazi was sitting here many days.     Indeed Chair.     We have confirmed that and that stipulation Chair has been communicated to Mr Mkwanazi.   And he is comfortable with it.     Indeed.     The last just procedural aspect that I always forget is Mr Mkwanazi is legally represented, his legal representatives did introduce themselves to you way back when, but I wonder if they could just place themselves on record, they are also on the Zoom platform.     He is not with him, he is at a separate location, you will see him second from the end on the top row of – second from the left hand side, so Mr Mkwanazi comes in the frame on the left and then next to him is also Mr Mkhwanazi but spelt with an H, as is legal representative.    Thank you Chair, if I may then hand over to my learned friend, Ms Armstrong. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I looked at the file I could not – Iwould not – was not able to identify any – any of those.  Safe to say Chair as I did indicate yesterday the collection of the review of media reports it is not a requirement in terms of the other standards.  It is one of the parties that we had and there are also a number of other ways that we do accumulate audit evidence.    Chair Nkonki did that as part of their own procedures and in keeping with PwC it is part of our procedures, we did look at that in the previous year.    Chair we did not do that.  We used other way – methods of procedures to accumulate audit evidence and to determine our risk assessment.    No Chair it was not part of exact procedures it was an audit [?] procedure that we had – would be.  As I indicated it is not a requirement of the ISIS that one reviews media reports.     Chair that EGA was – is not part of the standard EGA’s that are in the PwC audit guide.  It is an additional step that we had added.  So it is – as I indicated it is not a standard requirement Chair.    Chair.    Chair as I indicated it is an extra step that we added.  It is not only – on the standard EGA requirements it is not there.  It was an extra step that we added and I think Chair I did agree to that.    Chair that step was not there in the 2016file.  So it is not – it would not be entirely correct to say we did not follow that because it was not in the – in the file – the step did not exist.    I am not too sure I understand the Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Sir – Chair as I indicated Chair in 2016, we – it was an extra step that we added it is not part of the mandatory steps that is included in our own process.    Chair it was not introduced it was an extra step that we added because of what we considered to be a necessary process to gather evidence or to understand.    Chair.   No Chair it had not been added Chair.    Chair I do not know – Chair as I indicated it is not part of the process it was an extra step that as a team we thought we should add to help us in the risk – with the risk gathering – risk assessment process so it has never been added.  It is an extra step that the team took.    As I indicated Chair.  For the 2015 year we decided to add that step, that extra step in our file.    Yes.    In 2015 yes Chair it was there.    Yes the step was not added in 2016.    No, no it was not added on the file.    I think Chair.    That is correct Chair.   Chair we did that in the 2015 financial year Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes that area was allocated to us in 2016 Chair.    That is correct.    Chair I am – alive to the requirements of the Irba Guide on reportable irregularities.    Chair as Ms Hofmeyr has indicated in terms of the – the guidance on identifying reportable irregularities we consider matters that come to our attention even if they come from the media.  This matter had not come to our attention from the work that we had done and therefore we would not have been able to consider it.    Yes Chair I am – I was going to give the ground Chair.     And had the information come to our attention do our audit would certainly have taken a view on that and following it through Chair.  Because there are issues there at risk anyway.   I shall do so Chair.    Chair just – the closing one Chair to say that had the information come to our attention we would have – we would have raised red flags and would have responded on that Chair.    There has been of interest to us Chair.   Chair as I indicated despite the fact that it is not a requirement of the – of the standards had it been there Chair and had the team identify the article it would have been of interest to us Chair.    Chair…    Chair I cannot say whether it would have been easy or not.  Safe to say Chair we – there is a big [indistinct] of media articles out there and if they had searched Chair it may have come up as part of the search.    Chair I am not too sure if they can necessarily say it is a monthly process but I just say if you go into the internet and you search.  You will get – you might get quite a lot but I would – they did not do that on a monthly basis, no Chair.  This is not how they approached it.    Chair as Ms Hofmeyr said earlier in reviewing the previous years a lot of them Fin24, News24 and there is not much from Money Web any.  So Chair I think I can say Chair do a – done a search and whether it will bepicked up or not Chair I cannot – I honestly cannot say Chair.    Chair off the top of my head I would not think that it would be one of the steps they would have taken.  Chair the work that [indistinct] we performed have been subject to a considered view and we importantly focus on the significant issues first before you look…  And in my experience Chair if you follow through a process, I would notthink that this would necessarily be that high up on the list.    My recollection Chair is that the – there was a review of board minutes which had been delegated and I had access to extras of those board minutes and the full resolutions Chair.    Somebody in my team would have looked at some of the board minutes Chair.    Chair yes I did receive it Chair as Ms Hofmeyr indicated but the review was then delegated Chair, I did not do the review myself.    Chair I would have to look at the filebecause it would have been more than one person because there is different minutes that we had access to and Chair they would have looked at samples of those as there – as and when required Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I have it Chair.    I have it Chair.    Chair, having not seen or at least all the other resolutions, I am not too sure I can necessarily comment on that Chair.   That is correct.    That will be correct.    If we had sight of the article.  Yes, Chair.    In that article as shared with us today here.  Yes, Chair.    Chair, the Audit Standards require that we consider all subsequent events that impact the numbers of the financial year that the present financial year, to the extent that what has not yet signed ...[indistinct]     That will be correct Chair.    It did not come to my attention Chair.    I am not too sure I understand the question Chair.ADV    That should be correct Chair.    Chair, when we... from the audit of South African Airways and as part of the requirements of the standards, we did an assessment at company level, looking at the issues Chair relating to governance, management, competency and the controls that they have in place.And we have, after review Chair, consider that and we could not allow Internal Controls and their approach adopted.  South African Airways was a substantive audit approach Chair.   The Internal Audit Reports Chair were provided to us.  It is one of the audit steps that we undertake and they were also included in the minutes of the Audit Committee.    Chair, I am trying to recall Chair if in September 2016 we had received those minutes Chair. ADV    Chair, we reviewed what was made available to ourselves and what were requested.  Hence, Chair I am trying to recollect whether or not that... at the time of the year, we had access to those minutes.Chair, the... one of the biggest issues that occupied us as we got to close to signature of the Audit Opinion then it occupied both partners and both audit teams, time was needed... the challenge around who it concerns.Where we critical ...[indistinct] stage Chair where we part of raising ...[indistinct] because we obviously just something always had with the cash-flow issues and the ...[indistinct] status.And Chair, 15 September Chair if memory serves me right Chair, I cannot recall having read those minutes but I stand to be corrected Chair.    Chair, that will be correct.  If my memory serves me right, the last audit committee meeting that we had was sometime in August and I would not have beenaware of this ...[indistinct] minute before I signed.And as I did indicate Chair that we... at that time we were all invested in trying to get ...[indistinct] comfort on the growing concerns ...[indistinct] of South African Airways because it was quite a big critical issue at the time Chair.    If memory serves me right, that is correct.    If it had been available earlier Chair, we would not have missed it and it is one of those items that would had to then be reported under none-compliance with laws and regulations.    Chair, we do engage with Internal Audit ...[intervenes]    ...on their work.  They assist us in identifying areas of risks where we should be focussing on because... So yes, Chair.  Internal Audit is ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]     ...that we did talk ...[indistinct]     Chair, it would not have resulted in an irregular expenditure because the contract had just been entered into.  So if there has been none-compliance with law and regulations in that... in the supply chain, management process not been followed.   It is only when they start expanding on that that it becomes irregular expenditure.  So that would have been... because the contract is from 1 April 2016 the subsequent year.  In that year, it then becomes irregular expenditure.  So at the end, it would only have been none-compliance with laws and regulations.    Chair, if I read this correctly.  This is acontract that takes... whose term starts on the 1 s t of April.  So it is a commitment to procure senses(?) from Swiss Port.So what they will do is.  Depending on the contract, whether it be on a monthly basis, they will then issue invoices.So it is only when the... if... when the expense is then incurred that that becomes irregular expenditure.    Chair, it is not a liability Chair.  It is a commitment.  It only becomes a liability when the services have been provided and all settlement then it is an expense but ...[indistinct] Chair the matter(?) is not a liability in terms of the accounting framework is a commitment.    That is correct Chair.  It cannot be an irregular expenditure because there has been no spent.    That is correct Chair.    Yes, from the time that it becomes expenditure, yes.  It then becomes irregular expenditure.  In the subsequent years we were not auditors Chair ...[indistinct]     That is the case Chair.    Chair, it is an unlawful act.   Chair, it was committed by the board which was management before governance of entity Chair.    If one looks at the article.  That is what... that is correct Chair.     I saw it in the article Chair.    Chair, that is correct.    I have it Chair.    Chair, the consent order is in relation to what I considered to that... Chair, we should have as auditors disclosed a none-compliance with law and regulations in the Audit Opinion.It was immediately(?) identified when we performed our work and reported to management and that we also reportedto the Audit Committee.    That is correct Chair.    Chair, that will be correct.    Chair, that is correct. ADV    Chair, what... and maybe to put it... emphasise Chair.  That when you carry out the audit, there were two parts.  The first part Chair is the audit in terms of the International Standards of Auditing, where we were having a look at the numbers to show that we... the financial statements fairly presented ...[indistinct] operations for theperiod under review and the cash-flows.Chair, that work was performed and we were able to obtain sufficient comfort numbers in the financial statements were properly(?) disclosed Chair and that there was no material mistake in those numbers Chair.The area where this concern audit relates to Chair.  It relates purely on the compliance side of the audit in that we have identified areas of... or areas where there were deviations from required ...[indistinct] processes which should have been elevated to the ...[indistinct]As I indicate Chair, we did raise these matters with the... with management and with the Audit Committee but we omitted to include them in the Audit Opinion.So Chair, in a nutshell, the Audit Opinion as far as it relates to the fair presentation of the numbers Chair, we still stand by that.Chair, we are happy that we have done sufficient work.  It is only as it relates to the compliance of laws and regulations that we could have did(?) more Chair.    That is what I am saying Chair.   Chair, it is important to note that at one never give assurance on the Internal Controls.  We would not do that Chair.  Neither... if you look at Audit Opinions of any enterprise, the auditor never gives assurance on Internal Controls.   You give input where on controls that you have reviewed specific areas that relates to do audit work or areas that we were auditing.  One can never give Chair assurance on Internal Controls Chair.    There were ...[indistinct]... there were items that were identified Chair ...[indistinct] as I talked to earlier.   Chair, to the extent that the reader would be looking at the compliance law and regulations part of it ...[indistinct] Chair.    The... what were disclosed was not accurate Chair.    Chair, as we indicated... as we have indicated in our ...[indistinct] audit, we believe that after going through the review Chair we could have included morein terms of ...[indistinct] in that regard    Chair, when we engaged with Mr Sokombela, we... his office performs work on procurement and contact management on a regular basis.And if I can use the word, they were experts in that area and they give that... in looking at the work that were performed, they would like to do a bit more work Chair.Compliance... procurement and contract management is a complicate scene(?).  It is that where ...[indistinct]     I have it, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.       That is correct, Chair.     Chair, as I initially mentioned before we went into the tea break, we did have interaction with Mr Sokombela and in that discussions he did indicate that the office of the AG is an expert when it comes to the audit of a supply chain, procurement and contract management and therefore they would be able to do – if I can – because they excel in that area, they would be doing bit more work in that area, Chair, and that is how the discussions and the speed of discussions were – in our session, Chair.     Chair, that statement does not necessarily fully capture what we had discussed.    Chair, he did indicate that they would want to do much more work that we had performed.     The email says that, Chair, but in our discussions, Chair, the discussions were more to say theywere experts in the area, they excel and therefore they would to do much more work, Chair.  At this stage, Chair, when I received this email – because one reflected on the spirit of the discussions in the defence(?) 08.52 I did not take this on further, Chair.     I did not respond, Chair, to this.     Chair, as I indicated, I reflected on the spirit of the discussions that we had with Mr Sokombela and as I indicated that the office of the AG does this kind of work on a regular continuous basis and that he would certainly want to do much more than what we hadperformed.      Chair …[intervenes]     Chair, if I read it, Chair …[intervenes]     Chair, I am not in full agreement with the Chair ’s understanding because if you look at it, Chair, it says that we have not done much work.  Not in the sense that we did not do any work, Chair.     And I think importantly, Chair, if we had not done any work, we not have been able to identify …[intervenes]     Oh.     Chair, the way that the Chair put that is acceptable.     I said, Chair, the way that you interpreted – you mentioned it now that he looked at the work that we had performed, compared it to how – he probably would have compared it to the amount of work that he would perform and said he would like to – he would not rely on that.  And, Chair, you mentioned that he would start afresh. Chair, the norm would always be that he will still have to perform his own work anyway, Chair. Even placing reliance does not mean that he will not do any work altogether.  He will still have preferred to perform some work to – be the opinion that we would have given would relate to our financial year and he would have to do work to satisfy himself – that in his financial year.  So he would always have had to perform his own work anyway, Chair.     Ja, no…    Chair, I think I had agreed to that, Chair.     Yes.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, that is correct.     Chair, just a correction, Chair, I did not say that the Auditor-General was an expert, I think I said that when we engaged with Mr Sokombela, he said that they were experts and they do this on a continuous basis, Chair.  I think that clarity, I think it is important, Chair, but I did not …[intervenes]     Chair, I think I said earlier to clarify that.     Because if I – what I will say is that when we engaged with Mr Sokombela, when we spoke about – we spoke about the issues of supply chain and could have mentioned that, he indicated that he did do that on a continuous basis, they are experts.  They said that, Chair, it was not my – this is what I was putting forward to the Commission, Chair, and I certainly agree that, Chair, when we perform work on the audit, Chair, we do our work, we should do it properly and diligently, Chair.     Chair, that is not what I am saying, Chair.     We would not accept an appointment if we could not deliver it, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     This was, Chair, the meeting after the AG had completed his audit of South African Airways and the aim of the meeting, Chair, they were taking us through the final results, he raised a number of qualifications that they included in the audit opinion and, if I recall, Chair, it was courtesy meeting from the AG because at that stage, Chair, they were – were about to sign off the financial statementsand they had to go and present to parliament.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, if my memory serves me right, Chair, yes, we had a meeting and the outcomes of the audit were shared with us and then – I think business executive was Mr Eugene Zungu, he is the national leader, because was responsible for signing the audit opinion.   The idea was to familiarise PwC and Nkonki of the final outcomes and that they were ready for signature, they were going to parliament.  I was not a meeting to – for PwCor Nkonki to give input because the audit was already finalised and they were meant to go and present to parliament.  So it was a courtesy for them to share the outcomes of the audit.     Chair, in the meeting the discussion focused on what was the outcome of the meeting.  The meeting did not last – if my memory serves me right, Chair, I think – I am trying to think back, Chair, if you – probably about an hour or so, Chair, or a half.  As I indicated it wasa courtesy meeting because they had finalised the audit, they were going to parliament.     That will be correct.     That will be a fair summary, Chair.     Chair, in appreciating that the Auditor-General came through to SAA more than a year after we had been there, Chair, some of the issues that would beraised were peculiar to the years under their review and not necessarily issues that related to the year that we audited.   If I give an example, Chair, one of the concerns that they had relating to – or [indistinct]  was relating to the valuation of aircraft.  In the year that we audited, Chair, we did some work in that area and we were comfortable in the outcomes of that audit process.   The office of the AG had a challenge in the year that the performed the work, Chair, so it was very well understood that some of these issues were peculiar to the period that they audited, Chair. Also importantly, Chair, in that – and even when you talk to the issues of irregular expenditure.  Concerns were raised that the number had increased significantly.  It is important to note that, Chair, throughout our tenure, at South African Airways as auditors.   The Auditor-General was part of the audit committee meetings, they stay invitees, they had access to all the reports that were put together, they had a good understanding of what was transpiring, Chair, and at no time were there any concerns raised, Chair, this on the outcomes of our audits.   So, Chair, the issues are raised in the meeting and also some of the qualifications are peculiar to 2017.  As Iindicated, Chair, we are still comfortable that after we performed our audit in terms of the ISAs, Chair, the International Standards on Auditing, the numbers for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 are correct.  The financial statements were free of material misstatement.   Chair, we have made a concession relating to issues relating to compliance with laws and regulations and irregular expenditure which is an issue that was – that has been identified in this meeting, Chair.     I appreciate it, Chair.     Thank you Chair I appreciate that.     Chair, thank you Chair I think, Chair, I do appreciate where the Chair is coming from, Chair the issues that have been identified at South African Airways as I previously mentioned Chair, during our tenure we did look at procurement and contract management, we did identify deviations.We sought responses from Management to understand how – what has happened so that we can appropriately report on that.  We elevated the matters with those charged with governance, the Audit Committee throughout our tenure at South African Airways, Chair.  What we have included, Chair, in our supplementary statement is that we acknowledge that we should have probably – we should have included these – that compliance matters in the Audit report as required in theparagraph under compliance with laws and regulations Chair.  So, Chair, it is important to know that we did the work, we identified these issues Chair, it is the reporting element right at the end where, Chair, I think judgement, Chair, we got incorrect and that is the supplementary submission that we have made to the Commission, Chair.  Chair as I emphasised earlier, these matters relate to the compliance side on the numbers, Chair, we performed sufficient work, we did proper assessment, identified certain areas that required attention, we followedsubstantive audit approach because we could not rely on the controls, Chair and we were able to get comfort that the numbers included in the financial statement fairly present the position at South African Airways Chair and that the financial statements were free of material mistakes made.     Chair, as part of the review of opening balances we – the office of AG engaged with us and they requested access to our files to get an understanding ofthe numbers.  There were areas where they felt they could not rely on opening balances because they felt they could not perform some of the work that we had done.  We engaged with Mr Sokombela and shared with him the fact that – remember we had been auditors of South African Airways for a number of years and in certain areas – because we’ve been doing them for consecutive years. We also took comfort on the work that was performed in previous years in some of the key areas and he, in his discussions with us, was only – and rightly so I supposeChair, he was only prepared to look at the 2016 file and not look at all the other files because, Chair, had that been possible we definitely would have been able to get comfort on those numbers Chair.     I’m aware of Mr Sokombela’s evidence in that regard.    There were elements in the discussions where we did not find each other Chair, but it is the approach of the Auditor General, Chair, I cannot question the way they performed their work Chair, I’m not in a position to do that.     That is correct Chair.     I see that Chair.    That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair, when the Commission started, it was after the office of the AGS and of their opinion, and we – after that, Chair, the Regulator had accessed the report and was making enquiries, investigating the PwC and Nkonki with regards to work that they had performed.  At that stage, Chair, we were happy, we were comfortable that what we had done would have been sufficient.  It was only when the regulator completed his work, and in fact Chair, it’s only this year in March that when we looked at the input from the Regulator and we took that and read that with Mr Sokombela’s evidence that we accepted that this isan area that would have required – we should have had …[intervenes].     That is correct Chair.     Chair as I indicated before Chair, the issue that was, again was there the lack of reporting of the issues that were identified when we performed work on Supply Chain Management Chair, it is not that it was not performed it is the failure to report these deviations in the audit opinion, it’s not to say that no work was performed earlier Chair and I think Chair, the question that has come from SCOPA is that this – the opinions say there’s no – there’s not enough compliance.  Subsequent to that there is a lot of non-compliance, what has happened, what is thegap and that is where we acknowledge, Chair, that much as we had done the work we had failed to report that to the shareholders Chair and that is that last link that was outstanding.     Chair it is an important leg Chair.     Chair I understand where the Chair – where Chair is coming from, I think it is, for me, also very important to recognise that work was performed Chair, I do appreciate that Chair.     I think Chair, I needed to clarify.     Definitely Chair that was never my intention.    I do appreciate our role…[intervenes].     Chair I do agree with that insofar as it relates to Supply Chain and Contract Management.   Chair, that should be correct Chair.      I have got it Chair.    That is correct Chair.     Sir I was a vision partner for three years.     Chair I would say – I wouldn’t say failure to do work but rather to say failure – I wouldn’t say it’s a failure, I think from …[indistinct 16.39] they lack to understand why there has been such a deterioration.     Chair at the time Chair the view that we were taking is that we had done sufficient work Chair, and if there was a need for us to appear before SCOPA Chair, we should be in a position to appear and explain what we have done.     Chair, at that stage Chair, if I recall the manager or senior manager who was responsible for performing this work had previously worked for the office of the AG and in that regard Chair, one had comfort that, with his background we should be able to cover all the critical areas, there was a comfort that I had at least Chair, to the extent that this will reflect the 2016 financial year that we audited, the 2014 and 2015 financial years where these areas were mentioned by Nkonki Chair, there had been thisfairly …[indistinct 19.17] at other big enterprises Chair. The view was that we should be able to demonstrate that we had done sufficient work Chair.     Trying to go back Chair, so…[intervenes].    And I think, Chair – hence I say Chair, part of the comfort that one had was that we had allocated this part of work to somebody who had, in fact, spent time in the office of the Auditor General and that they understood…[intervenes].     Chair I do believe we knew what we had reported, it was based on the work that had beenperformed, Chair, and as I did indicate, understanding what we had reported we were comfortable at that stage that the work performed supported what had been reported Chair.     Chair like I said I was aware that we had not reported.     Yes Chair.     And I think Chair, what I was alluding to was that, based on the work that had been performed, the level of people that had performed and the experience of people that had performed, we were comfortable that we had done enough work to support what is in the audit report Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Yes Chair.      Chair I understand it, maybe slightly differently Chair in that when the AG performed his work on Supply Chain Management, he had identified deficiencies which he then was reporting and the amount of deficiencies identified compared to the fact that nothing was reported in the previous year, as recorded earlier Chair, why is there such a big difference. So Chair it’s not to say maybe,because he had reported we should have reported but rather why is there such a differentiation and my view then was, the work that we have performed supported – if the AG Chair, has reported it was reported based on the work that he has performed and therefore it supports the kind of report we had given Chair.     Yes Chair, that is what is in the supplementary statement.     I knew at that time that I had not reported Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair it is based on the work that we have been performed that we had employed somebody in that area who had experience in performing this kind of work and the result that were fed through to us, we did consider, we applied our judgement and at that stage we did not believe that they should be – we did not believe that it should be in the audit opinion.    Chair at the time, based on what we had done and the judgement we had applied at the time Chair, we did not think we should have reported.     At that time Chair.     Based on the work that we had done and the judgement that we had applied.     As I indicated Chair, the work was subject to investigation, however, and Chair at this stage we – when we handled the file, we believed that we had done sufficient Chair.    Chair when the investigation was – there was – IRBA, put to us questions, we responded, they cameback and asked more questions there were areas where we had – were able to give them responses, Chair and it was only – that process was only finalised this year in March.     Chair at this stage, Chair we said there was no material non-compliance Chair.  So Chair the – thatis always absolute assurance but we said – we said to our viewers that there was no material non-compliance Chair.    Chair after – we got responses from the Regulator and their view was the Regulator’s view was that we had not complied and the view from the [indistinct    Chair the concession was made after the review by our Regulator.  Chair the process was ongoing and Chair one does not want to anticipate outcomes of a – of a process.  Secondly Chair we do know that the processes unfortunately it does take a bit of time Chair and when we initially issued our opinions, we applied our mind we applied our judgment on the outcomes Chair.  As I deemed – I have already indicated Chair these matters were identified and they were elevated to the Audit Committee and Management so it was not a – I am not sure if I am using the right words that Ms Hofmeyr says a failurebecause work was performed it is easily identified so – and I do not want to – and I think Chair as you mentioned earlier I do not want to make it sound like it is not a – it is a    Chair the Regulator went through the – requested our files went through a thorough process and it was Chair the Regulator’s view was that the items that he identified would not require a judgment Chair which we have – the views that we should have reported them – the matters would have been material because the – I am trying to use the rights words Chair.  An indication when we could not get – when we could not receive the – in some of the areas the files that we were looking for which would – should have said that the – there is material non-compliance and should have been reported Chair.  And the Regulator also read it with the – the Auditor Generals Guide on how they approach these matters Chair.  And it was that – the problem Chair was that    Yes Chair which are non-compliance.    That is correct Chair.    Chair at this stage…    At that stage Chair that is what we thought.    Yes Chair.    Chair as I indicated Chair we – we only looked at those matters Chair because the judgment that we had applied and Chair as I think I mentioned I did refer to that in there Chair that one of the biggest things that occupies one’s minds when we came to sign the [indistinct    Chair I think what I am [?] Chair we have had heavy focus in that area.  The – and we not applied a judgment.  One might have focussed so much on this area Chair that – and that is where – one we have erred in applying our minds correctly in determining whether or not those items were material enough to be included in the audit opinion.    But Chair I thought that is what I was relaying Chair if it did not come out.    Chair in terms of the guidance in the – from the AG Chair there is a threshold that I have said for each    Chair for the years 2013 and 2014 –apologies 2014 and 2015 if you recall Chair this work was    We erred – we erred in not considering thatChair.    Yes Chair.    I nod yes.   See Chair I read that in the audit opinion Chair.    I see that Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That sounds fair Chair.    Chair I must admit I have never thought of it.    In the way that you ask me because we cannot Chair as auditors, we…    We perform your work and we will then issueappropriate audit opinion Chair.    Chair I would think…    I would think that any entity would especially qualified Chair it might – it – you do not go down [indistinct    Depending on the – on the nature of the – of the qualification Chair.    There could be qualification as a result of an error.  If it is an error say general error then you will be able to explain it but it is the qualification.  So I think Chair thecircumstances – it is difficult to respond to your question.    Is that a fair statement to say why an entity might not be able to – to give the auditors material information and documentation?   Chair that is a difficult…    Yes I think the Chair – it is a bit of a difficult Chair.    I have got that Chair.    Chair that is correct.    Chair I will again make reference to our supplementary submission in that in the [indistinct   Chair ordinarily when one goes into perform work on – on contracts you would initially focus on new contracts.  If you had been auditing an entity for some time Chair you would have – you take comfort on the work that you have done previous years on – on – because you would of in the previous year’s selected new contracts for review and to the extent that you are provided with those contracts you have done sufficient audit work and those contractswould have – would run for a particular time.  So when we performed our audit Chair the initial focus it is on a new significant contracts.  That said Chair I think Chair that said as I indicate Chair, we did identify deficiencies.  We did identify challenges with regards to the contract register and there were elements where we could not be provided with contracts that were – that we had requested for audit purposes.  We raised the matter with the – with management and with the Audit Committee and Chair those deviations as I indicate should have been included in the audit – in thesematters  - we should have included them in the audit report.  So we did identify those issues Chair.    Chair, I will make sure that I will raise my voice.   That is correct Chair.    That is what is in my supplementary submission Chair.    Shall I read it out Chair?    “Irregular Expenditure and Fruitless and Wasteful    Oh.  I am competing with the... “Section 55(2)(b)(i) of the PFMA requires the SAA Group to include particulars of irregular expenditure in the notes to the financial statements. The SAA Group did not establish adequate controls to maintain complete records of irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure. We are not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to confirm the completeness of the amounts of irregular expenditure and fruitless and wastefulexpenditure disclosed in the ...[indistinct] report for the 2014 financial year and note 46 and 45 of the consolidated and separate financial statement for the 15 and the 2016 financial years...”    That is correct Chair.    Chair, that will be correct.    That is how my supplementary statement reads Chair.    That is correct Chair.    No, Chair.    I am attentive Chair.    Chair, thank you for the question and I do understand where Chair is coming from.  Chair, as I have indicated, we performed the work and when it came to the ...[indistinct] of the Audit Opinion there was significant time that had passed.And when we then ...[indistinct] opinions Chair, you then to go back and look at what... what had been identified, what is material and what is not material.When we received the first draft of the Audit Opinion Chair, because we had delegated that... and as partners we reviewed that.  Nothing had been highlighted by our team to indicate that there were additional(?) issues that need to come to the Audit Opinion.Chair, we had ...[indistinct] the matters in the management(?) report and in the Audit Committee documents.  And I do have to ...[indistinct] that once we have also gone back and also do that to ensure that everything has been included.Chair, in the 2014 year, in the first year, those matters would at that stage ...[indistinct] Chair, we had... we had... based on our professional(?) judgment Chair and review, we had thought they were not material.And I do believe that could have also influenced the view in subsequent years to say this matters had appeared, they were deemed immaterial and therefore in subsequent years, unless ...[indistinct] Chair, then probably(?) the conclusion was they are not material.And that is Chair one of the things why that could have happened the way it happened Chair.  And Chair, and I think... I do believe I have touched on it earlier Chair, that we also had the benefit of having attending all Audit Committee meetings.A representative of the office of the auditor general whoalso had access to all these reports and there is a summary that we did consult when there were difficult issues.For example, on the matter of the growing concern.  In fact, there were times where we did not necessarily agree because they felt... there was a view at some stage that we might be a little bit harsh.So when these matters came through Chair, we were also aware and they also did not... it did not come out from the former discussion that these matters... maybe we need to consider elevating them because they were also in a way asoundboard for us when we performed this work Chair.I do understand where the Chair is coming from and it is correct that we would consider previous matters when you ...[indistinct] for what.But Chair as I have indicated, when that report was put together, because for the first year we did not deem them as material.  Incorrectly so, as I admitted Chair in subsequent years, because they were not material.  It probably(?) influenced the way the team would have thought about them.  And in applying a ...[indistinct] judgment Chair.  That is where we could have got it wrong Chair.    That is correct.    Chair, we are the appointed auditors as PricewaterhouseCoopers and Nkonki in the ...[indistinct]opinion and therefore we are responsible for that.  I think that ...[indistinct]      Chair, that is correct.    That is correct Chair.   And as a consequence of that you say that you were unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence.  That the SAA Group maintained an appropriate procurement and provisioning system which is fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective.  Is that right?    But then I would like to go over the page, if we may, in your supplementary statement.  Chair, I am going to focus some attention on the language that Mr Mothibe uses.  So I suggest that it might be useful for you to have it in front of you.  You will find it in EXHIBIT DD19B which is in the first file.     Chair, as I have indicated earlier that with respect to the numbers in the financial statements, we had done sufficient work.  We obtained the necessary audit evidence and that the numbers, as far as they are disclosed in the financial statements, are free of material statement Chair.And the Audit Opinion in terms of those numbers Chair iscorrect and I do stand by that Chair.    No, Chair.  As I said that I stand by the statement that I have made.    As it is Chair.    Chair, I respectfully disagree with what MsHofmeyr is saying.  As I do explain Chair.  The work we performed on the numbers in terms of that we... ISIS and in compliance with IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards, that was adequate.  The numbers that I disclosed in the financial statements are correct.  The work that we do around procurement and supply chain management and all irregular and fruitless expenditure.  Chair, that is on the compliance side and it relates to the quality of the numbers.  But on the quantum of the numbers Chair, I stand by my statement I have made ...[indistinct]     It is the quantum Chair.    And that is what ...[intervenes]     The quality is... then the question that youask is, will you then address the compliance with a supply chain management Chair.  You say ...[intervenes]     Even if you did not follow due process.    You might find that of the R 2 million... let us say half a million ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]     And therefore, you will then disclose half a million under irregular expenditure.    But the fact that the money was spent onrefreshments that will change.  If you still spend on that, there was a service provider who delivered.  You have got the invoice.  You paid them.  It has gone through the ...[indistinct] of the payment process.  There is going ...[indistinct] [coughing] authorisations and it has been paid.    Chair, those are... that ...[indistinct] Chair that it is on the supply chain.    Supply Chain.    It ...[intervenes]     Chair, we said that we had done sufficient work.We reported to the Audit Committee and to Management but we did not report to the shareholders.    So... and I think that we should clarify Chair.  We did sufficient work.  The error that we made Chair is in the report... on the reporting side Chair.  And I do not know if Chair ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]     Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I do see those words.  And Chair, maybe if I read this sentence again.   “However, I remain of the view that despite these omissions, the annual financial statements for those financial years in terms of IFRS are free of material statement and that sufficient audit work was performed and appropriate audit evidence was obtained to support the audit opinions...”So Chair, I do not know if I am repeating myself Chair, but I hear where Ms Hofmeyr is coming from but those areas Chair that she is talking to are not areas of ...[indistinct] of the IFRS of the ISIS.Those are areas of compliance with law and regulations.  They do not impact your balance sheet, your income statement and your statement of cash-flows.And hence I am saying Chair, the ...[indistinct]... the numbers were correct in ...[indistinct] statement Chair.  And I consider that irrespective(?) of irregularexpenditure and wasteful expenditure the... that portion of the Audit Opinion should have read differently.    Only with respect to fruitless and wasteful expenditure Chair.    And irregular expenditure.     Chair, the limitation of scope as it was does – was not in relation to the numbers disclosed in the financial statements.  It related to – specifically to the area of irregular and fruitless expenditure.  So on that basis, Chair, the whole set of financial statements would not be qualified in that regard then.    That is correct.     Chair, it is also important note that whilst – I understand where Ms Hofmeyr is coming from, Chair, one then needs to assess the materiality of that in relation to the financial statements as a whole.  So by just takingthem as a whole, Chair, cannot be qualified, Chair, on the basis of those two matters.Chair, if I look at the audit opinion of the AG, Chair, if you will just give me a second?  I just wanted to look at they have worded this, Chair, because in line with how I have worded my opinion.  Chair, when you qualify financial statements it is based on the fair representation or whether there is a material misstatement on the numbers as a whole.  So if on a whole the financial statements are not materially misstated, Chair, then it is not qualifying, wemight qualify an aspect of it.  This statement, Chair, I make here, I stand by it, I do not believe that what I – that on the numbers is incorrect, Chair.  I am comfortable that those numbers were fairly stated and that, as I indicate in my summary statement, that on irregular and fruitless expenditure, I did not – there were limitations and therefore I would not have been able to give the opinion that I initially gave, Chair.  I should have said – indicated that I was not able to obtain sufficient evidence because of the fact that SAA did not have in place sufficient controls to determine fruitless and wasteful expenditure.     No, there were never [indistinct] 03.27 qualified whole audit, Chair, no.     Not on their own, Chair, no.     Chair, as I indicated, when I explained the difference between the qualitative and quantitative, say on the quantities that are included in the financial statements are correct.  We did sufficient work on that, we obtained sufficient audit evidence, Chair.   It is the – the quantities matters on supply chain management, that is where there were challenges, Chair.  So that, Chair, that on its own, can never lead to the qualification of the audit opinion unless you say – unless on the numbers included in the financial statements there were areas where there was limitation and ones that are not able to obtain sufficient evidence and importantly, Chair, whether it is pervasive or it is material or not andwhether it is limited to specific areas, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.      Chair, I make a reference to my auditopinion, if you...  Chair, as I did mention earlier that importantly, one will never give assurance on internal controls because we do not audit internal controls – well, audit all controls for the entity, then we only comment on the internal controls that are relevant and to the audit and ones that we have tested and in the opinion we see that we did not identify any deficiencies in internal controls that we considered significantly or significant for inclusion in the report.  So, Chair, it is important to say we are not giving assurance and we are not saying that there were no internal control [indistinct] but then when we give the opinion, we said we [indistinct] that were sufficiently significant for inclusion, Chair.     That is a fair statement, Chair.     Yes, I do know Mr Vilakazi.     He was the Chief Audit Executive, pardon, let me call it, the Head of Internal Audit, Chair.    And do you know that there was a tender for dry snacks which was initially awarded to Mantelli’s Biscuits in 2014 but subsequently cancelled?     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, I am aware of the issues around that tender and what transpired.     Chair, I am aware of complaints that weremade to IRBA in that regard.     Yes, I am also aware of that, Chair.     Yes.     Chair, I am aware that there were issues in there, Chair, but I am trying to recall if I had seen that, Chair, but I am aware that there was investigation there, Chair.     Chair, I am aware that there was assurance done on internal audit department SAA.     Chair, that report was discussed at one of the audit committees.     It was discussed at the audit committees, yes, Chair. ADV     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, as Ms Hofmeyr had mentioned earlier, it was a fairly new internal audit department and it was in a developing stage.  So, Chair, I would not categorise as not necessarily functioning well but obviously because it was new, developing, there wouldsignificantly have been room for improvement in a lot of areas, Chair.     Chair, that is not within the scope of external audit, Chair.     Chair, internal audit, first of all, Chair, if one looks at the control environment that we have looked at for audit purposes, Chair, it is the business processes and the management processes.  Internal audit  is anassurance provider not to dissimilar from what we provide, Chair.  So when it comes to internal controls, Chair, they do not necessarily form the core of internal controls in the business, we look at the work that internal audit has performed which helps us identify areas that we needed to focus on from a risk perspective, Chair, but as an actual control, Chair, on its own, internal control, Chair, it is not the sole indicator, Chair, if I can say that, of strong internal controls.  It is management, it is best processes that has been documented and like us, there are assuranceproviders and they look at that, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Can I ask you to repeat that, Chair?     I think you are being unfair because that is definitely not what I am suggesting.      I accept that we look at internal controls and that we comment where we identify significant weaknesses but importantly, Chair, as I mentioned, that we do not give assurance for internal controls.     Chair, the statement say we did not identify any sufficiently significant to report, Chair, not to say we did not identify any [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     That is what we said, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, as I indicated we do receive reports of internal auditor, we do have sight of them and they assist us in identifying areas of risk and what we can focuson and certainly, Chair, if one looks at the reports of internal audit  over the years, Chair, the quality thereof, there was an improvement, Chair.     Chair, again, it is difficult for me tocomment on environment that the Auditor-General found versus when we were there, Chair.     Chair, if I reflect, we had the same CFO from the time I became audit partner who left at the end of 15 replaced by one individual who was there when we left.  Chair, the positions –the other positions, Chair, theposition of CEO was filled at all times when we were there.  The positions of Chief Commercial Officer was filled when we were there.  Even, Chair, the important positions of head of procurement, they were not taken, there were persons occupying those positions and, Chair, what was important to us was their ability to deliver and, Chair, we did not find challenges in that regard.     Chair, there were documented policies and procedures at SAA.     Chair, in our mentioned reports and report to audit committee, whilst we identified we did have issues in the IT space but there was a head of IT who was I would like to think competent, Chair, and attended all audit committee meetings and reported back at every meeting, Chair, and audits that they were running and how they were tracking, Chair.     Chair, as I indicated, all the key positions that were [indistinct]  those offices were occupied at all times when we were at South African Airways.  Issues were raised and in the audit committee meetings, as far as I can remember, Chair, there were questions asked of them to understand why matters have not been dealt with, Chair.     Chair, I did indicate earlier that when we determined our audit approach for South African Airways we did a risk assessment, we looked at the company, the structure, its complexity to understand how everything fits together, Chair, and at a stage we determined that we were going to adopt substantive audit approach because we were not going to fully rely on controls, Chair.  So I do not know if that answers Ms Hofmeyr’s question.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I think for starters, from PwC’s side and I do think it probably applies the same for Nkonki that we would never on an assignment that we are not able to deliver on and that we arecompetent to deliver on.  Chair, we did work, we identified deficiencies, we raised them with management, we also raised them with the audit committee and we have conceded that we should have elevated them in the audit report because I think, Chair, if they were elevated the report would have had the same as the AG’s report reads.   So I am confident, Chair, that both firms have done the work.  The work was done, definitely, Chair.  There was fairly delivered.  What we had erred in was not elevating those last elements as I said including into the auditopinion.Chair, in as far as whether we should have seen some of these ones that we did not see, Chair, there is an inherent limitation, Chair, of audit sampling where – and I think I alluded to it earlier that this was the approach from the – the ones that we saw we did report.  The ones that we did not see, because of audit sampling, Chair, there are important issues, had we seen them we would have definitely, Chair, followed the – in short that they are reported appropriately, Chair.  So I do not know if that covers the question, Chair.     Thank you very much, Chair, for your indulgence, thank you for the time. 
MOTHIBE:The article does set out important information Chair.  Chair, apologies, I’m trying to…[intervenes].  Chair, the numbers in the financial statements relate to actual expenditure that has gone through Chair, and those numbers are correct.  Hence, the statement that I made that I am of the view that despite the omissions, the financial statements fairly present or for those years, fairly present what happened at SAA ...[indistinct] statement and sufficient audit was done.With respect to irregular and fruitless expenditure there.  Chair, it is more the... should I say... I hope it is the right word, is the quality of the numbers, not the quantum.So the fair presentation here is the quantum that... if wesay, for example Chair, if we only(?) said...  Let us say expenses ...[indistinct] or let us say for refreshments was R 2 million.  That fee of R 2 million is correct.When you talk about the irregular expenditure it is then whether or not those refreshment were required using the appropriate CM process.So the disclosure of that number as a... under fruitless and wasteful expenditure or irregular, might be... might not be correct but in your income statement, that disclose is correct.Because Chair, the expenditure was incurred.  There were invoices for that.  They went through the appropriate payment processes and they were settled.So from origination to liquidation, they have gone through the necessary process.  Hence, I am able to... I am comfortable that my statement in my supplementary submission is correct Chair and I stand by it Chair.  Yes.How was it acquired in the ...[indistinct] process. 
HOFMEYR:Apologies.The Internal Control Department within SAA would regularly review its own processes, would it not?  No, you were filing on the 30t h of September.  Should you not have contented yourself that those documents had been made available to you before you signed off?  And the consequences of those concessions Mr Mothibe is that the Audit Opinions for all three of those years were incorrect.  Is that right?  And that was attributed to the inexperience of staff and the failure of more senior members within internal audit to take full accountability for their work.  Were you aware of that?

Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth, if so please raise your right hand and say I truly affirm. 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman I do, thank you very much.     Is that fine?     Mafika Edmund Mkwanazi.     I do not have any objection.     I truly affirm.     Okay, alright, thanks.    Yes it is only myself, nobody else.     No I will not be receiving messages, naturally except for the documents that you forwarded to me.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I have two university degrees, one fromthe University of Zululand which is a BSC in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and the second one is a degree from the University of Natal in Electrical Engineering, and then I do have a couple of diplomas from – it is from Wits University etcetera, but those are short duration diplomas.     That is correct.     Advocate Amy you – I have been with Transnet maybe 19 or 20 years because I started there in 1996 as an Executive Director, then I left in 2003 being a Group CEO.  Then I rejoined Transnet in December 2010 and I left in December 2014, so I have had different types of roles the latest one being that of being non-executive Chairman from 2010 to 2014.     That would be MM027?     Am I correct, okay.  Okay, I have got a computer in front of me, scrolling down, let me see I am on page 25, 27, yes I am there.     Yes.     That is correct yes.    That is correct Chair.      That is correct.     Acting Group Chief Executive.     Ja, it is that time yes.     That is correct.     Yes?     I was non-Executive Director, I had beenthere before by the way in the late nineties, I was on the Board of the Eskom Council then, they were called Eskom Council, it could have been 1995 or 1996, it was for a brief period, maybe two years.  Then in 2011, June  - ja 2011, around June, the Minister appointed me to the Board of Eskom as a non-Executive Director.     I think it was December 2014.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes it is my signature.     Yes.     No, no that is incorrect, there is no “h”. ADV     It is the same family Chair, because inmy family there are four children, two of the children have an “h”, two of the children do not have an “h”, it was the Home Affairs that decided what.     No     It is yes.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes I have Chairperson.     Ja, I have Chairman, I met them twice around that time when they were talking me going to their house, then when we say Guptas it is an interesting family, yes I met them that.     But then I met them at some of their events, if I can call them like at the TNA breakfasts, I met their employees, not necessarily the Gupta Family.      Yes.     Yes, I got a call in January 2011 from a Mr Tony Gupta who indicated to me that he had got my cell phone number from Minister Gigaba and requested to seeme.  I agreed to see him or – and then they gave me details of where they stayed and I – we agreed on a date, I don’t recall the date exactly and I went to visit them at their house somewhere in Saxonwold if I recall, and yes on arrival at that gate we met the security, then I come through the gate and then I drive through something like a drive through where I then stop the car, told to stop the car in front of an entrance, get out of the car, then walk up the stairs because the protocol there seemingly was you drive your car in, then they drive the car to where they park it.   You don’t know where exactly they park it.So then I got into the house and there was another protocol, I recall I think I had to take off my shoes and then went to this venue where this meeting was going to be held.  And in that room, I then got introduced to the people I wasgoing to meet.  One of them was Tony Gupta and the other was Duduzane Zuma.  Upon meeting them we had what I would call general discussions or pleasantries.  They introduced themselves told me that they were involved in mining, computers.  They employed well over 10 000 people in the country in terms of whatever they were doing and of course I had reciprocate I told them that no I am an entrepreneur and at that time I was working on a project to try and do something in KZN which was an ambitious project of property development and therefore we shared that andthen we came to the main purpose of the discussion which was – they made me aware that they are friends of President Zuma which is fine and then they made me aware that they are aware that Transnet has a marketing budget of R1 billion.  I am not sure where they got that from and they therefore wanted to be allocated 30 – 50% of that marketing budget.  And of course, I told them that Transnet has got a method of procuring anything through a procurement manual.  They issue RFI’s, RFQ’s and RFP’s – request for proposals etcetera before they take decisions on things like those as a matter of principle.  But also, me as an individual even though I was seeing them at that time you need to understand I might have been acting GCE but I did not behave like an acting GCE I behaved like a non-executive Chairman.  So I made them aware that hold it youare actually talking to the wrong person.  Because I am non-executive chairman.  People who get involved in procurement matters are executives and in that case whatever their levels are but it is executives in the various areas of the organisation.  And of course they then went about telling me how close they are to the President.  They – they meet him once a week.  He comes to their social functions and yes also as he comes to their social function you could see that these people are deep friends with the President.  They even shared that at virtually a week hevisits their house etcetera, etcetera.  And therefore, in terms of the – they entertaining that they do they claim that occasionally the President sings for them Umshini Wami, Umshini Wami.  Naturally whatever they were saying I – well did not go down well with me.  I felt they were abusing their friendship with the President and – but I did ask Duduzane to confirm if these people are actually friends of your father and he did confirm.  And that in a nutshell would be how we met but it did not – the meeting did not end on a good note because they – they were too boisterous as if they control a lot of things that I knew they were lying about ja.  So yes that was my first meeting with them on that first occasion.  Then post that meeting.    Because the – let me pause.   Ja he confirmed that you are Mr Mkwanazi etcetera, etcetera.  I said ja.  And he said we have been given your number by Mr Mahlusi Gigaba and we would like to meet you.  Then I said okay fine I can meet you.  It is not a big issue.  Ja.    Yes I had read about them in terms some of their involvement with the some of the black business people in the country around that time.  Yes I had read about them.    But I did not know which one in terms of – it was just like the Gupta family who deal with various peopleat the time. Some big names in the BEE space if I can use the word.    Do not forget I felt I should attend this meeting because you cannot quote my Minister and then I do not respond in a particular way.  So yes I felt I should attend that meeting because somehow, I already knew that theseare important people.  I read about some of the investments that they had done in the country.  So yes I felt I had to meet them.    My details.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  Yes.    That is correct Chair.  Yes.    Yes.    Mr Chairman I had.    Because I had met Mr Gigaba around October of that year.  I had known Mr Gigaba while he was in the ANC Youth League.    So yes.    He has got my numbers.    That – my numbers for – yes.    No I had never spoken to him before.    All I recall I think it was a white painted house or light grey.  It had big gates with very high pillars on both sides and I think it had a guard house as well somewhere in there.  And naturally I only saw a portion ofthe house maybe 5% of the house.  I did not see the rest of it because all I saw was how to get in, drive to the entrance that is basically it.  In the house and then into the meeting room.    Not too many but all I can indicate it looked like a highly guarded home.  Because even as you entered there was maybe two security at the gate – two security personnel.  And of course, you entered but what was interesting about just a strange observation I do not think I saw a black security guard and I do not think I saw a black worker inside who gave tea or things like those.  So yes thatis how I remember the house.  And then I went inside and went into that board room where we were offered Coke Cola to drink etcetera.  Ja but that is it.    My cell phone was on me at all times.  They did not demand it or something like that ja.    That was how many years ago.  Chair I am not sure now.    Frankly…    You are asking me a difficult question.    The next thing you will ask me was there a portrait, what was the colour of the wall?  How many corners were there when you turned right or turned left?  I do not recall.    No there was nobody and it was just the three of us.    Ja.    That is correct.    Yes that is correct.    Chair – I did not know then but that was so incorrect and false.  Why I would know because at some stage I was on the South African Airways board and the entity within Transnet at the time that spent a lot of money on marketing was actually SAA.  And in 2010 or 2011 SAA was out of Transnet by that time so this figure of R1 billion was a thumb suck.   Chairman it would not have been even though I – at that time I had not even checked what amount the budget was.  But my knowledge of that entity was deep enough to know that this figure of R1 billion is just a thumb suck.     Is that MM?    Oh.    I am on that page yes.    Thank you for that clarification.   Duduzane I knew the name but we had never met.    So yes I met him and Tony Gupta I heard the names – even right now they – that two of them I am notsure what their names are but one is light complexion, the other one is a little bit darker.  So yes I met Tony Gupta then and that is it.    And of course, I did meet Duduzane again at a different second meeting.    They did try to – to indicate that they are friends with cabinet Ministers and members of Parliament etcetera, etcetera and ja but in my view they were like trying to portray a figure of, we are these important people that we are friends with your cabinet Ministers.  It did not intimidate me or anything.  Even when they said they are friends with the President I was not at all intimidated.    Sort of – they said they would like to look into it but not that they would invest.  Ja they – he said they would like to know more about it but that whole thing did not get off the ground whatever I was trying to do in KZN.   Yes to them ja.    Do not forget in my interpretation of their approach they had no clue about how business works – zeroclue.  They behaved as if Transnet is like a spaza shop who when somebody comes and say give me 30% of this we just give.  So they had no clue about business protocols, how to run businesses.  So which is why then even when they came with that figure of R1 billion they asked for this 30 – 50% I could see that for some reason these people have never been in business and now I must educate them that this is how an organisation like Transnet procures for services whatever services they are.  And of course, I did indicate to them that we – Transnet procures in a particular way following a – a procurement manual.    Yes I did because from where I sat I feltthat the loop is not properly closed.  I personally wanted that somebody from within the Department be present to hear what I call these dreamers talking about R1 billion marketing budget and asking for 30 – 50% of that.  So I did say I would like to have a second meeting with you guys.    Almost weekly yes.    Ja.    They said that yes.    Oh it is one guy.    It is Tony.    No, no.  Duduzane never uttered a word.    Never uttered a word.    Tony Gupta was talking.  At some stage I had to ask Duduzane are these people telling the truth about their relationship with your father.  That is the only time he opened his mouth and he confirmed it that they are friends with the President.    That is correct Chair.  He was abnormally silent.   That is correct.    Yes I said so that when I say in their house, at their functions.  I do not know what functions that there is.    It is like maybe they entertain a lot, callpeople to a hall or gatherings, yes he did.    Thank you Chair.  Naturally as I indicated post this meeting when I got the request then to that second meeting, I did brief Advocate – the good advocate Mhlangu that Mahlangu look I have been – I have a first meeting with Tony and I want you to be present because…   I want you to – I want to have a witness.    He was the advisor to Minister Gigaba.    Yes the first meeting Chair did not go very well because somehow, I got angry when – in my interpretation they were beginning to denigrate my President.  So I got very agitated.  So the first meeting did not go very well.  Then they suggested that we meet again and I agreed because in my mind then I knew that I wantedto bring a witness to see these types of business people.  So I did brief Advocate Mahlangu that there is a meeting I want you to come to it to be a witness at – so that you see how some people behave under the guise of being sent by – or being – having got my phone numbers from Minister Gigaba.  So yes he agreed to join me at that particular date.    Yes they did.  They did and I said I amcoming and I am going to bring a witness with.    Tony Gupta.    That is correct.    You know maybe I am a strange individual.  I do not elevate what I can call nonsensical stories to the Minister.  To me these people were talking nonsensical stories which is why I just needed somebody.  It could have been another person as long as maybe that somebody was at Public Enterprises.  If in case it is true that the Minister gave these people my number so that is why then I askedMahlangu – Advocate Mahlangu to accompany me.    No, no.  We – no we did not drive together.  I used my car and most probably used his as well.  Because we would not have come from the same direction.    I am not sure if I found him there or if he found me there but we were both at that meeting at aroundabout that time that was set for the meeting.  And then we – ja.    No, no Tony Gupta and Duduzane Zuma.    No it is a follow up and I explained why Advocate was there so that in front of an official of the Department who works for the Minister I am explaining to you guys as whatever the company TNA or Sahara whatever they are called that this is how Transnet procures.  They did repeat their request that they are requesting this 30 – 50% of the marketing. BREAK IN RECORDING – WITNESS INAUDIBLE   [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     No, no.  [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     I am not sure ...[indistinct]     [Indistinct]     No, no, no. [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     Not in so much detail but he did confirm that, yes. [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     [laughs]     [laughs]    [Indistinct]     [Indistinct]     No, same response that all that, now it is four of us.  It is myself, it is Advocate Mashala, Duduzane and Tony.  That this is how... of course, I did not know the marketing budget of Transnet net or even in the first meeting.I did not know because I am only here at Transnet maybe two months.  Then I have got to know all these budgets, et cetera, et cetera.  It is impractical.So I still made them aware that frankly I do not know how big that budget is.  Also, the process is you follow a RFP, RFI or RFQ through executives in the company.  Not through a non-executive chairman.    That they accepted my explanation.    I do not think they took it well in the firstmeeting.  That is why then the suggestion was we need to meet again.  But even myself, their approach, I did not take it well because they were waving the flag of being friends of the president rather than talking what they want to talk and I was terrible annoyed, ja.     No, [laughs] I did not.  As I indicate, I am not a person who speak to the minister every week or every month.  I do not do that.  I have an agenda and a meeting scheduled if I need to speak to the minister.    Yes, sort of.  But at least I achieved something as well in terms of the fact that I now brought somebody who is close to government, who has explained to these gentlemen that that is not how state-owned entities operate.    Yes, yes.  It is so, ja.   Chairman, I do not think you would have confirmed anything because I doubt if he would have known himself to.    In terms of how things are done.    Because he is an outsider.    Ja.    He did observe, yes.   Ja.  Yes, Chair.    No, there was no change because the things that we do... there are certain meetings that we hold, almost like quarterly meetings with him or once in six monthsmeeting with him under certain conditions.  Those meetings went ahead.  I did not see any change whatsoever in him.    Yes.    Maybe not quite well Chair but I knew him, yes.    Maybe two weeks.    Okay.     Yes, I am.    [laughs] To read it is an understatement.  It was a shocker.      Ja, it is.    Yes, I do recall that article and the conclusion.  And also, my understanding was that somehow some of the cabinet members were not privy to that plan.  And they only read about it on the day of that meeting whatever Cabinet meeting it was.  So they felt that it should have been discussed in more detail, some Cabinet ministers.      Hold it.  I am not sure if he was successful in removing me because I was not removed at Transnet.    Ja, okay.    I would have.    That is correct Chair.    Chair, I understood what the article was saying, particularly the headline.  Chairman of Transnet, Eskom and Denel to go.   And naturally why somehow it was a big shock.  This has never been discussed with me that I would leave Transnet.  But other things in various meetings with the minister and other key ministers, we had discussed in my presence the question of SOC Board Chairman sitting in various state-owned entity boards for certain collaborations by state-owned entities.  So I was not surprised that I was going to be proposed to go Eskom but what surprised me was that then I was going to be fired from Transnet and yet at a strategy discussion that we would have had a few months before, we did discuss these issues of Chairman of SOC Boards.So that you said you get certain collaborations owning between certain types of SOC’s.     Yes.    That is correct, Chair.  We did have a forum like that.  And the two key ministers who used to attend was Minister Gigaba and Minister Patel andoccasionally two other Cabinet Ministers.    He was the chairman of those meetings, Chairman.    That was new, Chairman.    Okay.    MM38.  I have got that.    [laughs] I have got no idea.    [laughs] I have got no idea.    The outcome?    No, the outcome.  I was not replaced.    Chairman, we did talk about the article after it had appeared and his response was somebody had leaked something which was work in progress and therefore it was leaked in a wrong way.    We did discuss it.     Chairman, I did not ask him ...[intervenes]     ...as straightforward, as you say.    But his response was there was work in progress within his department and it was leaked to the press.    Chairman, what he told me is different to what had been submitted to Cabinet.    But I am not privy to the Cabinet debate ...[intervenes]     ...around the ...[intervenes]     ...why Mr Iqbal Sharma should become chairman.   No, Chairman. [laughs]    No, Chair.  Because he had done it.  It is just that he did not get the approval of that resolution at Cabinet level.  He had already done it.  As I see in terms of this Cabinet memo.    Well, after this article had appeared...  I am not privy to... it is the first time I am see this document.  Thank you very much.  This Cabinet memo.    I have never seen it.  So post the article, because also other board members were now asking me questions that we have read that you have been fired.  So that is why then I had to go to him to try and find out but “Minister, what is this article about?” Then he said no... He did not sound as if he had already pushed through a Cab memo or something which then might have been rejected.He said no, maybe... it goes like, there was work in progress on changing boards inside the public enterprises and that then something got leaked, et cetera, et cetera.But I was aware there is a process within public enterprises to formulate this Strategy-U of chairman of various entities sittings elsewhere to get certain collaboration on various topics.Local manufacturing,exporting, training...There were a few key strategy topics that we wanted to try and address by this sharing of board members in that particular forum, ja.    I was not aware.  It is only when I read is this article.   Not really but maybe there could be.  I do not know.    Chair, I do not know but the forum where these things were discussed... we did not discuss in that detail ...[intervenes]     ...because it was more high-level strategy forum ...[intervenes]     ...of discussing these issues.    Yes.    No, we did not discuss that.    I would have discussed that with some board member or something like that but in passing.  Not in detail.     That is correct.    That is correct Chair.  Yes.    That is correct.      It is short.    You said 23?     Yes, I have got it, yes.     Yes.     Yes.       Yes.     When I say to comment no, but meaning the fact that they wrote what they wrote, I must have spoken to them based on the questions that they were asking, Yes.     Yes.     I did describe it like that but to say isthat correct, it is correct that I met them on the day that I met them at the house but then, you know, the media is a strange animal because I would not like to discuss certain matters of how I run companies through the media, which is why I responded this way.     Yes.     It is a strong word, yes, I must say, yes.      No.  No.    Yes, I met them, yes.     Chairman, personal relationship is toostrong a word for two meetings I had which maybe lasted an hour and a half in total, both of them.     No, at the time I used it because I wanted to dismiss the media off my back.  They were onto too many issues, if I can use the word.     Chairman, you know, the use of the English language when you are a Zulu-speaking person gets a little bit tricky.  But yes, I did have two meetings with them and I did say that I had a personal relationship with them.    Yes.     That is correct, yes.     Yes, I am not sure why have that in - you know, as if it is a quotation but that matter was never ever touched on again of what I was trying to do there in KZN because it never happened, it fell through almost thatsame week or two weeks later.      Ja.     That is correct.     No, I did not.     No, I did not.     It is not in my nature to start discussing what I can call board issues or company issues with the media.  There are many of other issues, by the way, in the past 20 years, 21 years I have been at Transnet that I have never discussed with the media in terms of whatever they might have been.     What had been discussed?    No, I did not discuss that with the board. You need to understand one strange thing about state owned entities.  In a year when you are like a Chairman or Group Chief Executive you get hundred proposals or calls from people who want to procure something from your organisation.  It is so common and it includes everybody.  At times it starts even with the President himself..     Exactly, exactly, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.  Just another  example, at these TNA breakfasts, which  attended 8 to 10, whatever the number is, people would queue to talk to me and ask for business opportunities in Transnet.  Of course, as a civil servant I would stand in a queue, they would come or they want to talk.  This one goes, this one goes.  Ja, it is part of my job.     Yes, it was unusual, yes.     No, I did not.     No, I did not.     Include which information?     No, I did not.  I did not see a need to do that, ja..     No, I did not.     You can see they are fishing..     I could have, ja.     No.     Chairman, we have never discussed that matter.     Even today or – we have never discussed that.     No, I was not aware of any – I only became aware of these approaches once the Commission was set up and Maseko and others and a lot of other people did come to the Commission to make inputs.  Then to my mine it was – this thing was quite common at the time, ja.   I did not know.     No.     Do not forget – maybe let me put itdifferently, the answer is no because at some stage, if you recall, the Secretary General of the ruling party did ask people to come to Luthuli House, etcetera, etcetera.  I felt that these people are not honest.  They themselves know what is happening, so I did not even go there.     Chairman, yes, I was not going go.  If I recall, maybe it is only Themba Maseko who went to see Mr Gwede Mantashe at the time but I felt that whatever the Gupta family is doing, it is a well-known thing within the ruling party.     That is correct.    That is correct, yes.     I did, yes.    No, it did concern me.  You somehow need to understand the procurement systems of state owned entities whereby they have various committees to procure things up to a certain amount and then up to the CEO level.  In this case it would have been Brian Molefe.Brian Molefe had the full authority to procure certain things, whatever they might be, up to a certain limit and then above a certain amount of above a certain timeframe, then those things needed to be elevated to the board.The fact that, yes, I was now going to these breakfasts, yes, it is true but the CEO would have then applied his mind whether is it worth that - using his discretion and his delegated authority.     I am not sure what…     Did you pick that up?     So can I repeat?     Then I will respond again.     That is correct, Chair, yes.     They had followed the processes, yes.     Chairman, I am happy to continue.     I am settled Chair.     When you say page 8 can you use the MM’s is it MM8?    Okay.   Ja I’ve got it.     Yes.     I’ve got no comment.     I said – Chairman I said no comment because I don’t know whether it’s true or not true.    Oh yes, man years ago Chair.     Yes.    No comment still, because I’m not the type of person who reports almost minor things to a Minister, to me that was minor.     Yes.     That is correct Chair.   I don’t know but I didn’t tell the Minister that I’m taking Siyabonga to that meeting it was something I raised between myself and Siyabonga.      Of the three documents?     No we can talk off the cuff ja.     I think it was June 2011 to December 14.     That is correct Chairman.    That is correct Advocate.     That is correct after the people – the forensic people had finished their work, yes.     That is correct Chairman.     At the high level Chair it concluded on two issues or two individuals  it concluded that the R43million contract was irregular and it concluded that the clause – the exit clause that was supposed to be there which was removed by somebody, that was wrong of that somebody to do that and it concluded that the acting CEO at the time did not have the authority to conclude thatcontract because there was no budget and they also – there was not proper approval because such contracts, above say R3million, was supposed to be approved by the EXCO of Eskom and that was not done.     That is correct Chair, ja.     Yes, it’s Chose Choeu, that is correctChair.     Yes, what page Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That is correct yes.     That’s my understanding yes.     That is my understanding.     That’s my understanding because still he was within the scope, I think he reverted back to a non-Executive Director position.     That is correct.     That’s my understanding yes.     You need to go back to the actual PFMA and in this case it was irregular yes because he exceeded the delegation they did not fall – had an exit clause etcetera.  Now, whether it was fruitless and wasteful, somebody else then – a specialist in analysis of what value did the company get out of that R43million needs to be done and then based on that then the Board can then define it as a fruitless and wasteful expenditure unless you’ve got somebody doing that analysis, at the time we had not done that analysis as a Board.     Yes.    The irregularity is a given and the wrong clause is a given they shouldn’t have done that but whether then, as auditors and as an Audit Committee how do you then define this, you need to apply your mind.  Yes, it would have been irregular in a particular way unless regularised by a Board but then conditional regularisation on condition that you take action against the two Executives involved.    I agree Chair, yes that’s fruitless and wasteful.     That is correct Chair, there was no budget.     That’s correct Chair.    To a certain extent I know, how can you have a contract with no exit clause, that’s a bad contract.     That’s a bad contract.     That is correct Chair.     Chair that is correct but in this instance, because there was an exit clause in a preliminary contract.     And also, he fact that there was no budget for this thing at all and at that time Eskom was experiencing financial problems and then you go out there with no budget and you try and spend R43million, that’s a bad contract.     That’s correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That’s correct.     Please, was not in a good position we were beginning to make losses if I recall also the Regulator was on our back about cutting down on expenses etcetera, etcetera.     That’s correct Chair.     That is correct Chair, ja.     That’s my recollection because we were preparing to handover to the new Board and that is why she insisted that, that be captured.     That’s correct ja.     Ja that’s correct Chair.     Chair, you need to have a budget for every line expenditure in your organisation.    That’s why this, frankly, was not correct.     That’s correct Chair.     Chairman it does not change anything because this is a record of that last Board, which then would have been handed over to the new Board which started in January 2015 and there – in the resolution below on that there are clear statements that indicate that there are certain irregular things that did happen.  And whether but the contract was there – yes – but it is the technicality of irregular, no exit clause, no authority etcetera that must be handed over to the new board.    That is my understanding Chair.    At that particular meeting but do not forget if that old board had had one more meeting because that was an issue of the auditors as well putting pressure on us to fix this irregular expenditure.  So the old board in my interpretation having articulated what we had done would have ratified that contract conditionally to disciplinary action being taken against the two gentlemen who were basically the authors of this document.  But that old board did not get the time to – to actually come to that point because now it was handing over.   Chair yes it would have been a conditional ratification because do not forget in the external auditors would have defined it fully as irregular – it has not been ratified.  So you ratify it that we understand it was irregularetcetera and we have taken these steps so we now adopt it as board that this contract can continue to its termination.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.   Chair in other words let me clarify.    Chair these types of contracts particularly in the issue of marketing and marketing contracts.  The definition of value is quite difficult because you – you then need to quantify the number of hours that you got on exposure through television and you must quantify it in numbers that per flitting of an ad or anything and also you – at the time if you recall there was a special messaging that Eskom was going to the public with – in terms of trying to talk about the load shedding and all the other things and people saving electricity.  So there was an element of value but the issue is was that value worth R43 million that is the exercise that needed to be done.  But there was value inEskom trying to have this publicity in terms of what they were trying to achieve as an organisation.  Because they were talking about the advertisements that was flitted.  They    Ja.  No, not fruit.    Chair there are two issues here.  One is the irregular contract that the board would have ratified.     But the fruitless and wasteful part of itwould have required more work.    To determine if there was any value that Eskom got out of that contract.    Chair there are two issues here maybe you are confusing the issues.    There was a board that ended its term in December.    We are talking about that board.    I was part of that board.    Then there – there is a new board that took over in January it was chaired by Zola.    By Zola.    And the – subsequent to that there was on the board chaired by Doctor Ben Ngubane.    It is those two boards that then took a different view on what to do with this contract.  This board that I was part of was still evaluating the options.    It did not execute the ratification.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes Chair.    No there are two approvals Chair that are needed.    On a contract like this.  The one approvalis the irregular that we could have done because then…    You avoid …    This board – my board could have done that Chair.    But the approval of fruitless and wasteful even my board would not have been able to get it until a different report would have come out on what value did youget out of this contract.    2014.    Chair you are not too harsh but at the time…    I am thinking [indistinct 00   So for that to fix the irregularity.    Would have been helpful.    But mentioning that there is potential fruitless and wasteful expenditure coming.    And it is normal in companies that it actually comes after – almost at the conclusion because of the project.    You then say, hold it this project – this is the value I was supposed to get but I only get this value.    So the difference is that yes there wouldhave been a fruitless and wasteful expenditure.    In another board.    In another audit.    To say that matter you fix the irregularity but fruitless and wasteful expenditure yes it is recognise it because it is something carefully wants you to articulate would have done that.   That is correct.    If I – handover board.    Yes.  We could have.    Ja.    The fruitless and wasteful would have been dealt with following that.    That is correct.    That is correct yes. ADV    We waited – which board now took …    My board or the new board?    Chair if I – if I –     We will give you indulgence Chair.      [indistinct]       Can I respond?      It is an opinion.  Now the old board had two reports the Dedoro Muswayo [?] Report and the Gomoto Report [?] and those reports were clear.  Anybody who wouldhave taken those two reports and read them thoroughly now being the new board.  I am not sure how they have arrived at a different conclusion.  I am really not sure.  Now even in terms of say can you do this telecom or Round Robin firstly to read the two reports before you can commit to a telecom or a Round Robin on an important subject like this because it is not easy to discipline a Chief Executive of an organisation.  It is quite a process.  So yes they needed the two reports and the two conclusions before they would have taken the decision, they took in June 2015 to ratify a contract yes.    Chair may I yes.   I think they were handed over.  That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  That is correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.    I have got an electronic one.    Thank you very much I thank you. 
MS HOFMEYR:   Mr Mkhwanazi can I ask you to placeyourself on record. 
ADV MKHWANAZI:   Good afternoon Chair, good afternoon colleagues.  Thank you very much for affording us this opportunity finally to appear before the Chair we are here with one sole purposes, which is to help the Commission to achieve its objectives in terms of the investigations and also to mention to you Chair and specifically to thank you for your indulgence in allowing us to appear before you on this medium, which clearly is becoming a permanent feature of our going forward, so thank you very much forthat indulgence, and also to state Chair that the reason that as my – the advocate just mentioned now, our statement is so short and sweet the words she used, it is because of the amount of time we have spent consulting with the Commission, starting initially with the forensic investigators and of course subsequent to that with the legal team and the Commission.  We specifically initially requested that we be given questions that we should focus on, and as we went through the motions we kept on you know correcting and making our statement much more user friendly and it is for that reason it is as short as it is, but I must also mention Chair that with regards to Transnet in particular there were a number of requests that we had made to the previous Company Secretary at Transnet to see if we could access any Board information that werebeing referred to by the Commission and unfortunately we could not get any information from Transnet.   I believe that Company Secretary is no longer there and there is a change of guard and so forth.But I also want to confirm Chair that the issues in the main that Mr Mkwanazi will be talking to today, both in terms of Transnet and of Eskom, are issues specifically relating to the TNA and of course you would recall Chair that both the Transnet and of course Eskom, and many other institutions had agreements there and of course MrMkwanazi is ready, willing and able to cooperate with you, so thank you very much Chair and we spent the whole day waiting for you, so we have discussed as much as we could with Mr Mkwanazi so I will just give you know give him the floor obviously through you and you Chair will ...[intervenes]      If I have a question, I will just raise my hand, so thank you very much Chair and colleagues.      Excuse me Chair, if I can just come in there, I’m still here, just to correct something that the counsel said before you intervened Chair.     The – Ms Luthuli did not suggest that the Board should handover to the new Board to say that the contract was bad, her recommendation, rather was that the Board had conceded or not whether the contract was abad one.  I just wanted to make sure that we correct that Chair, so that you know, we don’t get confused in terms of what the recommendation was in this instance. 
MKHWANAZI:Oh and my name is Ronnie Mkhwanazi and I am the Director at Mkhwanazi Incorporated.   Mr Mkwanazi and I are in the same building but of course he is in the boardroom and I am in another office, just to make sure we observe all protocols relatingto Çovid 19, so thank you very much Chair and also just to ask for your indulgence in advance, that in the event, and you will guide us Chair in terms of the procedures of the Commission, if we are allowed to in fact request for some time out, if I need to discuss something with Mr Mkwanazi we will be entirely in your hands in that regard Chair, so thank you very much for being here today. 
ADV ARMSTRONG:   Thank you.    Mr Mkwanazi can you – could you just – thank you, thank you.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.     Yes thank you Chair, indeed.     Chair so I am Amy Armstrong, I am part of the legal team of the Commission, and before we get started given the nature of the medium if there are means to pin Mr Mkwanazi – there you go – I would just like to confirm three things with Mr Mkwanazi about where he is given that we are using this medium.  The first thing I wanted to confirm is indeed as we heard from his legal representative, can you confirm Mr Mkwanazi that you areby yourself in the room?     Okay.  And can you confirm that you will not be receiving any messages during your testimony and if you do receive messages to please bring it to the attention of the Chair.     Indeed, and that is the third thing Iwould like you to confirm is just that you will only be looking at the documents and exhibits that have been provided to you and no other documentation, can you confirm that?     Thank you very much Mr Mkwanazi.   So just to orientate Chair you and Mr Mkwanazi about the exhibits and files we will be using, so the first and the main will be Mr Mkwanazi’s statements and other documents in MM7.  Then we will be turning to two other files, only two other files, one being EXHIBIT MM3, which was Mr Pamensky’s evidence and the other one will be MM6 which was Mr Tsotsi’s evidence before the Commission and Mr Mkwanazi you have all three of those files with you, is that correct?    Okay.  As my learned friend, Ms Hofmeyr, indicated I have created a list of the different documents in the order that they appear in this file, and I have given them labels, and I will not necessarily be referring to them in the order in which they appear in here but as I go to them I will read what the label is into the record as to what the exhibit is called.     Thank you Chair, so we call the first one MM7, could I correct that just to call it MM7A, this statement on page 1 and 2.     Indeed Chair.     Thank you Chairman.  So before we begin Mr Mkwanazi could you just explain what your qualifications are?     My goodness, yes, that is interesting Chair.  So then Mr Mkwanazi if you could explain, you’reobviously as was stated earlier you are going to be going to be giving testimony in your capacity, your involvement in both Transnet and Eskom.        But let us just begin with Transnet.  Could you just explain your role at Transnet?     Thank you Mr Mkwanazi, so can I just take you in this MM7 bundle, I would like to take you topage 27.     That is correct.     Thank you Mr Mkwanazi.  The purpose of this is just to indicate Chair this has been labelled in my file which we will ensure is in all the files, this is Exhibit MM7D.    Indeed, it is an exhibit on its own    7D, that is correct.     December 2010, indeed.    It is an announcement by Transnet.     Yes.     It is MM7D.     Thank you and Mr Mkwanazi the purpose of showing that to you is just as a reminder that this is an announcement from Transnet on 16 December 16 saying that a new Chairman was to – and that would be you Mr Mkwanazi, is to assume executive responsibilities until a permanent CEO is appointed.   And then it states ...[intervenes]     ...in the first paragraph    Okay and ...[intervenes]      So just to confirm Mr Mkwanazi you are a non-executive Chairman of the Board from December 10 to 2014, but you have a brief period from December 10 as being the – an Executive, Acting Executive of the Chief – Group Chief Executive is that correct?     And then ...[intervenes]      Acting Group Chief Executive, thank you.  I am indebted.  And then in 16 February 2011 I believe that a Mr Brian Molefe was appointed, does that accord with your memory as the Group Chief?     Okay so it is just in that period from December to February 2011 that you were serving as the Group Chief Executive.     Okay, thank you.   And then Mr Mkwanazi just your role at Eskom.     What was that?     And do you recall the end of your tenure on the Board, the date?     That is my understanding, thank youMr Mkwanazi.  So let us begin then with your evidence regarding Transnet and that is – let’s go back to your statement which is page 1 of that bundle that you are looking at.     That is MM7A, Exhibit.  And then Mr Mkwanazi can you just turn to the second page where your signature appears      Can you just confirm that that is your signature?     Okay and then Mr Mkwanazi I see at the top of the beginning of the statement your surname is spelt incorrectly, it has got an “h” in it, just the very firstpage, Mkhwanazi, so I take it that is incorrect?     We must just correct that.     Thank you Mr Mkwanazi so besides that correction do you have any other corrections at the outset you would like to make to this statement?     Okay so then do you confirm that under oath that this statement is true and correct?     Thank you.  Okay so as my learned friend, Ms Hofmeyr explained any meeting with a member of the Gupta Family is of great interest to the Commissionand we would like to just expand upon the – what you – the content of this statement and make sure that that we understand in detail everything that happened on each of the two meetings that you deal with in this statement, so I am going to be taking you through those events step by step.     And of course, Mr Mkwanazi I know this was a long time ago, the statements starts in January 11, but just if you could give us as much detail as youcan recall we would appreciate that.  So ...[intervenes]     Indeed Chair.    Thank you Chair.  So just a few details I would like you just orientate us in times.  So this is January 11 which means you have just been appointed as a Non-Executive Chair you are acting Group Chief Executive and this is just after that and you arrive at – first of all you get a phone call.  I just want to confirm.  Do you recall exactlywhat Mr Tony Gupta said to you in that call?    Had you heard of Mr Gupta before this phone call?    So why did you …    Thank you.  And why did you agree to attend this meeting?  I mean for so – there are summoning you to – to their home and is – was that normal?  Why did you feel that you should attend that meeting?    Thank you Chair.    And I just want to talk a bit about what the house in Saxonwold looked like to you.  So from the outside when you approached it do you have any memory of what it looked like to you?    Thank you.  And Mr Mkwanazi when you – you got out the car and you handed over your keys to the valet were there any other security protocols that took place?    Thank you.   And Mr Mkwanazi did you keep your cell phone on you at all times?    Thank you.  And when you walked into the meeting room – so – could you just explain.  You get to the entrance of the house and then how do you – how does itlook when you walk in the door?    Indeed 10 years.    No indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed Mr Mkwanazi.    Sorry Chair just on that issue.    May I just direct Mr Mkwanazi to an affidavit that we have procured at page 37 of the bundle and that is from Mr Livhumhuwami Makhode.    34.    That is correct. 34.   MM34 of that same bundle.    Thank you.  And Chair this is an affidavit that does not seem to be contentious but we seek it to be provisionally admitted.      This is Exhibit MM7E.    MM7    E.    Thank you.    And Mr Mkwanazi if you turn to the next page the budgets are set out there for Transnet’s marketing and advertising and you will see that in 2010 the total marketing budget was R27 005 399.00 and in 2011 the total spend marketing budget was R95 530 394.00.  So you were correct to be sceptical about those figures.  They are off by a factor of at least 10 in 2011 and by more than that for 10.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mkwanazi I just want to ask if when you entered the room and Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Gupta were there did they introduce themselves and did you know who they were before you entered that room from Mr Zuma in particular as you indicated you had not heard from Mr Gupta before?    Okay thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.  And did they – when they were – when Mr Gupta was speaking about his relationship to President Zuma did, he mention any other relationship to members of Parliament or Cabinet, anything else about hisinfluence?    And when you mentioned your business development in KZN did you – did they indicate that they were interested at all in investing in that business?    And when they asked you about the marketing budget of Transnet and they asked to have – I think you said 30 – 50% allocated to the New Age Newspaper.    Was this – what was the tone this?  Was this a request?  Something they expected?  How did you interpret it?    And did you suggest during the course of the meeting or at the end that you wanted to have a second meeting?    Okay thank you Mr Mkwanazi.  So after that meeting so you want…    Yes certainly Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Sorry Mr Mkwanazi you say in your statement I was contacted for a second meeting.  So did somebody call you just to…    And who was that that called you?    Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  So you took the Minister’s special advisor with you.      Yes.  Why did you not speak to Minister – former Minister Gigaba about this directly?    And then at the second meeting did you drive together with Mr Mahlangu?    So did he do – thank you.  Did he join you at the beginning of the meeting?    Was that attended again by the same people or different people?    Thank you.  And – so what was the content of this meeting?  What did you discuss?    Sorry, Mr Mkhwanazi.  You say in our statement “I was contacted for a second meeting”.  So did somebody call you just to confirm that?    And who was that who called you?    Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  So you took the minister’s special advisor with you.  Why did you not ...[intervenes]    Yes.  Why did you not speak to minister... former Minister Gigaba about this directly?    And then at the second meeting, did you drive together with Mr Mahlangu?    So did he ...[intervenes]     Thank you.  Did he join you at the beginning of the meeting?    And with...[intervenes]     Was that attended again by the samepeople or different people?    Thank you.  And so what was the contents of this meeting?  What did you discuss?    Did you mention again about the relationship with President Zuma?    And what was Mr Mahlangu’s reactionto this?    So once again, Mr Mkhwanazi, you are saying that Mr Duduzane Zuma remained silent throughout the meeting?    And ...[intervenes]     Sorry.    [laughs]  No, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.    And... Thank you, Chair.  And Mr Mkhwanazi, what was your response again to the request?    And what was their reaction to this?  What was Mr Gupta’s reaction to this?    Thank you, Chairman.  Out of this meeting, did you again speak to the minister about what had meeting at this meeting?    Did Mr Siyabonga Mhlango... It was Siyabonga Mhlango?  Yes.    Thank you.  And Mr Mkhwanazi, did you note any change in your relationship with Minister Gigaba after this meeting?    Thank you, Chair.  And just before I move to another page.  Mr Mkhwanazi, that second meeting, how long after the first meeting was it?   Thank you.  Then Mr Mkhwanazi, I just want to direct you to a news article and that is on page MM37.    Chair, this MM37, I would like to label EXHIBIT MM7F.    I would like to enter it into the record. [laughs]    Admitted as an exhibit ...[intervenes]     MM7F.  Thank you, Chair.    F, Chair.    That is indeed so. [laughs]    Indeed Chair.    Thank you.      So Mr Mkhwanazi, this is dated the 9t h of June 2011 in the Business Day and the headline is... and it is written by Peter Bruce.  The headline is “Chairman of Transnet, Eskom and Denel to go.”  Are you familiar with this article?    Did you read it when it came out in the Business Day?   Okay. [laughs]     Oh, okay.  Well, Chair ...[intervenes]     Okay.  I think Chair, then we will have this replaced I think in the record but I have... I can read out the relevant portions on the record if that might be helpful now?    To be replaced.   Indeed, Chair.  Indeed.  We will do that Chair.    [laughs] Thank you, Chair.  So Mr    So that is the 9t h of June 2011 in Business Day.    And... thank you, Chair.  And it states in    Indeed.  Because Mr Mkhwanazi, how Iunderstand this is... what I understand the article to be saying is that Mr Gigaba recommended your removal as Chair of the Board of Transnet and that you would be replaced with Mr Sharma but while he was successful in the Cabinet meeting at removing you, he was not successful in replacing you with Mr Sharma.  Is that also how you understand this article?    No, indeed.  I am saying what thearticle says, not what in fact happened.  Sorry, if I just can remind you.    Ja.    Indeed.  Indeed Chair.    Indeed.  So ...[intervenes]     So Mr Mkhwanazi, my understanding of this article, not what happened in reality, that my understanding of what the Business Day is saying is that Mr Gigaba attempted to have you removed and recommendedthis to Cabinet and that he was successful in having you removed but not in having you replaced with Mr Sharma.  That is my understanding of this article.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.  So ...[intervenes]     Exactly.  And I am just pointing out.  Mr Mkhwanazi, that you would have read this.    [laughs] And would have been... itwould have been quite a reaction because, as you point out, in reality you were not removed.  The cabinet did not approve that recommendation.  Is that correct?    Thank you.      Thank you.  And... so Mr Mkhwanazi, let me take you to the cabinet recommendation.  The memo thatwas sent to Cabinet by Mr Gigaba.  And that you will find the following page which is page MM38.    Indeed Chair.  As MM7G.    Thank you so much.    Thank you, Chair.  So Mr Mkhwanazi,    This Cabinet meeting to deliberate on these recommendations?    And the outcome Mr Mkhwanazi for you?  The outcome of the meeting?    Yes.    Okay.  So ...[intervenes]    Thank you, Chair.  So just to clarify.  Mr Mkhwanazi, but you were aware in this time in 2011 that Minister Gigaba had recommended your removal?    Did you at all attribute the attempts to... by Minister Gigaba to recommend to have you removed, to be related in any way to your meeting with Tony Gupta and Duduzane Zuma?    I see.    Thank you, Chair.  So when you were having these discussions with Minister Gigaba, did he indicate at all that Mr Mhlango had relayed anything about your meetings to him?    And did you speak to anybody else about the meetings with Mr Gupta and Mr Duduzane Zuma?    And then, can I take you to another article?  That is at page ...[intervenes]     Yes, Chair.    That is correct.     Thank you, Chair.  Then let us move to page MM23 of that bundle.       So Chair, again I ask that this be admitted as an exhibit as MM7C.    That is correct, Mr Mkwanazi.      So this document is an article from the Mail & Guardian entitled “Going off the rails” dated 4 March 2011.     Thank you, Chair.  And, Chair, I have just been alerted that a larger and clearer copy of the Business Day article that we looked at has been prepared and will be brought up to be replaced in our files.     Not yet, Chair.     It is being prepared now.     So, Mr Mkwanazi, then just turnplease to the next page in the article on page 24.  The portion that is highlighted.     It says     “...admits he has a personal relationship with the Guptas and has met them to discuss privatebusiness interests but denied this influenced Mr Molefe’s appointment.” Mr Mkwanazi, did you have an opportunity to comment on this article?  Did you see it before it was published?     So this description of you having a personal relationship with the Guptas …[intervenes]     Okay, sorry, Chair, I will read itagain. “Mkwanazi, who drove the appointment process admits he has a personal relationship with the Guptas and has met them to discuss private business interests but denied this influenced Mr Molefe’s appointment.” And so, Mr Mkwanazi, you described your relationship to Mail & Guardian as a personal relationship with the Guptas, is that correct?      But just to me, having met briefly on two occasions with the Guptas sounds...     A personal relationship sounds a bit of an overstatement to me.     But there was no – there is no additional relationship that you had except for those two meetings?     Thank you, Chair.  The article goes     About a property development you had in KZN, is that correct?     Sounds – exploratory discussions that did not result in a partnership, once again sounds like a more significant discussion on that topic than what you have mentioned.     And so, Mr Mkwanazi , you have told the Mail & Guardian journalist that you had these meetings with the Guptas, is that correct?     And that you spoke about private business interests, is that correct?      But you do not seem to have – or did you mention anything about what Mr Tony Gupta had askedyou about …[intervenes]    About procurement and the allocation to the New Age?     And why not?     Did you disclose what had been discussed with the board of Transnet?    With Mr tony Gupta about the question of dedicating 30 to 50%?     But, Mr Mkwanazi, what mightperhaps be a bit unusual was that your number in this case was provided to Mr Tony Gupta by the Minister himself.     And so that unusual aspect you did not mention that to the journalist at Mail & Guardian.     Or to the Transnet board.     So even though that was unusual why did you decide not to include that information in yourstatements to them?     So even though it was – that aspect of the interactions was unusual, that they got your number from Minister Gigaba, why did you …[intervenes]     Why did you not see a need?     Indeed, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  I think theelements, the unusual element is of the Minister giving Mr Gupta your number is the only – is the aspect that I just wanted to probe further because, Mr Mkwanazi, your answer was that you did not feel the need to tell the board or the media about this meeting because you get many requests, they are very usual, and I was just probing that there was in fact an unusual aspect of it which was that the Minister had, according to Mr Gupta, connected you and put you in touch and that was – I was probing whether that that unusual aspect might have prompted you to treat it differently and perhaps alert somebody else.       Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Mkwanazi.  And were you aware of other officials at the time?     Thank you, thank you.     And did you hear at the time about any other people or officials being approached in this way by members of the Gupta family to have a meeting?     And did you, before you approached by the Commission to give evidence, did you feel the need to come forward and disclose the meetings that you had?     And why not?     Thank you, Mr Mkwanazi.     Thank you, Chair.  Then, Mr Mkwanazi, I am not going to ask you too much about the New Age breakfasts, we have already heard extensive evidence about those, but you do say in your statement that you attended a number of these breakfasts , is that correct, the New Age breakfasts ?     And in your statement you indicate that you do not have any idea of how much was spent in respect of those breakfasts.     But of course – so we have had testimony, so for example from Mr Phatlane has explained that from 2012 to 2017 over R122 million was spent on the New Age breakfasts .  Now, Mr Mkwanazi , in light of the fact that you were contacted and asked by Mr Tony Gupta to dedicatebetween 30 and 50% of the Transnet advertising budget to the New Age breakfasts and we know – and you went to a number of those breakfasts.     And you saw that they were occurring and we know there were – so at that time were you at all concerned that what you had been asked in a way that did not comply with procurement procedures was now being in effect that you were attending these breakfasts that they were happening.  Did that not concern you?     Oh dear, I think the screen hasfrozen.     Okay.  Sorry, Mr Mkwanazi, the screen is freezing so we are missing your …[intervenes]     Unfortunately, not, Mr Mkwanazi, we have missed now a portion of what you were saying.     Yes, thank you.    Indeed.     So, Mr Mkwanazi, your testimony was that you were approached and you were asked by Mr Gupta to dedicate 30 to 50% of the Transnet advertising budget to the New Age.  You said this is an inappropriate way ofdoing things, this is not how we do business.  But then you then attend yourself a number of these breakfasts so you see that in fact Transnet is spending budget on the New Age.  Did this not concern you given your previous approach by Mr Gupta?     Yes.     Indeed.     Indeed.     Okay.  So, Mr Mkwanazi, you were not concerned, if I understand you correctly, because you imagined that they had – you assumed they had gone through those correct channels.    Thank you, Mr Mkwanazi.  Then, Chair, I see that the time is already five o’clock.     Indeed.     Unfortunately, chair, I just need to deal with …[intervenes]     I think approximately an hour, Chair.     We have to deal with the Eskomevidence.     Okay.     I will certainly do my best, Chair.     Okay.  So just to …[intervenes]     About quarter past three I believe we began.     That is correct, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.    Indeed, Chair.     Thank you, Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    So Mr Mkwanazi I just want to wrap up the feedback.     Thank you Chair.   So, in order to just finalise the Transnet evidence, I just want to put to you the essential points that Mr Gigaba has raised in his affidavit in response to our Rule 33 notice and that is in the file, in MM7 at page 8.     MM08.     Thank you Chair.  So, there are just three main aspects of what Mr Gigaba has said in response to your statement that I’d just like to put to you so you have an opportunity to respond Mr Mkwanazi.     The first thing that Mr Gigaba says isthat he did not provide Mr Tony Gupta with your number, do you have a comment?     Mr Gigaba says that he never provided Mr Tony Gupta with Mr Mkwanazi’s cell phone number.     And the second main point there Mr Gigaba makes is he says that he was – that you never spoke to him about the meetings which accords with your testimony today but that he’s surprised, because if you were not comfortable you could have spoken to him about the first or second meeting and you chose not to, do you have any comments to that statement?     Thank you Chair for that and the final point that Mr Gigaba makes that I’d like to raise with you is that he says, he was not aware that Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu, his special advisor, attended the meeting with you and Mr Gupta, do you agree or disagree with that statement?     Thank you Chair, Chair I apologise I didn’t enter that as an Exhibit,  so Chair would it be possible to admit from page MM4 to the end of that affidavit which is MM22 as Exhibit MM7B?     It does.    Yes, so the affidavit that begins at page 4, MM4 and the Annexures end at page MM22.     The Annexures begin from page MM17 – sorry I beg your pardon that’s another affidavit…[intervenes].     It’s MM14 is the end, so MM15 you’recorrect Chair.     That is B.     Indeed Chair, thank you.     Thank you Chair.  Chair that concludes the evidence on Transnet, so Mr Mkwanazi I’djust like to move to the evidence about your time at Eskom on the Board which was – which began on June 2011 and came to an end in December 2014 and in particular I’d like to ask you about that end part of your tenure on the Board, so November/December of 2014 and in particular I’d like to ask you about this contract that Eskom had concluded with the New Age and that was a contract for R43million, do you have any memory of that Mr Mkwanazi? MR     Not yet.     Not yet Mr Mkwanazi.     Yes, yes.     Indeed, thank you Chair.  So, the R43million rand contract between Eskom for advertising in the New Age – so you indicate you were aware of that contract?     And do you recall that towards the end, in November and December of your tenure 2014, on the Eskom Board you were considering that contract, do you recall that?    That’s quite right and that is a report by SNG, there was a forensic report done on this particular contract, is that what you’re referring to Mr Mkwanazi?     Do you recall, in general terms what that report concluded about the contract?     Thank you, so that Chief Executive that was Mr Colin Matjila, is that correct?     And the other individual you referred to is that Mr Choeu?     Thank you Mr Mkwanazi and so then I’d just like to move to – there were three Board meetings that then took place towards the end of that year at which this issue was discussed.  I’d just like to take you, Mr Mkwanazi to the very last minute and that will require us to go to file – to leave our file MM7 and to move to Exhibit MM3 and that was the Exhibit in respect of Mr Mark Pamensky’s evidence.       I’ll just make sure that the Chair has that file.     No Chair, thank you.  Then if we could just turn to page 349 of this bundle.    349 that’s correct Chair.      That’s right, thank you.     My apologies Chair, that’s correct, 349, thank you Chair.     So, here are the minutes of a meeting of the 8 t h of December 2014, now this must have been, Mr Mkwanazi, right before the end of your – this must have been one of the last Board meetings you attended, is that correct?     Thank you and I confirm that you were at this meeting, it says you were present, is that correct?     Okay, and I just want to move to page351 in the second last paragraph of that page it says, “The lawyers were of the opinion that Mr Matjila’s conduct constituted a wilfulness conduct in terms of the PFMA…[intervenes].     Sorry Chair, it’s the second last paragraph.     The first sentence okay so,“The lawyers were of the opinion that Mr Matjila’s conduct constituted a wilfulness conduct in terms of the PFMA.  The National Treasury Regulations stated that if there were a financial misconduct by an employee then the Board must ensure that an investigation was conducted and relevant disciplinary action taken.  Furthermore, the Board had to advise the relevant Minister, National Treasury and Auditor General thereof.  In respect of a reportable irregularity is reported to external auditors and had to make a disclosure”,And then, Mr Mkwanazi you’ll see the next paragraph says, “With respect to the definition of fruitless and wasteful expenditure it was stated that the Boardhad to take a view whether the contract had value or not”,So, let’s stop there and discuss that.  So, Mr Mkwanazi, you mentioned earlier that the forensic report had mentioned two key actors, that was Mr Matjila and Mr Choeu and so did you understand that…[intervenes].     That is C-H-O-E-U.    Thank you Chair.  So, in light of this paragraph about – that Mr Matjila’s conduct constituted misconduct in terms of the PFMA, did you understand that the Board had an obligation to act on that information, Mr Mkwanazi?      And that corrective action had to be taken in that regard?     Now, Mr Matjila, after this, was no longer the Chief Executor of the Board but do you still understand that the – was the Board of Eskom of the view that action still had to be taken against Mr Matjila?     And then, Mr Choeu, he was, if I’m not mistaken, still an employee of Eskom is that correct?     So, was it your understanding, as a member of the Board that disciplinary action was going to be taken against these parties?     The second point that I mentioned was fruitless and wasteful expenditure, what do youunderstand that to mean?     Thank you Mr Mkwanazi, that’s very important.  So, at this time there had been no analysis into commercial value of the contract.       But did you understand that, that was still going to be done at some future date?     Okay I…[intervenes].     Chair that is my understanding, being a person – an Engineer, typically if you build a bridge and then you get the full payment and the bridge is not built or even one brick is laid, that’s fruitless and wasteful.     Thank you Chair, that’s very helpful for me.  So, Mr Mkwanazi, let’s then turn to the next page, it’s page 352.  So, in the first major paragraph, the first complete paragraph, we see here that the discussion is about a decision about Matjila’s guilt or innocence and there was a discussion about fruitless and wasteful expenditure and then we see the statement, halfway down the paragraph it starts with the sentence – it’s about six lines down, the sentence starts with, “The Chairman stated that the Board had to be convinced that the contract was not a bad one”,And then if you go on to the end of that paragraph it says, Ms Luthuli stated that the handover report had toreflect the Board had considered whether or not the contract was a bad one and had concluded that the contract was not a good one at this time”, Could you just explain, what do you understand by a good or a bad contract meaning? MR     Okay, so when they talk about – when the Board talks about the minutes reflect that this was nota good contract, we see it in a number of places, again in that same page on the second last paragraph, they were of the opinion that the contract was not a good contract, so are you saying, you’re not sure what that means?     Okay, so…[intervenes].     Thank you so much Chair and Mr Mkwanazi you also raised the financial position that Eskomwas in at the time, you say, so when it concluded this contract what was its financial position?     And this was R53million contract for advertising for a State-owned entity?     So, in light of the financial position ofEskom at the time could that be another reason why it was not a good contract at that time?     And they emphasise that Mr Luthuli emphasises here that it must be in a handover report to the new Board, is that your recollection?     It was captured that it was a bad contract, it was not a good contract?     Thank you.       Thank you Chair.      Let’s read out the full statement.      So, on page 352 it says, “Mr Luthuli stated that the handover report had to reflect that the Board had considered whether or not the contract was a bad one and had concludedthat the contract was not good at this time”.    Thank you Chair.  So then in summary Mr Mkwanazi as a member of the so-called old board before the new board had to make its decision you have said that – am I correct that the old board was not going to determine whether to ratify the contract or not?    Thank you Chair.  So then Mr Mkwanazi so I understand then to summarise that the board at that point had reserved its judgment on ratification.  It was still exploring options that was your testimony.    Yes.   Yes you could have.    Okay.    Okay.    Indeed.    Okay.  Thank you.  And then finally the issue of the corrective action or the disciplinary action against Mr Cheou and Mr Matjila that is also something you expected the new board to deal with.    Okay.  And with all these very important things for the new board to consider and an emphasis in theminutes about at the very least the fact that this was a – not a good contract being conveyed and then also you pointed out Mr Mkwanazi in the resolutions that Ledwaba Mazwai Attorneys and the company secretary were going to prepare a summary and final resolution on the discussions and the decisions around the New Age sponsorship contract for signing by the Chairman of the board, Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee for inclusion handover report to the new board.  So all of these discussions were now going to be passed over in its handover report was that yourunderstanding?    The new board.  The new board.    The new board when they took over would you accept it to be good corporate governance for them to convene a meeting to discuss all of these issues.    Indeed Chair and the basis that I was hoping to point out to Mr Mkwanazi was there were so many important issues that still needed to be determined by thenew board with respect to a large contract sponsorship of the New Age, with respect to disciplinary action that had to be taken with two of the employees, with identifying fruitless and wasteful expenditure and the…    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.  What was the – what would have been Mr Mkwanazi your expectation perhaps of a member of the old board?    Indeed Chair.   Thank you.  And of course, Mr Mkwanazi you would have expected a handover report to contain a summary of your discussions at these meetings as is included in this resolution, is that correct?    So in the – I asked you earlier Mr Mkwanazi about this resolution and your last meeting which stated that there needs to be a summary prepared of whathad been discussed and that would be included in the handover report.  So what I am asking you – and you would have in addition to the two reports, the forensic and the legal reports would you have also expected that summary of your discussions in the board meetings, the opinion of the old board to be conveyed to the new board before voting on a contract?    Thank you Mr Mkwanazi.  Chair thank you.  Those are our questions about – from Eskom and from our side.    Thank you Chair. Sorry Chair could Ijust hand up that Business Day clearly of the article.    Thank you that our files are completed.    Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi you would have had an electronic version.    Yes.   Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 20 JULY 2020
MR MAFIKA MKWANAZI:   [d.s.s.] 
ARMSTRONG:Great, and then besides ...[intervenes]   Okay that’s MM3, Mr MarkPamensky’s evidence, thank you.  So with all of these important considerations would – would you have considered it good corporate governance to convene a live board meeting to discuss these issues before the board took further action? 
MKWANAZI:Advocate, can you repeat your …[intervenes]  Yes, and I, in terms of the documentation is there something I must open up? I can’t explain that, also my understanding it would be difficult to – it was irregular that’s it, ja.  Then somewhere along the line somebody decided that, I don’t like this exit clause then you make it a bad contract.  Could have been defined as mismanagement. 
MR MKHWANAZI:   I can confirm, Chair, just to put it on record that we are prepared and ready to continue, Chair, thank you. 
ADV MKWANAZI:   If I may come in Chair and then…    I think arising out of this is that the – the timelines between you know the vacating of office of the board at that time and the new incoming board was so slim that for someone who is not you know close to the process may actually think they were on the same board at the same time.  So it is just for clarity for example Chair.  Mr Pamensky was never on the same board with Mr Mkwanazi.  In fact, he came in I think two or three months after that – after the board that Mr – the old board as he referred to it had already made the recommendations insofar as how theirregularity and the expenditure should be dealt with in that regard.  So I think it would not be fair to you know ask a question of that nature to Mr Mkwanazi whose terms at the time had already expired.  So I think Chair it is important that we brought that line and make sure that Mr Mkwanazi only answers for the questions you know that relate to his term of office.  So whether or not it is good corporate governance for a board to have a Round Robin etcetera, etcetera I think that depends from board to board and organisations as well as the communications policy that that particular board had in that instance.    All I am asking for Chair is that let us – let us speak to the term of office of Mr Mkwanazi and anything beyond that would only be supposition Chair and   Thank you Chair.   Thank you Chair, thank you colleagues.
