CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody.    Good morning Mr Montana.  Yes.    Okay.    Yes okay no that is fine.  The one thing which works in your favour Mr Montana is that since you started testifying you have been very cooperative with the commission so your track record speaks for you.    They always say it is good to create a good record for yourself because it speaks for you even when you cannot speak for yourself.  Okay alright butthank you for – for availing yourself and I know that it was short notice but we appreciate that you were able to avail yourself. Okay alright.  I think let us do the oath.  Ja.    Thank you.  Yes Mr Soni.    Hm.    Okay.  15?    Okay.  Yes.    Oh I have not seen it.   Yes.    Oh that are not.   Yes.    To put that to rest ja.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay alright.  Thank you.    But she – would you say she may have said in essence in different terms what she puts in this tense here?    Ja okay.    Ja okay.    About the campaign.    Now before that discussion between the two of you was the position that – in other words beforeshe started daring you saying fire me was the position that you were going to fire her in any event because you saw her as part of that campaign – it was just a matter of time but when she said fire me and repeated that then you decided I’ll do it now then?  Or was the – or what was the position?    Ja.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  Okay.  Mr Soni.    I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Soni. I think he was still saying something that might substantiate his version.    Because you see there are now two versions and he is sticking to his version that it is the 18 t h.  I think he was still substantiating.  You were saying Mr Montana you were in a meeting there is no way something, something?    Okay alright.    Yes.    Okay alright.  Mr Soni.    Ja.   Well – well I was under the – well I see that you signed it on the 20 t h if you look at the – now at the end of the letter if you signed it on the 20 t h if you signed the letter the following morning or the following day after the discussion on the phone with Ms Ngoye then that would tend to support the idea that the version that – the discussion on the phone would have been on the 19 – evening of the 19 t h.  Unless – unless it is not a situation that the letter came the day after the conversation.    Yes.    Ja.  Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no, that is fine. I think that probably resolves it.  If in terms of when the conversation was if you say the letter was signed the day after the telephone conversation then it would have to be the 19 t h.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay. I do not know Mr Soni?    Your memory is fresher.    On these things than mine.    But in the end I think you made some point earlier I just want you to remind me whether it would make any difference whether she was told on the 18 t h or 19 t h?    Ja-no, what I was interested in is whether it makes any difference whether she was told on the 18 t h or the 19 t h because it is accepted that she was dismissed.    It is a question of whether she was told on the 18 t h or the 19 t h .    On the face of it, it should not matter but I maybe missing something.       H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.    Ja, ja.  Well, I am not sure why – I am still not sure why it makes any difference, whether it was     I fired her because she was insolent, she was insubordinate, she get me to fire her, and I fire     Maybe that he does not ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja, ja, ja.  Okay alright.     Yes, ja, ja.    Ja. MR     H’m, h’m.  In terms of what was in your mind.     Ja.     H’m.    Ja.     Ja.  Well, actually, I was thinking ...[intervenes]     H’m.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     Yes.    I will offer you something and you must give me your comment.  In the light of how strongly you felt against people whom you viewed as being part of the campaign that you talked about in your email and in the light of the fact that you viewed her as part of that campaign and in the light of the fact that in your own mind you had made it – up your mind to fire such people.  The probabilities that she was going to be fired what happened may just have brought forward what was going to happen in all probability.  We are not saying certainly.      On...  Would you think that is fair?     Yes.     It was very high, ja.     Yes, ja. MR     Yes, ja.     Yes.  Okay.  I think ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja, ja.     Ja, ja, ja.     Could she have been legally represented at such a disciplinary hearing?     Oh, is that so?     Okay, okay.     Oh, Advocate Naseer Kasim.     Oh, to preside as chairperson?    Oh, I thought that you were saying that Ms Ngoye was going to be legally represented.     Oh, she was entitled to have that?     It was not arbitration or was it a CCMA thing?     Internally? MR     Ja, okay.    H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.  Mr Soni.     Yes, yes, yes.     H’m?     H’m?    Ja.     Ja. MR     H’m.  No, no that is fine.  No, those matters, one would go into them but nevertheless it might be good to just have a look, for example, at the charge sheet against Mr Ngoye in the light of what you say Mr Montana.  But also it would also just be helpful to see whether Mr Khena in concluding that there was no evidence of misconduct on the part of Ms Ngoye, whetherhe prepared any document that showed that he had applied his mind to what was there.  And whether he had been furnished - he secured for example, statements from people who may have had information relation to the charges because if – obviously,     Ja.  So ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Those charges, yes.MR     Ja.     Ja, ja, ja.     No, no that is fine.  So it would be good to see what Mr Khena had or what he prepared which led him to the conclusion because if what Mr Montana issaying, it may be that PRASA, up to a certain level, had become factionalised, as it were.     Say, there are those who are Montana’s ones and then there are those who are the chairperson’s people.  But we do not know but that – he gives that impression that it may have been that situation.  Okay alright.     Oh.  Yes.     Should we – we can go – we can takethe break now or we can take it at half-past eleven.  It depends on whether from your side ...[intervenes]  ADV VAS SONI     ...the matters ...[intervenes]     Okay.  Finish it, ja.     Ja, that is fine.     Well, it is just a pity that the challenges which happened in regard to affidavit happened because I would have preferred a situation where if you are dealing with paragraphs 22, 23, 24 you deal with them fully including whatever documents you have so that when one looks at certain things at the evidence at your response to Ms Ngoye’s evidence and allegations one gets the full picture but I accept that we are where we are.In the end what may happen is that one will read what you have to say about paragraph 22 to 24 somewhereand then somewhere else finds something else that belongs here as well but I think that is fine.  We are just doing the best we can in the circumstances.     Ja?     Ja.     Yes.    H’m.     Ja.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja.    No, no that is fine.  I am tempted to say something now.  I am going to say it.  Mr Montana, you have a right to say nothing if you do not want to say anything.  You have a right to say something.  There was – I was speaking with the legal team of somebody who was reluctant to testify in the absence of his counsel in the Commission and I used you as an example.     H’m.     H’m.    H’m.     H’m, h’m.     Yes.     H’m.     I must just say because you have said that before and I have never said this.  I do not have a recollection of having seen that letter but it has been two years.  Maybe I did and I have forgotten but I do not know whether you got any response.  I think you never got aresponse.     Oh, okay.     Yes.     2019, you say?     Oh, I thought you said 2020.     Ja.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.     Ja.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.    No, no, no, no …[intervenes]    Your story.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Okay, no, no, that is fine, I thought I would just say that because I was tempted to say so but let me say it and give you the freedom not to say anything orto say something.   But, look, Mr Montana, as we Commission, we – I think we try our best, we take our work seriously, we are acting in good faith.   We might be I misunderstood sometimes but we are doing the best we can and we accept that people will have different views about our work in the Commission and we hold no grudges, we say it is fine, you know, it is a public process and we just keep on trying to do our best.  That is all and …[intervenes]     And I am happy that you made the decision to participate and as I said when we started this morning, you have – since you started appearing you have been very cooperative, you have been availing yourselfeven at short notice to appear, so we appreciate that cooperation.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.    And I want to stop you now.     Ja.    Okay.  No, that is fine.  Let us take the – or were you done or were you not done, Mr...     Okay. ADV VAS SONI     No, that is fine, that fine.     Ja, okay.     Well, I did not know you were going torefer us to another bundle, maybe we should take the adjournment.     Yes, ja, let us take the adjournment.  I thought it was just going to be quick-quick.     Ja.  Okay, no, let us take the tea break, it is twenty five to twelve, let us resume at ten to twelve.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     I am sorry, so what you are saying is to your recollection around 2013/2014, while you were still at PRASA you were aware of  - based on what Mr Mashaba told you, you were aware that – or he said he was talking to the ANC, is that right?     Yes about the donation or something.    Oh okay, alright.  And you say in 2016 …[intervenes]     No, no, no, I accept that you say you did not know the details but I am now going to Mr Molefe’s affidavit.     When that was in the media you became aware of that.     Ja.     Okay.     Okay, alright.     Yes.     Mr Soni?     Ja, okay, do that, ja.     H’m.     Ja.     I am sorry, just repeat that?     It is just that I did not hear it properly.     And most of them, even if not maybe all of them, most of them would have been recommended by its deployment committee, I would suspect.  The CEOs of the state owned …[intervenes]     No, I am saying most, maybe most.MR     Not even that, ja.  Okay.     Ja.     But also I must just say, I know that you said you would link what you were saying with this issuebut I am not sure whether you stopped on the way.  I have a feeling that you …[intervenes]     I have a feeling that you were telling a certain story and then …[intervenes]     Ja, okay.     Ja, okay.     Okay. MR     I actually seem to think – remember from the media at the time that the reports of the media of the report he had made in Polokwane was said to have been – well, I am not using the words that was used but theimpression I got was that he had been brutally honest to the organisation about challenges and so on.     H’m.     This information is information I get from the media.     Any knowledge I have is just based on what I get from the public, ja.     Ja.     Well, before you go to the narrower part, you did refer to the fact that I said if we do not want things that according to the evidence that the Commission has heard to have happened in the past to happen again, it is critical that we be – we reflect very honestly on what it is that made those things – that made it possible for those things to happen.     Because if we do not know what made it possible for those things to happen we cannot put in place correct measures to prevent them from recurring in the future and so I repeat that we, as a country,  and we as individuals, we as different groups have to look honestly at what it is that brought us here and it probably is not asingle thing, it probably a number of things.  Let us look at those and then when we know what it is that made it possible for those things to happen, we can look at what it is that we should put in place, make sure those things do not happen again.So to the extent that you really do have information that can assist in that regard we would appreciate it.  So I just wanted to reaffirm that.  But you were into the R80 million thing, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Said.     But his report, whether he comes or not his report may be important, ja.    Ja, he will be able to say what were the challenges that he talked about in his reports in 2007.  That maybe have been based on things that had happened before 2007 and then look at the SG’s report in the Mangaung Conference and maybe look at the SD’s reports in 2017 NASREC Conference and see - because I have a suspicion that some of the things are the same that keep on being mentioned.    No, no you are right enough we will move on further but I just want to also say this.  When you say as you have just said a few seconds ago, they would come to somebody who is a CEO of an SOE and say here are these people we were working with this people, would that be in the context of saying, when there are tenders remember them or what?     Gavin Watson.     Ja.     As I understand it, and you must just confirm if my understanding is correct.  What you are saying is when the Commission has to look at how the levels of corruption arose, the way they arose, and how various things happened, which are associated with State Capture, how those things happened.  You say there is a certain way of doing things within the ANC, which is part of their culture that has been there for a long time.       Which in your view, must have created or contribute to the environment that made the corruption to rise the way it has arisen for State Capture to happen and if the ANC wants to assist the Commission and if the ANC wants to say going forward, these things must never happen again it must start by acknowledging that culture and an assist the Commission.      Yes.     Ja, and of course you have told me what happened there.     Ja, ja.     Ja, there have been quite a few of your last points.     Okay, let us start this – let us hold it there.  I am sure that later on; it would not be necessary to go into a lot of details on issues that you have dealt with now.     Mr Soni.     I am sorry that is PRASA Bundle C1, Exhibit SS4?     Ja, just to make sure that is always more convenient that you start with the bundle than one knows whether one has got the right bundles.  Okay and what page?     Yes, okay.     Now, when Mr Soni - when Mr Mashaba     Sorry, ja continue.     What is NS reference to again, I amtrying to look?     Because from paragraph five, it appears that Mr Mashaba says, GS that is Mr George Sabela?     Gave evidence at the sections 417 inquiry to the effect that one, he had never been a fundraiser for the ANC, two the only part that he – NS, oh NS would be the law firm…[intervene]    Ja, I think it is the law firm, E/NS played in leasing plus to collect amounts invoiced by Sim, what is Sim?     Oh, Similex’s?     Entity, yes – I was to collect amounts invoiced by SIM for leasing.  So Similex would have sent invoices for leasing, that is Swifambo and so he as Mr Sabela - according to Mr Mashaba’s says, his role and the role of his firm was basically to claim from Swifambo.   What, the amounts that appeared in invoices sent by Similex and where after he dispersed the amounts received. So he would have known how he dispersed theamounts that he received as directed by MG, that is Ms Gomes.  So he would say whether he - where he directed monies.    Ja.    Ja.    H’m.    Yes.  What I am more interested in is since Mr Sabelo says his and his law firm’s role was to collect the money from Swifambo that was reflected in invoices sent by    Similex to Swifambo and he says that he or his law firm would then disperse those amounts in accordance with instructions of Ms Maria Gomes.    The next obvious thing is to say where did he – where was his instructed to send that to.  We do not know that based on this document.    Yes.  Okay alright.  You want to say something Mr Montana?    Hm    Ja.  No, no that is fine.  I mean obviously I think what the – what the commission is doing and the investigators and the legal team is to keep our minds open that sometimes something that may look legitimate and innocuous might not be. And sometimes something that looks illegitimate and criminal might not be.  So it is keeping that mind and – and that open mind and probing and stopping where it looks like there is no reason to go further.  Okay Mr Soni.    Of course – of course I can say and you may have been aware from the media that the commission had issued summons against Mr Mashaba for him to come and give evidence and he decided to defy the summons and then not come here.  His complaint was as far as I – no I gave instructions that the complaint be laid and I think it was laid with the police but that – that is just one fact you know.  Of course there is the issue of Mr George Sabelo’s version. MR    Yes but..    That is on a lighter note.  Mr Soni.    I see we are at one o’clock.    Ja that is fine.    That is fine.    That is fine.  That is fine.  Well I can just say on a lighter note Mr Montana that I thought that you know the commission would get very good cooperation from lots of people and it has got good cooperation but there are some who do not think that this commission is such a good idea.      You are a sole source?  Yes Mr Soni.    Ja okay.     Okay alright.  Let us take the lunch adjournment.    It is five past we will resume at five past two.    We adjourn.     What happened this time, Mr Montana?     Oh.     Yes.     Oh, okay.     Okay, okay.  No, that is fine.  Okay.  Mr Soni.     Okay.  H’m.     I assume that this means we have moved away from the Swifambo matter?     Ja, okay alright.     Okay alright.  If you could start by giving the names of the parties and the case number.     And the high – which high court and so forth.     Do you want to read the case number ...[intervenes]      Ja.     And the judgment seems to have been handed down on the 8 t h of October 2020. ADV VAS SONI     Ja.     H’m.     I am sorry.  And it is the Gauteng Division of the High Court.      H’m.    H’m?     H’m.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  But for what it is worth.  It would be good, maybe, that will be in your – maybe that is in your affidavit, should be good to get that factual background that you have just outlined later on.    Okay alright.  Ms Soni.     H’m?     Ja.     Invited you.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.    H’m.     Ja.     Ja.       Ja.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  Mr Soni.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     There is some acronym that is also for – what cross-section or something.     Cross-function.     This is not the one?     Oh, okay.    CTPC.     Okay.     Okay alright.     Yes, okay alright.  Continue.     Ja, those were the ...[intervenes]      ...the parts that you ...[intervenes]     ...considered important to read into the record.     Ja, okay.  I think you had said that Mr Montana could then comment if he wish to comment.     Mr Montana, do you want to say?  I know you have already commented.  So I am, obviously, not inviting you to say the same thing but if you wish to say anything.     H’m.  Yes.     Yes, just one second, before you do that, you have said that you had, at the invitation of the court, submitted a detailed affidavit, is that correct?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, I was – the reason why I was referring to you having filed an affidavit was that I was wondering whether it would not be convenient to hear what you have to say after looking at such an affidavit or not but I assume that those affidavits, Mr Soni, even though the final – the ultimate court that gave this judgment excludedthem, they available somewhere.  At least his.     At – particularly his affidavit that he was not included.     My – part of what is in my mind is that he was no longer at PRASA when the litigation was launched, is that right?     He was no longer at PRASA.     And yet he was a significant player in the transaction, is it not and affidavits were placed before the court by PRASA and I guess [indistinct – dropping voice] but somebody who may have known quite a lot about the transaction, his affidavit was not there.  I am not saying that it was a wrong decision or right decision to include or not include his affidavit, I am just thinking that, you know, a court is able to – not that it is able, this is what courts do, they decide disputes between parties, they are able to say well, both parties put your facts before the court and the court decides but an inquiry such as this one might go broader in terms of facts, you know?     Because it is not deciding, it is not litigation.  So I am just wondering – I was just wondering whether it might not have been convenient to listen to him knowing what the affidavit says but maybe that is something to think about and I should just give him a chance to comment.     Ja.     Let him finish and then I will give you a chance.  Let him finish him finish first.     Ja?     Oh, you want to emphasise that you …[intervenes]     Ja.     Yes.     Ja, no, no, no, I will let you say what you want to say, let him finish first.     To the court.     Oh, okay.  I take what you are saying to be to say is it not better that Mr Montana gets an opportunity to say what he wishes to say when we have theaffidavit and therefore know in advance what he is going to say?  That is what you are saying?  That is, I think, consistent with what I was thinking.  So I must just say that – you see, as we look at these issues where a court has made certain findings and has given judgment, one needs to on the one hand bear that in mind but on the other hand, bear in mind that because of the different functions between the court and the Commission and as well as issues which might – for the court they might be narrower, for the Commission muchwider, there may be circumstances where the Commission might need to hear more than the court had before it.   I think of an example that will be – that will resonate with you, I think.  You will remember during the ‘80’s when labour law was in its infancy in this country that when there had been a judgment by the then Supreme Court on a matter affecting a dismissal, when the employee of a trade union went to the Industrial Court to challenge the fairness of the dismissal, usually you would find lawyers for the company, for the employer, saying no, but the court has decided but what the court would have decided is well, the dismissal was lawful or whatever and the Industrial Court would look at the question of whether the dismissal was fair.  So the Industrial Court could still look into the matter.  So that is what crossed my mind as I think about the fact that there may be situations where there is a judgment but because it is two different forums with a different scope of inquiry it may be that there may be circumstances where the Commission has to hear something that the court did not hear but one has got to bear in mind obviously various things, the time constraints, but also the issue of fairness to somebody affected, such as Mr Montana especially where he did not get a chance to his side, his facts, as he knows them, were excluded.So it is something that one may need to tread carefully on but it is something that one might need to look at with a view to making sure that one, there is fairness but there is proper consideration for the time constraints that one is working under and then take it from there.  That is what has crossed my mind.  Does what I thought resonate with you resonate with you?     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Mr Montana, before you – before we move further, let me ask the question.  In your affidavit do you deal with – or no, probably you do not deal with the judgment, or do you?     Ja.     Yes.     One of your annexures…?    Oh, okay, that is – you have given that to the legal team or not yet?     Previously?     Ja.     Oh, okay, okay.     Okay.  Well, I will tell you what I am inclined to do.  I am inclined to first see what you have to say and maybe it is that affidavit and whatever, whatever, before I let you then deal with it.  Is that fine with you? MR     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Yes, ja.     Those affidavits.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, ja.     But I will – let me say – why do you think it is not right that you reserve your comments on the judgment until we have seen what we want to see?    Ja, because [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Ja.  Ja, ja.  No, no, you will get a chance, ja.     Ja, no, he must be given – I am, myself, interested in seeing at least your affidavit.  I may be interested to see more of the other affidavits but your affidavit because you have said the facts that the court was given were not true or did not give the complete picture and if it had looked at the affidavits that wereexcluded it may have come to a different conclusion.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja, no, no, no, that is fine, that is fine. So, Mr Soni, you will take charge of the process of obtaining the affidavits.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  At least Mr Montana’s one.     It may be that – I do not know, I just do have a recollection that the court papers in some of these PRASA matters go into thousands.     So I am – so at least maybe the first – the start is to get Mr Montana’s one.     And then one can take it from there.  Okay.    Okay, alright.  And if there are matters when we finish, Mr Montana, if there are matters that either the Commission has undertaken to look at, you have asked that they be looked at, which by that time it might not have looked at or come back to you, just raise them when you finish all your evidence, if there are things because I justwant to make sure that every issue that needs to be looked at is looked at.  Ja, okay.  Mr Soni?     Yes. ADV VAS SONI     Ja, Waterkloof, ja.       Yes.     H’m okay no that’s fine.  I think because we starting a new topic it might be convenient that we take a short break.     Let us just take a short break, I want to say five minutes, I know five minutes might be good for me but I don’t know whether – Mr Montana you said you were looking for your jersey and so on.     Five minutes is fine.     Okay, alright, let’s adjourn for five minutes.     Okay, let’s continue.    Your mic.     H’m, you mean in general?     Or this particular property.     This report, oh, okay, alright do that.     Let me say this because this might certain things might be causing confusion, before you proceed, okay so I see that so it is a report or investigator ’s report as opposed to being a report of the Commission, so I am just mentioning that so that that distinction is made, in other words a member of the investigation team assigned to look into certain matters is supposed to have conducted investigation and looked at documents and he then cuts to certain issues which I might accept or reject, so I just want to mention that, then youcan continue.     You see Mr Montana by coming to the Commission you might end up being a de facto lawyer.     Ja.     What report, I’m sorry?     Oh yes, yes.     Ja, h’m.     No, no that is fine.     No, no, no Mr Soni will be able to say something in response if he wishes to, but what you say Mr Montana is you have said that this report is based on MrO’Sullivan’s affidavit so I am keen to see that affidavit and then I think you said something else also based on something else.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     H’m?     H’m.     No, no that is fine, yes, yes.     Ja, ja ...[intervenes]      Ja, no that is fine, I wanted to say something about Mr Wagner I think, I don’t remember that name but I do recall that on one of the occasions when you were appearing here you did refer to a witness and I thinkit was in the context of the property, of the issues of the properties that you said as I understood you had deposed to an affidavit or had said something that you said were – did not accord or support a certain narrative, and I think ou said he was not called to give evidence. Subsequent to hearing you saying that I did ask I think I hope I am not mistaken, I did raise it with the legal team to say follow up on this, what is Mr Montana is talking about, because it may be that sometimes somebody expects a certain witness to be called and the witness is not called for reason A, but when that person sees that this witness is not being he or she thinks it is reason B, you know, sometimes there is a good reason but when you know there is not communication and discussion it is easy to think differently, so I am just saying that when youpreviously mentioned something like that I raised it with the legal team to say they must look into that.Mr Soni did I raise it with you?      Yes, yes, I do recall that you told me I think a certain answer, ja.     Well you must read the last sentence aswell, I think it is important.     Okay.     Okay.   Okay alright.  The – the agreement – well the agreements he refers to in 3.1 or 3.2 must be agreements.    With Mr Van Der Walt.    Okay, okay, alright.  Yes okay.  Mr Montana do you – I think Mr – what Mr Soni was doing was just to explain why Mr Wagner was not called but the affidavit is here.  Do you want to say something on that?    Ja.   Ja.    Now Mr Soni or Mr Montana in your affidavit that is saying that in terms of the annexures is there a distinct section where you deal with the issue of properties?   In great detail.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    You know what I am thinking Mr Soni it may be convenient that Mr Montana gets questioned on the properties when one has seen what he has to say about each of the allegations connected with all his properties because without that he might spend – we might spent a lot of time because one he is not looking at what he has already written and we could take maybe half the time if we were to do it that way.    Yes.      Yes.    Ja.    No I think I would prefer to read it before you give evidence because then…    Then I would be in a position and Mr Soni would be in a position too – I would be in a position to say inthe light of your response the only issues are really ABCD.  So let us focus on those issues then we do not have to spend too much time.    Yes, ja.     A background.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  So – so for example – I mean you said already you have got this story.  You have your – what you have to say in your affidavit.  So when one has regard towhatever the documents say here and what you have to say one ought to be able to say there is no disputes in terms of facts on the following issues.  The disputes are only in regard to ABCD.    And…    Yes.  So – ja you want to say something.    Yes, ja.     Hm.    No, no I – that is important.  In the end – in the end you are right to say to the extent that this is on the basis of suspicion that it is a bribe this is my answer.  It is not or it cannot be because of these facts.  So – so we must not forget that – that is important.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.      Ja.  Ja.    Ja.    Ja. No, no that is fine.   Ja.    How far – how far are you and the legal team to finalising the annexures for the affidavit?    Ja.    ja.    Ja.   Ja.    Yes.    The reason I ask Mr Soni you remember that – and Mr Montana would remember that I did say previously what we will do with the affidavit once it has – it is ready it is something we decide – that I will decide then because of the time constraints.  Now if Mr Montana’s assessment that tomorrow whatever is left we finalise – should be finalised if that is correct then it may be that all we need is that it gets finalised tomorrow and then one can look at it with special reference to the section relating to the properties and then take it from there.   It may well be that when his response to the issues of properties is looked at is considered it may well be that it might be necessary to maybe do some further limited investigation of some issues.    I do not know.  Or it may be that it is not necessary.  But certainly in relation to properties I – it is going to be important that or I hear what he has to say and as I say I want to hear when there is something in writingand then what one does with the balance of the affidavit might also be something to look at.   If the position is that the section on the properties is – has got to be dealt with because that is part of what he was asked to respond on but maybe he is not going to get a chance to give all the evidence about other matters that has – the affidavit it may well be that – you might consider whether there should be a separate affidavit that just extracts from the – from his affidavit the section that deals with properties you know.  So – so it seems to me that – but let me find out is it your understanding too that tomorrow the issue of annexures and whatever in regard to his affidavit might be sorted out?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes do you want to find…    Yes.    Oh but in terms of whether it can be finalised the process can be finalised tomorrow?  Is she in agreement as well?    By Wednesday.  Okay.  In any event that is quite close.    I think ja.  So I think therefore what we should do is not move forward on the issue of properties for now.   Let us get that part sorted out and then once I have seen what he has got to say on the properties then we can take it from there.  Okay.  Is that fine Mr Montana?    Ja it is fine.  Ja.  I think what – what the effect of that arrangement for present purposes is therefore I guess that if there are other matters but I think the – you know the Oellermann document was the last.    The one that you wanted – ja so from your point of view you have nothing further.    For today.    Okay.  And I guess that to the extent that Mr Montana has throughout indicated that he deals with certain things in his affidavit – in his affidavit we cannot deal with those either because the affidavit must still be finalised in terms of annexures.    So that being the case I think it would mean we should adjourn on the understanding that soonanother date will be given maybe another evening and then we take it from there.  Is that alright?    Okay alright.  We are at seventeen minutes past four so I think let us adjourn then and then we willarrange a date but the sooner the process of sorting out the annexures to his affidavit is finalised the better.    Okay alright.  I think we adjourn.  Ja.  Okay we are going to adjourn for the day.  We do not have an evening session today.  We were going to probably have it if we were continuing with Mr Montana.  Tomorrow for the benefit of the public I will be hearing Mr Koko’s evidence in regard to Eskom.  Ja.  Okay alright.  We adjourn. 
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Mr Chairperson may I apologise we are starting about half an hour late it seems there was a bit of a miscommunication Mr Montana knew he was coming toady but thought he was on standby and did not realise it would be the normal time ten o’clock.    That seems to be a misunderstanding.    As you please Chairperson.    Mr Montana you will recall that on the previous occasion you were here we were dealing with the affidavit of Ms Ngoye you have recalled and we had dealt with the allegations she makes in paragraph 19.  You recall that?    Mr Montana I am grateful you pointed that out what I thought we would do is all the matters that are sought of so in dispute and where you have raised concerns we will deal with them at the end of our – Ms Ngoye’s and Mr Oellermann’s reports.  Then – you know then we know that we have dealt with – we have dealt with all the matters you have been called for and those will be   Now you would recall that in paragraph 19 we dealt with the MM2 which was the letter that was sent to Mr Dingiswayo as well.  Do you recall that Mr Montana?    Yes.    Yes.  Alright.  Now I just want to go then toparagraph 20 the – and this issue too we dealt with when we considered Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit that you dismissed Mr Dingiswayo and we have been through that.  And then we know that Ms Ngoye called you and there was a conversation between you and her that did happen right?    And one of the things she says if you turn to page 289 is she said to you that the dismissal of Mr Dingiswayo was similar to the matter relating to Mr Chauke.  Did she tell you that on the 18 t h?  If you look at    Okay.  But she did not tell you that?    Okay.  Did she mention Chauke?    And…   As you please Chairperson I am grateful for that.    Now Then she says that she said she – you should have engaged with her and that she had approved of all Mr Dingiswayo’s decisions.  Did she tell you that?    Alright so can I just understand when youtalked to her on the phone on the 18 t h you had told her you are going to fire her.  You had told her that she must come on the following day because you are firing her in that phone call.    As you please Chair.  Now in the next    Okay I just want to point this out to you Mr Montana the one essential difference between your and Ms Nyoge is you are saying you told her on the 18 t h that she was fired she is saying she only found out at six o’clock onthe evening of the 19 t h.  That is the difference between the two of you right?    No, no but Mr Montana I want to emphasise this that is an essential difference because to an outsider it makes a little sense that an employee is told you are fired and comes back to receive the letter dismissing her.  So I am saying it is – it is not an inconsequential difference between the two of you and I would like you to reflect – did you tell her on the 18 t h or only on the 19 t h?    Okay so we – we …    So we know now you told her on the 19 t h?    I am sorry on the 18 t h.    Alright and then you gave her the letter ofdismissal that …    Of course sorry.    Thank you.  Then let us look at MM3 this is the letter of immediate termination that appears at page 319 Mr Montana.      Yes.  Have you got it?    Alright.  You – in your letter – alright firstly this letter on 320 is signed and it appears to be signs by yourself, that is correct is it not?    Alright.  Now you – you start off at page319 in the first paragraph referring to the phone call and the fact that the – the matter concerned the dismissal of Mr Dingiswayo and you then set out the objection that Ms Ngoye raised and you say here that you told her you were engaged in the – in another meeting just as you have told us this morning.  Is that correct?    Then you say she began to raise her voice and demanded your objection be – her objection be heard and you say that that amounted to an act of grossinsubordination which may attract a drastic sanction such as dismissal.  That is what your letter says, is that right?    And you say   That is correct?    Then on the next page you say   Alright.   “I reminded you that this had no bearing whatsoever to the issues which you called me about.  I view – I with a view to address your concerns requested you put thesegrievances and allegations in writing.  You refused to do so.  Your refusal and defiance to act on my instructions again amounted to gross insubordination.”     “Now during this conversation it became clear to me..”  And you obviously talking about the conversation on the 18 t h – that is the telephonic conversation?     “It became clear to me that you as an executive at PRASA intentionally failed to accept my authority as the Group CEO andyou addressed me with a level of resistance, defiance and great disrespect to which I cautioned you against.” That too did happen?    Alright.  Then you say   And that – so you say that happened even in that meeting?    Then you go on to say   You see Mr Montana this would suggest that the decision was only made on the 19 t h not on the 18 t h.  I am only saying to you that when one reads the letter that is what appears.    Chair.    Yes.    So – yes – the point is Chairperson what is clear from Ms Ngoye’s affidavit hers they had a telephoneconversation on the 18 t h.The – it was unhappy conversation.  Mr Montana says it was an aggressive conversation.  We can accept both versions it does not matter.  But Ms Ngoye says she was only told on the 19 t h that she was being dismissed when she met Mr Montana face to face.  And Mr Montana’s version is he told her on the 18 t h.  So that is the difference between them and I am saying Chairperson that the letter which indicates that there is a reference to the face to face meeting on the 19 t h would suggest that Ms Ngoye’s version is correct that she was only told on the 19 t h not on the 18 t h.    Chairperson what – what would happen or what – what - who is this?  And I accept in the final analyses not much will depend on but it would show that Ms Ngoye’s version is the more probable when one has all the evidence in hand.    So what - and I am just taking the big picture that emerges around the flow of funds.    There is that monies were dispersed by Swifambo Similex.    There they were saying that “I received instructions from Maria Gomez to pay these amounts to Similex.”    So that is the amount of R79.4 million.  But Mashaba is saying that that money never – because Sabelo was never a fund raiser with the ANC that money never reached the ANC.    Similex.    Ms Gomes yes.   Not – not from this.    Can I then ask you to turn to the same bundle that is Bundle C1 SS Ford Stand documents to page 214.149.  Oh sorry before you – before we go there can I just keep you at 133 Mr Montana and say that according to paragraph 1 now and this is why the link to Swifambo is not   But let me make another point you…    As you please Chair.   Can I just finish this Chairperson?    Then we will finish Mr Montana …    Ms Ngoye’s affidavit.    As you please Chairperson.  Can I now ask    Well we know that – and I am just saying this to you so we finish this – that Swifambo did pay Mr Mabunda or the S firm several million rand – and that is reflected in this affidavit.  I did not refer to that and I purposely did not refer to that because the point you make Mr Montana is this that if Swifambo had engaged the services of the S Group for Mr Mabunda it might well be improper for Mr Mabunda to then receive a R75million payment which is the complaint that Mr Mashaba makes at note 32.  That is the only point I want to make.   Well fortunately we will not need to look at it it will need – it will be some other forum that will. I am just saying that Mr Mashaba’s mind.    That is the impropriety on Mr Mabunda’s part.   As you please.    As you please.    With Mr Van Der Walt.    Yes.  It is 3.5 that the agreement with Mr Montana.    No I agree.    Chairperson may I augment that and that we must do because Mr Montana must be entitled to (inaudible).    One of the purposes of the 10.6 directive was to say tell us what you admit and what you do not?  So if I am just giving an – that is in addition to what you said Chairperson.    It will shorten things a lot more.  If I could just take and I am doing it for Mr Montana’s sake at page 34 if we are – that is of SS18 Bundle H.  Because it says     Page 34.  Paragraph 2 says Mr Montana purchased the Parkwood property on the 4t h of July for R1.85 million.  Mr Montana can say yes or no.  So one then knows that when one is dealing with the – and those are just facts.    I am not asking him to deal with the inference.    Just the facts.  Then we say that in paragraph 3 there – there is a – an email from Mr Montana’sprivate banker which says the property is valued at R3.5 million.   It does not mean he accepts the valuation it merely says yes I accept that that is what my client (inaudible).  Then at paragraph 4 we say Precise Trade and Mr Montana entered into a purchase and sale contract whereby the property was sold.  So that would just eliminate all the factual disputes and we will get into the real disputes as to where did the money come from.    Mr Montana’s explanation being sought.  So it is not amending what you are saying it is augmenting Chair.    Correct.    And it will save us plenty of time.    Yes.    Chairperson let me say I have for various reasons have not involved myself.    In dealings with Mr Montana outside the commission.    Ms Gatanga is …    Is – they have arranged that already.    It was supposed to happen on Friday it did not.  As I understand it that is the arrangement for tomorrow.   She thinks by Wednesday Chair.    Quite close.    As you please Chair.    It is yes.    No nothing further Chair.   No.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    As you please Chair.
MR MONTANA:  Thank you – thank you Chair.    Tshepo Lucky Montana.    Not at all.    I d.    So help me God.    I recall Chair.  May I – May I through youChair just raise one thing?  Go back to 15.13.    15.13.    And 15.13 and 15.14 I think it is just one thing Mr Soni I did raise it the last time and requested the commission to find the copy of the letter of suspending Mr Martin Chauke and I think I said look I wanted to – to remind myself and Chair I have since come across – it is not the same letter but a draft letter by – and I will forward that to you – between the letter it is because it is apparently signed by the late Ms Hope Zinde and it had nothing to do I think the commission will see that it is has got nothing to do with (talking over one another).    Yes, no I will forward that Chair the…    The letter speaks about other things about …    (Inaudible).    So I wanted to just remind myself.    And – but I think a signed copy thathopefully that Mr Chauke will provide that to the commission.    Because I have got the draft but I still forward that.    00   Thank you.  Thank you Chair.    We dealt with it Chair.    I spoke at length on the matter yes.    That is correct.    Well Chair not in those exact – in those exact terms not mentioning Mr Chauke as it were but she was – she was unruly – she was unruly Chair – she was insubordinate.  Her conduct was very bad.    Not those specific words no Chair.    No not at all Chair.    Well I think Chair I think (inaudible).    No, no Chair she did not say that.  Chair you see we did not even discuss at length because I had another scheduled meeting and I did indicate to Ms Ngoyethat I am having a meeting will discuss the matter once I am done in the meeting or tomorrow and that is when she refused and she became unruly.   And – and effectively and I think I deal with that at length in my affidavit.  She then was daring me to fire her – you are firing me – you fired my general manager.  Well I reminded her the general manager appointed by the Group CEO and fired the Group CEO.   But I then invited her to say look come let us the following day and invited her to all the issues she wasraising in passing in end I ask her put them in black and white I want to see them because I was hearing some of those things for the first time.   So I think the Dingiswayo dismissal it seems to have unleashed something else Chair.  I said put that in black and white show us some cooperating and she kept on saying well I think you just fire me.  And I said well you – that is what you are asking for that is what you will get and then I invited her to come and see me tomorrow and said look I will take action.   I have asked you to put the things in black and white you have still to do that. Kept on having a – she was screaming Chair she was completely disorder but this was someone who you could see that she – when someone is daring you in that way she – and I knew at that timeconsistent with my emails and Mr Soni the emails that I had written about. So there was all that background.    So you – about the campaign that there were all these things and here is the person who is daring her immediate boss – I even said put them in black and white let us discuss that the following day.  She still defies that. If I denied her an opportunity I would understand that if she says I tried to raise the issues with Mr Montana he did not want even to hear me.  I said to her and again that detail I provide in my affidavit – I said to her put it in black and white let us discuss those.  And she was no she was on a warpath and    Yes no, no that evening I did tell her that she – well she is asking for it.  She did not say it once, she did not say it twice – every time she just kept on saying then fire me and I took a decision that here is a person who – here is an executive who – who conducts herself in that way and I think Chair in my – in one of my documentsI am not sure if I have attached it inside I write a letter to the chair of the – of the Remuneration and HR Committee of the board to explain the circumstances around her, Mr Dingiswayo and someone else.   So I dealt with it in that way but she – because at that time I could not just fire her but she gave me a reason to fire her.  She said fire me because she was – she was defiant, she was disorderly and it was someone who says look I am not going to actually respect your authority as CEO and she was putting me to the test.   For me she was making a clear statement I am no longer prepared to work with you.  I am no longer going to respect your position.  So Chair I took action on that basis.    Chair probably in my mind and I want to reflect to the Chair and the commission my honest – the way – my state of mind at that point in time I had taken a firm view about some of the team members who were nolonger focussing on what we had agreed upon as an organisation and they were running behind the campaign and the selecting certain contracts and leaving others and doing a whole range of other things.  So my mind was – was mind was fact was made Chair but I would not say because you know when you run an organisation especially an organisation as big as PRASA you are managing different interests.   I will tell you Chair that there are many instances where I get angry with people and I take a view that they should be fired.  Some of them would run behind my back and run to the chairman and at that time Mr Buthelezi – Mr Buthelezi will then invite me and say come let us have dinner.  We will have dinner we talk and we talk about other things and he will say there is this situation.  And then he will say to me – and give me cogent reasons and say look I think maybe chair you are over-reacting you are not dealing with the issue and will counsel me and say I think you should deal with it differently.  So – so sometimes I do take a view but it does not mean that view would be realised because an organisation you have one on one meetings – people do present and tell you I did this because I thought 123.   But this one was involved in wrongdoing and I – and I invited her to sit with me as an executive and she defiesme and she asked me to fire her.  So yes I had made up my mind that she can see the tone in my email but whether ultimately she was going to be fired or not Chair I would not say with certainty because I think that a lot of things had transpired.   So I would put – I think that will – that would have been -  you are managing different interests sometimes you want to unite the organisation, you want to unite the teams that the executive is leaving and therefore – and therefore you consider all of those factors.   Is it ultimately in the interest of the organisation but we were facing a state of paralysis because of the campaign and Chair I had resolved in my head if I stayed in PRASA beyond that period probably most of these people some of them will come here said a whole range ofthings at the commission.  Some of them in fact have even done worst things that what Ms Ngoye has done. Some of them are Chair instead of firing I called the person on one    Because I those issues come in that context.    But I did not fire her.    So it was not this thing that you have thisguy who was firing everybody, who was so senseless.  I follow – I listen to reason Chair and in some instances these people had access to the board and they will tell – they will lobby board members and board members would ask me and sometimes they will say to me we think you must reverse that decision or we think you must not go that route.  Because the board is there is counsel you.   So Chair I was not this all powerful person who was pushing everybody out of the way as presented in this affidavit.  No it is not correct.  So I will say in a nutshellChair my mind was made but whether she was going to leave PRASA or not…    I think it was still dependent on a whole range of other factors.    Chair that was correct.  As I said I told her yes – the reason I invited her was to fire her.  I told her that.  She knew when she was coming to me that – sherefused the opportunity to meet and discuss with me.  And I said you must come tomorrow I will give you facts that – I could not have called immediately but I had another meeting.  She was actually disruptive I had to go out of a meeting to be able to try and even calm her down. She was defiant Chair and I have recorded that in my affidavit.    But I will respect the difference Chair.  Let us agree to disagree with Ms Ngoye on this one I will not dispute that.  I will put my view – she will put her view and ja.    No, no Chair I told her on the 18 t h butbecause I was in a meeting there was no way I would even  - because the meeting was in the evening as well the previous night.    I would not know…    It was on the 18 t h.    On the 18 t h Chair.    No, no Chair I was trying to say that there was no way in which because we did not plan to fire her.  That is the issue.  I think it links to the – to my explanation earlier on to you Chair that there was no plan to fire her.  There was no letter – with Dingiswayo as the teamprepared the letter.  I want to meet the – I want to meet the – I want to meet Dingiswayo – I want to indicate.  So we knew there was a – there was a process leading up to that.  Ms Ngoye’s decision was made on the events of the 18 t h I made that decision and I invited her the following – the following day.    So I am just saying.    I would not have prepared a letter on thatday when she was not there – we are not meeting I was meeting with other people Chair.  But then we had a discussion over the phone.    319?    I have got it Chair.    That is correct it is my letter Chair.    It is correct Chair.    It is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    She did Chair – she did that is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    Yes Chair I am referring to the 18 t h. Chair I cannot recall whether on that 18 t h I am referring to the telephonic conversation or we – we actually – I do not think we met but I am open – but I think we spoke but this – this letter correctly put on record what I said Chair.    That is correct Chair.   No, no Chair you remember the letter is giving effect to my decision which I had conveyed to her.  I think – I think that the – the – I do not know how significant – how material it is.  I am saying in my testimony I am saying to the commission.    On the 18 t h I have made that decision.  I have conveyed to her and then I put it in black and white this letter correctly captures that.  I do not know whether if I had given …    Chair I think probably that is what happened.   But I am saying that we did not have this matter over a three day period.    So the previous night and the next day.    So either the – the date may not be correct.    Or visa versa so I…   So I accept that Chair.    Yes Chair because I think in her own affidavit Chair.    She starts on the 18 t h.    And then she says we indeed met on 19 – the 19 t h.    And I cannot recall why the date is thet h Chair.    So I think – ja.     No, no Chair.     Yes, yes.     That is correct, Chair.    Chair, can I say?  No, I think the first point.  Chair, the point I have made that this, for me it is not a big issue.     I feel like I have been consistent in terms of what was...       What was in my mind and what would ultimately happen.     But this letter is specific.  And Chair, just to help Mr Soni.  I am saying in the last paragraph.  You see, because – and let me – and I am addressing the second part, Mr Soni, of what you are saying.     Mr Soni – you will recall, Chair, and why I am not – I do not want to leave this issue hanging the way ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Soni has summarised it.     Ms Ngoye was saying she was been targeted and even when she was here at the Commission     That was the last straw but if, let us say, she sat(?) with me, she did not then.      She did not even then knew at that particular day.     Would she have been fired?     I think Chair that is still a question.     You cannot – unfortunately, you cannot speculate about it.     Indeed, Chair.     No, it is fair.  It was the probability...[intervenes]      ...it was very high ...[intervenes]      That she be fired, Chair.     ...on that issue, Chair.    No, no Chair.  It is correct but I think the – she was not there.  Let me just share with theCommission, Chair.  We had a scheduled board meeting.  It was meant to start at ten.  When we arrived, of course, they did not raise the issue with the board.  They lobbied Mr Molefe.  So they raised – they took those letters to     Indeed, Chair.     Indeed, yes.    And I would not be – I would put – unless     Indeed, Chair.  It was the person who was going to preside over that particular matter.     As chairperson.     No, no she was entitled to have that, Chair.     She was entitled.     No, Chair.  No, no it was still – you will recall Chair I withdrew the letters.     Now what happened Chair is that after I have left ...[intervenes]      ...and you remember the R 57 million, it is a big to – R58 million to Siyagena matter.  I speak about it during my ...[intervenes]      It is a big issue, Chair.     Now after I have left, what happened, Ithink that PRASA brought in Norton Rose, the law firm.     And they declared everyone including people that were suspended in the organisation – some of them for serious transgressions, Chair.     Some of them even about money.  People have stolen money in the company.     Now everyone was on this bandwagon that no they were fired by Montana and people that have got nothing to do with me who do not report to me ...[intervenes]      ...show(?) them who are rear seats(?)who are charged because they have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar, Chair.     And they would return(?) all of them on a must stay ...[intervenes]      ...came back.  So, and then those that remained were in fact suspended Chair.     So you can see that in an organisationwhere there is a battle in the leadership ...[intervenes]      ...particularly between the chair and the CEO ...[intervenes]      ...you have that kind of a thing where the organisation is split in between.  And what is the result?  The result is that the operations of the business, the moral of staff, the discipline collapses.  And that is what happened in PRASA, Chair.     Chair, I want to put on record.     There was no an inquiry.     And if somebody is charged for irregular approval of R 58 million and many other transgressions – one of the charges related to – because when she acted in my position in that December when I was on leave, it was not only the SA Fence & Gate matter that she approved.  There are a whole range of other matters, Chair, that were irregularly approved by her.  It was part of the charge sheet.Now you cannot say because Mr Montana is gone.  The board has got an obligation to make sure that they verify and check and say we think that this one is – it stands, this one does not stand, Chair.  And I think that if you look at the report of the Public Protector, you will actually see, Chair, that the people who were not disciplined at PRASA, I – the heart of what the PublicProtector raised.  I do not agree with the Public Protector ’s report but if you look at what has happened, Chair, because the report came after I have left.  So they – matters in the Public Protector ’s report to dismiss and a whole range of other employees and then those that are actually mentioned in the report – I mean, let us take one good example.  I am not going – just to mention it.  The matter we discussed about the Primedia issue.  Who was central to it?  It is Mr Holele.  And thatmatter is raised in the Public Protector ’s report.  Who – there is the matter of the brand leadership.The appointment of brand leadership.  Who is central to it?  It is Mr Holele.  It is in the Public Protector ’s report.  He is not being disciplined. If you look at the Werksmans’ report, it mentioned the people who were part of the adjudication.  It mentioned Mr Oliver and Mr Holele and Ms Ngoye, all of them in that order.  Chair, those are the people who remained at PRASA.  So yes she makes that statement but knowing and following up on all the details, Chair, it never happened.  It was basically what you call – I used interview shop stewards, what they call no they used the word buti-buti-scheme.  So it was basically one of their own who is beingbrought in but to justify bringing her in and other people, they brought in a whole range of other people, some of the faces serious transgressions.  They never faced, Chair.  If this Commission were to review, for example Chair, the charges for some of the people, you will literally be shocked that they were brought back.So we – the board says we want to fight corruption.  The board says we want to fight improper conduct.  But fifty percent of the people that they regard as their own people are not subjected to these kinds of things,Chair.  And I think it is a separate issue.  I agree with Mr Soni.  Let us ...[intervenes]      ...but there was not a proper inquiry that you say ...[intervenes]      No, Chair, I was no never asked.     But Chair, just for the record.  The...     Part of my annexures I deal with those charges ...[intervenes]      ...to show how serious those charges were.     Ja.     Yes, Chair.  Except that I still want to put on record, especially in relation to 23.  In relation to 23 because I think you will recall, we closed on the basis of me discussing Swifambo, Werksmans, and other issues.  And I think you will recall my point.  I just want to put it on record.     Because here Ms Ngoye says – she describes the court, the high court and the supreme court of appeal on Swifambo.  And in my affidavit, Chair, and other papers, you will recall, I said I want those members of the Bid Adjudication Committee to be summonsed toexplain their roles because that is where – the Bid Evaluation Committee and the Bid Adjudication Committee.  Those are the people who gives cause, Chair.      Chair, can I say for the record?     That those issues are in fairness not a response in detail.     I dealt with in my affidavit.     I have interacted with the team Chair for information last week.     We have discussed my affidavit.  We had agreed that even sent on Friday a revised affidavit on some of those issues.  We were meant to meet on Friday to then sort out the annexures in relation to each.     We have agreed tomorrow I think Chair.     So that what we will do.  So I think Chair, they are not being lost.     I am just putting on record ...[intervenes]      ...my position so that we can deal with them and the supporting evidence on each of these matters.     No, indeed Chair.  Chair, I am quite – there are still issues that I will still raise in the process.     And I think Chair when the I got the summons from the Commission I reflected deeply(?).  What is the role of the Commission?  What do you want to achieve?       And I have used strong words Chair.     I think that if the Commission, for example, on the media side on the thing.  You know, I have criticised.     And Chair, I still have some of those on record in my affidavit but I have made a decision.  I will respect the Commission, I respect the Chair and I will go there without fear or favour.  I have put forward my viewson these issues.  And Chair, I do – I prefer to write my own affidavits.  And then I there I do consult with some of the best legal minds and they will tell me do not say this, do not say that.  And there are times when I go rouge and I say no I am not going to follow what they have said Chair.  So I do seek legal advice Chair.  But I think the story of PRASA is my story Chair.  There was no PRASA.  I was given a mandate by government to form PRASA and it was one of the – and one of the things – it     And that is why Chair I wrote to you on July 2019.     Because I said I want to tell the story ...[intervenes]      No, no Chair.  In fact, I wrote on the twenty – I think it was on the 26 t h.  On the 2 n d of August, the Commission responded.  We had a meeting at the Commission’s offices.       And then at the end of August, I gave you a first draft ...[intervenes]      ...of my affidavit.    2019, Chair.  That is why ...[intervenes]      That is why Chair I said in my statement I have been trying to come to your Commission.  It has taken me two years.     But because we then on the journey had a big fight Chair ...[intervenes]      ...about what I should say in my affidavit, what I should not say.     But the principle of it, Chair.  I have made a decision.    I have consulted with my family.     And said look – and some of the leaders have     And I said no I believe the Commission is pursuing a predetermined agenda and all of those things.     But they said we think go there.  And I said Chair if the Commission treats me bad, if they – if Mr Soni treats me badly and everything I will just carry my     It is my own response and I am saying, Chair …[intervenes]     Yes and I am saying, Chair – and you will see when it read it, Chair, and this will be my point.  I am saying at the beginning of my affidavit because, for me, when I asked why should I go after the ANC said all of us must go before the Commission, I then said, Chair, that this would by my report-back.   The nation gave us a mandate about these railwaysand, Chair, it is big, not because for any other reason, because I said I will use this Commission to give a report-back to the nation on the important work.   And I come here walking tall, Chair, for me I heard people talking about correspondence and all of those things and maybe, Chair, I listed to the President last week, I said when I come here I am going to make a joke and say Chair, can we put all of these accusations against me behind us because that is what the President says.  But I am here, Chair, I am here.     I want to be held accountable in this forum, that is also one important thing.     But I think the story of South AfricanRailways and the transformation that it embarked on, not everything about correspondence, where I have made mistakes, Chair, let them be pointed out.     But to project this thing that there was this grand corruption and all of those things, it is so false, I do not share that view, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     I am generally uncooperative, Chair, but respecting the Chair, I think, Chair, that – ja.     But you are a getting a true reflection of who I am, Chair.     When I read the newspapers, the way I am described, I always ask is this me they are talkingabout?  I do not think my mom or my dad, when they read about what is being said about me, by some of these publications, Chair.  They said all sorts of terrible things, but we have got to rise above all of those and I hope that in future or the media in particular, will understand that their job is not only the so-called speaking truth to power, they also have got the duty to inform, to enable citizens to be able to make informed decisions and participate effectively.   Now if the media mislead them, project others and take sides, then we are going to have actually in their minds democracy, Chair, we want the media that first and foremost must understand even before they speak truth to power they have a duty to inform and educate.     That is an integral part of the thing.  So this notion where you paid what the late Edward cite, the Palestinian intellectual when he delivered the – read lectures about speaking truth to power, you know, the media is very excellent in doing that, Chair, where you select …[intervenes]     The ramification, so speak truth to power that informs and educates.     And I think that is important for me, Chair.  Thank you.     No, not …[intervenes]     No.     Not, Chair, no.     I know Ms Gomez and I know Mr George Sibelo.     I know both of them, Chair.     No, Chair, I became aware of the 80 million – not even 88, 80 million that was mentioned in the media.  This came from the affidavit of Mr Popo Molefe, in the Swifambo matter.     That is when I first heard of it but previously I was aware that Mr Mashaba was talking to the ANC, from what he told me but not to this level of detail,Chair, no.     No, Chair, I think it was around that time.  I would assume that this was – this should have been in 14, Chair, if my memory serves me well.     No, sorry, Chair, sorry, Chair.  I am twothings, I am saying that – I am saying two things in one, let me correct so that we can understand.  I am saying when I heard this 80 million story, the affidavit of Mr Popo Molefe on the Swifambo matter, it happened in 2016, but left – so that was a year later, after I have left PRASA.  What I am saying, that the discussion that Mr – and I am assuming, I do not – I am assuming this – you are saying it comes from the affidavit of …[intervenes]     Mr Mashaba.  So I am saying that at the time when he was busy with this interaction I was aware of them and that was in – that should have been 2013, 2014, Chair.       Ja, no, Chair, but not 80 million, Chair.     Ja, that he was approached by the ANC.     For him to make a donation.     Not 2016.  But, Chair, we did not discuss, I did not know the details.     Indeed, Chair.     I became aware, Chair, and then I also obtained the affidavit.     When after I have read the affidavit I wasactually shocked with the things he was saying, that is when I applied to be a friend of the court.     But I will deal with that, Chair, when it is the right time.     No, Chair, no.  You know, Chair, can I – I do not know, can I take – can I ask Mr Soni that I perhaps answer this question now but in a much greater detail, Chair?     Just to have the …[intervenes]     Is it fine, Chair?     Because I address the issue in two ways, Chair.     Let me start with the ANC fundraising issue.    And because, Chair, I mention in my affidavit, I was drawn to ANC fundraising activities and in my affidavit I deal with that at great length, Chair.   And let me be honest, Chair, I listened to the testimony last week of the ANC President, Mr Ramaphosa, that contrasts very strongly with what I say, Chair.   The ANC worked in a particular way and as a result the ANC ended being defrauded because a lot of people would come and say we want to raise money in the name ofthe movement and they will say the movement, the ANC, referring to themselves.  And most of them, that money does not even end up in the ANC.   When I saw this statement, Chair, I tried to meet with the Treasurer-General of the ANC, at that time Dr Zweli Mkhize, whom I have met.   I have worked with him in fact very closely and I described that in the affidavit and I have met with Dr Zweli Mkhize at the home of Maria Gomez.  We discussed ANC finances and all of those things there.   Money, Chair, Ms Gomez is a businesswoman, involved not – Ms Gomez was never involved with PRASA, was never involved with Swifambo, was never involved in the locomotive tender, she was a businesswoman.  I knew her and her husband very well, Chair, through our ANCactivities.So, Chair, I would be involved in many ANC activities and the unfortunate thing, I hear the leadership of the ANC will come and say you know, this is the work of some people.   No, it is a way of life in the ANC, Chair, there is not a single state owned enterprise that the ANC has not approached, Chair.  Because I was a CEO …[intervenes]     Chair, I want to repeat it and maybe it willget on record.     Chair, I am saying the African National Congress approached state owned enterprises, it had its own conferences, it had a special section, deployed cadres including those that – the President was correct when he said not each and every person appointed in government or SOEs was appointed because he was a deployed cadre but one they are there, Chair, you will see they will be regarded as deployed cadres and there is a table there in the ANC conference.   They are approached by the ANC either as an organisation or by individual leaders of the ANC or by people who came that were raising money for the movement.  Half of that money probably does not go to the– and I will explain why I am taking you through this, Chair – half of that money does not even make – get through to ANC.Now the Swifambo contract, Chair, was never a corrupt contract, it will never be a corrupt contract and, Mr Soni, I will deal with the issue as well about the – you had the liquidators here and I watched when the Commission interviewed the liquidators.   Chair, I was in stitches including when one of the – Mr Sacks, who was in – who interviewed this thing, he saysand it is there also in the transcript, where he acknowledge that I know nothing about this tender or this transaction.  So the ANC approached these people.   The ANC would approach the CEOs of these state owned enterprises, public entities, asking for …[intervenes]     Who the…?     No, not, Chair.  I think not all of them, Chair.     Chair, I think – I think, in fact, you know, when – I was listening to the President very carefully.     And I think that – I think that – and I went as part of my review and I wrote about it on social media.  The ANC leadership wants to assist this Commission.   They should not try and put blame on people.  Theymust come and say we want to say to the country there is a certain way in which we did things.  These things happened before the – even the law on funding for political parties, the way we funded our conferences, the way in which in which we – prior to major conferences of the ANC, there are tables being sold and all of those things.  CEOs of companies, they are either buying these tables, Chair, or that they will get suppliers to that business to come and buy tables.   People who come, Chair, are all leaders, even for their own businesses and I described that at great length in my affidavit.   So I think – and I am a member of the ANC, Chair, I have been a member of the ANC – I joined when I was a student at Mamelodi High School.  I remain a member ofthe ANC, I have served that organisation with loyalty and probably will die as a member of the African National Congress.   But, Chair, this thing of trying to talk about state capture, these things belongs to Zuma, it is false.  The ANC is a way of life and if – and I thought we lost an opportunity when the President was here.   The ANC should have said there are certain things we used to do as a party, as an organisation, and we thing, with hindsight, when we reflect on where are country isgoing, we are looking at the culture that is developing, the culture of corruption, we think that because we are the leading – the governing party, because of the issue of incumbency.   Yes, you will find that people who get involved in this in one way or the member are members of the ANC.  But not all of them, some of them, Chair, when they got positions, they become even very close to the ANC. People who know nothing about the ANC, who has never worked for the ANC who most of them, some of them – I mean, I see people that I regard as sell-outs, in my own language, Chair.  I think you see where I stand in the political terrain, Chair.   So these are people who become – either they get appointed to positions, some of them buy their ownpositions, they sell even some of these things.   Now if you go back to Polokwane Conference of the ANC, the President made a joke, Chair, that you seem to know more about the ANC issues that are there.  I want to link – I am coming to link it to Swifambo, Chair, but I want to deal with the bigger context because for me this issue – when I saw Popo Molefe’s affidavit and say 80 million was given to the ANC, I then had a big struggle.   I was outside of PRASA, I have worked with the ANC, I have worked with the Treasurer-General, I then hadto -  I wanted to find out this 80 million, what was it all about, where is coming from because I did not know, Chair, it was not like we paid Swifambo 80 million to pay to the ANC, there was never such a thing.   Auswell was approached and he asked me, Chair, and say hey, do you think it is a good idea, Auswell is involved in many other businesses, Chair, he is an engineer.  He says …[intervenes]     Mashaba.  Mashaba, ja.  Sorry, Mr Soni.  And he says …[intervenes]     No, I have not stopped, Chair.     No, Chair, I want to deal with the ANC.     Linked to Swifambo and everything.     But I want to deal with the – start at abroader level and narrow it down.     Indeed, Chair.     Chair, I agree with that, I was at Polokwane, the deployed cadre, I was not representing a branch.     Well, Chair, if it is not …[intervenes]     Chair, it is in – sorry, Chair, it is in my affidavit and I say in my affidavit, the ANC is such a massive organisation, it has got nothing to fear, it is anorganisation of the people and it can say to this Commission and assist our country, we think may have created, in the way we did things, we may have created conditions for corruption, we may have created conditions for some of the things that are there.   It does not make the ANC accused number one, it is basically that it is reflecting honestly.  Today you have leaders of the ANC who come because some of them, they are not in government but they will take advantage of the standing of the ANC in society, even in SOEs, they willcome and approach us and try to bid and push for the interest of businesses where they involved in, this in the name of the ANC, to get money, Chair.  And always the movement, the movement, the movement.   So I think that when the ANC was here last week, they must tell us each other, Chair.  You said at some stage there will be a time when we have to face each other and tell each other the truth and I think the time has arrived, Chair, that the ANC hopefully it will still come back here and I think when we deal with my affidavit, Chair, I deal with what I believe the way the ANC operated.  Chair, the ANC, I worked with it, they will give me a list of suppliers that the ANC owed and say we think you must assist us in this way.   They were not asking because I am Lucky fromMamelodi, they were doing that because they say hey, you have got networks, you have got influence, use it to help us.  And, Chair, no one – I heard again the President says – and Popo Molefe said the same thing before you, Chair, said we do not want public funds to be used for party political activities.  Chair, it is not true. You know, when I listen, Chair, and I just walk up and down in my room when I listen to these type of things.  When the ANC organises events in January 8 statement, the leadership of the ANC said to Minister Dipuo Peters,we do not have a transport plan, we want Lucky to come and help us, PRASA to help us organise this thing.  Who pays for these things?  And she is not told by one person in a corner, she is told by the leadership of the ANC when they make preparations, Chair. So I think the organisation, the ANC, can take a bold step – currently they want to project it that it is those who are corrupt and those who are not corrupt and, Chair, when we go deeper into it – and I want to assist the Commission – because every – at least once a month, I will go to the ANC HQ at Luthuli House, if they do not burn those papers there, every time you go there you sign.  If you say bring them and see the people who go there, you will see that CEOs would go there, Chair.   My own colleagues.  I will not mention them, I donot want to speak for them, but they will tell you, Chair, that  – they will even ask you, hey, we are under pressure on this thing, how do we deal with it?  Because we speak amongst ourselves as CEO.   So the ANC leadership to come here and pretend that no, we have supported this Commission and everything but do not assist this Commission to solve the fundamental problems facing our society.  I think it is not correct, Chair, and I am saying this not because I want to attack anyone, I want to – I said I want to come and assistthe Commission.   Chair, the ANC has had lots of events, the ANC has had – some of the debt the ANC had when Dr Zweli Mkhize was Treasurer-General were sorted out by me, I had to speak to these companies and say can we deal with the ANC debt differently because some of were taking the – actually one of the days some – the sheriff of the court was on his way to attach furniture at the ANC headquarters and I was told I had to speak to a CEO of a large transport company that I knew very well and say but you do work for the country, for the government, you have this – you have got a tender and everything, can you really take furniture from the ANC headquarters for 2 000 – or rather R2 million? Chair, me and Dr Zweli Mkhize, and I know that hehas sent an affidavit denying all of that, but I tried to track Mrs Gomez because I wanted her to file an affidavit before this Commission, is if she is not in the country, to tell – she will say, Chair, that we were meeting all the time to look at the monies for the ANC inside the country and outside. Now when the 80 million came in – so I am dealing with the big part …[intervenes]     That the big part I am saying in thisCommission …[intervenes]     Absolutely, Chair.     Deputy Chair – Chair, I wanted to read,Judge, for the record on my section on the ANC.     One of the conclusions there, I just want to read them into record.     They are part of my affidavit, I deal with     He confirmed but the ANC are asked, did the ANC get the 80 million from Swifambo, the ANC had issued a statement and said no.  And you know what I said to Dr Mkhize in a text message?  If the ANC did not get the 80 million – it was not coming from us, it was not coming from PRASA, it was not a corrupt deal and I cannot accuseDr Mkhize of being corrupt because when this deal happened he was not even Treasurer-General of the ANC, he became Treasurer-General of the ANC later but, Chair, I was there with him at Maria Gomez’s house in Hawthorne(?) and you would come – would sit there, I would be there to discuss ANC monies and Dr – Maria Gomez, when the TG has made some of the requests and requirements, sometimes she will be given even accounts who to pay and I sit here, I listened to the President last week and the ANC washes its hands.  I think, Chair, the leadership of the ANC’s meeting to date must reflect honestly on it and say when we say we want to cooperate with the Commission, when we say we want to assist this Commission, and last week Chair it was not one of those.    I felt ashamed as a member of the ANC that we are not telling the majority of our people the true story, and I have recorded Chair, I have got a big section on the ANC here, including tenders that people in the ANC got and used their own positions, including some approaches Chair, and I am not saying that because I want to prove some anyone's wrong.  But I think that we should learn from it and say now that we have got the President that signed into law, this legislation governing the way parties should be, but for theANC to pretend Chair that there - its own conferences and events are not funded from public funds, it is not true Chair. I want to put it actually, let me put it as bluntly as it is not true and this Commission, maybe should not hear from only the ANC, it must extend its time – I am now urging that let us extend our time, till the end of the year, apply for that.  Get the CEO’s to tell us what is their relationship, I am telling my party, you probably having scary things Chair from this process.  So who must said - who must provideleadership on decision, who must assist this Commission, the ANC is supposed to be the first, it's got nothing to do with winning or losing an election, it must set the basis so that when this Commission puts the recommendation, they assist our country so that some of the things - and Chair they must abandon we started Kgalema Motlanthe reflecting at the time before Jacob Zuma was President of the Republic, but he was one of us.  Maybe, maybe he wants to come and the Commission want to invite Kgalema Motlanthe former President and say, what were you thinking, what was in your mind, what was the ANC thinking on this issue, Chair?  But now we are colour coding…[intervene]     May be important for the Commission Chair and you will be able to assess it.      Chair, hear from a deployed cadre, I did not apply for a job a Luthuli House but the ANC gave me a lot of duties as one of their trusted people and it is a way of life chain in the ANC that when you are in that position, you also have to find a way whether directly or indirectly, to assist the ANC.   It is a culture that is there and it is a culture that members of the ANC and its leaders and I am not – I am talking at the general level, I am not really – they do approach Chair, to even for their own businesses Chair and say hey man Montana, can you help us we are working with this people, they are making contribution to the movement and everything and some of it has got nothing to do with the movement.   It is people, cadre’s enriching themselves Chair andI thought the ANC would reflect honestly on this issue, Chair but enough of that Chair, for now.     Chair, let me give two specific examples.When we did – we are dealing with SA Fence and Gate, there was a tender and I know that my leader gets angry when I mentioned it, but it is true.  Enoch Godongwana for example, lobbied us that - for the tender to be awarded to a particular company.  He denies it, it is fine, Chair, but it happened and that company was Sondolo and this Sondolo I.T and Sondolo I.T is a subsidiary of BOSASA, okay.  Chair I knew Gavin Woods very well and sometimes…[intervene]     Sorry, Gavin Watson, his name is Gavin Watson.     I knew Gavin Watson and you know when I looked and I listened to how he was being treated,criminal and all of those things.  When someone was very close to the ANC, who has done a lot of things for the ANC and I knew him a lot of comrades knew him and Gavin was a good man, a good ANC person and now people are afraid to come here and say Chair, because they want to project the particular picture.  And I was proud when I saw Jacob Zuma former President, he came and the way he spoke at Gavin Watson's funeral.  So we want people of courage, that when it is difficult, we do not wash our hands.  The ANCwas refusing to even to meet me Chair because they believed that there was his massive corruption at PRASA and for me I just stood firm.  Okay, I said you can have it, you can show it in the media is not true.  An opportunity will arise when I tell the country the truth.  Yes, you cannot hide, you cannot have distance forever.  Chair it is a way of life in the ANC and you will not say we are renewing the ANC without looking at these things but the ANC, the transformation of the ANC it is a much bigger issue, it has to do with changes in our own society.  It is not just a simple question about people who steal and people who do not steal, we can spend 100 years Chair, accusing each other of who stole what, who stole what, some of these things are not true. Our society ischanging, the ANC calls itself a leader of society and when the President was here last week I wanted to hear how we are being led, I am not referring to the President, but by the party.  It failed the biggest test of accountability and leadership last week the ANC.  My own party Chair, okay so currently the model it has, is to have veterans who speaks because we respect them, we love them because of the enormous sacrifices they have made.  The wisdom they bring into the thing, they form themselves that they havenow become a - what is it called, a blog that targets other people.  I hear people who know me very well who are part of the veterans who talk about PRASA’s corruption, because I do not reply to some of them because they are so senior, I respect them.  Some of them have been there since the 60’s and I sent a note to them, can I please come visit you at home and have tea because I want to show them quietly that what we are repeating such and so forth, there is no basis for it.  So Chair, I am saying that I am hoping that before you round up this Commission the ANC will then have the courage to come back and say we think we stand - I do not think ANC is accused number one but I think that a lot of things has happened in the country.    Yes, Chair.    Chair I think more than that.     I agree fully Chair but I say more than that. I was as you speaking Chair, I was trying to put out - pull out two paragraphs that speaks to this issue for me.  I say in my affidavit Chair, that ANC leaders in and outside of government that used their powerful positions, the huge influence or standing of the ANC in society to evenadvance their own personal interest.  Leaders who put pressure on many CEO’s of SOE’s and public entities to assist the ANC or entities in which ANC leaders or members can belong to the movement.  We know many of this had nothing to do with the ANC but comrades making money for themselves.  The name of the ANC was used in vain.  But Chair, I am also going and I say the modus operandi is that the leader of the ANC would secure meetings for businesses, and they are sometimes paid fortheir effort.  They are paid facilitation fees and more on delivery of projects.  These have been happening since the 1990’s and not limited to the period under Jacob Zuma, okay. Now Chair, then there were issues of monies going into the ANC, okay, or accounts being presented, the Maria Gomes story Chair, when I heard Papu say R80million went to the ANC I did not know that, I was a CEO of PRASA I was already out of PRASA.  Chair, I travelled I even went to see Maria on my way to Berlin, in 2016.  I passed through London, and I met Ms Gomes in London and I asked her where is the money because I am now being told that you have got a corrupt deal because the money went to ANC. She said two things Chair, she confirmed that shehas given many monies to the ANC treasurer and that I know because I was there Chair when the accounts are provided to show transparency, that is the one thing Chair, particularly in the period leading to the 2014 election.  Chair, there were even other monies being organised from outside where the ANC would send people, even Maria Gomes travelled- Maria Gomes, I think with her husband.  I cannot recall it f Dr Mkhize travelled to one of the African countries there, so that we can get money for the ANC 2014 election and when I look at the statement ofthe ANC, they denounced Maria Gomes they do not know her yet the Treasurer General of the ANC were sitting with them, were either having lunch or dinner at their house and were discussing monies that were going the ANC.  Maria then also mentioned – so she did not deny that she put money into the ANC.  She said this money was for the ANC and she did that through a Treasurer General.  But the ANC issued a statement saying this money did not come to the ANC.  Now I ask in my affidavit whose account had been provided to Maria Gomes to make a contribution, that is one issue there and I think that – so I am just saying that there is a lot of stuff that we can talk about which I thought the ANC would reflect upon them.  Now they may say Lucky maybe he is bitter, he is angry I am not an angry man Chair, you can see I am herebut that is part of the reason why I fight with many leaders in the ANC because when they wanted - when the Gupta’s came to PRASA I fought with them but they wanted to do exactly what the Gupta’s were doing and I said no to them, I became enemy number one.  So it was fine when I fought with the Gupta’s but when I say no, no, is the same thing.  Whether it is in this bottle or in that bottle it is the same water, it cannot be done.  So Chair, the R80million story it is not the product of corruption.  If that is corruption, Chair, you are going tofind a lot of organisation who for one reason or the other have won tenders in this country, and they have made contributions to the ANC.  They were not – they never influenced Dr Mkhize and I must defend him and in this particular instance, he was not there when we did the PRASA Chair.  He came there with – or rather the Swifambo transit, he came there – he was elected in December 2012 when we awarded the contract to Swifambo, he started coming to that space late in 2013/ 2014 Chair and if indeed Maria Gomes gave money to the ANC we have to check whether it comes from other businesses or it comes from Swifambo, Chair, I do not believe it came from Swifambo that is one thing that is there, but we know that that has been used as a basis to suggest corruption. I looked at the report of the liquidators and the investigators Chair, let me say Chair they did not even know what they are talking about.  Look at the transcript the guy says I do not know the transaction yet his able to say - in fact what the reports of the investigators to this Commission, or rather the liquidators and the investigators -  what they are saying to this Commission, they are saying two things Chair.   They are saying PRASA did not pay R3.5billion in landing the contract, they only paid R2.6billion, trains weredelivered Chair.I thought that R2.6billion about R2.2/2.3billion went to places.  One, it went to Vossloh the company that built the train which the manual says to buy components and other things.  Now we are satisfied that actually, when I read that report, I was satisfied that the bulk of the money we paid went towards building these trains, that is the first issue. And then again, the money went to SARS and that we had about R280million that went to the directors of Swifambo.  Now, when you listen to the newspapers R3.5billion has been stolen, we never paid 3.5 we paid we paid R2.6billion, R2.3billion went to the company that builds the trains and money went to SARS and effectively, the issue under discussion is whether Swifambo was entitled to the R280million and whether it should pay andwhat kind of corruption is that?  Finally, Chair, the report of the liquidators. I wanted for me when I read it, I was not interested in what I just said, I wanted to see the money flows, they said follow the money. I wanted to see who at PRASA had been paid, not even a single person has been paid. The liquidators and the forensic experts, they never found a single one.  Now what kind of corrupt deals is that Chair?   It can never be; the issue is that we are now thinking how the Swifambo directors used that 280.  Iended up with somebody buying a house or whatever and then I can say it is proof of corruption.  It is not false Chair, and I think that as a Commission we need to deal with that and all the PRASA hearings that were happening.  I followed them with interest Chair because for me, I am vested in the truth. So the money was paid, Maria has confirmed paying some money.  It is not money – she said no, no, Lucky I am involved in oil and I am involved in other things, I put money into the ANC and as an Angolan me and my husband we are the friends of the ANC, we put money.  The ANC knows that I met Maria Gomes, through leaders of the ANC, not in some corners because of the PRASA deal, when we did the deal she was not there I never knew her Chair.Finally, Chair, let me say on this one.  I tried to see Dr Mkhize, it is in my affidavit.  Chair, you know what I put in my affidavit and people will come and say, it is true we want to be cross examined, I am ready Chair.  But let me say this, I wanted to see Dr Mkhize someone that I was working with very closely.  I was at Luthuli House or in some instances, and I think also we started working together when he was – because when he was elected he was still also Treasurer General, so he was still a Premier and I think that is when the province was still a workingmechanism.  So he was doing – so sometimes I meet him at the airport before he would fly to KZN, so he was doing all of those things.   So I am not talking about things I do not know I am talking about things that I was directly involved in.  When I left PRASA Chair, because Dr Mkhize at some stage also wanted other deals for the movement, which I rejected and I became a big enemy. When I tried to discuss the R80million Chair, did the ANC get this money, what happened? I struggled Chair, I could not see Dr Mkhize.  You know I met him at the hotel, I dropped him an SMS, a text message and I said and I was being sarcastic Chair and I think Vodacom will give us this SMS’s we must ask Chair that we get that SMS’s.  I said to Dr Mkhize, I greeted him TG, this is a text message.  My name is Lucky Montana, you may not remember me, I am the former Group CEO of PRAS and I wanted to discuss with you the statement issued by the ANC that they know nothing about the moneys, the R80million and I said if the statement of the ANC and I used the word if Chair guardedly. If the ANC did not receive this money and I said it tells me two things, also I believe that he made payments to the ANC and the ANC did not receive money.  And I said both the ANC and Swifambo, can it be or not Swifambo butAuswell Mashaba had actually been defrauded and I said, I wish to discuss this issue with you.  He sent me a text message and you know the beauty about text messages they are on record Chair and we can still pull them out and say here is a fact.  He called me, I struggled to see him for months but I saw him that very day that I sent him a text message. He called me and say I am at the hotel, in Sandton come and see me.  I went there, when I got there, the first thing he did was to berate me and it is again in my affidavit.  How can you say these things on an SMS because you know, this information can be - then he said to me, I have received money, he confirmed that receiving money but I do not know whether it is part of the R80million, and I did not receive R80million anyway.  So ifit was part of the R80million, I did not receive all the money, okay.And that day Chair, I left knowing part of the truth and that is when I said the only person who is going to help is Maria Gomes - at my own cost, I was invited by railway companies, international railway companies to come to Berlin to discuss railways, during the inner term, I was no longer at PRASA Chair, but they told me we think you can could help us in Africa.  So I flew there, but I travelled not my usual route,train for Berlin I went via London and I sent Ms Gomes, I said, I am on my way to Berlin can I see you?  she invited me…[intervene]     Ja, what happened their Chair, and there Chair we spoke, she confirmed.  So Chair, I am saying that I can relay all of these things and that is why I hope the ANC would be, but I want to tell the country Chair, I want to tell this Commission, I want to tell the country.     The Swifambo contract it is not a corrupt contract.  Even Judge Francis Jay – you know Chair on civil matters we have a problem and this will be my last point.    Ja, so this will be the last I promise Chair, Judge Francis J – you take that, you also take the Supreme Court of Appeal.  On civil matters you have courts making really unfortunate statements.  When somebody says Popo, Mr Molefe goes to Court we say that we believe that there was wrongdoing and he mentioned five irregularities. They may be true, they may not be true Chair andthe Courts take those irregularities and they want - I heard that time it was common Chair that when we deal with PRASA you are dealing with a big Tsotsi, Lucky Montana, even when it was not before Court the judgment must be as damning as possible, okay and Mr Soni said, with this he will accept those judgments Chair, bit a civil judgments - and you will see that when I go I deal with each and everything. It is a Swifambo front, no Chair there was no front here.  Did they - was there money paid?  And if there was money paid Chair, you know who it will be paid to?  It will be paid to members of the Commission Committee, Adjudication Committee, the CEO of PRASA, the Board Committee on procurement and the Board of PRASA. Then why do we not call all of these guys and dealwith that issue in that way?     Yes, Chair.     Well Chair, I am  happy to hear that Chair, I have not seen this, I am  seeing this for the first time but if that is the position, Chair, I think that  I am  happy because it indicates that the noise that the ANC took R80million from Swifambo was false and it also tells us that the statement made by Popo Molefe under oath that the ANC received R80million Chair, was actually false and it did actually - he misled Judge Francis,J in this particular regard Chair, because I think some of the strong statements about corruption they even emanate from thiskind of thing Chair.    If I may Chair?      Chair the – the – when I met Ms Gomes’s husband there are instances where Mr Sabelo was with themand – then I knew that the – and that is why number 5 maybe Mashaba is quoting what the George Sabelo said at the liquidation hearing but I know for example that in those discussions there was no clarity that he is a member of the ANC Fund Raising and all of those things and in some at the initial meeting because at that point Mkhize was not there but – but I think that Vikas Sagar was part of those. So that is why I am surprised you find.The second thing Chair that I want to say is that I worked for PRASA and I get a salary after I have rendered services whether as a train driver or whatever and I use my salaries in a particular way the problem of course for the commission is to decide what is it that it is following because here is a flow of money tells us a story but it may not tell us a true story.  Unless the commission would say Swifamboobtained – received money unlawfully and that is why this money was distributed.  But if Chair is saying PRASA paid Swifambo within a contract R2.6 billion and the bulk of that money – that is why I said for the commission it has to then make a determination whether the directors of Swifambo after having the – and the – you know if – if they were given R2.6 billion they never even delivered a single train.   Then the commission has got legitimate interests hey that the – there is a problem here – we give you money to buy – to build houses you do not build them.  Swifambo ispaid is delivering these trains – we use all of them and later on we are told the trains are tall.   Now I think the commission in my view Chair did come to a determination what is it that the directors of Swifambo are entitled – and if it says the 280 or whatever amount they – they then repaid themselves – it belongs to them and they bought houses they gave to the ANC that is a different matter.   But it says Swifambo was involved in a corrupt deal and got paid monies that were not legitimately due to them then of course then the – the flow of money from – from Mr Mashaba to Similex or via George and what – and then it raises the question when Ms Gomez was putting money to the ANC is it the same money?  Is it different money?  Is the flow of money showing us also as the – that Sabelo also paidthe ANC from part of that money?   Now these facts are very important because Chair they assist the commission to deal with – with the Terms of Reference corruption, fraud and as well as state capture.  But when you do it in general we are going to have a situation where Lucky Montana earned the salary, he buy a house and we say no, no even if his salary is part of that corrupt thing and I do not think that we – I think we need to be very specific on this matter so that we can answer the right question in line with the Terms of Reference of thecommission.  That will be my humble submission Chair.    No Chair I would accept that.  The issue of course for the investigators have got an interesting job to find out from the Sabelo and the other person when youapproach were you – were they informed by PRASA people were they doing all – because we are trying to get to the bottom of corruption.     But it is not something the commission will consider.    Chair you do it an emergency appointment considering the time is coming to an end and that you cannot go out on tender because then we award in six months.  Sohere is a candidate.    No, no Chair I was not aware until I read in the newspapers that Montana’s friend got paid R75 million. Chair I did not know – I did not know about it.  I did not know that – the terms but Chair I think let me say that my understanding is that when they were putting – I do not know when they were putting the NIP – what is it called – National Industrial Participation Program my understanding is that Swifambo then asked Mr Mabunda to help them.  I think they had some kind of an agreement but this one is strange because he is now working with them and he also worked with Vosloo.  I will not – I will not offer any explanation for that Chair but that was my understanding of the whole transaction.    No, no Chair I will accept that only if the R75million is related to the – their contracts.  You remember my understanding of the – of what these guys should do – what Mr Mabunda was doing was actually contracted to many companies in Europe he was working with.  Now the first issue left to verify the R75 million linked to the Swifambo contract or not?  Because if it is not there is no conflict – if it is part of that then clearly there is a conflict Chair so we need to look at it in a round.    Ja.    No not that Chair.     Sorry, Chair I was feeling a bit cold.     And I thought I was going to go and get a vest and by the time ...[intervenes]      ...I realised that it was silly.  So I just abandoned and came back quickly ...[intervenes]      ...to be on time.     Can I say something quickly?     Thank you, Chair.  No, no it is a fundamental matter.  Chair, I just want to put on record.  Mr Soni is partly right.       We did not apply.  PRASA went to court. I think it has lost a couple of times in these matters.  I think on four times.  Now their last review application that they made, it was a full bench of three judges which then wrote that it is not in the interest of justice for allegations to be made against officials and they are not given an opportunity.  So it did not apply.  We ...[indistinct]     Chair, I filed a detailed affidavit with a lot of evidence.  Two weeks before that matter, the whole bench was changed.  A new bench came in.  And our ownaffidavit that was asked by the court to put together, we were told that that evidence is no longer admissible.  So our affidavit that were asked by the court.  So we are not taking anything(?).  But when you read the judgment, you can hear, Chair, that they, in fact, it was.  But I will not argue that.  I accept what Mr Soni is saying ...[intervenes]      ...for the sake of progress but I think we should record it properly, Chair ...[intervenes]      ...in that regard.  Thank you.     Chair, this – the matter is dealt with indicating my ...[intervenes]      No, no Chair.  Can I again?  I do not want to disrupt Mr Soni.     It must be put – we are putting on record that we never applied.     The court ...[intervenes]      But the second thing, Chair.  I just want to say Mr Soni.  I do not want to debate it but they cannot say the court decided to take because these guys do not have substantial interest.  If you say in your affidavit that the Siyagena was awarded the contract in a corrupt way and you mention people’s names and then you ask them tocome – and then you say – then, surely, Chairperson there is a big problem.  I just want to say that.     But I deal with it in my affidavit.     So I just want to emphasise.  We did not apply.     The court emphasised, Chair.     I did an affidavit and I said I want to assist both parties, both Siyagena and PRASA because it seems they are getting their facts wrong.       I have provided those and said they can be used.     But the court rule, not from any application.     To say it is not in the interest of justice.  And I think that ...[intervenes]      ...that judgment that the three – by the three judges was for me it was the right decision becauseit dealt with the interest of justice.     And I think in this particular case, of course I do not have an interest in ...[intervenes]      But if I am referred to – I do not have an interest in the matter.  Surely, Chair, but the interest of justice is being undermined.  But I think let us proceed.     I just wanted to record those facts Chair.    Cross- function ...[intervenes]      ...sourcing ...[intervenes]      No, no, no.     The C – the one ...[intervenes]      CTPC is the Adjudication Committee ...[intervenes]      ...of Mr Tiro Holele and Martha Ngoye.     No, no Chair even on this one.  I will come ...[intervenes]      No, no Chair I am just going to ask you to give me time to reply to this.     When Mr Soni was reading this judgment,part of me was sitting with anger and at some stage I was also laughing.  How can the judges do this Chair?  One of the most scandalised judgment, suspicion of wrongdoing, inference and all of those things.  Then just two weeks before we go to court, the judges find reason – the judges are changed, Chair, new judges are brought in and then our affidavits that provides on this matter, cannot be considered and the judgments so similar, Chair, to the Swifambo judgment.   You remember I spoke about the SCA judgment?  Sothe SCA judges and the judges in Pretoria think the same, they think that this thing was under control of this what was it, tyrannical Montana.  The SCA judges say the same thing. Chair, let me address this thing.  I want to address the facts and Mr Soni has raised the judgment – I do not have, I have not party to this matter, so I cannot take it on appeal and I cannot I call the judges here to cross-examine, I wish if I had the privilege.     Chair, that is correct.     Not Montana alone.    All the people who participated in that process.     I never participated, I was a CEO.     So I think there were eight people who were mentioned by Ms Ngoye in her affidavit, Chair.     Now this affidavit, I think if there is one –who is happy with this kind of judgment?  Surely, Chair, that Werksmans, Ms Ngoye, Mr Molofe will be celebrating because they were able to get a judgment almost similar at the High Court, Gauteng High Court South division as well as in the North.   Chair, the changes of judges – and I do not know what the Judge President considered, one of the most scandalous things and I want to go into details, Chair, if you could allow me because I think …[intervenes]     But, Chair, can I object …[intervenes]     Not on the substance of the matter, Chair?     Because I think we have discussed previously and I think we need to take a decision.  Earlier on, Chair, I was dealing with the ANC issues.  It is time for me to respond to the judgment, to what the judges have said.  It is for the second time Mr Soni spoke about thefact that we do not need cast aspersions.     No, no, Chair.     But all of us, the only thing that is above all of us is the constitution in this country.  If I need to take on the judges, as long as I do not cast on a factual basis, I address the issues.     I cannot have this thing put before me to say do not case aspersions and everything.     No, Chair, in the latest that I have provided I have added a paragraph.     The affidavit that was submitted.     And for Mr Soni’s information, one of my annexures is my affidavit that I tabled there, Chair.     To my affidavit, it is my affidavit that I placed there in the High Court.     Well, Chair, we – it probably there, we have discussed …[intervenes]     Previously.     But we said we are allocating tomorrow,Chair, we are getting it.     So I am hoping that we will deal with the issue, Chairperson.     The judgment has been read.     And, you see, the issue has nothing to do with me.    So I am not dealing – my entry into this issue has got nothing to do with me.     There is nothing in this judgment.     It talks about participants, it does not say Mr Montana did that, it infers, we believe, we think wrongdoing may have been done by someone and then mention property.  Chair, I am not here to defend.    There is nothing to defend.  I do come to the Commission, Chair, I came to assist the Commission.     To put facts on the table.  The facts mentioned in these judgments are false, firstly.     Secondly, it is not only like Montana’s affidavits, all the people that were invited by the courts to file affidavits because the court said it is not in the interest of justice.  Okay, Chair?   To file – not to be given the opportunity to respond and of course I welcomed that opportunity, I said here is a court, we have been criticising the courts, here is a court, the judges said no but you cannot be making these statements, let the people – and Iresponded no in each and every detail, Chair, but I filed a very detailed affidavit with annexures to prove that the allegations that were made were false.  There were seven other people who were asked by the court to say file affidavits.  They did the same, Chair.  They were admitted. And I want to say boldly here, Chair, it is my affidavit and the affidavit of the seven others who were admitted, they were admitted because the court has asked for it and then just before the hearing starts, in that court Werksmans come and say there is no way they can beadmitted.  Say no, no, when the court took that decision, the two main parties, which is Siyangena and PRASA were to be – they should have agreed to that decision, now it is a court matter, it is the rules of the court that I do not know.  I am not challenging that, Chair. But the court has invited us and then the court – and, Chair, then court then says comes to a determination that the judges who were there before who said it is in the interest of justice for this people to come, they came back and the new judges says no, we should not.   Chair, I want to say that there is no way the court would have arrived at this judgment or penned this judgment if they agreed to accept out …[intervenes]     Those affidavits that the court had askedus to give.  But, Chair, I think the most - in terms of the way forward now, the fair process – because it is not only the attachment of that affidavit, it is also what I have written on this matter.     Actually.  Now I think that irrespective of what that affidavit said but I have got an affidavit and we have agreed on a process here that if there are issues that I should not deal with them as well, I can then refer to them and deal with them now because I think, Chair, the –you see, the problem that I have and I know that this Commission cannot create a platform from which judges are attacked and everything.     I understand the sensitivity.     But, Chair, I think that we also want robustness.  I will not go and attack judges, I am not – I believe myself to be someone who – who go at things directly.  I do not have an interest in attacking judges but this judgment, Chair, I want to see it and given the – before we even agree on the procedure, even elevate some of the issues that are here, Chair, you will actually be shocked.  The last time you gave us a bit of guidance, Chair, and you know one thing, I enjoyed being here thelast few days, Chair, is that when I am about to respond, you engage that judgment and I think that probably ten minutes ago I would have said things that really – just what you and Mr Soni were trying not to hear.But, Chair, I will tell you, this judgment, is a rotten judgment, I want to say that.  This judgment and the SCA judgment actually points …[intervenes]     Because I, Chair, …[intervenes]     No, Chair, I think I will agree with that as long as you deal with it at the right time.     Chair, I said your guidance on this matter, I think that is not what I said but there are seven other people, Chair.  I think that when you read the judgment, you look at what Martha Ngoye and what Werksmans said in that issued actually would – it should raise a big issue.  But, Chair, I will deal with the issues at the right time.     And I want to indicate to this court, Chair, these issues have been read as fact are in fact false andthat is why I was prepared, without that affidavit, to just go into the thing to demonstrate to this Commission.     And it is why I was asking how would honourable judges, how would they do this to us?  You know?  Chair, can I make one point.     Because I have been concerned with it for a while.  The judgments on PRASA, all of them, Chair, from judgment of Mthimkhulu, the judgment on Siyangena, you will actually see, Chair, maybe there is a difference of a comma and everything, they are one judgment and, Chair, I will elaborate at the right time.     When once you have seen all of that.    Because I think that is where the problem is.     And I will speak about this issue, ja, I will respect the judges, I promise you, Chair.     But at the same time to tell the truth and be honest to ourselves, Chair.     Of Mr Montana.     Montana.     Thank you, Chair.     Ja.  I will do that, thank you.     Waterkloof.     Van der Walt.     No, no Chair, five minutes is fine.     Chair can I suggest or rather request address you firstly on this issue because we go to the specific matters.    No, no, no.     This report, this report.     Because I think there are two things Chair, should this report be before this Commission, I think let’s start there, and Chair I think you will see my affidavit I deal with all the properties, I am not even getting into that, but the Commission Chair should know what in fact he is trying to do.  This report it takes the views – it takes the positions of other people who make allegations, it is compiled by an investigator at the Commission, it is put as a report of the Commission.   Now these are untested allegations, I am not ...[intervenes]     No thanks Chair, I accept that Chair and let me start by quoting a judgment, I think it was Judge J Davis ...[intervenes]      Indeed Chair I think I am having that direction Chair, and I think Mr Soni can take me under his wing Chair until I also get to the level Chair, thank you very much.       Chair the – Judge Davis in a matter involving the SABC raised two important issues, and I just want to quote them quickly Chair, he says firstly this is a matter that was between the SABC and a former ProvincialSABC news editor, Mr Charles Matlou.   He took the Joe Collier report on the SABC editorial independence, so interference with the SABC, on review and this ...[intervenes]      This was the Joe Collier, remember Joe Collier.     He was appointed to investigate, this Commission to investigate the editorial independence ofthe SABC.     He makes two important points Chair and I just want to quickly quote, the first one he says it offends one sense of fairness, even an investigator, and I am saying in this case, this Commission, were to only listen to the version of the complainant without considering the version of the accused before making a finding or recommendation.   He also come and say Chair in the same judgment he says and this is very important, and this is my basis for looking at this report, he says it is equally worrying when an accused person hears for the first time, for the first time recommendations which adversely affect him when they are already made.Chair I accept the distinction that you have made but this report Chair somebody in the Commission has give a – is going to investigate a particular area, to go and investigate, what he does if he does an investigation it has spoken to everyone that looked at all the statements, spoken to all the relevant people and these are my preliminary views, I want to put them before the Commission.Chair it didn’t happen, what has happened here is that the Commission’s investigate on PRASA when to takeallegations that were made by Mr Paul O’Sullivan in the 22 page affidavit that he put in Brooklyn Police Station and the Werksmans Report, and these are now compiled into a preliminary report today to the Commission.Chair I will answer questions, any questions because I agreed to come and testify before you Chair, but this report Chair can never be, actually what is first because this is an investigator of the Commission, you know I listened Chair when this thing was happening, Mr Soni asked for clarification, they were clarifying and saying Mr Montana bought properties for R36million.   Okay, not true Chair, but this report says that, because it takes the view, you see these people who manufacture these stories about us, they don’t themselves come to the Commission, they put them as if their report is in the media thing orsomething and then the Commission elevates – takes that, its investigators takes that and then they are channelled through the process because O’Sullivan doesn’t come here and file an affidavit on his 22 and say I believe that there is corruption and I write it here, then it’s a challenge, because Chair he says I have taken, I have used bank statements, I’ve used other things, I have also  used documents that are before Court.On the very matter we have just completed, it is not only the High Court that did not what I said even on thesethings and my version on this issue.  The Commission Chair ignored, they touched, they talked about everything, and I still make that distinction Chair that you have made I just take it and use it, they take these things, they elevate it, it is presented before the Commission. Chair there is no reason, if I look at the litany, I wrote to the Commission Chair, you will recall I even went to the – I wrote to the Judicial Service Commission, the Commission is actually breaking the very terms of that, this is one of the issues Chair, that I raised.Now here is the Commission where there is a dispute on even fact, it puts this report, it takes reports from other people who are ...[indistinct] they don’t file them, then they elevate, the Commission then enters the arena, in favour of particular people and then I come to theCommission, so the questions I should be answering I am going to answer now, I should be answering those Commission during, I should have answered during the investigation.Now I am having a preliminary report on this issue okay, where myself and I have checked with other people, did they speak to you, the answer is no, Mr Oellerman is not here, so if you ask him he was able to say Mr Montana bought properties for R36million, okay, which is false, but they were presenting it as fact.I also mentioned something else Chair that the Commission went and presented to the Chair that there is only report of the Public Protector and all other things even about how we deal with court judgments.   This report Chair the Commission should say we have got the information, we want to ask, we want to ask you certain questions and then we are also going to deal with it in that.  This report Chair I think if we were procedurally diligence of earnest we deal with the issue that Judge Davis has said that it is quite, it is extremely worrying.  This report should not be accepted by this Commission, not because it contains the lies that it contains, but precisely because the process before it was tabled here Chair I should have been spoken to, four/five other people should have been spoken to, the documents that Mr Oellerman says he placesreliance on he actually ignored them Chair, Mr Oellerman ignored documents on a whole range of fronts on the PRASA issue which has put into me into dispute with the Commission Chair.Chair if there was time I would actually put an application, maybe it has not been done, applying to you Chair to say I am asking for this chap to be fired  because he has actually misled the Commission, undermined its mandate to reach to the truth.What he is doing sir he is fighting a battle on behalfof particular vested interested in these matters.  Chair you remember I mentioned the issue about the NPA and the Hawkes, again the PRASA investigating team ignored the fact and presented the Commission with the facts that PRASA was fighting the Hawks to investigate these matters, when we know that the facts are in fact the opposite and in my affidavit I have attached a lot of things,   Chair I wrote to the Secretary of the Commission, why would this Commission or rather why would the investigators in this Commission pursue certain things, align themselves with certain people and the facts that I put including public statement, including some of them under oath like the affidavits they ignored them and they want to pursue, so this Chair what we have before you is this report, it is basically Mr Paul O’Sullivan taking hisaffidavit, which the police in Brooklyn they are not acted upon, which Werksmans says there is actually no support evidence for this, Werksmans said about it, but somehow they are getting to be investigators at the commission to say accept this and do not accept this, so Chair I am prepared to answer everything, but I am saying this report is not worth the paper it is written on, it should not be accepted by this Commission, and I think that in fact if you are going to deal with my properties Chair the Commission must have investigators to come and speak to me, preparea proper preliminary report, and then the facts are casted here.What we have is these things are elevated, the Commission has done work which ...[indistinct] and I am supposed to come here and respond to matters that the Commission should have sat with me on the side and then start to question me and verify the facts, so this is you are actually saying Chair if you accept this report, and I am not saying the Chair has accepted, but the fact that it is before us you are basically saying the Commission is coming to the ring, the people are making accusations, they don’t want to box with me, they are now putting Judge Zondo and the Commission to box with me, so if I hit them I still have people standing behind the Judge.  I think Chair it is not only  unfair but it actuallyfundamentally undermine the terms of reference of this Commission, especially cite for the truth Chair and I think that this is what has happened, and I take strong exception Chair, Mr Soni can continue asking me, but I am urging Chair that a report of this nature which is showing so partisan this report and if Mr Oellerman was writing this report and having his own dreams it is fine Chair, he went to take people that I am challenging, some of them have said they want to cross-examine me, he has elevated their version and it is elevated there, but fortunately I am hereand fortunately I am glad that you will give me the chance I will deal with these issues but this report Chair shouldn’t have been, when the country was being told Montana bought the R36million properties worth R36million, and m family asked me hey you are so loaded Montana, where do you get this money from.So these are the things that they do Chair, so Chair I think that I want to put it, I will answer specific questions that Mr Soni wants to ask.     But I do not expect this report Chair and I will never accept it, even tomorrow.     So in fact it is based on three things, which are attached, are part of my attachment that I discussed with you.       The first one is the 22 page affidavit by O’Sullivan, Paul O’Sullivan, the second one is the report of Werksmans, the same matter.    And the third one Chair there is a chap who worked for PRASA who worked with Mr Molefe who compiled and knowing the chap Chair I can see that he wouldn’t write an affidavit of that nature so all of them I have attached them so that the Commission can see all of those documents, and I have attached them Chair, I want us to have a look at them.      No, no Chair, no, I think – I will acceptyour guidance that you have given Chair.     That the Commission will have a look at that, I am glad that Mr Soni had seen the letter.     But you will see there, or rather the letters and what they mention Chair, so you will see when you see the affidavit, the affidavits, the concerned affidavits that this has got nothing to do, I have read Mr Loubser ’s affidavit and I have read also the affidavit of MrAndre Wagner, which the Commission by the way Chair let me mention before we proceed.     You see Chair the Commission engages with someone, Mr Oellerman he goes and interviews somebody, and this is Mr Andre Wagner, the man who is involved in a partnership with me through a company called Midtown Brace, he files an affidavit, he says this is my money, I have a partnership for development of property or properties with Mr Montana, okay and he explains, he was interviewed, I think he spoke to the Commission, he explained and he filed an affidavit Chair, he signed it, this affidavit he doesn’t support it in this preliminary report in respect of this property – one of the properties we are talking about.What happened?  We saw Sally de Beer, Ms de Beer was here, we saw Louis Green who in fact was in my view, I subjected ...[indistinct] who was here because he contradicted what was said, and Chair, and Chair Mr Wagner was not even brought here because he says I don’t do tenders with government, I am not involved with PRASA, I have got a property deal with Mr Montana, and it is a good property deal, okay, and what do they say?   No, no, no we don’t need you, because you are not articulating this version that we want, so Mr Soni with due respect I hearwhat you are saying, but this report Chair once you have seen for yourself the affidavit of Mr Paul O’Sullivan and the first affidavit comes from Mr I think he is called Mr Philemon Mamaholo, Paka Mamaholo.  Chair the enormous lies but fortunately I am here, I am going to confront the lies Chair and deal with them one by one, we are here, but the Commission can’t be – it belongs to all of us, it cannot be abused by people, if Mr O’Sullivan he will only go to Brooklyn, he must file an affidavit here and defend it and make those accusations and be open to cross-examination.Now it is hidden under the Commission’s investigator, now what do they do, do they cross-examine each other and statements that are made to the nation, a preliminary report Chair, a few days it was a full report,then we got a thing that is now a preliminary report.  The damage that was done now I must come afterwards to respond to lies but it has been dealt with at the Commission in this particular way Chair.    Now I am going to leave it at that Chair because you have ...[intervenes]      Let’s go into the issue but the principle of it I don’t want  us to be cracks over cracks, put plasterover cracks this thing was wrong in a very fundamental way, if I say it was unfair it is an understatement Chair.The conduct of this chap, this investigator by the Commission was unlawful Chair and if the Chair had known probably a few months ago I would have written and asked for this chap to be fired because now I have been made to believe it is the position of the Commission, but now it is quite clear that the – here is someone who is going – I asked the question, how was this chap appointed, I had to ask that question Chair because I have never seen an investigator at this Commission who aligns himself with the version he wants to put on the table Chair.Chair the reason why I didn’t come for two years here is because I have been fighting to say no, no, no, it cannot be done, I said either you deal with the truth or Iwon’t come and testify but I am glad I am here ...[intervenes]      Maybe we proceed, and I want I think Mr Soni should not defend it but should note my view until we have now confirmed that with the affidavits that are there.     198?     I am there.     Ja, I must ...[intervenes]     Yes Chair I want to say two quick things.    In fact this affidavit remember why – why are we here?  Why are we discussing these issues?  This commission – the commission investigated property.  They did not investigate all my properties.  It investigated certain properties where allegations of wrongdoing were in.  Okay.  Now they mentioned four and I am glad it seems you are making progress.      But these things that we have before us it is not a fact it is fiction Chair.    No, no Chair in great detail.    I know this is one of the accusations that have been made against me in public.    I would not come to this commission and not talk about my properties.    Chair I deal with each and every property how each of – each one of them was funded.   Precisely because I wanted to put this lie to rest for the last time we do not deal with it Chair.    Chair I have got – I have got everything I have written on this thing it is a…   If the commission asks me to read them into record.    I can do that now Chair.    Okay Chair.    34?   Chair I have accepted your guidance.    But I also do not want because we are going to now lose purpose – you see Mr Soni – Chair we must not forget what we are dealing with.    The investigators know that the property in Parkwood was bought by me was paid for by me. I do not want to go into detail about it.  And – and they are talking about an evaluate – they are talking about the valuation when I bought the property they are not talking about when I bought the – when I sold the property.  Okay.  Now – now Chair and I think – I think that – I think that the issue while we are discussing the private – the Parkwood property let us remember why we are discussing it it is because they are saying I sold it for R6.8 million above the valuation.  They are not telling you what the valuation – the valuation was –they are taking the valuation that I got when I bought the property because the bank had to finance me so it did a valuation of the property and it says no we can finance it because the value of the property it is far above the value of the bond you are requesting.   So the grant – they give me a bond but to – that story is created that no Montana he sold it for R6.8 this property is worth R3.3 or R4 million okay.  They are not telling you Chair that the property was – I am not being asked how did he develop this property?  How much did you spend on it andeverything?   Chair I have got pictures fortunately I have got pictures of this property then and now.  I bought a wreck Chair.  The bank financed us because of its location it is far above that.  I modernised the property.  What these people want Chair you do not even evaluation – they said they heard their neighbour saying this property should be R4. - a neighbour who has not even been inside my house he knows the value of this property.   And then Chair they are saying he sold it for R6.8.  You know what the R6.8 is saying?  So they are saying between the R3.3 that the bank evaluated when I bought the property and when I sold it they then say it is a bribe from Riaan Van Der Walt.  Okay Chair so I do not want us to deal with this thing as if – as if…   No Chair I will keep on reminding the commission    Respecting progress and I think Mr Soni and I agreed.   That we must move with speed.    But Chair again Mr Soni when he augment he said Regulation 10.6 Chair I do not want to go back.  I have said it on record.    Chair and I have said to the commission I wrote a – to the commission you as a commission issuing a .6 against me you are going to the Chair to ask for a    And then Chair as long as you are admit me where I feel very strongly on these things.    And then you can correct the facts you allow me to come in.    In that respect.    No, no tomorrow Chair.  I think we have now – we have even identified areas that the commission should focus on.    So Chair I think we are one – I think the fight is  gone.    We are no longer fighting – I am here.    I will testify Chair.    So tomorrow I give them all the evidence.    And then we move forth on that basis Chair.    No Chair I think it is fair I am happy with that.

ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, but Chairperson I was merely highlighting the manner in which the dismissal took place.     That Mr Montana, you will recall, and I just ask you to respond to this Mr Montana, and the Chairperson asked this earlier, you had already made up your mind at the time when you dismissing Mr Dingiswayo because you said so on the last occasion, that you also were going to dismiss Ngoye.  That is what you said on the last occasion.     Okay.     I was merely saying, Chairperson, that would emerge then is that what is contained in the letter is in fact an expo facto reflection on why Ms Ngoye was being dismissed.     Because the decision had been made even before the 18 t h ...[intervenes]      ...at the time Mr Dingiswayo was dismissed.     Yes.     Yes.     Maybe ...[intervenes]      No, I accept that.     That resolves ...[intervenes]      Chairperson.     Then, Mr Montana, at paragraph 21, she continues and if I can just summarise it.  We do not need to deal with it in detail because I think it is agreed that they approach the chairperson this time, not Mr Buthelezi but Mr Molefe.  He asked you to reconsider.  You – the determinations were ended but they were then put on suspension.  That is correct?  Both she and Mr Dingiswayo.     Just on that point Chairperson and this is just for the record, not to place a dispute.  In the     Yes.     Chairperson, I see it is twenty past eleven.     We could go on for another ten minutes and then break for tea because we have started late.     ...this part of the ...[intervenes]      And then we will ...[intervenes]      Mr Montana, and then at paragraphs22, 23 and 24, Ms Ngoye raises different questions which have come about Prodigy and Swifambo and so on.  We have dealt with most.       Yes?    I just need to ask two questions.    But I am just hoping that will hasten things.    Just in regard to Swifambo, Mr Montana, because you know all the allegations that have been made.  I want to ask you, Mr Makhensa Mabunda, youhave dealt with him before in your evidence.  He was a transactional adviser on the Swifambo contract?    He was not to PRASA?    Definitely, not.    Okay.  May I then ask you to please look at bundle C1, SS4, page 214.133?    Oh, absolutely, Chair, yes.    No, no, it is just two passages from that bundle.    As you please.    As you please, Chair.  Mr Montana,can I refer you to the Swifambo contract.   Now you know that there has been a finding by the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal that the contract was at least irregular, in certain respects corrupt.  I just want to refer you to what Mr Auswell Mashaba was the Chairperson of the Swifambo Consortium.   Now Swifambo Rail has been placed under liquidation, you know that, provincially liquidation and if you look a page – sorry, let me start that the reference is correct, bundle C1, SS4, page 2141.33 and what is said inrespect of note 25 that I am going to read and just going to ask your comment on it.   Now let me just explain what this is.  In support of his application, a more recent application for why Swifambo had to be placed under liquidation, Mr Mashaba filed an affidavit and this is part of the affidavit and he    You know him as well.    Okay.  Now this is what Mr Mashaba    Yes.    When did Mr Mashaba indicate to you that he had been talking to the ANC?    Okay, so this now you became aware – was this while you – certainly you were at PRASA at that time?    It is Mr Mashaba.    This is while you were still at PRASA in 2014.   No, no, no, I understand but you were aware …[intervenes]    So this is what I want to ask you.  When you heard that - this is in 2014, when you heard that the ANC had approached Mr Mashaba and that, I take it, was linked to the Swifambo contract?   Yes, no, no…     I am sorry Mr – just for the record, when you talk about Auswell, you are talking about Mr Mashaba.     Now in fairness to the ANC Mr Montana at page 214.134 of SS4, Mr Mashaba says; “By virtue of the full grain…[intervene]    Yes, Chair.     At page 214.134.     “By virtue of the four grand donations  by leasing for the benefit of the ANC, never reached the ANC and Maria Gomes and Mr Sabela have unlawfully received and retained the sum of R9.4million and accordingly these amounts are refundable.”    From Mr Sabela and Ms Gomes, in paragraph 5 Chairperson.     At the section 417 inquiry Mr Sabela testified that he had never been a fundraiser for the ANC and the only part that he played in leasing was to collect amounts invoiced by SIM Leasing, where after he dispersed the amount to Steve, presumably into the account of NS as directed by Maria Gomes.     I do not see a reference to NS here Chairperson.     Yes.     Oh the law firm, sorry Chair.     Sim is Similex’s.     Yes, that is Ms Gomes’s firm.     As you please, Chair.  Chairperson, you will recall when Ms Ngoye gave her evidence, shedealt with the allegations that had been made in the Siyagena matter in the high court.  Since then the high court has announced judgment in this Siyagena matter.  So rather then put those allegations to Mr Montana, I would like to put on record what the court’s findings were in regard to those allegations made by Ms Ngoye ...[intervenes]      So if – what I will do is what we did on a previous ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Chairperson, the intended doctrine is just to refer to the paragraphs in which the significant findings were made.       Yes, as you pleases.     Yes.  Chairperson, this is the judgment in the matter of PRASA v Siyangena Technologies and the retired Justice Goldstein and retiredJustice Joffe and intervening parties when -unite behind.  I am sorry.  In the(?) applicant and unite behind them(?).  Now, it is a judgment of the Gauteng Court, Chairperson.  May I just, so that we have the full facts? [Speaker not clear]      Oh, sorry.  As you please.     As you please, Chairperson.  It is –the case number is 2018/14332 and 2018/11314.     ...by the full bench, Chairperson.     I just need to point out that there had been a previous application ...[intervenes]      It is the Gauteng Division.  As you please.  In Pretoria(?).     What had happened Chairperson is.  And this the matter that Mr Montana, I think, has referred to previously.  That certain persons applied to be admitted or to be able to file affidavits and a full bench of the high court prior to this judgment had allowed them to file affidavits.This court, however, looking at the law in relation to what evidence may be taken into account decided that on the basis of the Maseko(?) judgment and a judgment of the Constitutional Court that only the relevantparties, namely, PRASA and Siyagena the affidavits presented by them should be taken into account.So I just present that because it had raised an issue that had been raised by Mr Montana.  And you will recall Chairperson he also raised that in the Swifambo matter.So this judgment does not deal with the allegations or the answers that he gave in his affidavit in this matter(?).     But very quickly, please, Mr Montana.     Yes, as you please.  Chairperson, Mr Montana is right.  The – a full bench – and that is why there are two case numbers.  A full bench had granted the persons who asked to submit affidavit but this court looked at that and based on the principle that they did not have a direct and substantial interest in the proceedings that were before them, decided that they would not take the firms(?)in those affidavits... [Speaker ’s voice drops – unclear]     Chairperson, can I just finish this part?     It is addressed at paragraphs 34, 35 and 39 of the judgment.     On this very issue.     Mr Montana, I just want to read to you relevant parts of the judgment and at the end you can     But that is, of course, in the Swifambo matter.     Paragraph 72    That is the ...[intervenes]      Yes     [No audible reply]      Yes.  Yes, Chairperson.    Yes.  Chairperson, let me – or are you looking at the affidavit?    Yes.    Yes.   He was no longer…    Yes.   Chairperson, let me suggest a way forward.  We were obviously bound by the court judgment as the evidence leaders.  Now Mr Montana says that what he said in his affidavit, it was presented to court but notconsidered by the court, may throw a different light on some of the issues.Now without interfering with the court judgment, of course, you as Chairperson would be able to take that into account.  In your report you would say there was this judgment but my scope is broader.  But one is looking at a legal process and I want to take the process forward to give you the maximum scope that you should exercise, be fair to Mr Montana but also not to cast aspersions on the judicial system.    This the …[intervenes]    No, can I please finish?   Chairperson, I understand, MrMontana’s desire to put his version in regard to the Siyangena because we have now had a judgment that seems to reflect badly on him.What we need to do, though, Chairperson, is to consider whether the best and efficient – or the most efficient use of the Commission’s time should not be along the following lines.  We received Montana’s affidavit, the one he gave to …[intervenes]    To the courts, which is not taken intoconsideration.  We know what that affidavit will say.  You look at the affidavit in your capacity as Chairperson.  We, as the legal team, look at it and then if you decide that there should be input, oral input on that, we set a time for that.  It will obviously have to be limited but that would give Mr Montana every opportunity to clear his name, if that is what he wants to do.   What, though, we need to be concerned, Chairperson, is the limited the time we have available.  We spent now on this – Mr Montana’s response without anybody know what the response is, it is going to take the rest of the day.    I accept that fully, Chair.    But it is not a question of Commission not relooking at it as would have been under different jurisdictions of legality and unfairness.    The only point I want to make, Chairperson, is we are going to base it on an affidavit thatis not before us and it would be in the public interest to know what was before that court that it did not take into account, deliberately, for good or bad reason.    But it did not take into account.    And what Mr Montana is maybe saying to you, not saying is, may be different from it and so we need to be careful that when we are determining whether what Mr Montana would have said in that court might haveproduced a different outcome, one has the necessary facts and we do not have that in the absence of Mr Montana’s affidavit.    And given what I have read, Mr Montana, must be given a chance.    Yes.    They do, Chair.    But, Mr Montana, you will make your available to [indistinct – dropping voice] tomorrow.    Chairperson, then that is the last bit of Ms Ngoye’s contribution and I want to deal with Mr Oellermann’s report.     Sorry, Waterkloof.    Waterkloof.    Sorry.  In Pretoria and there was aproperty in Sandringham in Johannesburg and then a fourth property in Hurlingham, also in Johannesburg.  Now most of the information is based – or most of the report is based on documents that Mr Oellermann attaches to his report.  I just point out two other things, Chairperson.   One is, based on the documents it is quite clear that Mr Montana did sell to Mr Oellermann – I mean to …[intervenes]    To Precise Trade, his property in Parkwood and it is also clear, Chairperson, that he purchased the property in his own name in Hurlingham.The other two properties, Mr Montana made some enquiries about but those properties, although connected to Mr Montana indirectly in the sense that he madeapproaches about them, either in relation to his children’s trust or himself, those properties were transferred from the owners to Precise Trade.  Now based on that, what I want to do today is just to establish the relevant facts as they emerge from the documents and Mr Montana can, having regard to what I ask, can either say yes, I accept that is what is contained in there – obviously it is going to be important, and that’s where I would like to spend most of my time is what inference is to be drawn from the four propertytransactions ...[indistinct – dropping voice].     Indeed Chief Justice.     As you please.     Sorry Chair.  Mr Montana the first issue I would like to look at is the sale of the Parkwood property and you will find that relevant facts are set out at Bundle HSSAT Pages 34 to 39.     No, no that is fine, but also another point I wanted to make is one which I think I have made before, namely it is good that you came to participate because then you can raise these things and say here is something that is flawed as far as I am concerned, here is my side of the story, and with other people do that the Commission has been trying to say come let’s hear, it is toafford them exactly this opportunity to say so and so is saying these things to me because of A, B, C, D or he is basing this on E, F and G you know so that we have the full perspective so that in the end obviously one would look at really what the evidence reflects, but it is good that you are here, you can raise your – raise those matters.Mr Soni?       As you please Chair.   Mr Montana I don’t want to enter into a dispute about – with you about this, I would rather ask the question.  I just make twopoints, that you do not see a single reference in this report to Mr O’Sullivan.  Secondly you will see in reference in this report at many levels a Mr van der Walt and payments that he made in respect of these properties together with a bank account that his partner supplied to the Commission, so for you to say that this is Mr O’Sullivan – I have read Mr O’Sullivan’s affidavit or report or whatever it is, I can say to you that Mr Loubser ’s affidavit came last year and it was the first time that anybody in the country knew how payments for the properties were made and that was made, that came about because Mr van der Walt  had provided two letters to Mr Loubser which are part of Mr Loubser ’s affidavit.I just make that point.      Yes no you did Chairperson, I am going to address it.     Yes.   Mr Montana can I ask you to please look at  - we are still dealing with Bundle H, please look at page 198.    Yes.     So paragraph 24 the report says    Yes. “Once it is submitted a decision will be made whether to supplement this report.” Now Chairperson can I – can I make Mr Andre Wagner ’s affidavit available to all of us.     To understand why no decision was made to supplement the report.     Chairperson this is the affidavit that Mr Wagner eventually submitted to the Commission, now he deals with the, in paragraph 3 with the Hurlingham
