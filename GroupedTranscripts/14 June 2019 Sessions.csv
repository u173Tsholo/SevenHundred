CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    Thank you.  Are you ready?    Thank you.  Let us proceed.    I am sorry.      I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  You referred us to 490 and then 491.    My attention was still on 491 when you referred I think to another document.    Before you go to that other document I just want to – I note that at 491 where it says accepted and agreed to by BNP CaPieterl Pty Limited then it says by …   It seems to me that there was meant to be something along the lines – along by or below by but before who warrants that he – she or he is duly authorised and then below that then...    There should be a full name and so on.  Now no name or signature appears along – alongside by     And no name or signature appears before by and who warrants.  But there is a full name provided under – under who warrants and that is the full name.    No it may be that – it may be that there was just a misunderstanding.    Of what was meant to happen here but you – one just has somebody who has put in a full name    There is no signature as such which might not legally you know mean anything – any difference if it is it is the same person who wrote his or her name.  But I just noticed it.    There seems to be something there.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes    Ja.  Ja.    Ja no look if to the extent that the person who put his name here is Mr Mahlangu     It would be difficult for him to indicate what purpose he put his name here for    Other than to accept.    Ja so…    It might just not have been done in the manner that was really contemplated.    But the purpose must have been then to accept.    Yes.    And then let us go to the page that I missed.    Yes.    Yes I have got it.  I missed what the two of you were talking about there.    I apologise because my mind was still on the other page.    Maybe you should – could just…    Ja please.  Yes please.    So the actual amount would be how much 50%?    Yes okay.    Okay, okay.    And I see the – Mr Hofmeyr that the date of that letter is the same as the date of the other one.    That you were talking about.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Quite unusual.    I am sorry did you say page 110?    Oh okay.    Did you say it is a letter from the Minister of Finance?    Oh okay I got it.  Thank you.    I am sorry.  Was that – was it two different things 14 billion and 15 billion or was it one thing?    Oh.    Hm.    Oh. Okay.    Because now some correspondence talks about 15 billion, others 14 so you get confused.    Okay.  Okay alright.    I am sorry.  That is at page?    503.  Let me get there first.  Yes.    Well the one I have at 503 is from Mr. Mahlangu to Pieter.    Ja okay.  Same letter.    Okay.    Yes.    That is fine.  That is fine.    Thank you.    And I see it is on 25 May?    Well Grissag singed on the 25 t h.    Of May.    Will – may change that.    Okay.    Oh, is that so.    Okay, okay.  Maybe it had been contemplated …    It would be signed on the 25 t h.    Okay, alright.    The – are you – are you saying that the basis of your concern is that there were a number of unusual features about how it was gone about?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Ys.    Huh-uh.    Okay.    Maybe – I am sorry – before that …    Is that where that story ended of the colleague who had been suspended as he told it to you or did he ultimately get dismissed?    On suspension?    Hm.    Hm.    Oh.  That – that was just important because here you – as I understand – you were being told this to say look what happened to so and so …    And whilst suspension has its own place in the whole thing it is also important to know what ultimately happened.    Okay but one of the things is that he was suspended for a long time?    Yes, okay alright.    Thank you.    Yes.    I have got it.    That was paragraph 138?    I do not know why I had 128 but …    138?    Okay.    Yes.    As far – as far as you know would there be any legitimate basis for somebody at SAA not to want National Treasury to know any aspect concerning a transaction that involves money that relates to SAA?    Would there be any basis for anybody at SAA not to want National Treasury to know?    Because it is not like National Treasury is a competitor to SAA.  National Treasury is National Treasury and SAA needs National Treasury.    And in many cases it needs National Treasury’s approval for certain transactions.    Yes.    Yes.    So …    So you – you know of no basis on which anybody could object to National Treasury seeing    Any documents relating to SAA …    Transactions?    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Before that …    I see that at paragraph 142 you say that she instructed you not to attend the meeting at National Treasury.  Did you comply with that instruction?    Okay, thank you.    Hm.    Mokoena or Manqele.    Manqele.    Mr Bongani Manqele, M-A-N-Q-E-L-E.  That is Manqele.    Hm, okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    I am sorry.  I thought I got the page but I it looks wrong.    5-7-0, okay thank you, proceed.    Yes, thank you.    Yes, thank you.  We will take the tea adjournment and resume at half past 11.  We adjourn.    You may proceed.     I’m sorry that term sheet was on what page again? ADV KATE       I think when we took the adjournment we were on the letter of suspension.       Okay thank you.       Okay thank you, you may proceed.       And the contents of that letter to the extent that they set out the history, Webber Wentzel got that history from you?     Okay.     Although they say you were suspended for misconduct they don’t seem to say what the allegations of misconduct against were or what the allegation was.     Yes but if the alleged misconduct was about the document relating to BnP then maybe they didn’t really want to talk about that because they seemed to want to distance that from – to distance your suspension from this issue of BnP.     But it had everything to do with BnP?     Was this before your suspension?     And how much earlier, compared to the incident that gave rise to your suspension.     Sometime in June.     But before you went on suspension nobody had made an issue of it?     Okay.     Maybe before we go there I think Ms Hofmeyer’s focus is to see if you can tell her or tell me anything that suggests that there was insolence, there could be a charge based on that WhatsApp for insolence.     Whether you understood where he connection is between your WhatsApp message and the charge of insolence, what was insolent about you sending that message in other words?    Ja but I guess the question would still remain, do you understand what’s insolent about that, you may have said something that the Board might not like and other people in management might not have liked but do you understand what was insolent about that?    But you are not obliged to use it were you?    It is something that is available to you to use if you want to use?    If you choose to go to the police you go to the police.    So why do they charge you with that kind of thing?    What – was that for what is called conciliation if you got to understand those concepts?    Oh that was still the disciplinary hearing    Oh.    At a certain stage you were waiting for a disciplinary hearing at SAA.  From what you have said it looks like that never sat, did it ever sit?    And then you decided with your lawyer to go to the CCMA?    I suspect that maybe that may have been what is called con arb or something like that?    Is that what it was about?    Yes.    So while you were waiting you were still on suspension, you were still being paid?    Yes.    Yes.  So it is not like you were not being paid for the 7 or 8 months or whatever you were being paid?    But the hearing was just not taking place?    And the arbitra – con arb – con arb was not taking place itself it got postponed all the time?    But I would have thought that because that was now under the auspices of the CCMA they would not have got – the matter would not have been postponed unless  1.  It was by agreement between the lawyers on both sides.    And the CCMA or the CCMA ruled that there were good grounds for a postponement with your lawyer opposing any request for postponement from the CCMA’s side.  Do you know whether each time it happened it was one of those two situations?    Well we not here about unfair suspensions and unfair dismissals but of course one of things which have said by some witnesses here is that in regard to corruption in government departments and entities and parastatals what was happening was that you would find that in each of the entities that are affected there would be people who would insist on the right things being done.  Who would be opposed to wrong things being done?  And there would be people who would be pursuing wrong things, breach of rules or procurement procedures pursuing corrupt agendas and that those who were standing for the right thing were opposed to these corruptive agendas were seen as stumbling blocks and that sometimes maybe very often all kinds of charges would be brought against them.  They would be suspended on no sound grounds. They would be – charges would be brought against them that have no basis just to make life difficult for them and if possible to get rid of them.  And so that is part of the reason why I am looking at the issue of whether the postponements were by agreement because that might give a certain context then in a situation where it is like a disciplinary hearing where maybe from your side you could argue whatever you argue and SAA just postponed.  There was a third party involved here and this is CCMA and so on. But – so that is the reason why I am looking at it but it still remains important to look at is the – were there proper basis for the charges against you why you were suspended and so on an so on.  Okay.    Ja so we might not go into finer details but still it is important to try and have a look at whether there were proper basis for – for suspensions and so on.  Because if there were proper basis the case might not fit into what has been suggested but if there we no proper basis it might fit into that.  Thank you.    Well…    While it may have been so but it is quite important that when you make a statement like that you are alive to the fact that your evidence could be challenged and – and there could be an attempt to say let us look at each one of those – or let us test what you are saying and then there would be an attempt to show that there were proper basis for at least maybe some of the suspensions and so on.  So just be careful when you – when you say you know it seems like there was a pattern.  But if you have got facts on which you base that that is fine.  I am just saying be careful.    So that you do not say there was a pattern if you do not have facts to back that up with.    But if you do have facts by all means you have to state that.    Okay.    Yes.      Yes.    Those ones.    Those ones you say.    They were no proper grounds.    Okay.    That is – that is fine.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    That is fine.    Did your settlement – was your settlement formulated in such a way that your employment with SAA would continue for six months and your 60 t h birthday would fall within that so that you would effectively take retirement without having left before.  Is that how it was structured?    Okay.      Was you evidence in relation to Ms Nhantsi include what you had been suspended for in relation to taking the document that we – that she did not – she was unhappy you had taken and = and your intention to – or taking it to National Treasury or intending to take it to National Treasury or going to attend a meeting there but them thinking you are going to disclose it to National Treasury. Did it include that?    At the time of that disciplinary hearing had there been a change of the board of SAA or was it still the board that was there when you were suspended?    It was a new board?    Thank you.     Thank you.    Ja I think it says because of affirmative action.    Okay.  No thank you.  Thank you very much for coming to share your evidence with the commission.  You may be asked to come back at a later stage.  I am sure you will have no problem but for now you are excused.    Thank you.    No I think we can start.    Do you want five minutes to…    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  We will – five minutes?    We will adjourn for five minutes.      Are you ready?    Thank you.  Let us proceed.    Yes.    Yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Yes thank you.  You may proceed.    That is fine.    That is at what page?    Yes, thank you.    I am sorry.  You have changed – you have changed it – did you say you have changed it?    What does that mean?    So there has been a change of directors to some extent?    In 2019 in regard to the South African version of the company?    But you say there is also a similar company in London?    Yes.    Yes.    It is different entities but in substance it is the same people?    In terms of Directors and so on?    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Oh, okay.    Okay, thank you.    Yes, thank you.  So this additional interest or portion of the interest that would have nothing to do with you?    It was just going to be between SAA and Seacrest?    I would have expected that the normal thing would have been that everything would be in this agreement and that then between the two of you – you would divide what – you know – your proceeds from the transaction among between the two of you the way you would have agreed.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and you say you never got to know exactly what percentage they agreed upon with SAA?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, okay thank you.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two.  We adjourn.    Are you ready?    Let’s proceed.    Well if it is…(intervention).          Well I’m sure mine should be with Zonaka.      Okay I’ll adjourn for two minutes for her to bring all that I need onto the table here.      We’ll adjourn. SHORT ADJOURNMENT INQUIRY RESUMES      I thought you had been asked whether this will be all that I will need, it turns out you were not asked.      Okay, alright, thank you.     Oh yes we should have done it earlier, let’s do it now.       Thank you very much.      Yes you mean below, you mean the interest rate was below…(intervention).      Did you say page 16?      Of the statement?      Thank you.      I’m sorry but if you look at the date for when this document was sent, would there have been an agreement or understanding between your company and FDC that they could produce a term sheet like this and send it over?      Okay.    Why did you not – why did your company not have its own BBBEE components?    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.  Well I was simply asking purely from the point of view that from your line of business it appeared that you would keep on being required to meet this requirement?    And one would have thought that if that is the case you would rather just have people or – satisfied that requirement for all times and not have to look for ad-hoc arrangements all the time.  That is the only perspective from which I was looking at it.    Yes.  But – and – but why did you not have the FSP licence if you needed one for your business?    So the actual – the money that your company was going to be using to provide funding would come from people overseas?    Ja, ja.  Okay thank you.    So you might have to look you are not sure if they are still there?    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I have lost the page of that letter.    Thank you.    Oh I am from – I thought I was there.  Oh okay.    And when they told you what did they say the purpose was going to be of you going to SAA?    Ja.    Hm.    Oh okay.    No I just wanted to understand why you were called to go to…    Ja okay.    Before that – excuse me – the signature just above the name of Mr Pokusaev was that your signature or his signature or somebody else’s signature?    Oh, okay.  Thank you.    How had that come about?  Did you come with the page which had – which had his electronic signature or did somebody else secure his electronic signature?    So had Mr Pokusaev actually signed this page?    He had not signed it?    Did you keep a kind of standard electronic signature of – of his?    Ja.    Oh.  The document where he needs to sign you would send the document to him electronically?    And then send it back and this is what had happened here as well?    Okay.  So – so on this particular occasion when you went to SAA you were not going to do the signing yourself?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    (Intervenes).    Yes.    But the – the term sheet that was to be signed on that particular day at SAA Offices did you sign it yourself?    Oh.    But when you departed from wherever you departed from to go to SAA was your understanding that you were going to actually sign or was your understanding that you did not – you would not need to sign because Mr Pokusaev’s signature would be provided?    Ms Nhantsi?    Yes.    (Intervenes).    Yes.    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    I am sorry.  Can you just repeat that?    Okay.    Maybe this might be a convenient time for a short break.    Just five minutes.  We will adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn.    Yes, we may proceed.    Well before that if that – if you were not informed by S A Officials how did it come about that you signed a statement that said you were informed by them?    Are you saying that you are not saying that you didn’t read it, you are saying that at the time of signing it you thought that was correct but later on there were documents or other information that indicated that that was not correct.    Okay.    Okay, you had two negatives there, you actually mean you had no contact with SAA?    Okay.    Was it Mr or Ms Nhantsi, the way you put it it’s like Nyati and Nyati is a different surname altogether from Nhantsi,  Do you have any idea?    Oh, you know the spelling.    Nh, with Nha.    Okay, alright.    Okay, okay.    Ja, that’s fine.      Is that 31, 32, 33?    Mmm.    Sorry, what was the answer?    Yes okay.    Were you aware of any Chinese partners, partners in Abu Dhabi, I don’t know about the Europeans, but they say European and Brazilian that were going to be involved in this project in which you were involved?    Yes.      Yes, but the author of this letter didn’t know that as far as your (indistinct) is concerned.    So he could not have been talking about your partners who are in Europe?    Yes, okay, alright.    And if he had you would have known?    Yes, yes, that’s not how you work.    Mmm, okay.    Yes, okay.    Just as a matter of interest the name of your company does it have any particular meaning, it’s an unusual name?    You have no idea whether ...(intervention)     Connotations.    Mmm.    Thank you.    You are done?    Okay alright, thank you very much Mr van der Merwe, you are excused.    Thank you.  It’s been a longish day.    On Tuesday what time do you think we should start?    Yes okay, okay, we will adjourn the proceedings for the day, and on Tuesday we will start at nine thirty.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Morning Chair.    Yes indeed.    Thank you Chair.  Where we concluded matters yesterday was at the point at which BNP had been provided with a letter of award in relation to the sourcing of funds.  I would like to start there this morning again if we may?  Ms Stimpel you will find that in bundle B because that is the one we are now working in for today’s evidence and it appears at page 490 which is under Tab 46.  Ms Stimpel you will recall that we had looked at this towards the end of yesterday.  It is the letter of award for the sourcing of funds for South African Airways that is dated the 25 May 2016.  I would like us just for a moment to turn over the page to look at the date on which the acceptance and agreement by BNP CaPieterl is filled in there.  That is at page 491.  Ms Stimpel can you just indicate to us there you see after the signature of the acting Chief Procurement Officer there is a section that says ‘accepted and agreed to by BNP CaPieterl Pty Limited, what appears thereafter?    Thank you.  There is some significance I would like to suggest relating to that date which is the 3 June 2016 because the next point that you make in your affidavit from page 19 at paragraph 108 is that on the same day that the letter of award is sent to BNP which is again just to remind ourselves the 25 May 2016 there is a letter from BNP back to SAA asking about a cancellation fee and we are going to go through that in some detail now.  But just to be clear Ms Stimpel were you aware of this correspondence at the time?    And so how did you come to learn of these documents?    Thank you.  If we can then go to that letter that comes back.    Yes Chair.    Correct.    Indeed.  Apologies Chair.    Yes.    Correct.    Indeed.    Hm.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Chair I will specifically make a note of that because we will be having evidence from Mr Mahalngu.    So it is indeed he who can likely    Clarify this aspect for us.    For present purposes just working off the text of it.    Notwithstanding the concern you raise with respect.    Appropriately because there is no signature.    We – the only thing we do see here is some acknowledgement.    From a person indicating to be authorised as a director of BNP>    On the date the 3 June 2016.    I would say that is the high water mark of what we can make of the document.    Hm.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Precisely.    Indeed.    Indeed.    Indeed.    It is over the next tab Chair which is 47 and it is page 494.      Indeed.    Chair let me…    Chair let me go over that again is I may?    What I was seeking to explore with Ms Stimpel is we now have a letter this is at 494 which is dated 25 May 2016.  And it is a letter that Ms Stimpel you then refer to at paragraph 108 of your affidavit which is at the bottom of page 19.  And it is a letter which    Hm.    About 112 million plus another 2 is 114 million, right?    Excluding VAT.    Talking about – yes in the order of about 115 million is that right Ms Stimpel?    Indeed.    Indeed.    The curiosity     Is though that on the actual letter of award.    The signified acceptance is dated a matter of days later the 3 June.    But at least this letter is the same day.    So there is an exchange on the 25 t h May as we have it.    SAA sends out its letter of award.    BNP sends back this letter.    In which they indicate a gracious acceptance of it and they immediately say if this thing is terminated at all we want 50% of our fees.    Which Ms Stimpel has clarified for us at that point stood at about 115 million.  What is your experience of cancellation fees in these types of arrangements?  Are they customary?    Ms Stimpel quite a bit was happening on the 25 May of 2016 because on that date and if you go over to the next tab 48 at page 496 there was a letter from the then Minister of Finance Mr Gordhan to Ms Myeni as the chairperson of the board of SAA.  You have also referenced that in your affidavit at page 110.  Just to clarify were you aware of this letter at the time?    But I would like…    Sorry page 496.    Apologies Chair I think the – it was behind tab 48.      Correct.  At 496.      Thank you.  You were not aware of it at the time as I have your evidence but I would like to ask you one or two questions about it because it appears to be an indication at least from the Minister of Finance conclusively indicating that the proposed engagement with the Free State Development Corporation is beyond the mandate of that entity.  You will find that in the second main paragraph on that page where he indicates that he had received an earlier letter from the board on the 15 March in which the board had indicated that a due diligence was being conducted on the Free State Development Corporation which was SAA’s preferred bidder.  Chair that is just important for us to know what was going on so still in March 16 the Free State Development Corporation is still being engaged with as a potential funder.  But you will recall from the evidence yesterday that as early as January of that year Ms Stimpel had relayed back to the interim CFO treasury’s view that this was beyond the mandate of the Free State Development Corporation.  But at this point we have an indication that still in March though those endeavours are    And just in terms of figures.  The debt consolidation was really what the 14 or 15 billion was aimed at was it not?    Yes.    Thank you.  And then …    It is difficult when you have got 1 billion floating around to be sure precisely where to locate it?    Ms Stimpel and Chair just for record purposes but I am not suggesting we go there.  That letter that the Minister of Finance refers to having received from the board of the 15 March is the next annexure but it records correctly as the Minister records it that in March there is still a due diligence being engaged upon in relation to FDC.  But I would like to then move on from there to another letter in the sequence.  Chair this is a letter which appears at page 503 under Tab 50 – 50.  It is a letter again from BNP CaPieterl addressed Pieter is the recipient at 503.  Ms Stimpel again I take it you were not aware of this document at the time?    Chair from this point on in Ms Stimpel’s affidavit …    Yes.  503.    Chair this is a letter what appears to be from BNP CaPieterl to somebody named Pieter.  Ms Stimpel has clarified she was not aware of this letter at the time.    Correct, correct.    Indeed.  Mr Mahlangu being the representative of BNP CaPieterl whom we have seen on the other letters.  Chair Ms Stimpel’s affidavit in some parts from now on deals with this correspondence which was given to her by the investigations of the commission.  We have subsequently engaged with Mr Pieter Van Der Merwe who is the addressee of this letter and he is in fact the witness giving evidence later today.    So it is my suggestion that we pass over those aspects with Ms Stimpel.    We will engage them directly with Mr Van Der Merwe.    Thank you.    I would then like to move Ms Stimpel in your affidavit to page 21 because we are going to skip over those letters we will engage on them further later in the day with the next witness.  But I would like to come to paragraph 115 on page 21 of your affidavit.  Because it is in that paragraph that you talk about a meeting that was held on the 3 June 2016 between National Treasury SAA and SAA funders.  Can you please tell us about that meeting?  Did you attend it?    And who from SAA was in attendance?    Well can I just clarify were there any members of the board present at that meeting?    And then tell us what occurred at that meeting?    And just to be clear was there any representative of BNP Capital in those meetings?    I would then like to take you to a letter from BNP Capital which you will find at page 526 and that is under Tab 53.  Now that is a letter as I have it from BNP Capital to South African Airways.  It is a – it is a three page letter.  Chair it is a letter we will return to this afternoon in the evidence but there is a reference to this meeting in the first paragraph on the first page on the 3 June 2016 between National Treasury, SAA and SAA’s funders.  And then it appears to record the key points of those meetings, do you see that Ms Stimpel?    And those points 1, 2 and 3 are those some of the points that were covered during the meeting?    Do you know how BNP would have learnt of the contents of those meetings?    Does it surprise you that they were given this information?    Thank you.  I would then like to focus on the second page of that letter which you will find at 527.  That is where there is a heading “Grissag AG” the entity whose director will be giving evidence later.  A detailed account there is given of the costs that Grissag by that stage had incurred in sourcing funding and this is presented as how I read the letter a justification for that cancellation fee that they were motivating for on the 25 May.  But it concludes on the following page at 528 with a capital lettered request to SAA which    Thank you.    And you go on in your affidavit to indicate that it appears from the documents that you have been shown that that request was in fact acted upon by SAA and the cause as I have it for your comment in that regard is the next item which you will find at page 530.  What is that document Ms Stimpel?    And if we just page through it…    Yes.    A lot happened on 25 May Chair.  But what you will see from the last page is that it was actually signed on the 8 June by the SAA representative.  But let us go there because over the first page there are what I take to be the terms of the term loan facility.  It identifies the parties as a borrower is South African Airways, lender is Grissag AG.  The guarantor is the Government of the Republic of South Africa.  It moves on to deal with the terms of the facility.  If we turn over the page pricing, repayment, representations.  Over the next page miscellaneous.  Now Chair we will get into this in more detail with the evidence later today but usually on that fourth page 533 under that last part of the table there is a whole lot of language about this being non-binding.  And that is now not here on this page.  The caveat that it is non-binding has been removed and if you turn over to the last page you will see at 534 the bold at the top ‘by our signature we hereby accept in principle the terms of this term sheet.’  And that is signed as I have it there on the 8 June by Ms Nhantsi the interim CFO.  We will also explore that with her.    Indeed.    Indeed.  Well the evidence this afternoon will give you …    Greater insight into that.    As I have it – it actually occurred at a meeting with Grissag on 8 June …    But our – our later witness will clarify that for us.    Indeed.    Indeed.    But the – the significance for present purposes Ms Stimpel is as I understand your affidavit there is that letter of 8 June that comes from BNP talking about a meeting to which they did not attend on 3 June.    Indicating what was discussed at that meeting in circumstances where you have queried their receipt of that information given the confidentiality of those discussions.  Is that correct?    And then on that day it appears that the Interim CFO of SAA did precisely what BNP was requesting which was to return a term sheet signed that could – did not contain that non-binding caveat.  Is that correct?    Did – is that – I know you were not aware of it at the time but if that a source of concern for you?    And why?    Thank you.    We have seen previous BAC score cards or checklists you will recall from yesterday that requires all sorts of things like risk assessments to be done, financial impacts to be done.  Are those the sorts of processes that you would want to see occurring before conclusion of this type of in principle agreement?    I would then like to move – we are at page 21 of your affidavit.  Again at the bottom of that you reference certain correspondence between BNP and SAA which you were shown by the investigators but again that is correspondence actually with Ms Nhantsi who will be giving evidence.  So my suggestion is that we move to that with her in her evidence Chair. So we can go over the page if you will Ms Stimpel to page 22 and at that page there is a heading whistle blower and it beings    Thank you.  I would like to take you to page 23 – the affidavit at least.  At the bottom of that page at paragraph 124 well around the middle you talk there about really – it is – it is a reference back to your first steps - I take it – as a whistle blower which was the WhatsApp message that you sent when you were on the pilgrimage in France but you record there at paragraph 124 what the response had been by that stage from National Treasury.  Can you tell us about that?    Right.  We will come to when you did have a response.  That comes later but then tell us about the next paragraph – 125 – where you went to see another colleague – Mr Joshua Du Plessis.  What were you going to speak to him about?    He also as I have paragraph 125 made reference to an example of another colleague.  Can you tell us about that?    And then as your affidavit progresses you talk about those interactions with your family that you have traversed in your testimony this morning.    Yes.    You carry on Ms Stimpel in your affidavit dealing with your engagements with your family.  I take it that this was quite an important and difficult decision for you given the extent to which you engaged with them.  Is that correct?    And then if we go to page 24 paragraph 128 because there I pick up the response that you received from National Treasury on 23 June.  Can you take us through that?    Ms Stimpel can I just get a point of clarification there because your affidavit goes on and we will deal with this evidence shortly about your efforts to get documents that were relevant to parts of this procurement that you were not aware of at the time.  So can I just clarify what – what was it that you gave over to Mr Du Toit in relation to documents you had?    Hm.    And as I have it you also did not have the BNP bid submission at the time?    In the next month?    We will come to that.    Thank you and – and you conclude at    At page 24 paragraph 129 you talk about receiving a call from Ms Thuli Mpshe.  What was that call about?    And as I understand your evidence in the affidavit you did follow suit on both of those legs, both the Public Protector and OUTA.  Can you explain what you did in that regard?    Ms Stimpel you – you appear from the evidence that you have given to have regarded this matter as urgent.  Why was that?    And at page 25 paragraph 131 you reflect on that meeting you had with OUTA on 1 July.  What happened in that meeting and then what steps did you take back at SAA thereafter?    And that as I have it is what you did then on 4 July.  This is picked up at paragraph 132 of your affidavit.  What steps did you then take to seek to get access to those documents?    And what was his response when you did that?    And that as I have it took place on 5 July.  Is that correct?    I would then like to take you just back to 4 July in the sequence because your affidavit at paragraph 135 on page 25 what else happened on the previous day 4 July because that is when a motivation was addressed to the Board to – to seek approval for that cancellation fee that we looked at earlier this morning. Chair by this stage however the cancellation fee had reduced from 50 percent of the total fees to an amount of R49.9 million payable to BNP Capital.  There is some significance in the reduction of that amount but it will come out in further evidence but I would like to take us to that document which motivates to the Board for approving this cancellation fee.  You will find it under Tab 59 at page 5-5-5 – triple 5.    And that document …    Is from the Interim CFO - as I have it – to the SAA Board.  Ms Stimpel were you aware of this at the time?    And if we just look at it the purpose   And if we can go back to page 5-5-5 can you take us through what motivations in the bullet points were offered for this cancellation fee?  If you start at the first bullet point it seems to be related to the extensive fundraising exercise that had been engaged upon.  Is that correct?    And then the second motivation?    The third motivation over the page?    And so the recommendation – as I have it there – is that this cancellation fee – if you go down to financial implication of 49.9 million – must – should be paid to BNP Capital in the event of a termination of the mandate.  Is that as you understand it?    Chair the evidence or at least the documents reveal that that recommendation then went to the Board and the only Member of the Board who in fact supported it was Ms Myeni.  The other Members of the Board in fact did not approve the cancellation fee of 49.9 million but I would like us just to take a moment with Ms Myeni’s response to the request for her approval.  Your will find that at page    And then if we can just go to Ms Myeni’s response which appears at the top of that page.  Could you just read into the record what she records there?    Yes.    Thank you Ms Stimpel.  Chair we will return to the importance if any to be attached to that email with further witnesses.  Ms Stimpel if I could then go back because I asked you to reverse one day …    Back to 4 July so we could see what had been presented to the Board on that day for approval but you had already got in your testimony to 5 July which was the date – as I understand your evidence – on which you returned the file to Mr Matsaudza and you then engaged with him – as I have your evidence.  He expressed concern about you having taken the documents and let us pick it up then if we may at page 26 of your affidavit.    And you begin telling this story from paragraph 128.  That is where you record that Mr Matsaudza became very angry and this surprised you as you had not done anything out of the ordinary.  He asked you why you had taken his documents and you said that you needed to see it and then as you recounted he told you that he was going to report you.    Correct.    Oh, apologies Chair.     138.    On page 26.    But at the conclusion of that paragraph you tell us what you then responded to him with.  I would ask you to tell us that and then take us through what happened in the remainder of that day.    And what happened when you were on your way to National Treasury?    And did she indicate that she had received information from Mr Matsaudza?    What could have been the problem with you giving those documents to National Treasury?    Thank you.  I – you indicate at paragraph 141 on page 26 that Ms Nhantsi also spoke to you about the media.  What did she say?    What is the “this” that could have gone to the media?    And then at paragraph 143 on that same page you talk about what happened towards the end of day when Ms Nhantsi called you to her office.  Can you take us through those events?    And then you talk at 143 in your affidavit about when you did manage to meet with Ms Nhantsi.  What happened in that meeting?    And Chair I note we are at the tea break but if we could just go to that letter …    To conclude it.    You will find it at page 5-7-0 under Tab 61.    And if you will just read the first paragraph because it – it just records what you have recollected about the terms and basis for your suspension.    5-7-0.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Chair we will take up – with your leave – the next events after the tea break if that is suitable.     Thank you Chair. Ms Stimpel I understand that there is a further point that you wanted to make in relation to that term sheet that was signed on the 8 t h of June by Ms Nhantsi on behalf of SAA and Grissag AG, what was that point?     That’s correct, we’ll have to go back just to page 530 for that term sheet.     it’s under tab 54.     Thank you Ms Stimpel if we can then return to page 27 of your affidavit, we left before the adjournment on the point of your interaction with Ms Nhantsi and your receipt of the suspension letter and then at paragraph 145 on page 27 you talk about your engagements with the media because that was a concern, as I have it from your evidence that Ms Nhantsi had raised the previous day when she was calling you about a National Treasury – apologies same day because that was the 5 t h of July still.  What – recount for us please if you will, what is contained at 145 which is, as I understand it is just a summary of your engagements with the media.     Thank you and then in the chronology as I have it the next thing that happened on the 7 t h of July is that a letter was sent to SAA by Webber Wentzel Attorneys who were they and why were they involved at this stage?     If we can go to that letter, you’ll find it at page 548 under tab 58, thank you.  You’ll see that – is that the letter you were referring to?     I’d like to just advance to the demand that was made at the conclusion of the letter, you’ll find that on page 552, as I read what precedes this in the letter it’s really a summary in an essence all the evidence you’ve given to us over the last two days in summary fashion talking about where the concerns lay in the whole process of procurement and engagement of BNP and then in paragraph 11 on page 552 are the requested undertakings that were sought from SAA, can you take us what the – through those two undertakings.     And as I ready 12 they requested an undertaking in writing by the authorised official by close of business 13 July, failing which they indicated they would launch appropriate proceedings in the High Court.  Do you know whether those proceedings were launched?     Thank you.     Thank you Ms Stimpel, the next document I’d like to take you to which you refer to at paragraph 146 of your affidavit on page 27, you’ll find under tab 62 at page 573, now Ms Stimpel I’m conscious of the fact that this document is dated the 8 t h of July 2016 as I have your evidence you are no longer at SAA at this time, is that right?       So can I take it that this is not a document you saw then?     Chair I’d like to just focus on this for a moment because it becomes relevant to later evidence and it also will enable me just to explain one aspect of the files of Ms Stimpel’s evidence.  Ms Stimpel what is this letter because you have subsequently seen it haven’t you?     Yes, so it appears to be a letter from BNP director Mr Mahlangu to South African Airways, is that correct?     And what is it dealing with?     Thank you lets just pause there for a moment, when we looked at the RFP that went out for transaction advisor services you’ll recall the critical criteria there included a FSB license is that correct?     And BnP won that bid did it not?     And as this letter reads, it seems to be informing SAA on the 8 t h of July  2016 that earlier in May, and Chair earlier than the date on which they were awarded the extension of scope for the sourcing of funds, they had received correspondence from the FSB indicating it’s intentions temporarily to suspend BnP’s license, is that as you read the letter?     Chair just to give you a bit of background what the investigation has done is engage with the FSB, well as it then was it is now the Financial Service Conduct Authority in order to obtain their records in relation to the BnP license, that response to the request for information that was sent to the FSCA is the next tab in this file, it begins at page 578 but because of its relevance and significance to evidence you will hear in due course, this was then followed up with a request for an affidavit from Ms De Silva who is the author of this initial letter and that has subsequently been provided to the Commission.  It will be found in file C of Ms Stimpel’s documents, I don’t intend to deal with it further at this point but that’s just to frame it in terms of where we find it and why it’s relevant, the only point I will make at this stage and which you pick up at paragraph 147, Mr Stimpel, is that the response that was received from the FSCA including all the contemporaneous documents at the time, as I have it from paragraph 147 of your affidavit indicated that contrary to what is said in the letter from BnP Capital on the 8 t h of July 2016, it was not the case that on the 12 t h of May their license was indicated as there being an intention to temporarily suspend the license.  The FSB documents, as we have them, actually include a suspension of he license on the 12 t h of May.  is that your understanding of the documents?     Thank you.  I’d then like to move to page 28 of your affidavit because you indicated in your evidence that the letter of demand went out on the 7 t h of July, the deadline for an undertaking was the 13 t h, I understood you to say there was no undertaking given is that correct?     And then urgent proceedings were launched do you recall when that was?     And you detail at paragraph 151 on page 28 what happened on the 21 s t of July from SAA’s perspective, let me just get clarity, did SAA ever respond directly to Alta or Webber Wentzel about their position in relation to the urgent application?     Thank you so I’d like to take us to the media statement that was released on that day by SAA, you’ll find that under tab 68 at page 833. There are a few features of this statement that I’d like to traverse with you, the first of those is under the first paragraph it indicates that it’s a statement of the 21 s t of July 2016 and as I read it, it records, “South African Airways has taken a decision to terminate the services of BnP Capital as a financial services provider to the airline, the effect of this decision means SAA has terminated  both it’s appointment of BnP Capital as transaction advisor and the appointment to source funds on behalf of the airline, the decision was communicated to BnP Capital yesterday”, Do you see that?     And then if we go to paragraph 2, one of the aspects of the statement that is of interest I submit, is at the bottom or paragraph 2, Chair you’ll recall yesterday when we were looking at the first appointment letter of BnP Capital as transaction advisor, we were querying the date of that letter which was 20 March because that was two days after the bids closed and before any processes had been embarked upon within SAA.  This statement again records the  award as having been made on the 20 t h of March 2016 you’ll find that at the end of paragraph 2, where it is recorded, “The appointment of BnP Capital as transaction advisor was ostensibly in accordance with prescribed procurement processes and the award was made on 20 March 2016”, Do you see that?     We will seek to clarify that with Mr Mahlangu when he comes but again there seems to be, at least an understanding from SAA’s part that, that decision was taken on the 20 t h of March   and then paragraph 3 deals with the attempts to source funds and what had happened in relation to the endeavours with a previous potential funder, do you see that Ms Stimpel?     What do you understand that potential lender to have been that was identified in that paragraph?     Right and it concludes with the withdrawal was communicated by the potential lender to SAA in April 2016, do you see that?     So as I understand this paragraph, and correct me if you take it different view, there’s an effort here to explain the background to the sourcing of funds and why it ended up with BnP and what’s being communicated here is that there was a withdrawal from a previous potential funder in about April 16, is that your understanding of the paragraph?     Again Chair, that may be significant because it suggests an interaction with FDC if they are the potential lender until at least 2016.  And then it goes on to give further background to the due diligence that they thereafter conducted, their concerns around the FSB license and ultimately as I have it the decision to terminate.  They also deal with you or at least their interactions with you in paragraph 9, can you tell us what they record there?     Well what is your response to that statement?    And if we could Ms Stimpel then go to that notification of charges that you received at the end of July, you’ll find that at page 837, Ms Stimpel you’ll see there – was this the first time that the charges against you were made known to you?     And who did you meet with when you collected it?     Thank you and if we could go to paragraph 2 on page 837, because this, as I have it records the foregrounds on which you are alleged to have misconducted yourself.  I’ll just read through them and then I’d like your overarching comment in relation to those charges, the first is, “Unauthorised possession and removal of company documents, the second is insolence, the third is breach of substantive provisions of the contract of employment including the  confidentiality undertaking and the fourth is breach of SAA’s anonymous reporting policy”, Lets just deal with each of them, unauthorised possession and removal of company documents, what is your response to that?     And the charge of insolence?     Ms Stimpel I – you’ll forgive me but I still don’t understand why the WhatsApp interaction on the 16 t h of June is evidence of insolence, can you just help me with that?     Thank you Ms Stimpel.  The breach of substantive provisions of the contract of employment including confidentiality undertaking, what is your response to that?    And just help me also on number 4 the breach of SAA’s anonymous reporting policy, what did you understand that charge to be?    Ms Stimpel at the bottom of page 28 paragraph 155 you indicate that you initially decided to challenge the suspension but you go on to explain why you did not follow through with that process.  Will you please explain to the Chair what was going on and why you changed your decision to challenge the suspension?    And then you go on at page 29 to detail – it is the conclusion of the preceding paragraph 155.  You talk about continued postponements and delays that happened in the case.  So when does that period of postponement take you to?    Ms Stimpel one of the aspects of the version of Ms Nhantsi who will be giving evidence in due course is she questions your decision to settle.  She indicates that it is evidence of a lack of conviction on your part in the merits of your case challenging these charges.  What is your response to that?    Thank you Chair.  Just two follow up questions from that Ms Stimpel.  Do you regard yourself as being in the category that the Chair has described of persons who were suspended on merit list charges because they stood up to what they regarded as being irregular and potentially corrupt?    And a second follow up in the course of your evidence I have noticed at least two references to other employees of SAA who were suspended.  You made reference to Mr Bosc because when you went to engage about what you should do to whistle blow as I have it you were cautioned that you would just be placed on suspension as he was and then I recall you referencing Ms Mpshe.  Chair Ms Mpshe will be giving evidence in this session so we will hear from her first hand but she was also on suspension as I have it when she called you and you asked her about the whistle blowing and she suggested the Public Protector.  Could you give us the benefit of your insight as to that as a feature of the way in which management was being dealt with and employees were dealt with within SAA?    And the suspension of Mr – Doctor Dower do you have any knowledge of that?  Chair these are witnesses who will be coming in due course.    We take note of the    The need for specificity.    In relation to these types of themes that seem to be emerging.    So you will be hearing evidence from at least Ms Mpshe and Doctor Dower in this session and potentially Mr Bosc in the second session.    But just in terms of your knowledge of Doctor Dower’s circumstances were you aware of his suspension?    Ms Stimpel I would then like to take you to the last page of your affidavit page 29 and paragraph 157 you talk about the terms on which you settled with SAA and you talk about what pecuniary benefits you took – you gave up as a consequence of that settlement.  Can you tell us what those were?    And Ms Stimpel the last paragraph of your affidavit refers to a disciplinary hearing that took place in 2018 against Mr Zwane and Ms Nhantsi.  What is your knowledge of that process?    Advocate Cassim?    That 20 April 2018?    Thank you Chair and just for the purposes of the record and future evidence the findings of that disciplinary process are contained as the last annexure in Ms Stimpel’s bundle from page 841 and that is an aspect that Ms Nhantsi takes up in her statement and will do so in her evidence.     I can.    There are a series of allegations as to your bullying mode of engaging with her.  There are allegations about on one instance you representing a racist attitude and those are the aspects that I would like to have your comment on.    Chair there are no further questions from our side subject to any further from you.    Chair the next witness Mr Van Der Merwe is here.  We happy to start with him now unless it is convenient to take an earlier break.  We are in your hands.    Certainly.    Could we just arrange the table.    And have things ready.    Thank you.    Five minutes will be fine.    We are indeed Chair.    Thank you.  Chair we next have the evidence of Mr Pieter van der Merwe.    If I could ask for him to be sworn in.    Thank you Chair.  Mr van der Merwe you have in front of you a bundle of your evidence documents.  They include a statement – a sworn statement – from yourself and a few other documents that I would like to just go through with you initially so that we can orientate ourselves in the file. I have left on the witness table the bundle of Ms Stimpel’s evidence because there may be once or twice where I need to ask you to reference a document in those files but if we can start with your file.  It commences at page 1 with a sheet headed “Statement of Pieter van der Merwe”.  Do you see that?    Mr van der Merwe if you bring the microphone a bit closer to you and also turn it on at the bottom, thank you.    So that is the first document which runs to page 10 and as I have it at page 10 it was deposed to on 7 June of this year before a Commissioner of Oaths.  Is that correct?    Thank you and then what follows it are the series of annexures to the affidavit which run – at least the sworn statement – which run to page 32.  I then would like you to look at from page 36 which is another statement under oath from you – as I have it – that will be under the divider 2 and under the tag A2.1.  Do you have that?    That appears to be a second statement of yours and if you go to its last page which is at page 40.  Again signed before a Commissioner of Oaths but this time on 8 April 2019.  Is that correct?    And that as I understand it was a previous sworn statement you provided to the Commission.  Is that correct?    Mr van der Merwe I understand that there are some aspects that you want to correct in relation both to this earlier statement in April as well as one or two in relation to the June statement.  As I did with Ms Stimpel I propose Chair to deal with those corrections in the course of the evidence.    Thank you Chair and then just to understand the remaining two documents in that additional bundle section – at least there are three remaining documents.  The first is a CV of a person which is actually an annexure to your – your April statement.  Is that correct?    That is at page 40.1 Chair.    And then if we go over again pass the next tab to page 41 this is a copy of an email which we will deal with in your evidence but just to confirm I understand it to be an email that you received on 22 April 2016 which you then subsequently forwarded to the Commission’s investigators.  Is that correct?    And the same applies – as I understand it – for the document at page 43 that similarly is an email you received on 22 April 2016 and forwarded to the Commission’s investigators.  Is that correct?    Thank you.  Each of those emails have letters attached to them which were the attachments in the emails but we will come to that in the evidence.    Thank you.  Mr van der Merwe if we turn to page 3 of your sworn statement and when I say page 3 I am – I am really referring to the paginated pages at the top right hand corner because you have internal numbering which his different but when we refer to pages it will be the one in the top right hand corner of the page.  Do you have that?    Thank you and you begin there in the introductory section telling the reader of your affidavit about the formation of Grissag AG.  Can you please tell the Chair about how that company was formed and its origins?    Just two follow up questions.  When about was that?   And you said in your testimony that Mr Pokusaev was a representative of the Government.  Which Government was that?    Thank you.    So at the time that you met him in 2014 - and apologies for the error on my part – what position was he occupying at that stage?    And then you mention the creation of a company in 2015.  Tell us about that.  What was the name of the company and who were the Directors?    Has that remained the position insofar as Directors are concerned since 2015?    To this day?    Right, thank you.  At paragraph 8 on …        Thank you Chair.  Can I just get clarity?  At the time that the 15 billion debt consolidation of SAA was taking place which is really the years 2015 and 2016.  The company Grissag AG that was registered in South Africa during that entire period who were its Directors?    Thank you and then in relation to the London entity that you refer to we will go through your evidence with all of the various interactions that the South African company had at various points in time with the SAAs endeavour to raise funds but was the London company involved in those interactions?    Thank you.  Now at the bottom of page 3 of your statement you start to talk about your engagement with the Free State Development Corporation.  Can you please explain to the Chair how those arose, when they arose and what they entailed?    That letter – just for your reference – is at page 11 and it is dated August 2015 – as I understand your statement.  Can you confirm that that is the correspondence you were referring to?    Over the page at page 4 of your statement.  You talk about the reasons why that funding for the housing project did not go through.  Can you explain to us what the issue was there?    And why did that become an issue in relation to the housing project with the FDC?    And then on the same page – page 4 from paragraph 10 you start to talk about your interactions with Seacrest as an entity.  The full name is Seacrest Investments 115 (Pty) Ltd.  You – you recount at paragraph 10 that that also began in August 2015.  Can you tell us about those interactions?  Who approached you?    Did he indicate to you how he came to learn of Grissag AG as a potential funder?    Mr van der Merwe just to get greater clarity I was interested in how Mr Etzebeth learnt of Grissag as a potential funder.  Did he ever disclose that to you when you first communicated?    Thank you and you have – you have dealt with the terms on which Seacrest was explaining to you the need for them to be involved in the arrangement with SAA - as I have it.  You were told two things.  You were told Grissag did not have an FSP licence and similarly it would not satisfy BBBEE requirements and so the idea as I understand it is that you would then form a JV with Seacrest insofar as the funding for SAA was concerned.  Is that correct?    And you talk at paragraph 12 about a Memorandum of Agreement that was subsequently entered into between Grissag and Seacrest.  A copy of that is attached as Annexure VDM2 to your sworn statement.  You will find it at page 12.  If we could just take a look at that. Mr van der Merwe the first thing I note in relation to this is that at paragraph 12 of your statement you talk about a Memorandum of Agreement that as subsequently signed on 27 August between Grissag and Seacrest but if you go to page 15 which is the last page of this agreement it does not appear to bear a signature of Seacrest.  Can you assist us there?    So just to be clear despite it not being signed I take your evidence to be you have gone through the terms as reflected here and you are satisfy that they accord with the terms of the agreement that was reached with Seacrest.  Is that correct?    I would like to just highlight one or two points in the agreement.  Did this agreement relate to the SAA funding opportunity?    And if you go to page 13 you will see Clause 2.4 there.  The copy is not all that easy to decipher but I think we will –    Well can I – can I probe that a bit further    Right.  So you knew though the Grissag interest rate would be 4.5 percent in the transaction and you were aware from the terms of this agreement that Seacrest would add a mark-up – so speak – and that would be its interest in the transaction anything above 4.5 percent but from SAAs side SAA is going to pay the Seacrest amount whatever it is above 4.5 percent.  Is that correct?    Thank you.  Chair I see we have reached the lunch adjournment time.  If it is convenient to break now.  We can continue after the lunch.     Indeed Chair.     Thank you.  Mr van der Merwe we were before the lunch adjournment at page four of your sworn statement and we were dealing in the last paragraph on that page with the memorandum of agreement that had been concluded between Grissag AG and Seacrest, you recall that?      You say at the end of paragraph 12 there that you never saw the tender yourself nor did you try to look for it.  So can I just clarify there, you took SeaCrest at it’s word did you that they would have to be the interface with SAA because of the requirements of BBBEE as well as the FSP license, is that right?      I’d like to take you to the tender that was sent to the various, potential funders at the time because you will note fro it that those were not stipulated requirements of the tender and for that purpose I’d like you to go to the evidence bundle of Ms Stimpel and you’ll find it in A of that bundle. Chair I’ve just realised that you may not have your, Ms Stimpel bundle with you, am I correct on that (indistinct) Mr van der Merwe.  I am going to make reference to one or two of the documents in Ms Stimpel’s bundle, how would you like to proceed?      Oh we have an extra Chair, I’ve just been told.      There seems to be an affirmation, yes Chair.      Apologies for that.      I was not apologies Chair.      Thank you so much, Chair I’ve also been reminded that Mr van der Merwe’s legal representative is here today and would like to place himself on record, if we may do that.      Thank you.      Thank you Chair.  So Mr van der Merwe I was asking that we go to file A of Ms Stimpel’s evidence and the particular page I’d like you to turn up there is page 220 you’ll find it under flag 11.  Mr van der Merwe just to orientate you in relation to this document, it was Ms Stimpel’s evidence that this was the request for proposal that was sent out after the Board of SAA determined that it wanted to be more involved in the process of procuring the 15billion funding for SAA and they required that this request for proposal then be sent out to specified list of recipients one of which included SeaCrest.  You will see that is a single page document with signatures on the second page and it is accompanied by a term loan facility term sheet, have you seen this document before?      Now you can take my word for it but if you want to read it feel free to do so, as I read the text of this it makes no reference to requirements of either a FSP license or BBBEE requirements, are you happy to proceed on the basis that it doesn’t say that?      Mr van der Merwe if that is so, why do you think SeaCrest would have said otherwise to you in relation to its interactions with you?      Yes can you take a look at point 9 on the document under the first amount of 15billion, do you see reference to bridging finance in the interim of 1billion, were you engaged at all about that?      Insofar as the RFP’s are concerned, this to the knowledge, certainly to ourselves as the Commission and our engagements with SAA this was the only one that was sent out at this point in time, were you not concerned to verify what you were being told about the terms on which the arrangement could be taken forward?      We saw the terms of the agreement that you concluded with SeaCrest, in term of which you, Grissag AG was going to charge 4.5% and SeaCrest was going to add a percentage above that when it bid for the tender, do you recall that?      Were you keen to win the tender?      Would any – do you think it would have been useful to have come in at the lowest possible interest rate on the transaction to secure the prospect of winning the tender?      Would it not then have been in your interest to determine whether you actually had to have SeaCrest there because their involvement simply served to increase the interest rate at which they would bid for the SAA funding tender.      Explain that please, what did they propose, apologies Chair.      But Mr Grissag your evidence earlier was that you had no knowledge whatever of the mark-up that they were going to add to the 4.5% is that correct?      So you had no certainty that they would come in under the repo rate, did you?      But as I understand your evidence, you didn’t seek to investigate this at all.      Thank you. If we can the go to page 5 of your sworn statement, you talk at paragraphs 13 and 14 there about other engagements that you were having over that period in terms of developing Grissag’s business development and marketing, my sense from those paragraphs is you were actively pursuing funding opportunities, is that correct?      And give us a sense of who you were approaching at that time?      You make references in paragraph 13 to a meeting with Eskom, with the Shanduka Group and one interaction with Mr Wolf Meyer at the time who was then the Chief Financial Officer, do you confirm that you had those interactions?      And were you leading – were you contacting them or were they contacting you?      And you record at paragraph 15, that in December 2015 you were told by Mr Rambau that SAA was going to increase the amount to be sourced to 15billion, what explanation were you given for that increase?      And at no point in these interactions, as I understand your evidence, did SeaCrest ever disclose what it’s mark-up was on your 4.5%, is that right?      If you are subsequently told, and the evidence we heard yesterday confirms this, that they went in at 5.8%, which is a margin of 1.3% on your 4.5 – let me just get that right, they went in at 5.8% - yes it’s a margin of 1.3% on your 4.5%, what would you make of that mark-up, is that in line with the levels for mark-up for sources of funds internationally, do you have knowledge of that?    Chair that is consistent with the evidence, yesterday of Ms Stimpel when she engaged the banks for those hypothetical quotes.  So would you have been concerned about a mark- up in the order of 1.3% in terms of the competitiveness of the bid?        But you made no effort to uncover what the percentage was that they were going in with?      What were you asked for from SeaCrest in terms of proof of funds and other documentation, and I ask that because we heard evidence yesterday of the efforts of SAA to get greater clarity as to the source of the funds that SeaCrest was going to be providing, what did they ask you for?      Mr van der Merwe there was also evidence in the course of yesterday about a due diligence that was done by the legal department of SAA and conclusion by that department that they were concerned as to the source of funds aspects and a proposal from that department that nonetheless they recommended that an agreement be concluded subject to a series of conditions precedent which were designed – we went through them in some detail to enable SAA to be the recipient of this information and without it, no agreement coming into existence.  Were you aware of those – that position having been adopted by SAA?      What would have been your attitude if you had been told that there would be an agreement concluded, it would include conditions precedent but the required these proof of funds, confirmation from the Reserve Bank, Financial Surveillance Department etcetera as pre-requisites to the operation of the agreement.      I’d like to just dwell on the point for a moment because it does have some significance in the development of events because you see the Group Treasurer’s proposal to the Board of SAA at the end of 2015, amongst other things was that the SeaCrest bid should be accepted but that was subject to the caveat that the agreement on these terms with these conditions precedent be concluded so that the position of SAA was protected insofar as they didn’t know enough yet about what was happening behind SeaCrest with the funder.  So if you had been privy to all of that at the time can I take it that you would have been satisfied having had the agreement signed to then provide the necessary information?      Chair we know from the evidence yesterday that was not to happen because on the 3 r d of December a different decision was taken.  Mr van der Merwe if we can return to page 5 of your statement.  You begin at paragraph 16 to talk about the period while you were awaiting an outcome from SeaCrest about its engagements with SAA and at that point, still in 2015 you were dealing with the FDC on the housing project.  Your affidavit – your sworn statement at least then goes on to talk about how SAA and funding through FDC came up, can you take us through those events.      And when about was that?      Of 2015?      In the course of paragraph 17 on page 5 you indicate that the FDC enquired whether Grissag was a Financial Services Provider and registered with FSB, why was it making those enquiries?      Was that in the context of the SAA funding discussion or was it separate to that?      Did you establish whether the Free State Development Corporation had a FSP license?      And did you make any enquiries as to the likelihood that one State owned entity could lend money to another State owned entity was that something that concerned you at all?      And what did they tell you?      Well could we go back a moment because it seems to me there would have been further interactions before you got the no-go signal so to speak because as I understand your evidence you first raised, towards possibly the end of November early December 15 with the FDC, the possibility of funding SAA through them, is that correct?      I understand your evidence to be, they said they would look into it, is that correct?      Was there any point thereafter, prior to the no-go conversation that you provided the with a term sheet in relation to what funding you would make available and on what terms?     Let’s go to that, it’s at page 16 of your sworn statement, this is the first…(intervention).       16 yes.      Well it’s an Annexure to the statement, I apologise Chair.        So it’s Annexure 3, Mr van der Merwe this is the first note I have of a correction that you want to make to the affidavit – to your sworn statement because at paragraph 19 on page 6 you say, shortly after this discussion at the end of 2015 I sent Grissag term sheet to FDC, you say I’ve been shown a copy of the term sheet that FDC provided to SAA and then you say a copy is attached as FDM3 but if we go to FDM3 that does not appear to be a term sheet, is that right?     So what exactly is Annexure 3?      And were you the author of that letter?      If you go over to page 17, you – under item 4 there, paragraph 4 indicate the interest rate on the loan and you talk about a fixed 4% per annum to be calculated on each of the draw-down in the event of the guarantee of 3billion being delivered and then there seem to be alternatives, depending on the period within which the agreement and the amount for which the funding is to be provided, is that a fair reading?      What I notice about that is, the highest percentage there is 4% whereas the percentage that you were going to charge when you were dealing with SeaCrest was 4.5, why come down?      I would like to take you to the actual term sheet that was provided by FDC to SAA so that you can tell us whether you had sight of it at the time, you’ll need to go into the bundle of Ms Stimpel’s evidence and you will find that term sheet at page 316, which is under tab 21.  We can – if we may just start at the commencement of that Annexure which is actually at page 313, under tab 21.  You’ll see that page 313 is an email from Mr Shepherd Moyo to SAA funding RFP, it seems to be copied to Ms Phumeza Nhantsi who is Shepherd Moyo, Mr van der Merwe?      And it says, “Good day please find attached our proposed terms sheet for funding as per the RFP”, And then if you go over to page 316, you’ll see what was the attached term sheet, do you see that?      It appears to have been sent on the 24 t h of December 2015, were you involved in this at all?      It doesn’t appear to reflect that gradation in the various interest rates that we saw in your letter to FDC at the time at page 318 there’s a fixed interest rate of 4%, it appears on the full extent of the loan is that – am I reading this correctly?      So you weren’t engaged on that at all?      And the document there is what I take to be a Grissag logo did you give them the logo to use?      But you were not engaged at all in this document?      If we return to your affidavit – sworn statement apologies Chair.      Well can I just probe that a bit further because, again I understand your interest to be securing the opportunity to provide this funding, is that right?      Now as I understand the letter, you wrote to FDC, there was a sliding scale of interest rates the highest of which being 4% the lowest of which being 3%, given that variation, you may have entertained a greater competitive position, mightn’t you because the lower the interest rate the greater the benefit to SAA is that correct?      But this term sheet does not indicate that gradation it simply is a fixed rate of 4% on 15billion.      And when you say there’s slight variations you’ll forgive me but the difference of half a percent on 15billion rand I would suggest is not a small difference.      Thank you, you then, back in your sworn statement at page 6 paragraph 20 say, a short time thereafter, now just to orientate ourselves in the previous paragraph you’re at the end of 15 and then in paragraph 20 you say, “A short time thereafter, probably a few weeks, FDC came back to me and said that it would not be possible for it to source funds for SAA as it was not allowed for one State owned entity to fund another State entity”.  Mr van der Merwe can you give us some sense of your degree of certainty about that time period that it was probably a few weeks after the end of 2015 that you received this feedback from FDC?    And that would have put you in January of 16, is that right somewhere thereabouts?    Could it possibly have been as late as March or April of 2016?    Thank you.  If we then proceed you start to deal thereafter in your sworn statement with the events of 2016 and you say a month or two later towards the beginning of 2016 we were already in January so I would like you to again be quite specific if you would to the best of your recollection when this next event occurred because this next event as you have it here is a call from someone who introduced himself as the CEO of BNP.  When to the best of your recollection did that call come through?    That timing does have some significance Mr Van Der Merwe because of what you say in the second sentence in that    And just to have your evidence it is somewhere in February or March of 2016?    How did BNP come to contact you?    Let me be a little more precise with my question.  Were you ever – did you just receive calls from people over time about funding?  How did they know to contact Grissag AG about R15 billion?    Okay but let us just place ourselves in about February or March 2016 because as I have it you have been engaged with Seacrest the previous year. Did you know at this stage in year whether Seacrest’s bid for that funding tender had been accepted or declined?    Can we be as clear as possible there?  Had you been told that they had not been successful or had you been told that they did not have a result yet in relation to the tender?    And then as I have your evidence FDC was an option but they came back to you a few weeks after the end of 2015 and said they cannot loan state entity to state entity and then as I have your evidence in about February or March you get the third potential interface with SAA and that is BNP Capital.  Is that a fair summary?    And just to be clear when you were first contacted there was no discussion with the person from BNP whose name you cannot recall about how they came to know to contact you for funding?    Thank you.  You then at paragraph 22 on that page say that you were aware at the time that SAA had published a tender for transaction advisor services.  How were you aware of that?    We saw in the course of the evidence yesterday that an RFI went out for these transaction advisor services.  You say at paragraph 22 a copy of the RFP is attached as VDM4 but Mr Van Der Merwe I have a not that that is a second correction that you want to make because if you go to VDM4 which is at page 18 you will see a document that does not appear to be an RFP is that right?    I am not going to spend longer on the document that does appear at page 18 at the moment because we will come to it in due course.  It is actually one of the documents attached to the emails of 22 April 2016.  So I will remove it there but we can then just delete that a copy is attached.  That is my suggestion for paragraph 22.  Let us talk about the interactions that you had with BNP at this point.  Did you have meetings in person?    Were you always dealing – well I assume you were then dealing telephonically, is that correct?    And I assume also some communications via email, is that correct?    Were you dealing in those interactions with one or more people?    Do you recall the names of the people you were interacting with?    But you were inclined to engage with them about what is now your third attempt to provide funding to SAA, is that correct?    Would it not have been relevant to engage in a bit more detail and find out a bit more about the entity that you were going to be going into partnership with for this purpose?    And you say on page 7 at paragraph 24 that the main reason for Grissag’s partnership with BNP was because of BNP’s BBBEE status and FSP licence holder-ship.  That seems to be a common theme of your interactions first with Seacrest, then with FDC and now with BNP, is that correct?    Was this discussed with BNP that – did you enquire from them whether they had an FSP licence?    Well can I just follow up on that Mr Van Der Merwe because you said they told you that there needed to be a locally registered company, who were they?    Mr Van Der Merwe let me be a little bit clearer.  I was asking about the registration of the company locally because as I understood your answer to the Chair you were explaining why transactions in South Africa had to have a locally registered company as opposed to the position in the rest of Africa where you use the London Company.  So who indicated to you that the – there had to be a locally registered company in order for you to engage in funding opportunities in South Africa?    Thank you and then I understand just to summarise.  Over time you have told that there are three requirements to engage in funding of this order in South Africa.  You must have a locally registered company.  You must have an FSP licence and you must have BEE credentials in order to be able to fund and as I understand your evidence you took steps to comply with the first but not the latter two, is that correct?    And for the latter two you kept engaging with I am going to call them intermediaries or middlemen who would then satisfy those requirements insofar as SAA was concerned?    The consequence of that arrangement Mr Van Der Merwe I would like to put to you is that the ultimate cost that SAA pays is higher than if they had engaged with you directly.  Do you accept that?    Mr Van Der Merwe when did those attempts – when were those attempts made?    Just to follow up Mr Van Der Merwe I was asking when precisely you made the approaches to SAA and your answer covered ministries and a housing project.  So can you recall when you made this approach to SAA directly?    So would it be fair to say somewhere in the period of 2015?    Chair with your leave we will make a note of that.    And just see if we can follow up.    It is not an aspect that we were aware of prior to today.  If we can then go to page 7 paragraph 25.  Because at 25 you talk about an email communication from BNP where they attached their appointment letter and BNP wanted Grissag to provide proof of funds immediately.  Now if we go to your copy of that letter which is VDM5 you will find that at page 19.  Chair this letter will be familiar because this is the letter at page 19 that was addressed to BNP Capital dated the 20 March we have already raised a query about that date and it is in fact the letter appointing them to provide transaction advisor services for 2.6 million or thereabouts.  Mr Van Der Merwe I would like to move from 19 to the emails plus their attachments that were included at the end of your bundle because we have actually been able to source the originating email thank you to your endeavours in this regard when these documents were sent to you by BNP and Chair the reason why that was important is because if you go for example to page 42 of the bundle.      You will see page 42 is a letter - dear Pieter signed it appears by Mr Mahlangu but the letter has no date itself so it has been in the challenge in the course of the investigation until we engaged with Mr Van Der Merwe to establish precisely when this letter was sent to Mr Van Der Merwe but usefully we now have at page 41 the email that records that it was sent in the evening of April the 22 n d, 16.  Do you confirm that to be correct Mr Van Der Merwe?    Thank you.  What I am interested in over the page at 42 – well Chair just to signal first of all that date is fairly important because at this stage BNP Capital has not yet been appointed to source funds for SAA.  What they have been appointed to do is give transaction advisor services.    But of some interest is that we do know that on the 21 December the board of SAA took a decision in principle to extend the scope of a transaction advisor to include the sourcing of funds but no process had yet been followed within SAA.    But interestingly on the 22 April this email from BNP comes to Grissag – you had been dealing with each other at that point, is that correct Mr Van Der Merwe?    And the letter as I have it – let us go to the    And this letter was received I think it is a minute or so later on the evening of 22 April that appears from page 43, is that correct?    So let us just understand what is happening on the 2 April 2016.  You receive a letter from BNP Capital announcing that they have been awarded the opportunity to arrange funding for 15 billion for SAA but the letter that they suggest confirms that does not, is that correct?    Did you note that at the time?    And then if we go to the bottom of that letter to yourself.  They are talking about the conclusion of a memorandum of    Apologies Chair.    Apologies Chair.  We are at page 42.    So this is the letter to which the award letter is attached.  We have dealt with the fact that it was only an appointment for transaction advisor services but you have explained why that did not raise a red flag for you.  And then I was just focussing on the last paragraph on this page because what I understand BNP to be asking for here is a proof of funds so that you can move forward in the transaction with SAA and a request that that reach them by close of    And Mr Van Der Merwe I understand that to be the consistent position that you adopted even in relation to the Seacrest arrangement, is that right?    So if we go to the bottom of page 7 of your statement paragraph 26 you say there in order to move matters forward Grissag’s term sheet needed to be signed by SAA.  And then you go into the engagements around the term sheet that was signed.  That term sheet appears as annexure 6 which you will find at page 21.      And we need to spend a bit of time on this because I understand that there is a further correction in your statement that needs to be made here.  Because at paragraph 26 you talk about the circumstances in which this came to be signed. But amongst the things you say is that you attended a meeting at which you signed the term sheet and I understand that to be incorrect.  So please take us through those facts.  What happened on the 8 June 2016?    If I can ask a few follow up questions.  Who told you to go to SAA on that day?    And let us go to page 25 which is the signature page.      Well Mr Van Der Merwe let us go to the earlier term sheet that you made reference to.  That you will find in Ms Stimpel’s evidence bundle B and you will find it at page 520 which is under Tab 52.  We are at page 520 in bundle B.  Is this the earlier term sheet to which you referred Mr Van Der Merwe?    And you said this was non-binding.  Certainly at page 524 that is what the capital lettering seems to indicate.  It has also been crossed out – the words by our signature we hereby accept in principle the terms of this term sheet – that is crossed out and at the bottom of the page there is handwritten draft for discussion purposes only non-binding and subject to SAA board approval, do you see that?    And when were you sent this?    And just clarify for us, what was your attitude when you received it?    And did you communicate that to BNP?    Because as I understand your evidence you are only interacting at this point through BNP, is that right?    There are no interactions directly between you and SAA representatives, is that correct?    That is an aspect that we will pick up in relation to your earlier statement because I understand there to have been averments there that are – that do not reflect that.    So we will go to that in due course but let us look at page 25 then back in your sworn statement because that seems to be a document – apologies Chair.    Chair it is actually a point of some significance.  The question you have raised because when we go to page 25 back in Mr van der Merwe’s statement you will see that same signature appears for Mr Pokusaev and it is the point that I needed to take up with Mr van der Merwe because Mr van der Merwe’s statement says he attended the meeting at – on 8 June and he signed the term sheet but Mr van der Merwe I have you to indicate that you did not sign the term sheet on 8 June.  Is that right?    So how did the signing take place?    But does that mean that the document she was signing had already had on it the electronic signature of Mr Pokusaev?    So we …    So you despite what was indicated in your statement Mr van der Merwe I understand you to say that SAA was in possession of a version of this bearing the electronic signature of Mr Pokusaev.  Is that correct?    And when you arrived for that meeting you at no point picked up a pen to sign.  Is that correct?    You initialled.  You did not sign on the last page?    But Nhantsi signed?    Is that correct?    Thank you Chair.  I would like to go back a little bit in that week preceding 8 June.  Mr van der Merwe you live in the Free State is that correct?    Were you located in the Free State in the period to 8 June?    And I assume from that then you would have needed to make travel arrangements to come up to Johannesburg for the purposes of the meeting on the 8 t h.  Is that correct?    Do you recall how long in advance of 8 June you were requested to come up?    But for our purposes it would be relevant to know whether you were told at any point prior to 8 June that you needed to be there on 8 June.  Can I take it that you told at some point prior to 8 June?    And do you remember how long in advance you travelled up?    But just to be clear you can confirm that you were told before 8 June that you would be required on 8 June?    Who communicated that to you?    Would you have any records of that?    Thank you.  So you come up on 8 June.  Ms Nhantsi signs it.  You get it stamped on the various pages.  You initial and you take this away with you.  Is that correct?    Were there further interactions?    I would then like to look at the terms of this term sheet that was signed on 8 June – if we may.  Let us look first at page 22.  Chair the significance of these terms will become relevant later when we are looking at some of the correspondence.  What I would like to focus on – on 22 is that insofar as the facility description    Thank you and then if we go over the page to 23 you will see there an interest rate which is now at 3.5 percent.  It seems that with each successive term sheet it drops by half a percent.  Can you tell us about why you arrived at 3.5 percent by this stage?    Well maybe I should not have been so quick because I see the rate had dropped by this - to 3.5.  That is right insofar as we talking about the fixed interest rate because the previous fixed interest rate on the term sheet with the FDC was at 4 percent.  Is that correct?    But unlike in the case of FDC there is now another fee added in this team sheet.  In this term sheet there is    So would it be fair to say the combined effect of that is 4.5 percent?    Tell us why.    As an interest rate?    Right and just talk to us about the one point – the 1 percent fee there.  How was that to work?    Mr van der Merwe you have just turned off your – yes – microphone thank you.    Can we …?    Can we just talk about some numbers?  A 1 percent fee on each drawdown – let us just assume over the full funding exposure of 15 billion whether it was paid over time or in one drawdown.  The total that SAA would pay is 150 million.  Is that correct?    Right.  So there is 150 million that is going to be paid at each drawdown broken up if necessary if the drawdowns are for amounts less than the full 15 and then as I understand it you are going to share that 150 million in equal parts between yourselves and BNP Capital.  Is that correct?    So out of the total 150 million Grissag AG would take 75 million and BNP Capital would take 75 million.  Is that correct?    Why is that not reflected here - that arrangement – the split of the 50/50?    And I understand you to say that that was because you shared that with BNP because of the roll that BNPs FSP licence and its BBBEE status was playing in the conclusion of this whole transaction.  Is that right?    Were you aware that they were going to be paid 256 million for having found you?    But you will accept that if this had all gone through BNP would have earned even more than the 256 million that it had agreed SAA would pay it as a source of funds.  It would also have received a further 75 million on top of that 256 million.  Is that correct?    Thank you.  Mr van der Merwe I would like to then go back to your affidavit – if we may.  Is that agreement that you refer to - the 50/50 split - recorded in writing anywhere?    So when did you come to agree those terms?    I am interested in that.  When about would that have occurred because let us just orientate ourselves in time.  You got the email on 22 April 2016 where they told you they had been appointed as the source of the funds and they produced the letter albeit that it related only to transaction advisor services.  So was the agreement on this 1 percent fee split around that time or – or later in your engagements?    But would you be comfortable with saying fairly shortly after 22 April?    Thank you.  Those dates will become fairly important in due course in the later evidence Chair.  I would then like to go to your previous statement Mr van der Merwe because there are a number of corrections which I understand you want to make to that statement and that statement commences at page 36.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Mr van der Merwe we were at page 38 of your bundle which is the third page of your previous statement under oath that was provided to the Commission is that correct?      And I understand that the corrections you want to make begin at paragraph 10, because at paragraph 10 you say there I was therefore contacted by SAA Officials during February 2016 and they informed that Grissag’s term sheet incorporating its terms and conditions were acceptable to SAA, is that correct Mr van der Merwe?      Which term sheet would you have been referring to here though?      And just to be clear you met with the investigators as I have your evidence and then you sat down and put this document together, is that correct?      And as you’ve described to the Chair you referenced being contacted by SAA officials that you with greater reflection can confirm is not correct, is that right?      And insofar as what was happening in 2016 is concerned and which term sheet, have you got clarity on that?      Okay if we go to paragraph 11 there’s another error, as I understand it from you, you said the intended funding agreement between SAA and Grissag did not materialise because Grissag was not BEE compliant.  That sentence seems to suggest that at some point you thought that there was going to be an agreement between SAA and Grissag directly, notwithstanding the absence of BEE compliance, is that right or wrong?      And I understand the next sentence also is erroneous, you said the SAA subsequently informed me that it had appointed a certain BEE entity called BnP Capital, a service provider that according to SAA was 100% BEE compliant.  That is not correct, is it?      In what respect is it not correct?      And as I understand.     And then if we go to thirteen on that page there’s a further error there as I understand it, there you’re referring to the term sheet that we have been spending some time on, and you say in that paragraph Grissag agreed to the mooted JV, that’s in your previous paragraph, a JV that you said you were going to form with BnP Capital, as per the attached term sheet dated May 2016.  In paragraph 6 of the term sheet which deals with fees it was recorded that once the funds had been received by SAA 1% once off fee would be payable by SAA to BnP Capital.  Now we’re looked at that term sheet, it doesn’t refer to BnP Capital, is that correct?        To Grissag, and you’ve clarified what ancillary arrangement was between yourself and BnP in relation to the split of that 1%, is that correct?     So this is an incorrect reflection of the 1% being paid from SAA to BnP, just so that I have it correctly, it’s the 1% to be paid to Grissag which you then had an agreement with BnP you’d share 50/50, is that correct?      Mr van der Merwe those are my notes as to the changes or corrections you need to make on your first statement.  Are there any that I have omitted?      I’m seeking just to understand from you whether there are any corrections over and above the ones that we’ve discussed relating to paragraphs 10, 11 and 13 that you want to make to that statement?    If we can then go back to your later statement, the June statement that you provided to the Commission, and Chair this is – will be the last aspect of the evidence that I propose to traverse with Mr van der Merwe, Mr van der Merwe it arises at – well let’s start on page 8 at paragraph 29 on page 8, you talk about one previous interaction you had with Ms Nhantsi, can you please tell the Chair about that?          Thank you Mr van der Merwe and if you go over to page 9 you record at paragraph 30 of your sworn statement that you don’t recall having had any meetings with a Mr Mashodsa Mugadi of Nedbank but you don’t have clarity do you as to who the people were that you were interacting with from BnP, is that right?      So is it possible that you were engaging with Mr Mugadi in some of those interactions?      Thank you.  Let us then go to paragraph  31, because these are three, you reference three letters in paragraphs 31 that I would like to take you through, they are letters that begin at VDM8 which you will find at page 31 of your bundle. Chair with your leave I would like to deal with these three letters in the order of Annexure 8, 10, 9, just because that will follow the chronological sequence.      And what’s relevant here Mr van der Merwe, so that I have it correct, these are not letters as I understand it that you were aware of at the time that they were being submitted between BnP and SAA, is that right?      Yes Chair so – indeed, indeed, so all three, there are three letters there.      All appear to be from BnP Capital to SAA and Mr van der Merwe what I have you confirm is that you – the first time you saw these letters was when they were shown to you by the Commission’s investigators, is that right?      Mr van der Merwe I suggest that’s somewhat curious because they say a lot about Grissag AG in these letters, but you confirm you never saw them at the relevant time?      Right if we can start with the one at page 31, you will see Mr van der Merwe it’s dated 31 May 2015, it’s from Mr Mhlongo, the CEO of BnP Capital and it’s addressed to South African Airways, do you see that?    This is a letter which is motivating for a 50% cancellation fee, to be paid to BnP Capital in the event of the termination of their mandate as a sourcer of funds, and what we will see through these letters is that with increasing levels of detail I would suggest BnP Capital is persisting in its motivations to SAA for why that initially 50% cancellation fee should be paid and in the end it ends up being a cancellation fee of 49.9million.  What I am interested in Mr van der Merwe is that a great deal is said in these letters about all sorts of costs that Grissag AG has incurred, that Grissag AG is threatening to look to BnP for and I want to have your evidence in relation to whether any of those statements are in fact correct, so we will go through them if we may.   Page 31 the second paragraph there, it says BnP Capital is incurring costs for amongst others sourcing in conjunction with its partners the funding globally for and on behalf of SAA, including from our Chinese, Abu Dhabi, European, and Brazilian funding partners.  Do any of those cover you?    If we go to ...(intervention)     Because you weren’t incurring costs at that stage were you?    Right.    If we go to the paragraph below that mid-way through that paragraph there’s another assertion that BnP Capitals partners or stakeholders have a cancellation fee in US Dollars against BnP due to the costs incurred of flying around the world to source funding for and on behalf of SAA.  Let’s stop there, did you have a cancellation fee in US Dollars agreed with BnP?    So when they go in the last sentence to say that the 50% of the fees that we asked for that’s a reference to the 50% of the total fees that they were trying to have SAA agree to equate to BnP’s actual cancellation costs that couldn’t have been relating to Grissag could it?    If we can then go to the next letter, this is – well the next one I would like to go to is actually Annexure 10 which you will find at page 33 because that is the next one in chronological sequence, it’s a letter dated the 14 t h of June 2016, do you see that Mr van der Merwe?    Now you will have realised in the course of the evidence the dates are fairly important, certainly to me, as we piece this story together, on 14 t h of June 2016 that term sheet had already been signed, hadn’t it, by Mr Nhantsi?    And that was going to secure the full 15billion worth of funding from Grissag is that correct?    Indeed.  My point of significance is simply that the full amount of the debt consolidation that SAA was embarking upon was now going to be funded by a single entity, Grissag AG, is that correct?    Assuming the agreements had been concluded.    And Chair this is a letter we’ve actually looked at before with Ms Stimpel, it’s the one that talks about the events that happened at a National Treasury meeting, Ms Stimpel has raised concerns about how it was that BnP Capital would have that information.  What I’m interested in though is over the page at 34, there’s a whole section of this letter that’s devoted to facts about Grissag AG, I would like to take you through a few of them.   The first says in the middle of the page Grissag AG has been chosen and tasked to find a total of 15billion from its various long-term investments around the Globe because of their efficient funding terms as listed below.  Two says this entails breaking up those investments and consequently the incurring of breakage costs to achieve this fundraising of 15billion.  Is that correct Mr van der Merwe?    There were no breakage costs?    Chair you will recall in the motivation that went to the Board to approve the cancellation fee one of the four items as I recall it which were the basis for justifying that cancellation fee were these breakage costs that were allegedly to be – have been incurred but I understand your evidence Mr van der Merwe to be that no such costs were incurred by Grissag?    Let’s move down to point four on that page if we may, because now we get a whole lot of detail about directors that are being flown around the world, let’s go to four, following the written request from SAA of a Term Sheet that required proof of our ability first to raise this funding and secondly to provide the terms attached to the funding raised four directors were dispatched to Paris, France on the 1 s t of June 2016, these directors come from amongst other countries Brazil, Canada and Russia.   Let’s stop there.  Are there four directors of Grissag AG?    So it is false insofar as the letter records that any four directors of Grissag were dispatched to Paris, France on the 1 s t of June, is that right?    Insofar as the two directors that do exist in Grissag AG were you dispatched to Paris, France on the 1 s t of June 16?    And to your knowledge was Mr Pokusaev dispatched on the 1 s t of June to Paris, France?    Well the letter goes on ...(intervention)     Let’s go over the page to 35 if we may, you will see at point five there we get even more detail about this elusive trip to    And then finally at paragraph 7 there’s a reference there to mitigate Grissag AG’s losses in the event of SAA cancelling BnP Capital’s mandate as above Grissag AG will invoice BnP Capital with the cancellation charges in US Dollar amount of five million to recover, compensate for its costs and the work involved in its fund raising execution, including the breakage costs of the amounts as above.   Well let’s break that down, had you indicated to BnP Capital that you were going to charge them five million US Dollars if this deal did not come to fruition?    So Mr van der Merwe just insofar as that letter is concerned would it be a fair summation to say those facts related to Grissag AG that I’ve taken you to today are false?    If we can then go to the final letter in the sequence which is at page 32, by sequence I mean chronological sequence, because this is a letter dated the 4 t h of July 2016, you will see that this letter is a letter that marks Chair that reduction from the 50% of the cancellation fees now to the lesser amount of 49.9million.  What I am interested in is the second paragraph but let’s look at the introduction. Our previous letter – so this is Mr Mhlango of BnP Capital    And so the suggestion that you were going to slap them with a penalty if there was a cancellation I take it would also be false?    Chair those conclude the questions that we have for Mr van der Merwe.  Oh, apologies Chair I have seen a note that I made, could I just be permitted ...(intervention)     ...one further question.  Mr van der Merwe there has been some media reporting in relation to Grissag previously and amongst that reporting I understand there to be allegations that your company was engaged with the Guptas, is that correct?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Indeed.    It has Chair indeed.    Chair may I propose nine thirty, we are envisaging two witnesses on the day and it will help the movement for the course of next week if we could start a bit early. 
MS CYNTHIA AGNES SORAYA STIMPEL:  It says by who warrants that he or she is duly authorised and then the full names of Mr Phulesane Daniel Mahlangu his designation being Director and it is dated the 3 June 2016.    Not at all Chair.    The first time I got to know of these particular documents there was the one where there was the letter of acceptance in my own personal case when SAA sent documents but the full detail that I have now I got from the Zondo investigators.      It would have been 50% of the 225 million if one included VAT 256 million and then the other fees as transaction advisor of 2.68 million and then 50% of that.    So that is quite substantial.    I will have to do quick …    Ja almost ja.    Correct.    They are not customary Sir.  For your own business and someone like a company like SAA who every single manager has been tasked to save cost in fact every single person, every employee in the company.  We would not be negotiating a cancellation fee in any of our contracts.  They are service providers to us and if they are unable to provide that service we terminate the contract.  So why would you then against your best interest for the organisation put in a cancellation clause?  If you on the other hand SAA serving someone else they can put the cancellation clause in.  So this for me and which is strange I did not have sight of this document while I was still in the employ of SAA.  I only got sight of it much later and having seen that from the date of the award having if – the round robin happened on the 24 t h board approval the 25 t h the letter goes out as a letter of award, the 25 t h our client comes back BNP already putting an – a cancellation clause in there and you asking yourself why?  They have not even done any work?  How would you even justify putting in that clause?  Normally you put it in after you negotiated your – this is just a letter of acceptance.  Then you negotiate your contract and the agreement and in that agreement you going to then discuss those type of aspects.  And – so for me this was really I say curious…    To find this that I could see this right in the letter up front.  Correct Chair thank you.    No Chair I was not.    What I understand there Chair is that the Minister of Finance is directing the board of SAA saying that we have noted you have not been able to do the debt consolidation which we have confirmed throughout the process and therefore to continue rolling our debt over.  With the refinancing means finding other funders.  If for instance Standard Bank does not want to continue with the funding be it a City Bank or a Standard Chartered of a FNB or you roll it over with the same bank.  And which we have been doing the past years in the same process. And so they were directing us to continue that process seeing that the debt consolidation was not happening.  Thank you Chair.    Yes at the time it was roughly about 14 billion.  If we look at the letter the date of the letter in May.  Correct.  And that was also the extent of the full guarantees.    So it was backed 100% security with government guarantees.    The 14 billion Sir is – Chair is the amount of the government guarantees that National     The National Treasury has given SAA.    The round figure of  - it – because it is 14. Some odd amount.  The 15 billion was the round figure for the debt consolidation.    Correct thank you Sir.    No I agree and noted Chair.    No Chair I was not aware of this document.    Yes I did.    We had Ms Nhantsi was there.  It was myself, it was Mr Joshua I think it is Du Plessis, it was Lindsey Olitsky.  There was the lady from Flee, Elsha Du Preez and I think that was it.      No there were no members of the board present at that meeting.    So on a regular basis Chair is that we meet with the banks together with National Treasury for various reasons. The one is that National Treasury is giving – providing the security to SAA through its loan book, through government guarantees.  And secondly is that SAA needs to present. a.  Its financial results. b. Its where it is going with its long term turnaround strategy and how it is doing generally from a financial operation perspective but also from its airline operations from its ground handling to its roots etcetera.   And so on a regular basis and this particular date was chosen the 3 June which we held at National Treasury’s offices and there SAA made presentation to each of these banks showing them our standing where we are currently with our financial situation.  Also reflecting what our routes are?  Which are out best routes?  Where we struggling?  What the – where we are with our aircraft etcetera.  So it is an all-round overview of the business.  This is presented to each of the banks but separately. a.  Because of the confidentiality surrounding the information.  Not from a SAA perspective only but also for the banks we dealing with because you have a different relationship, a different loan percentage wise and sensitivity and exposure to each of those banks.   So when we presented we present to each bank on its own.  So be it a City Bank, be it Standard Chartered, be it a Nedbank and so we presented to each of these banks throughout the day.  We started – it was from about 8;30 in the morning and we finished in the evening about 4 or 5 ja.    No there was not any Chair.    Yes I do.    Yes correct.  Okay thank you.    I actually do not know because this was only the team that were working obviously at SAA and then presenting directly to the banks for BNP to have got this information had to be someone who was part of the team that was present on the day.    It does surprise me it should not have been told to BNP.    Yes it is how I also understand it.    Thank you.    This is a term sheet as well – a term loan facility done by Grissag and for the client SAA.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct Chair.    That is indeed a source of concern.    Well that we would sign a non-binding sheet.  Secondly is that we have not gone through – ja – with all the background to this for our Interim CFO then to sign it and then not take – ja – push SAA into this.  For me it is definitely a concern.    The whole process from the start …    And we already started with – through the initial process of procurement getting the FDC.    Then finally we come now to the BNP.    I will tell you where my main concern is if I can be more specific rather.    In that SAA engaged BNP as a transaction advisor.    Then they changed it to sourcing of funds.  Now – and so the agreement now is done through Grissag who is going to be providing the funds and just looking at this you will see now Grissag is offering a 3.5 percent in the fee that – but they are adding 1 percent payable on each drawdown as SAA takes out the money depending. So – so there is even more issues as one looks at this that if you start calculating the cost the cost would incur and I am not sure if that was thought through because then you would – you would say my final cost once you agree you would also list – look at your final cost, yes.    Yes and especially from a term sheet of funding.  We have got others from Standard Bank, Absa etcetera and those are gone through again in Treasury Department because we have worked with the finance.  This – none of us in Treasury were privy to.  Not the Head of Cash Manager – Michael Kleyn – who looks at these terms sheets on a daily basis. He had not – he was not privy to seeing this and then this is being signed and putting SAA at possible risk, yes thanks.    For me was the whole process of just the way we have gone – the approach we have taken to secure funding for SAA.  We have diverted from the traditional way and our historical way of sourcing funds in that we went to the banks, we went to an RFP.  So by even getting external new parties on we still should follow a proper RFP process. What we have done is we have added in names.  We have then brought in a transaction advisor, changed the scope of it to – to widen it to source funds.  Hereby also going against the scope of 15 – if you are changing the scope it is only 15 percent of costs which is far more.  So we have already gone against that. Then secondly is once we have procured this transaction advisor the fee was at 1.5 percent – the final fee that was decided on – from three to 1.5 and – and still a phenomenal amount of 225 to be – million to be paid to this party and the fact that Treasury Department was not involved in this made me feel totally uncomfortable and I felt that I needed to do something about it. Yes I did talk to – to two of my colleagues – Michael Kleyn and Silas Matsaudza – at the time and I said to them you know that this process was not done correctly.  Can we stand together and speak up about it and they both said no they need their jobs.  They are not going to – do to anything.  So I said well I cannot sit by and let this happen.  I need to speak about it.  I also consulted with my family etcetera. The risk was that I would probably lose my job should I speak out and I said that should I resign it will come out later anyway and they will say who was the person in that position.  Who was the Group Treasurer?  Why did they not do something about it and I said I have to take the risk and I have to speak out and so on that basis I decided that I will become a whistle blower and speak out on it.    Yes.  After sending that WhatsApp message I did not receive any response from Treasury at the time.    I had already drawn up a draft letter whistle blowing.  I had done some research about it and I thought now how do I approach it.  Who do I approach within the organisation because you also need to go to your next seniors and for my next best senior would be a, my boss who was at the time Ms Nhantsi and I was reporting about her going ahead with the BNP and not being open to listening what I had to say. Not being open to hold back the RFP or just open the RFP to or start a new RFP but rather go ahead with the BNP and with the fees that they – we were going to pay BNP.  So I drafted my letter.  I made an appointment with Mr Joshua Du Plessis.  We met in his office and I showed him the letter and I said look this is what I would like to disclose.  I just need your guidance. I think you are the next best senior person I can speak to because he was on the Executive Committee.  He was the Executive of strategy at that time and I thought that would be the best.  So we had a discussion and his advice to me was Cynthia do not go the internal route because if you do it goes directly to Board and Board will suspend you immediately.   Correct he did. He mentioned that there was a case prior to mine regarding the Airbus deal.  There was our Head of Operations at the time – Mr Sylvain Bosc who then also reported through the normal internal whistle blowing process within SAA regarding the Airbus deal.  He was then suspended from SAA.    Thank you Chair.  His went on also for more than a year back and forth …    On suspension – back and forth through obviously trying to have a hearing and eventually when they finally had his case he won his case …    And in his case was that SAA had to reemploy him …    But SAA ignored everything.  He then took it back to his lawyers.  They had a follow – follow up hearing on that and he ultimately won his case – ja – with damages.  SAA had to pay his lawyers and he then resigned – left the company and is now working at new airline.    Correct sir.    Indeed Chair.    For a very long time sir.    Thank you Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I received a call from Mr Hugo Du Toit at the time asking me if I was still willing to disclose and have I got the information ready for them and I said yes I do and that is it possible for us to meet somewhere and he agreed and so I did meet with Mr Hugo.  I placed all my documents onto a flash disc. My cover letter stating that this was – was a whistleblowing information that I was giving.  So following the principles of a whistle blower and then listing all the issues in chronological order, listing and attaching all the documents and which I then provided to National Treasury Mr Hugo.    Okay.  So it was based – everything that I had at the time.   Which started with December’s Board Resolution which I found was extremely irregular.  The one we saw with the letter being circulated at Board yesterday which we discussed.  That I was extremely uncomfortable with and that I had already raised to National Treasury at the time and then obviously when the FDC came in.  So that was part of the documents. It was the documents I had on hand as in the first the transaction advisor and then how we changed from transaction advisor to now source the funding.  So basing all that information that I had up to date.  What I did not have was any of these letters regarding BNP because I was not privy to those at the time, thank you Chair.    No.  At the time I also did not have that.  I only had that once I had taken it myself …    In the – in July.    Okay, thanks.    Yes.  I have not then spoken any further to them except when we had our normal meetings but that is us presenting our SAA either financial standing or what is happening on the funding or what is happening on our cash position, correct but nothing related to the whistle blowing issue, thank you.    Okay.  Ms Thuli Mpshe was our Head or General Manager of Human Resources.  At that time we had the – the telephone discussion she was already suspended from SAA.  She acted as CEO for SAA for a time and then she was taken off and Mr Musa Zwane was brought in.  She was then brought back to GM HR and subsequently was suspended and so I kept in contact with Ms Mpshe more because I was concerned about our colleagues that were getting suspended and she was one of the staff I reached out to when I told that I would like to whistle blow. So on this particular day she returned my call and we spoke and I also indicated to her that I intended to whistle blow and I gave her the background to all the information that I had and why my concerns were so relevant and why it needed to be done and she then gave me advice as well and said report to National Treasury. So I said I have done that and she said report to the Public Protector and also then gave me an additional number.  She said OUTA who is normally involved with e-tolls have changed their mandate and looking at any abuse of taxpayers money and she gave me a contact number to – to phone, thank you Chair.    Thank you.  Yes I did that Chair.  So I first started with the Public Protector because I had actually saved a flash disc which I thought I could go over to the offices and – and give it but then I Googled and – to their website and I came up with – it led me to the corruption watch website and in there it said type out your query which I did. I typed out the query which was actually limited.  So it would not – had a limited amount of letters or words you could use.  So I had to reduce it and I was quite brief in saying that I have a matter of urgency which I would like to whistle blow on.  I gave my details my cell number, my email etcetera and I said I am prepared to whistle blow on that and I gave rough essence of the matter being that this is the amount and this is the company SAA etcetera. I did not – I did receive an acknowledgement from the email saying thank you for your inquiry.  We will get back to you.  I did not get anything back from them.  I was waiting and the next step was I then – the telephone number I had from Ms Mpshe was Wayne Duvenage from OUTA.  I called him and told him that I have a matter which I would like to disclose and he said to me well let us set up a meeting and let us set up a meeting for 1 July, thank you Chair.    My concern was that we were going to pay out 225 million for – for obtaining the – the funds.  So yes I was fully aware that SAA needed the funds and at the same time we were paying expensive debt and rolling it out but it should not have cost us 225 million and I felt it is my duty a - as a SAA employee but also as a South African citizen to be mindful of not wasting money of not just being part of the process that everyone was engaging in as we read in newspapers throughout the time that money was just being wasted on unnecessary procurement transactions for little gain and value to the organisation.  So I felt if there was anything that I can do to either stop this or prevent this from happening I was going to do it, thank you Chair.    So we had – I had handed over my – the flash disc with all the information.  There was a team there with Mr Duvenage and his team from OUTA.  They had gone through – they had their laptops.  They had gone through all the information and they asked a lot of questions as we were going through obviously and then asked me if I had seen the BNP file and I said no I had not seen their – their bid document at all. I have not had the privilege yet to see it and I had asked in the initial stages around March already when the client was first approved and then I got so busy because it was our year end and various other key issues that landed on my desk that I needed to take care of that I had it at the back of my mind and I just did not do anything and they asked me would it be possible for you to see if you can get the document and I said yes I will try and get it.  I will ask the Commodity Manager for it, thank you.    So on 4 July I had gone to Mr Silas Matsaudza’s office to ask him if I could get the documents from him.  He was not at his desk and I asked his team around him where is he and they said he is in a meeting.  So I said please let him know I was around.  If he can come see me and I went back to my office.  I continued with my daily work. The next day – couple of hours later I went back to find out if Mr Matsaudza was back at his desk.  He still was not there and I came back to my desk and I went again.  It was towards – I went there a couple of times.  Probably three times already.  By the end of the day I went again.  It was about 4 o’ clock and I thought no he must be back at his desk now and I went there and he still was not at his desk. They said no he has already left.  He has gone home and then I said oh please tell him I need to speak to him urgently because I need to review some documents.  As I turned away from his desk I found these documents all lying on the floor lying on their side and I read the name on one of them on the side there stating BNP the document and I thought here is the document just lying on the floor. So I took the document and I brought it back to my office.  I went through the document. Found some information there which I did not know about and which I knew would strengthen the reason why we should not be dealing with BNP and so I scanned the document to myself.  I went back to the office to put the document back and by then their office was – their office was locked. They have an open plan and so I left the document on my desk.  The following morning I came back to my office.  I then took the document and I went to Mr Silas Matsaudza’s office to tell him look I wanted these documents.  You were not here the whole day yesterday.  So I just wanted you to know that I did take the document and I did scan it and I am not returning it to you and I gave him back his documents, thank you.    Mr Matsaudza to my surprise got very angry and he said how could you take this document without my permission and I said to him Silas you know that this guy is supposed to be sourcing – this company is supposed to be doing sourcing of funds. That is my area in Treasury and I should know about this client.  They have not once come and spoken to me or any of my team and I wanted to know more about the client and he said well he is going to report me to the Procurement Head which is his boss and to the CFO who is my boss – Phumeza Nhantsi.    That is correct.  It took place the next morning yes.    No I was not Chair.    They are the Interim CFO – Ms Phumeza Nhantsi - and the recommender is the Acting CEO – Mr Musa Zwane.    That is correct.  So it states    It states there that   “That BNP Capital has engaged and tasked Grissag AG to find a total of 15 billion from its various long term investments around the globe.” And the fourth one goes. “Grissag AG has incurred the breakage cost in breaking up the investments.”    Yes correct.  That is how I understand it.    There – there should – there are set Board Meetings.  They – the timetable is set out by the Company Secretary’s Office.  So all meetings are scheduled a year ahead.  So you have full calendar of where your dates are.  I agree there will be times where you will need a round robin meeting because of matters of urgency and then Board needs to consider it. This particular one I – I was not there at SAA because I was suspended by then.  So on the 7 t h I am not sure.  I do not think there was a Board Meeting in July and so hence this is the reason for the round robin which they put in but there should be judgment calls made when you – which are urgent enough to put for round robin and which are not. The – the process we went through yesterday when the – to appoint the transaction advisor from a normal mandate as transaction advisor to now source our funds when there was a Board Meeting coming up 27 May and to do it on the 24 t h as a round robin to me did not make sense at all.  So yes the Board does have a policy that we normally for us as – as employees we have to stick with all the deadlines. So we are not allowed to put any documents through to round robin and so I am just surprised that from what I see that they have used it now as a habit and I would take that as noted, thank you Chair.    The 5-5-9 page?   So she responds to Mr Madu Nyoni. “Dear Madu, does this need Board approval?  If so I approve it.  Regards, Ms Dudu Myeni.”    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Thank you.  I told him that – because it was a Tuesday morning and we normally had our weekly meetings with National Treasury and I was on my way to the National Treasury’s Office and I said to him I have to go to a meeting with National Treasury and upon my return we can discuss the matter, thank you Chair.    So I had gone to National Treasury.  At the time I received a – a phone call from Ms Nhantsi and she told me not to attend the meeting.  That I must return to the office at SAA and that I should wait for her.    Yes she did.  She said that he was with her.  He had come to her office and told her that I had given – I had taken those files and she wanted to – and she said do not go to the office – do not go to National Treasury because you are going to be – you are going to give the information to National Treasury and I said I am going for the meeting and – and she said well do not go to the meeting. Stay at your desk and until I get back – she said she will attend the meeting and she will then get back to me once – and meet with me once she has returned, thank you.    Personally I do not think it should have been a problem.  If you look earlier when we were sourcing funds especially on the consolidation National Treasury has been involved in those meetings.  They have looked at each of our bidders that we have had which have been primarily the banks at the time and even in the last one where we had up to December and early January when we included FDC we had National Treasury part of that meeting as observers. So they were fully aware.  Once we have engaged in the funding process with any bank National Treasury gets involved because they provide the – the guarantee and their legal department together with SAA’s legal department and together with the funders legal department work together on drawing up the legal agreement.  So with BNP they would have had to know the company anyway. So if they had to see the documents it was important that they also had to see.  They were going to work them and they had to know who the legal person was.  They had to draw up the guarantee regulations, terms and conditions with BNP.  So they would have had to know that.    Hm.    There should be no basis sir.    Exactly Chair.    Yes for each of our funding transactions.    We need National Treasury.  So …    Strong it is and SAA cannot function without National Treasury.    They are their backbone literally.    There should not basis.    The information should be …    Correct sir.    Correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.    She also told me that if this gets leaked out in the media she will hold me responsible for that and I said to her why would I go to the media.  I have no intention of going to the media and Ms Nhantsi said I will still hold you responsible for it, thank you.    The “this” I would say is the fact that I had taken the BNP documents – their bid documents.  She already knew that I was very much against the appointment at the time of the BNP becoming the source of funds and the phenomenal fee that we were going to pay them and she knew I had objected to that and now that I wanted to see the client and see their profile and to see whether they do have the capacity and the capability to provide the sourcing of funds with SAA. At that time I had no idea even that they were dealing with Chris Hack.  So for me was I needed to satisfy myself that this was a company that was above-board and could do what it said it was going to do and was worth the value that it was going to be paid although I – well I will not say worth it – was for me is how could they still be charging this value and that was what I had at the back of my mind.  So to go to the media I think that is what she was referring to.  That I would leak out the information around BNP to the media.    So yes I thought she would call me to the office around 12 o’ clock but that was midday – nothing.  In fact I did go up to her office and I was told by her secretary that I must wait at my desk.  They will call me.  So I went back to my desk and continued doing my normal daily work and at 4 o’ clock the    Yes.    Yes I did.  I was actually on my way to National Treasury’s Office.  That particular day sir I had taken my car in for a service.  So I was travelling with a colleague – Ms Lindsay Olitzki - we travelled together.  So that is when I received the call and we were almost in Pretoria at the time. So I told Lindsay about it and I said look I better not attend because it would be seen that I am going against her orders and so I sat at a coffee shop while Ms Olitzki attended the National Treasury meeting.  When she finished she came back and we were back in the office by 12, thank you.    So I did not attend, yes.    I came into the office.  It was Ms Nhantsi’s office and in the meeting was Ms Nhantsi together with Mr Manqele.  I did not know him.  I had no idea who he was.  He introduced himself as the new …    Thank you, Manqele.    Manqele.    Manqele.    Thank you Chair.  I entered the office and the two people were sitting there and I greeted and sat down and Ms Nhantsi in front of her had a letter and she pushed it across to me and she said this is your suspension letter and I said to her.  I thought we were going to discuss what happened.  Why I took the documents. Can I explain my side of the story?  Why I needed to see the documents and she said do not explain anything to me.  You have been suspended.  Sign the letter and I said to her do I have any legal recourse and she said oh you can to go the CCMA and you need to find your own legal representative at your own cost. I read through the letter.  It stated that I had obviously – ja – I had been suspended due to taking confidential information that was lying on the floor – confidential information that I was not privy to according to the statement that I have therefore been duly suspended until further investigation.    It states here that   Thank you Chair.  I will start               Thank you Chair, having looked at this term sheet that Ms Nhantsi had signed with Grissag on the transaction for the 15billion my thinking was…(intervention).       Thank you Chair, just looking at the term sheet dated 25 t h of May 2016 which was signed by Ms Nhantsi but the date was the 8 t h of June, the – even inn that point I thought Ms Nhantsi had an opportunity then to probably cancel – I mean stop the whole payment that was going to be made or shall I say the transaction with BNP because one could have then said, you know what here’s Grissag offering a far better rate, change – come out with a new RFP completely, put new critical criteria that would include clients like Grissag who can deal directly with the SAA and rather than going via a middle person and so I thought this would have been ideal opportunity for her to also do that, but I see that opportunity wasn’t taken and that’s what I  wanted to raise, thank you sir.       Thank you Chair, so after receiving  my suspension letter that was probably five minutes past four, I’d gone back to my office, obtained – I’d taken my handbag and walked out, I left everything there even my jacket and had left and because again, having had my  car in for a service I needed a lift back to the place where I had left my car and I went, again to my colleague Lindsay asking is it possible if she can get me to the place where was being serviced and then I showed her the suspension letter and told her about it but as we got into the car by then it was almost four thirty, my phone rang.  It was a number that I could not identify, the person identified themselves as Sabela Skitty? saying that they are a journalist from the Sunday Times and they would like to chat to me and I said why, and he said, well we’ve just heard that your job is in jeopardy and can we please chat, and I just said to him, I’m sorry I cannot talk to you and I switched the phone off.       Okay so for - from my having met without Alta on the first and subsequently on the day that I was suspended, the 5 t h I contacted Alta when I got home that evening and we arranged to meet again the following day, the 6 t h and then on the 7 t h they – in fact met on the 6 t h and they asked me then to meet with their attorneys called Webber Wentzel.  I met with those attorneys, I actually went to their offices in Sandton and gave them the whole background of what’s transpired since my first concerns which started in December with the original Board resolution and they – with the BNP they felt that they could stop this, so they wrote a letter of demand to SAA to stop the transaction going forward with BNP and they sent that on the 7 t h of July.       Yes.       Thank you Chair I will do so.  So it states, “To suspend the performance of it’s payment obligations under any contract arising from the transaction advisor tender and  the funding services decision and number two to suspend the conclusion of any contracts arising from the transaction advisor tender and the funding services decision pending a lawful and a competitive procurement process for the relevant services”, Thank you Chair.       Yes they were launched because SAA did not come back to them or to Webber Wentzel directly on the first part and so I had to work with Webber Wentzel again so that we could put documents through the High Court to interdict, thank you Chair.       Yes I worked with Webber Wentzel, the same information that I’ve presented here and the same information that I gave to National Treasury, the only addition was the BNP files.       That’s correct Chair.       No I did not see it then.       I have, through your – the (indistinct) investigators offices.       That’s correct.       Okay its dealing with – regarding its FSB license and it says there that they’d like to clarify the issue of the FSB license being B Capital received a letter from the FSB dated 12 t h May 2016 indicating its intention to temporarily suspend BnP’s license for a period of three months.  Based on the reason that according to the FAIS Act Section 10, the key individual failed to successfully complete the first level regulatory examinations applicable to the categories and sub-categories for which they are authorised to approve or approved.       That’s correct.       They won that bid.     That’s how I understand it Chair, correct.        Correct, that’s my understanding, thank you.       Correct yes.       Yes after the 13 t h I think there’s still a couple of days waited and then I worked together with Webber Wentzel for the documents to be submitted at the High Court and we were there on the 21 s t of July to have all the signatures done and then Commission of Oath signed and then we had to submit it at the High Court before – I think it was before midday.  So it was submitted and SAA did receive it on the 21 s t through their offices, thank you Chair.       They did – I’m not aware if they did, that I’m not aware of, what I am aware of is that in a press conference they indicated that they have stopped the transaction then, yes.       Correct, thank you.      Yes I can see that, thank you Chair.        Yes I do, thank you.       I identify that as FTC.       Correct yes.       That’s my understanding Chair.       Thank you Char before I go onto the interactions with me, is that they mention the due diligence and we came across it, in also, previous correspondence to National Treasury where it makes reference that a due diligence was done but for the treasury team at SAA we’ve had no sight of that, if there was any due diligence done, so I’d just like that to be noted, thank you.  Okay so to go onto the point regarding myself they obviously state here that I’ve been placed on suspension and that I’ve been suspended for misconduct, that I’ve acted in contravention of SAA’s code of conduct and that the decision to suspend me has nothing to do with the media reports suggesting that I had allegedly objected to SAA’s decision to tender to the award of BnP Capital.       My view is still that it’s incorrect, that I’ve been placing my concerns in many ways whether it was via a sms, a WhatsApp, an email, via telephone calls, via physically having meetings I’ve stated my objections, I’ve listed the issues I had around the whole process leading up to the point of BnP sourcing – becoming the sourcer now of funds and so – and I had already stated I will take this further, so for SAA that it was based on misconduct I find is incorrect.  The other thing is, also that I’ve gone to the media regarding – leaking out information, is also incorrect because I have not done that, thank you.      Exactly Chair, I only received that the end of July, then I had a list of what my misconduct was.        Exactly and agreed Chair.       It had everything to do with BnP sir.       Yes the day I received them there was no prior discussion on it, I received it as is here and I had to sign it, I was called in and told to be in the office at three, collect it, sign it and leave.       Again I met with Ms Nhantsi and then the acting General Manager of HR.       I’ve taken the BnP documents being part of treasury, sourcing funds being one of my main responsibility for SAA, I need to know who I am working with so I do not see it as unauthorised and I did not see it as confidential it’s something that I needed to – it was confidential for me not to pass on to others but for – to do my work I needed to know it, the fact that SAA has taken BnP from transaction advisor to become the sourcer of funds, I needed to know who the company was, so I felt I need to know their profile, their capacity and their capability, thank you Chair.       The insolence relates to an WhatsApp message which I had sent to a colleague who was off sick at the time and the date is even on the WhatsApp which was the public holiday, 16 t h of June, I was at home with a bit of a flu and I hadn’t seen my colleague who had undergone an operation and I wanted to know how she was so I sent a message checking on her, are you well, how’s  your recovery doing and then I updated her – because she was an SAA employee on what was happening currently at SAA.       Before my suspension so this goes back to June, so I was surprised, very surprised that this came in as a point of insolence as a charge against my misconduct.       My suspension happened on the 5 t h of July and the – this…(intervention).       It was the 16 t h of June, the public holiday.      No not at all, this only came up on the date I received it which was the 27 t h of July.        I think I can give you some background because the lady that I had dealt with which is Borjina Kowalski, she also worked in the procurement department and we were – besides working colleagues we were also friends and I think she was approached and she wanted to know, has Cynthia been in contact with you because when I went into the office to take the BnP documents, she sits right at the end, she was there and I greeted her, I didn’t speak to her at all and I just said to her I’m taking documents , she didn’t know what I was taking and so they obviously would have asked her, was Cynthia in the office and she would have said yes and then is Cynthia in communication – I don’t know if she was threatened because for them to have seen that WhatsApp message meant that they had to go through her phone, so whether she had to hand it in and was coerced to give it in or threatened, I have no idea, we have not spoken since so I have no idea.  I was just surprised that in that WhatsApp message, I think we have a copy of it...(intervention).       Thank you so its based in…(intervention).       Thank you Chair, I’m sorry I wasn’t more clear.  In the message I gave a background of what was happening at SAA and then I also stated that our Board continues its unethical behaviour, that was my sentence.       Not that I could – in  there I spoke about – at that time Mr Nico Bezuidenhout had just resigned and left to go to Fast Jet, I listed that, it was all in the media it was nothing that was not in the media, I also stated that the Board had said that they always funded Mango and then they withdrew their statement afterwards and then I ended saying, and our Board continues with it’s unethical behaviour, thank you Chair.    I had no idea what I did there.  Breach of substantive provisions as far as I know that I have conducted myself in the utmost integrity and honestly while I worked at SAA so I was not sure what they were charging against there.  In the detail later they bring out that was going to the media.  Ja thank you.    That charge was that I did not go through the whistle blowing process within SAA.  So they have – we have our own whistle blowing where you could go through either – through phone call or email for whistle blowing and so they are saying it was a breach that I did not use that method.    No you are not obliged.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    Thank you Chair.    Well at the time I was still working with – because when I received I was suspended and at that point in time I was really at a loss because I did not know what my next action would be and how do I approach the CCMA I have never been in this type of situation before.  But during those days following from the 5 t h to receiving the final charges was that I had been working with Webber Wentzel regarding trying to stop the BNP transaction.  So up to the 21 s t I was engaged constantly.  We were con – because it meant reviewing the documents, going and seeking evidence, making sure that everything was a hundred percent before they took it to court.  So on the 21 s t once that was done come the 25 t h I get noted that I must come and collect this and the 27 t h I went in to pick it up and then they said there must be a hearing.  When I went back to [indistinct] to ask how do I approach – in fact I went to Webber Wentzel they said we need to get you a labour lawyer and then we need to see how to now set up a CCMA date and SAA had said that they would have a hearing which we did attend on this date which they had asked us to attend.  But SAA was not ready for the hearing at the time.  Thank you.    So the first the disciplinary hearing should have happened in August which I had appeared there.  I did get a labour lawyer from Webber Wentzel.  They were very kind to offer me a labour lawyer at the time.  And we – SAA was not ready.  There was no-one there we waited and eventually they moved it and said we will set another date.  My legal representative…    It was initially for the disciplinary hearings Sir.    The disciplinary hearing.    At their offices and they were not available, SAA team.  And then subsequent to that my lawyer indicated that we should try and move directly to CCMA rather than wait for a disciplinary hearing. And that meant that we had to take my case to the labour court which we did.  And we then appeared at the labour court on the 22 August which we had a full court hearing.  SAA did have their representative there as well as I did on my side and the court ruled that we could take our – my case to the CCMA.  We then every time thereafter dates were set for the CCMA hearing and every time we came to the CCMA it was moved or postponed by SAA and this happened August – well we met in August at the labour court.  September it moved to October to November.  There was nothing in December and then in January it was moved to February.  February it was moved to March and my lawyer then advised me it is best just to settle this it will continue for another year and you cannot continue with your life.  You need to start getting – continue with what you need to do and focus and he recommended at the time I did not want to – I wanted to go on with my case and he recommended to get peace of mind settle. Let us approach SAA and see if they would settle and I discussed with my family and they agreed and so I went with his recommendation Chair.    I would say in contrary to that because I really wanted to continue with my case.  I definitely saw merit in it and the main thing that my lawyer recommended at the time was he said how many months have passed it has already been since July it is now already into March.  You need to get on with your life and that is when I made the decision yes I will go with his recommendation and so yes we did agree to settle.  It had nothing to do with that there was no merit in my case at all.    It never did Sir.    Correct.    Yes.  Conciliations and Arbitration.    Correct.    Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes I was still being paid.    The disciplinary hearing did not take place at all Sir.    Correct.  We were always prepared.  I always sat three days working with my lawyer before the dates.  When the dates came we were sitting ready.  They would bring in their lawyers. There would be some discussion and then there would be a postponement.    Which it did.    Correct Chair they were both always in agreement.  There was always a discussion.  They would – the two lawyers would get together, discuss.  My lawyer would come back and say this is one of the reasons we cannot continue whatever and we going to post – motivate for a postponement.  So that is what happened.  So the lawyers yes did get together, they did come up with an agreement for whatever reason.  The one time the lawyers were there we were waiting for the SAA representatives they did not come.  And then when there were SAA representatives they want the senior representatives.  They sent the HR person and they sent a risk person to represent SAA but it was not Ms Nhantsi.  It was not Mr Zwane and my lawyer said he was not prepared to continue if the executives of SAA were not present.  So there was always a postponement.    Thank you Chair.  I still feel there was not proper basis.  That is my personal view.    Yes I do.      What was transpiring around SAA at the time if anyone challenged what was being directed from board at the time or certain senior executives that have been placed in positions at the time – if you challenged anything that you knew was not correct they – you were immediately suspended.  Your charges were not given at the time and only afterwards charges were made up and then you were given your charges.  So it was a method at the time I was suspended there were at least four other people suspended.  That is how many during my time and it seemed to have a pattern that you were given documents to sign. So your signature is on it.  You were not part of like I was also given and if you did not question it and challenge it the documents would be approved and – but if you challenged it they would find a way of getting you suspended.  If you were tasked to do something some people were tasked to get rid of certain people in their departments or find issues against them and suspend them.  And if challenged that then they would – I will not say they but senior management would try and find some issues against you to get you suspended.  So it seemed to have been a pattern that was going around in those couple of months.  Thank you Chair.    Is it clear now?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Ja.    No I can only then speak on the two that I do know Mr Sylvain Bosc.    And Ms Thuli Mpshe which I have mentioned previously.    Thank you Chair.    Noted.    Yes.    Correct.    Thank you.    I was aware only because a notification gets sent out to all the staff when anyone leaves the company especially if they are senior and if they are suspended.  So we as staff members got a notification that Mr Dower has been suspended from SAA.  There was some – they also had serious – everyone it was listed in the email that it was also under some misconduct and nothing further stated than that.  So yes I was aware that Mr Dower was suspended.  Thank you.    Yes to basically ja I was 59 at the time and that was one of the reasons my lawyer said should you win your case and go back they will find something else and – or place you in a position where you are unhappy and hence well we came to the position of accepting settlement.  With SAA my settlement was based basically on initially it was supposed to be around 8 months but because I already got paid for March and April they took that away so it turned out to a six month’s settlement and of my salary and I was – and that is all I received together with my normal pension.  SAA does offer travel benefits I did not receive any of the travel benefits and ja and that was basically it.    Yes so because I was 59 turning 60 so we worked on sort of early retirement benefits.  But with the early retirement I should have got travel benefits or other but I got none of those.  So yes it – they factored in the 6 months’ salary that I would have got turning 60.  Yes and then that is what I got paid.  Correct Sir.    Okay thank you.  I just want to make a record change that this date could be incorrect and maybe you can contact …    Yes and just get the correct dates there please.    Correct yes.  It was in 2018 but I may have the dates wrong and I meant to check it up.  So my apologies.  But yes I was called in by CDH at the time which is Cliff Decker Hofmeyr Attorneys who had asked me if I could please come and be a witness and testify on behalf of SAA this time to witness against Ms Nhantsi and Mr Zwane.  The company had placed both of them on suspension after some investigation and they were doing their disciplinary hearing.  And because one of the issues that came up was on the BNP case and they asked me if I could come and testify on the BNP case which I agreed to and which I did.  Thank you.    It included everything that I have had here to date Sir.  So similar process I had to go through the process of from the start covering the whole process from the first board resolution up to BNP being appointed, how it was appointed etcetera up to the point of my suspension.  The reasons why I was suspended together with the documents that I took.  Together with the charges that were related in my suspension.  Thank you Chair.    It was a new board.  Thank you.    It was a new board that were put in place Chair and based on some investigation the board had asked – had placed at the time the two senior executives on suspension and then asked – and had an investigation and then had the subsequent disciplinary hearing.  Thank you.    Ms Stimpel the last question from my side just relates to the criticism that is made of you and Ms Nhantsi’s statement to the commission which we will deal with next week. She has numerous criticisms of your character and the manner in which you engage with her and I would like to give you an opportunity for the record to respond to that.      Are you going to read what she wrote?    I do not have it in front of me.    Thank you Chair.  I do not have it in front of me that so I just want to know which point it was because it goes throughout the document but I actually object to that.  My – I recall in her writing she says I used to storm into her office and swear.  It is actually not in my nature to swear.  I think the word I use often is damn.  If I have to go a bad swearing word and I was always highly respectful of Ms Nhantsi.  I always made an appointment first before I could see her and she had a secretary that would not allow you to enter her office so I found that very untruthful of her to state that in her statement.  I have not done that.  Also there is the statement saying that I have told her she does not belong in that position because she only got for – because of BEE.  I would never have done that and again I say that is untrue.  On the contrary I always felt sorry for Ms Nhantsi.  I saw her first as a mother …    Yes, yes.  Affirmative action.  And – but I always saw her first as a woman and as a mother and I always respect that first in my colleagues.  I see them first as that person who has to take care of others, who has to nurture others and that is how I saw her first.  And I even told my colleagues I wonder why she is following this agenda and pushing the BNP you know and not listening to us and seeking advice from any of us around her.  So yes I disagree with all those.  They all untrue.  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Much appreciated.

HOFMEYR: Chair let me give that to you, it commences…(intervention).   Would you have records of that correspondence? 
PIETER JOHANNES VAN DER MERWE: My name is Pieter Johannes van Der Merwe.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    (duly sworn, states)    Yes, thank you.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes I do Chair.    Yes Chair.  I met with Mr Sergey Pokusaev - whose CV is attached in the document itself – we met at – informally – at a lodge in Zimbabwe.  He was conducting business for the Government at that stage and I stayed there for a period of time and we basically – we came to know each other and I was actually asking him if there is a possibility - because I have learnt that they do funding for Governments – if I can introduce that similarly funding to be done to South African entities at that stage which he then agreed and that is how Grissag was started.    When I actually met him was in 2014 and the registration process was – if I am correct – in 2015.    No Chair.  He previously …    Worked for both the Russian Federation and for the Soviet Union.  He is aged 71 this year.  He worked directly under – under the Minister of Finance with huge experience.  He has visited more than 107 countries in his life.  So he is very familiar with financing and especially international financing law.    He was retired.  He retired in 00 and at that stage he was residing in Amman in Jordan until 2016.    Grissag SA (Pty) Ltd which was registered in South Africa under South African Law and there were just two Directors - Mr Pokusaev and myself.    That has remained until 2019, yes Chair.    I have changed it recently about three months ago.    Yes.    We also have an entity which is based in London which is also Grissag.  It is just AG Limited instead of the (Pty) Ltd.  There we have four Directors.  In South Africa I have – Mr Pokusaev has resigned.  I think it was in February or March and I added a business BEE component and new Director to the Grissag AG (Pty) Ltd South Africa, Chair.    In 2019 Chair.    Correct Chair.    Registered in – in the UK.    With the same name.    We have got different entities Chair.  There …    Correct Chair.    Not entirely because …    The South African entity has got now a BEE component …    With Mr Pokusaev …    Resigning on that …    But in the – in the component in – in the UK itself …    There are four Directors.    I am the only South African on that – as a Director and the other three Directors are Mr Pokusaev who is currently in Russia …    And there are two UK citizens who …    Are Directors there.    Thank you Chair.    Chair as I stated myself and Mr Pokusaev since 2015 until 2019.    Chair no.  If I can just say the reason for that was it was made clear to me that any business that has to be done inside South Africa must be a South African entity.  So for that reason the South African entity was registered Chair.    Yes Chair.  During 2015 - I think the company was registered in February or March 2015 – I basically then went to various departments and even our neighbouring countries like Lesotho and Swaziland and because I am residing in the Free State Province I also went to Bloemfontein and I met up with the FDC. My biggest market for – was at that stage – was for housing.  We really – I tried to get a model on-board where we can do the gap housing – for instance – where Grissag then can be part of doing the funding as - as such.  So I then met up with the FDC and I wrote them a proposal. At that stage they explained to me that they are more interested in buying certain buildings which they rent out for – for different reasons and in the documentation there – there is a letter which – which can confirm and the date that we were talking about a possibility of funding this house – actually the buildings as – as such which at that stage was a priority for the FDC, thank you Chair.    Yes Chair I confirm that is the correspondence that I received from the FDC.    Chair for Grissag to do funding in any country for any project as such we see ourselves not as investors.  They are a funding entity and it is private capital that they use.  So when they engage in – in any project they want to make 100 percent certain that they will be repaid. So they would insist on having a bankable guarantee which will be the surety for the payback of any amount that is needed for a specific project as such, thank you Chair.    With the FDC itself they corresponded to me to say that it is very difficult because they need to get a guarantee from Treasury and at that stage such guarantees are not available to be issued and I even asked them do they have a current – a book with enough assets where they can issue a guarantee against that and the reply that I got was that it was not doable for them to issue a guarantee. They were more hoping that we would use the new asset that was supposed to be bought as – as a payment guarantee should they not pay back from the – the funder’s perspective was they do not want to end up with a lot of property in foreign countries.  Thank you Chair.    Chair I was contacted by Mr Leon Etzebeth who is an attorney in Nigel and he has got a representative or somebody renting office space from him.  I am not 0 percent certain how the relationship works – a Mr Rambal.  If I am – if I am correct with the pronunciation of that and they asked me if Grissag would be interested in funding SAA who wanted to do debt consolidation.  At that stage the amount was R14 billion.    Chair they did not directly tell me that they have had some engagement with a specific person.  They just said to me at that stage - and that was my understanding - that there was a tender that was out for funding SAA for this 14 billion and they made it very clear to me that as Grissag has not been registered as an FSP provider at that stage and we did not have any BEE component that we cannot basically on our own tender on this specific tender and I said that we do not have a problem we can do a JV if it is beneficial for both the parties, thank you Chair.    Chair no.  I cannot recall a direct time or a date that he disclosed how we met but as I said in – from – because this is August of this year – I started with market as early as March when the company was registered.  So it could have come from - from any source at that – at that stage.  So I – I honestly cannot say it was - I was introduced by a specific person Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  The agreement was definitely signed.  I just could not find the copy at that stage because it happened a few years back and the transaction went nowhere.  So I did not find it as a necessity to keep it and after I have been contacted by the – the Commission I found whatever documents I had and I prepared that.  So this arrangement as in this addendum that is the arrangements that we discussed and that is what we agreed upon, thank you Chair.    That is correct, ja.    Yes Chair.    Chair that is the interest rate that S - SAA would pay back the loan when the money was paid out.  So that is a – a fixed interest rate that we charge.  It is 4.5 percent in this specific arrangement.    Chair that is correct.  The 4.5 was the funding that was made available but in this specific – specific case to Seacrest itself and Seacrest would put a certain percentage which they would negotiate for their own benefit.  That percentage was never discussed with me or disclosed to me.  Thank you Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    The reason for that was because they were – I was using the BEE component which was compulsory as – as it was explained to me and for the fact that we would be making use of an FSP licence which I did not have at that point in time.  So that will be their contribution and that is why they sought some sort of relief in getting some payment but what that payment amount was I – I – that was never discussed with me.    Chair that is correct.  That is normally how we conduct the contracts.    But they insisted on doing it in this way.    So this contract was not drafted by myself.    It was – it was drafted by Seacrest Investments.    That is correct Chair.  I – I was not aware what percentage …    They put forward …    Towards SAA for funding.    That is correct.   Chair that is electronic signature of Mr Pokusaev.    That is correct Chair.    The signing was only done by Ms Nhantsi and I actually got an original of this document with me.    That is correct Chair.    I sent this document - even Chair when you look at the previous one of 2 June which is basically the same it has got the same signature on that as well.  So I – I made this document available with the electronic signature and then I wanted each page – page to stamped and signed by the – then the Acting CFO of SAA.    No Chair.    No.    Yes.  All documentation is sent to him for approval …    And then I add on then only after he has approved a specific project or a specific document to be issued.    Correct and he put the signature on that and send it back to me.    Correct.    No Chair.  The term sheet …    Is not the main document for us.    The – the document is the contract that needed to follow …    And – and that – that contract at that stage would have been signed by – by Mr Pokusaev if he would fly in.  Just for the record Mr Pokusaev has travelled about six times to South Africa …   Where – where certain projects were supposed to be finalised …    And it was not finalised.    So – so the moment that SAA went ahead and the – the contract was available for signing as such then he would have flown in because even our banks require only original documents no copies of – of that.  Needs to present it to the – to the banks as well for their due diligence purposes Chair.    No I did not sign it Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I just initialled it.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair my – my main purpose was getting an original signature and a stamp from …    The authorised person at SAA because this had been dodged all the time to us.  We never get any documentation where there was any commitment even with terms and conditions addressed to us directly …    And the previous term sheet it was signed and sent to us with …    This is open for discussion and it is non-binding …    And so that was the – the reply that that is not acceptable.  We need something that is – that is at least acceptable and binding and we then can formulae the finance contract itself and move on with that Chair.    That is correct, ja.    Yes Chair.    That is correct.    I cannot recall but it could be a few days but I - I really cannot recall what that timeframe was Chair.    That is correct Chair.    No.  I travelled the same day and I returned the same day.  I hardly ever spend time in - in Gauteng.  I always arrange my meetings coming up early in the morning and going back the same day.    That is correct Chair.    BNP Capital Chair.   That should have been communicated I think by email and like I have said previously I lost of data on - on my emails.  It cleans itself after a certain time.  So if – if it was not printed then I would not have a copy of – of the specific document.    That is correct.    No Chair.   That is correct Chair completion after agreement yes.    Chair as this was the third attempt of doing the funding I once again went back to the funders.  I have asked them for a better rate and this is the rate that was approved by them.    That is correct.    The 1 percent, yes Chair.    No that is incorrect Chair.    As the 1 percent is a once off payment as they receive the money and it – it has been calculated over the 15 year period.  So should you do that then it is like 0.1 or zero point - even less than that – 0.075 percent.    As an interest rate.  So it is not correct to say it is 4.5.  It is rather like 3.6.    The 1 percent fee would be paid …    Sorry Chair.  The 1 percent fee was to be distributed by – for the offices – for Grissag in South Africa 0.5 and 0.5 I would pay to BNP Capital for their part of using their FSP licence and their BEE component.  That was arranged between us.   The 1 percent – the arrangement with Grissag and BNP Capital is to split it 50/50.  0.5 percent paid towards them and 0.5 percent towards Grissag.    That is correct ja.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is an arrangement what – what Grissag has with BNP.  It is not an arrangement that we have with SAA Chair.    That is correct.    I am totally unaware of that Chair.  I have only read that in the media and that came as a shock to me because the fact that BNP did not find me.  I was already – Grissag was already known to various companies at that stage.  So it is definitely not a finder’s fee.  So I am totally unaware of that payment.  I can put that on record Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair no.    Chair we came to agree the terms once I had been informed that BNP Capital has been appointed as a transaction advisor which I thought at the time was also their job to look for funders itself and obviously they asked me what their share is.    I would – Chair, I would say it can be either in April or May.  I am not certain about the specific time at that stage.    Very comfortable yes Chair. 
MR PIETER JOHANNES VAN DER MERWE:    Yes Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      Chair, no I’ve never seen this document.    Yes Chair I acknowledge that.        Chair I wouldn’t have an answer to that but this document clearly states 15billion and I was approached initially for 14billion so there’s definitely two different amounts that we’re talking about so I cannot verify to say that perhaps there was additional documents when they starting engaging with the 14billion but according to my records the initial amount was 14billion and it was then increased to 15billion, this document shows 15billion.      Not at all Chair.      Chair I was not concerned about that because it’s a common practice in the new South Africa that one of the biggest requirements is indeed have BBB representation, so no I did not question this.      Yes Chair I do.      Yes I was keen to win the tender.      Yes I definitely think so.      That’s correct Chair but anyway if I look at what they proposed it was still beyond any of the competition in the market at that stage.      Even if they should add a 0.5 or a 1% towards that it would still be lower than what the repo rate in South Africa, at that stage was Chair.      That is correct Chair.      No I did not have a certainty I just thought that it would be important for them to be - to come in below a rate otherwise it wouldn’t make any business sense they can – SAA can just go to a commercial bank then Chair.    That’s correct Chair.        That is correct Chair.      Very early in March already of 2015 we had meetings in Lesotho with the government, in Swaziland for instance and various Municipalities which I thought were in the need of funding for projects Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      No I was contacting them Chair.      There was no explanation given Chair, it was just the funding has gone up from 14 to 15 as some months has lapsed and they did not secure funding so the need for more money was getting a bigger loan at that stage Chair.      That is correct Chair.      Chair yes I do have enough knowledge, international, the mark-up for an amount this high is not more than 0.5%.      Chair definitely yes.     Not at that stage but we must remember that only term sheets and agreements was issue so the final documents from SAA was not approved, so at that stage no, the answer is no I did not make any effort to find out, it was not disclosed to me, it was, like privileged information Chair.        SeaCrest – Chair SeaCrest did ask for proof of funds which I told them at that stage it’s not even an option because the process that is done through the international banks that we work through is that you need to have a signed agreement and they then will first get approval from their central bank for such a transaction to take place and only after that, we are allowed to issue proof of funds, definitely not up front, they see it s just a fact seeking mission Chair.      Chair no.      Grissag Chair, view will be that an agreement will be drafted where it would be approved with the certain measures put in place, the proof of funds and the source of funds and the necessary due diligence that they need to be done but there needs to be an agreement so if all that points have been met SAA cannot walk away from the transaction at that stage.  So that is our attitude towards funding any entity Chair.      Chair 100% we would be - would have been satisfied with that.      Chair I actually engaged with the FDC before I engaged with SeaCrest Capital and my main focus was housing development and we had numerous of meetings with the same criteria, the FDC should be in a position to issue a bankable guarantee which is acceptable to the funder for the funds to be released as such and there is documentation stating some of the correspondence that relates to that and it was a request from my side, from Grissag’s side that I asked them, is there a possibility that we can fund SAA through the FDC and not through SeaCrest as the transaction wasn’t going anywhere and the answer at that stage was, they will look into that Chair.      If I recall Chair, end of November beginning of December I should say.      Of 2015, correct.     Chair I do not have the answer to that question, I do not know what the reason for that was, if it was standard practice, so I do not know what’s the answer to that question.       That was specially in the context of the SAA funding because with housing you can approach it differently.      No I did not establish but they told me that the do have Chair.      Chair no, I did not know what the rules and regulations for that was and that’s why I put the enquiry for them to find out if it was possible Chair.      The FDC came back to me in a short period of time, it was weeks, definitely not months and they said no, one State entity cannot finance another State entity and I accepted that Chair.      That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct.        Chair yes it’s actually common practice for Grissag to issue a standard term sheet, so I did send an email, there’s a copy in my affidavit with the basic terms and conditions and interest rate regarding funding the SAA for the same amount of 15billion rand.      That’s correct, it’s got the content of the term sheets Chair.      It’s a letter addressed to the FDC with the terms and conditions as set out in a standard term sheet that Grissag is used Chair.      I was the author of that letter Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      This is a later version Chair, so this was issued in December and I had numerous discussions with the funders itself and I negotiated a better rate as they were quite eager to go ahead with the funding.      Mr Shepherd Moyo at that stage was the CFO of the FDC.      Yes Chair I see.      No Chair I’m a family man, at that stage I was on holiday so I was not conducting business definitely on the 24 t h of December Chair.      Yes Chair you’re reading this…(intervention).      No Chair.      That is possible that they could have copied that logo Chair.      Chair not in this specific term sheet.      Chair that’s possible because the rates and the terms and conditions are standard to what was issued in all of the term sheets, there was little variations, I think dealing with the SAA in total, I do not have copies of everything, but there must have been circulated, up to 10 versions of the different type of term sheets for basically the same amount and some of the periods differ fro 10 to 15 to 20 yes but the information that they have submitted here is, according to the standard that we have agreed upon.      That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.    Chair not less than 90% certain.    That is correct.    Definitely not Chair.     After doing some research on the documents itself I would say it can be as early as February not later than March of 2016.    Chair I am a hundred percent positive that is what was conveyed to me.    That is correct Chair.    I had a telephone call and later on there was emails exchanged to me Chair.    I cannot answer the question that how do they know about it but yes it frequently happened that people on a weekly basis do contact us about funding for different projects.  So I do not put a lot of effort in in finding how they did come across our contact details and the subject about SAA has been going on for almost a year about the funding so to Grissag it is common knowledge and it was not resolved at that stage as well.    I did now Chair that by January that Seacrest was not in the run for the funding anymore.    I had been told that they did not – they were not successful for this specific tender Chair.    That is a fair summary Chiar.    No Chair not at all.    Chair through the media.  I was made aware through the media that a tender was published.    That is correct Chair.    Chair no I never had a meeting in person with anybody from BNP.  I also did not visit their offices I am unaware of their offices and they certainly did not visit my offices Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Definitely more than one person Chair.    I cannot recall the names of the people Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair at this stage being my third attempt I was not very confident that this party would also be successful so I did not put a lot of effort and travelling in to discuss so the relevant documents that is why I requested documentation to be sent to me so that we can move forward on that.    That is correct Chair.    They informed me that they do have a FSP licence Chair.    Chair because the company was newly formed and the funders of this are all based overseas.  They are not based in South Africa.      So I was establishing to get the first big transaction.    Finalised and then obviously that would follow after that.    Chair that is correct and…    Chair appreciate it.  By now I have learnt that Chair.    Chair that is a process. Our main business and where we are currently oppering – operating is in Africa and we do not use the South African entity for that.  We use the overseas entity for that and the reason for the South African entity even being registered was the fact that I was told that you need to register entity in South Africa otherwise if there was a possibility that engagements should have been done directly abroad then there would not have even been a South African entity that was registered.   Thank you.    That is correct Chair it is not based in South Africa.    That started off Chair with BN – with Seacrest Investments and once that rules has been laid out to me being BBBEE compliant and having a FSP licence and a FSP licence you do not just require it in one month’s time there is a procedure I presume that you have to do.  Then I presume this is the rules and regulations to which I must apply to Chair.    Chair that I cannot recall because that establishment was done – the registering I think it was in March of 2015 we can check it from the registrar so I cannot recall at this specific date if I already had meetings with Eskom at that stage because I did have a meeting with them and I also had some other meetings as well with some of the municipalities.  So in one of those interactions that topic came to my – to be placed before us and that is why the decision was made to register a locally company.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I do accept that – to that and I would like to comment.  I did make various attempts to contact SAA directly and there was no response from their side so they had the opportunity to interact with us directly.  So there is only so much that I can do to start interaction Chair.    Chair in the beginning of February – ag in the beginning of 2015 I started interacting and so I even wrote letters to the housing Minister at that stage.  I wrote a letter to Mr – the Minister at that stage Ms Lynne Brown which was the Enterprise Minister.  I did not even get a response from their offices Chair.    I cannot recall the exact date on that Chair but it was definitely before my engagement with Seacrest at that time Chair.    That is fair to say yes Chair. ADV KATE    Chair perhaps I would need to go through archives but as this has happened almost four years ago I do not keep records that – of matters that did not materialise that timie.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    No Chair I do not have the knowledge what the difference was between an advisory and the sourcing of funds.  I honestly believed that that was in the scope of their appointment.  So I was not aware at the point of time that there was a difference Chair.    Chair my response was that proof of funds cannot be done up front and we first need at least a term sheet signed that commits SAA to the terms and conditions and after that an agreement must be signed – a formal agreement which we call a funding agreement and the steps inside that funding agreement states exactly what happens at what specific time.  We do verification by the Swift system and in that document all the banking details are put – available so that – and the banking officers and so forth.  So that was what was still need to follow before the proof of funds will actually have been done at that stage Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    On the 8 June I travelled to SAA’s head offices at the airport.  I – it was my first and my only visit ever to SAA’s offices.  I was shown to a boardroom.  There were a few people seated at that boardroom and Ms Nhantsi came in.  She signed the term sheet before me and left.  That total time spent there was not more than ten minutes and then I left.    It was set up by BNP Capital Chair.    Chair it is for signing the term sheet itself.    I do not want to jump ahead about questions but there was another term sheet – the same term sheet that was being signed by Ms Nhantsi prior to that and it – and that term sheet had – it basically meant nothing.  It was non-binding and such and I said to them I cannot accept this.    It needs to be a binding term sheet and she needs to sign that I know I have got an original with me.    So [indistinct].    Both those term sheets are in the affidavit Chair.    Chair that is correct I see it is dated the 2 June by Ms Nhantsi that is correct.    That is correct.  That is the reason why it was not acceptable to me.    I cannot remember the date but obviously I presume it was on the same date because normally they moved with this very fast.  So it should be the 2 n d or the 3 r d June as I see the signature is the 2 n d June.    My attitude is that this is not acceptable to Grissag as we need a binding term sheet to move forward.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      No chair I was not, I was never informed directly by SAA or any of their officials.     Chair this initial statement when I was contacted by the investigators itself I sit down and I drafted it without doing a lot of attention on dates as such, I just explained in this affidavit, it’s quite short, what happened without looking at specific documentation and only  afterwards I’m getting more information from the investigators itself I was able to then construct and sign a new affidavit, with the necessary documents that can prove what happened at what specific date, what was clear at that point in time.     That’s correct Chair, that was human error on my part.      That’s correct.      That is correct ja.      Yes the date on February must be wrong, because after dealing with the FDC which was at this stage definitely told – I was told at that stage it was a no-go, the only entity that I then engaged with was BnP Capital Chair.    No the paragraph is wrong, I simply needed to say that I was informed by Seacrest that in participating I need to be BEE compliant, to participate in a tender as we previously discussed it Chair.      No that is not correct.    It’s not correct that SAA did not contact me, I did not have any engagement with SAA.    Chair the bottom line is I was like I stated earlier I did try to communicate with them, there was no communication back and the only means of community was via intermediate and that is the facts Chair.      That’s correct it’s to Grissag.     That’s correct yes.      That’s correct Chair.    Sorry just repeat that?     Not that I’m aware of at this point in time Chair.      Chair Mr Pokusaev was in the country at that point in time and we were at Standard Bank opening a bank account and we went for coffee, and I also had a meeting with Mr Shepherd Moyo at that specific day, sometimes we met with the Board which they have meetings near the Gautrain Station and as we were just drinking coffee at that stage Mr Moyo stood up and he went to greet a lady that entered and then he came back and he said to us that this is the new acting CFO of SAA, Ms Nhantsi, and then he introduced us, myself and Mr Pokusaev to her, then we carried on with our own business.  That was the only interaction I had directly with Ms Nhantsi except for the day with my visit to the SAA building where the term sheet was signed by her in person in front of me Chair.      My apologies Chair, Ms Phumela Nhantsi.      Ja, I know the spelling..     Nha that’s correct ja.      I can just perhaps just add Mr Moyo at that stage said that he and Ms Nhantsi has previously studied somewhere, but they were acquaintances of somewhere in the past.  So that’s the only information I had Chair.      Chair that is correct.     Chair it is possible, I cannot recall that he was introduced to me as in my affidavit, especially as an employee of Nedbank because it’s competition to us, so definitely I was not aware if I had an interactions with Mr Mugadi Chair.     Chair I have never seen this letter, letters, before it was introduced to me by the Commission itself.      That is correct Chair.     I hundred hundred percent state place on record I have never seen these documents before it was introduced by the Commission to me.    I see that Chair.    Ten, not at all.    No Chair, none of that is applicable to Grissag.    Definitely not Chair.    Chair definitely not, our funders has never been disclosed to anybody.    So it’s definitely not Chinese and it’s definitely not anybody of Abu Dhabi and definitely not Brazilian, but there is some of them that is in the European Union.    No Chair.    Definitely not Chair.    Chair Grissag has got no cancellation fee of any of their documents whatsoever and I think throughout the evidence it is very clear that there’s no insertion of any cancellation fee whatsoever.    Definitely not Chair.    Yes Chair.    That’s correct, it was signed on the 8 t h of June.    That’s correct, but in addition to a signed contract, that first meeting to happen.    That is correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.    That’s totally incorrect Chair.    There’s no breakage costs Chair.    No, none whatsoever Chair.    Chair no, there is only at that point in time there’s only two directors, myself and Mr P Pokusaev.     That’s correct Chair.    Chair no, I was present in South Africa, I did not travel anywhere.    Chair definitely not.    I would definitely have known because I manage his itinerary for all his travel and anyway the way that the letter has been constructed is this is not our procedure how it works, because this letter is explaining we are now only looking for funds and ...(intervention)     We do not operate like that, we first get approval from funders and with that mandate we approach our clients, so there’s no necessity even after the contract would have been signed that we will fly around seeking money suddenly from different investors at any point of time.    Chair again 100% not true.    Chair no money was sought to be paid, there is not in any of our documentation any cancellation fee or even fees that needs to be paid as cancellation of a specific contract, so in all three that instances there was no intention from Grissag to sought any financial relief from BnP Capital.    Chair I put on record that is totally false.    Chair nobody consulted with me about any negotiations with SAA for paying any fees for any amount.    Chair it is definitely false because to do that you need to have a contract in place and there is not existence of such a contract.    That’s totally false.    Chair I – that name was, it originates out of Switzerland, it was a name chosen by Mr Pokusaev so ...(intervention)     I don’t know if it’s got some Russian name ...(intervention)     Or connotation as such, can I just add about the Guptas as such?    The fact that my surname is van der Merwe, I have been confronted by various individuals because apparently the Guptas attorney of law is Van der Merwe and I believe even his brother has got the same first name as myself so these questions have been put to me various times and I can say on record that we are not even remotely related whatsoever.    Thank you Chair. 
MR ANDRE VON METZINGER:    Thank you Chair, Andre Von Metzinger as I introduced myself earlier from MVM attorneys under instruction from Mr van der Merwe and Grissag, thank you.
