CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning Mr Zuma.    Good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    Yes.  Okay.  I think Mr Zuma wishes to say something.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.   Yes.    Hm.    Thank you.  Before I say anything I wonder whether Mr Sikhakhane wants to say anything, nothing.  Okay, okay alright.  Ordinarily in response to what you have just told me Mr Zuma with regard to other witnesses I would urge the commission to take necessary steps to ensure that a witness who is giving evidence before the commission gets all the protection that they can give.   What I do not know is whether by virtue of your position you do not already have maximum protection.  So I do not know whether thereis anything beyond what you – the protection you get that the commission can add.  I think maybe your legal team could be in touch with the commission’s legal team because if there is anything that the commission can do it should be done.   I was simply saying it may well be that the protection that you have is far greater than whatever protection the commission could hope to provide.  But having said that I just want to say this that it is totally unacceptable for anybody in our society to want to use violence, intimidation and all kinds of illegal means when they are unhappy about anybody because our legal system is such that people can go to courts,can go to the police if they have complaints against other people.  It is totally unacceptable that any threats should be made to anybody and more so when those threats are made to or concerning a person who is giving evidence before this commission.  I said similar things some time ago when certain threats were made against a certain witness who gave evidence here.  I say the same thing today.  It is unacceptable.   People who come to the commission to give evidence and help the commission to understand matters that it is investigating should not be threatened, should not be intimidated.  Their families should not be threatened or intimidated or harmed in any way and all good people in this country must take a stand against the use of violence and intimidation.   I am happy that whatever threats have been made have not made Mr Zuma to change his mind about giving evidence.  He is stillgoing to continue and give evidence before this commission but it will be important that all steps be taken by relevant authorities to make sure that the threats he has reported are properly investigated and that they are not carried out.   I also want to address the threat against his counsel.  One of the traditions of the bar is that Advocates represent anyone and everyone who needs legal representation and when lawyers represent their clients they are just doing their job.  And they should not in any way be threatened or intimidated or be discouraged from representing whoever they choose to represent.  Everybody deserves to berepresented by a lawyer when they are in proceedings, in legal proceedings and it is important that as far as possible everyone should get the lawyer of their choice. So any threats that have been made against Mr Zuma’s counsel or any lawyer is totally unacceptable because in this commission I want every lawyer to feel free to come and represent their clients. I would ask that whatever assistance the legal team of the commission can provide if Mr Zuma’s counsel needs any arrangements to be made for his protection that everything be done to assist in that regard. I do not want a situation where a lawyer is supposed to come and represent somebody in this commission is no longer able to come and represent them because of threats. So I thought I would just make those remarks and I hopeeverything will be taken care of. But before we proceed I had meant to just make one remark and that is that I thought that the proceedings yesterday were characterised by respect, courtesy and cooperation from all sides.  From the commission’s legal team, the former President’s legal team, the former President as well as everybody who was attending and I thought I must just acknowledge that.  Indeed even with regard to those who were outside the venue I did not get any reports of incidents.  The reports I got seemed to suggest that there was a high level of discipline and I hope that today and in the days to come this week everything canproceed in that way. Thank you.  Mr Zuma I thought I must also say should a need arise as it happened yesterday to wash hands please feel free to indicate.    Otherwise the next break will be quarter past eleven for tea.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Hm.    Thank you.  Thank you.    We are still using Exhibit GG[a]?    Exhibit..    Exhibit GG[a].    Did we enter these exhibits into the record yesterday?    Did we enter these exhibits into the record yesterday?    Oh.    To the extent that we might not have done so.  The lever arch file which contains Mr Zuma’s statement is to be marked Exhibit GG[a] and the other lever arch file which has got certainannexures in addition to the annexures that are in Exhibit GG[a] will be marked Exhibit GG[b].  Thank you.    No actually I think what I said was wrong.  Because it does not contain his statement.    I am going to correct what I said in regard to the lever arch file that will marked Exhibit GG[a].  It does not contain anystatement by Mr Zuma but it contains statements of certain witnesses and the first statement on the top is that of Mr Themba Mveli James Maseko and the other lever arch file Exhibit GG[b] contains other statements including that of Ms Barbara Hogan.  That one of Ms Barbara Hogan is one on top on the other lever arch file.  Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius before we do that.  Mr Zuma I just want to clarify something that your counsel mentioned yesterday.  In terms of your ability to read the words in the documents I think he was expressing a concern that they may be too small.    Are you able to read it is fine?    They are small.    Yes.    They are small.    Maybe – maybe you might as far as you can Mr Pretorius read to him what needs to – what is necessary for your question and if that is not enough for him to get the context we can take it from there.   Bigger – ja okay, alright, thank you.    I think what he may be seeking Mr Zuma is to establish whether from your side when you were speaking to the Gupta’s about this project you were speaking to them just as a private citizen or as President of the ANC because I think it is clear from whatyou have said you were not speaking as President of the country?    When you spoke to the Gupta’s.    About the New Age Project.    Ja I think what Mr Pretorius is trying to establish is whether from your side you were speaking to the Gupta’s about this project in your personal capacity.    Or in your capacity as President of the ANC because you have made it clear it was not in your capacity as President of the country.  Is that correct?    Yes.    From a personal capacity.    Yes thank you.    Maybe one could – could put it this way.    From what has been – from what Mr Maseko has said in his statement if what he says is true it appears that Mr Ajay Gupta believed that if Mr Maseko did not cooperate he could get Mr – Mr Maseko’s seniors to “sort him out” to use that word.  Maybe let us look at – let us start with who Mr Maseko’s seniors would have been in – in Government.  Would it – would it have been the Minister in the Presidency?  Is – is – would I be correct?    It would be correct?    And above the Minister it would be the President?    Yes.  Is there anything you know which would have made Mr Ajay Gupta if what Mr Maseko is saying is true which would have made him believe that if Mr Maseko did not do what he wanted him to do he could talk to Mr Maseko’s seniors to “sort him out”?  Is there anything you know on the basis of which Mr Ajay Gupta could really say that? Maybe before that if what Mr Maseko says Mr Ajay Gupta said to him …    Namely I will speak to your seniors to “sort you out”and bearing in mind that you have indicated that Mr Maseko’s seniors would have been the Minister in the Presidency and above the Minister it would be the President?    If what Mr Maseko says Mr Ajay said is true would you agree that then Mr Ajay Gupta would have been abusing whatever relationship or friendship he may have had with Mr Maseko’s seniors in order to try and get Government work?    But are you not able to say we do not know Mr Ajay Gupta’s version.  It might be different from Mr Maseko’s version …    But that is why I say if what Mr Maseko is true.    Are you not able to say if what Mr Maseko says was said by Mr Ajay Gupta is true that would have been improper?   Are you able to say that?    Okay.    Okay.    Just repeat the question I think.    Well, huh-uh.  Just finish before I say something.   Well I think we – the – the time that we are talking about when Mr Maseko was moved from the position of CEO of GCIS …    And he was moved to be Director General of the Department of Public Service and Administration …    Was around 2011 end of January or thereabout.    Have you got a recollection of how that happened?  Have you got - have you got the picture of how that happened?   That specific incident of his whether one can call it removal from …    GCIS to Public Service and Administration or a transfer from GCIS to Public Service Administration – Public Service and Administration.  Do you – do you recall how that occurred?  Obviously having read Mr Maseko’s statement and understanding what his version is.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Public Service and Administration.    Hm.    Hm.  When you read Mr Maseko’s statement did yousee what he says happened with regard to that – with regard to his removal?  He says he was told by Minister Chabane …    That you had called from outside of the country because you were outside of the country at the time.    He says he was told by Minister Chabane that you had called and you had said that he must be redeployed.  That is Mr Maseko or his services must be terminated and he says Mr Chabane was not happy with this but he had to carry it out and he said to himbecause I know you are a good – I think civil servant he said – I will try and make a plan for you and Mr Maseko says he – he did not want – Mr Chabane did not want to so to speak throw him into the street. So I think what Mr Pretorius is asking is that context – I am just providing a fuller context.    Is whether you have any recollection of you having asked Mr Chabane to redeploy him.  In other words according to Mr Maseko from what he was told by Mr Chabane the idea that he should be moved from GCIS came from the President and not from Minister Chabane.  Are you able to throw any light?    Yes.    Yes last week.    Yes.    Yes, thank you.  Mr (intervenes).    Oh I am sorry.    Yes I am sorry.   Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Thank you.    Yes.    I will hear what Mr Pretorius has to say.  I had a little bit of concern in relation to questions that related to the meeting that Mr Maseko had with the Guptas which obviously Mr Zuma did not attendbut with regard to the removal or transfer of – of Mr Maseko from GCIS to – to the Department of Public Service and Administration my recollection is that his statement and/or evidence suggested that he was removed from his position as CEO of GCIS because he did not cooperate with the Guptas and that he was told that by the Minister – Minister Chabane that that was at the instance of the former President. That is my – my recollection of what he said.  Of course if one talks about a phone call that happened many years ago some calls one might recall because of their distinct nature or significance but someone would not recall.  Sometimes one might not even recall a call that happened a few months ago but my understanding of Mr Maseko’s evidence suggested that the Guptas were unhappy that he did not cooperate with them and that he was removed when there were no grounds to remove him and that that was at the instance based on what he was told he said by Minister Chabane of the former President but letme hear what Mr …    Yes?    Well you see when you deal with a case in litigation in court it is easy to say when you are for one side the other side must make out its case, because that is litigation.  Where it is an inquiry a person make come and say this is what I know, I am placing before the Commission what I know and what happened and the Commission must inquire whether that may have anything to do with any impropriety, so while on the one hand there must be fairness, there can be no doubt about that, but one also needs to understand that unlike in litigation where one is able to say well that party must make its case clear in the pleadings and in the affidavits, in an inquiry you have a situation where people say I am only here to say what I know, what you make of that in terms of your inquiry whether you think it is relevant or irrelevant but this is what I am here to say, so one has got to look at all of that.   Yes.    No, no, no.    Yes.    Let me hear Mr Pretorius.   Thank you.    Yes you would like to respond?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  I think what I would like to do isthat we take the tea break and at the end of the tea break may I see counsel on both sides in my temporary chambers here, can I see both counsel on both sides and just to try and see if we may at least achieve a common understanding as to where the concerns are and whether there is a way of resolving them in terms of the way forward without me having to make any ruling.    Yes.  We will take the tea adjournment now, it is about twenty two minutes past eleven, I think let us aim to resume at twelve to give ourselves time for tea and time for the meeting that Imust have with counsel on both sides.      We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    My meeting with counsel on both sides took longer than I had anticipated that is why we were not able to resume at twelve.  However I am happy to say that the meeting that I have had with both – with counsel from both sides has been a very constructive and fruitful meeting.  The discussion that I had with counsel from both sides has resulted in an agreement that I do not need to make any ruling on the concerns or objections that had been raised.   A way has been found to try and minimise any prospects of any feeling of unfairness.  Counsel for the former President have indicatedthat they do not wish to be seen as if they are obstructive by rising all the – very often and raising objections whenever there might be something that they are concerned about.   They have said that they wish Mr Pretorius to be able to ask questions without having to look over his shoulders whether they are rising to object or not.  It has been agreed that because they do not intend to do that I will try and be more ready to intervene in case I think there is unfairness in any question.  But it has been agreed that we can proceed we do not – I do not need to make a ruling. Mr Pretorius from his side will try and find a way to putquestions in a manner that will take account of any concerns that he may think may create unfairness.   So we are going to proceed and Mr Zuma’s counsel have indicated that they will really raise an objection if it is something that is quite serious but otherwise they intend to try and allow the proceedings to flow as much as possible.  So we will proceed on that basis and I just wish to thank counsel from both sides for their constructive approach to resolving the issue that we have resolved.  Thank you very much.    Hm.    And maybe – maybe before that.  And is it something you have quite a clear recollection of that you – you did not cause him to be shifted.  It would have been a request from his Minister?    Okay.      Well would that not be a Parliamentary issue in the National Assembly?    Yes no what I am saying is the action…    Ja, ja which would not involve the Presidency.    Well should you not just give him more details.  I think it was said it was a state visit but the way you put it it is like whether he recalls Ms Mentor’s visit to China.    Well maybe let us say – I am sorry – do you recall astate visit that may have made to China was it 2011?    2010.    Ja.    Yes.    You might not recall that in that year.    You had one or not but you have had a few of them.    A few state visits?   Yes.    Yes.    You would be able to say.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    When you have a state visit would the President not normally invite South African business people to join for purposes of promoting trade with the country to which the visit is intended?    That happens.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    In the state visit.    Yes.    So they meet their counterparts’.    And discuss business but they do not become part of the state activities.    Okay.    On second Mr Pretorius.  Lerato.  Thank you.      I – I guess maybe let us ask it this way.  Before a reshuffle would happen would there be people with whom you would have consultation that would know before it happens?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is the top six of ANC?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    And I guess that the best you can say it that you did not tell him or you would not have told him but you cannot know what anyone else who might have known might have done?    Yes.    Okay.    I am sorry.  What page?  What paragraph?    Okay.  Huh-uh.    Hm.    I think I pressed the wrong one.    No I wanted to say I think your – what you put toMr Zuma as the essence of what Ms Mentor is saying might not be accurate.  My understanding is that what you read says Ms Mentor says Mr Gupta said to her he would put in a word for her to the President for her to get the ministerial position but you said he – she said there was communication which might suggest there had been prior communication.    I do not know if that is there but that is what I heard.    Ja.    I – I think maybe the question should be was your relationship with Mr Ajay Gupta to your knowledge such that he could make such suggestions to you as to who should be appointed Minister?    Have you ever been at the Gupta residence at thesame time as her?    No.    Do – do you recall who Ms Mentor is?    You do recall her?    Ja.  I am asking …    Yes.  I am asking because I think at a certain stage there was – seems to have be something from the Presidency that suggested that at that time you did not recall who she was.  So that is why I am asking but you say you do recall her?    Okay.    Okay.    Are you moving away from that incident?    Oh.    Have you got a clearer copy for counsel for Mr Zuma?    You say that is a better version of the document at page 54?    Ja.  We can take the adjournment now.    Okay.  Let – let us take the lunch adjournment now.    You can – you can discuss the matter ja.  We will take the short – the lunch adjournment now and resume at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn.   Are you ready Mr Pretorius?    To the face?    I’m sorry I didn’t hear, was the question whether the statement at page 54 is incorrect, was that the question?    Aren’t the two of you speaking at cross-purposes, the statement says- doesn’t the statement say that he had no recollection of who Ms Mentor was?    Well  might not have understood but I understood your question to be asking him whether, the statement at page 54 or suggesting that the statement at page 54 is incorrect and with him agreeing whereas my understanding is that the statement at page 54 is correct, according to what he is saying insofar as he had no recollection of who Ms Mentor was but when he subsequently saw the picture, he realised that it was somebody that he knew, that’s my understanding, I may be wrong.   Yes as at that time?    Yes Mr Zuma you understand?    Yes okay.    No I have a very unclear copy.    You are talking about …(intervention). MR PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    No, no Mr Pretorius I think you are talking about page55 and he’s says page 55, you are on the same page.      No I think he said page 55.    Yes the red one ja, I think you have got the right one.    The one in front of you…(intervention).    No, no the one at page 55 is it legible, can you readit?    It’s small?    Okay, have you got a copy…(intervention).    Have you got a copy?    Have you got a spare copy, I think just – have you got another spare copy or can you defer the question?    Okay.   No, hang on, I think Mr Masuku wants to say something.    Yes there’s no indication that…(intervention.   Give it to the witness.    Ja, no I understand.    There are two ways of dealing with this, one is for you to ask someone to get another copy or…(intervention).    You’ve got copies, okay the witness must be given the copy, Loratto.    I don’t have – thank you.    No Mr Pretorius I don’t think that’s fair.    No, no, Mr Masuku has said he was given a copy, notby you, but by Ms September…(intervention).    You don’t know what transpired between the two of them, Mr Masuku has said that there was no indication that, that was meant for the witness, it’s fair for – it would have been fair for them to think you might have made other provisions for the witness.    Let’s move on.    I’ve got – the one I have here that I’ve been given now is a page that has got two paragraphs but the one that it is supposed to be a replacement of or a clearer version of has got one large paragraph and about three lines before.  Does the one, the clearer version, is the clearer version exactly the same as the illegibleversion.  So in other words I want to know when I look at the clearer version I may be reading something that is not in the illegible version or not?    Yes that’s page 55.    On the illegible version?   Okay.    Okay.    Okay thank you.    Well that may be there’s some importance in it because I think she gives these details, as I understand what she’s saying in order to suggest that it can’t be that you did not recall her, that’s why she gives these details because if all of these things that she says are true, then one might say, but then in that event Mr Zumamust have known her very well.  So I think that is what she is saying, so if the position is that, for example, with regard to her saying the two of you used to sit next to each other, if the position is that, no, no that could not have – that wasn’t there  it’s important to say, no, no that’s not the case because this creates the impression that the two of you had interacted so closely in terms of work that she’s suggesting this idea that you couldn’t recall her is not true and therefore it is important to say, well did you know each other as well as she’s suggesting and so on in terms of the things that she is mentioning?    Would the President be involved in Caucuses and so on in Parliament?    Okay.    As a member, not as President?    Thank you, Mr Pretorius?      No Mr Pretorius, if it was correct, that he didn’t recollect who Ms Mentor was would there be a need to correct that?    Well base on what he explained, his – I understand him to say, I may have known the face but I didn’t put the name to the particular face or is your understanding…(intervention).    Okay.    Okay, five minutes?    Okay we’ll just take a five minutes adjournment for the page to be found, thank you, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Are we able to proceed?    Thank you.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Oh.    So is the – is the red numbering that is wrong?    At page 50, can you see page 50 the red 50.   Ja below it you have got a black 33 – the red 50 below it there is a black 33.  Can you see the number in the middle of the page 33?    On page 50.    Yes.    Ja if you go to the next page.    The red page number says 49 instead of 51.    It should say 51 but it says 49.    But if you look at the black number in the middle of the page it is 34.    So the black numbers are correct but the red ones there seems to have been a problem.     Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry I think I missed the question.  Just repeatthe question.    Let me just hear the full question first.    I think Mr Masuku wants to say something but let mehear the full question first.    I am sorry I think Mr Masuku wants to either give you something or address me.    Yes.   Hm.    Hm.    Ms Mentor.    Yes.    Hm.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius.    Hm.    Well do you want to just put that beyond doubt?  I am not sure …    I think the answer was that you could not comment Mr Zuma is that correct?    Yes okay.     I am sorry.    I am sorry Mr Mantsha.  Can I ask the leader of the legal team to assist?  Normally you have the leader of the team addressing the Chair and if she – if he is going to arrange for somebody else to address then it is – arrangements are made.  I do not know – Mr Sikhakhane are you able to?  Okay thank you.      Well..    Mr Mantsha we cannot allow … – Mr Sikhakhane can you address me?  Thank you Mr Mantsha.      Thank you.    Okay you will – you will – okay thank you.   Thank you very much.  Proceed Mr Pretorius.    Well if you are moving away from that statement Mr Pretorius I have got some questions.      With regard to Ms Mentor’s statement – evidence that she was at one stage in – at the residence of the Gupta’s when either Mr Ajay Gupta or one of the Gupta brothers offered her the job of Minister of Public Enterprises and she says you entered the room when she was getting I think she says confrontational because she took objection to somebody other than the President offering her the job of a Minister.  She says that when you entered the room she rose – shestood up and she says as is customary as is protocol when the President comes in she says Mr Gupta just continued sitting down.  She says you spoke to her, asked her to come down because she was agitated because of this offer that was made to her by somebody other than the President and she says you asked her to come down and when she indicated that she wanted to leave because she did not want to miss her flight she says you walked her to the car outside and you even carried her bag and walked with her. She says when you came to the car you said your goodbyes and – and I think you said something like we will see each other Ntombazane I think she says you used thatword, Zulu word Ntombazane and she said you were – you were calm, you tried to calm her. She says she told you about what Mr Gupta had said to her but she says you were concerned about calming her down and you walked her to the car and you helped her with her bag.  You have no recollection whatsoever of any incident like that?    And – and is it – it is not possible that it could have happened?  It is not a question of you do not remember but maybe did happen.  Are you positive it never happened?    Yes    Yes. And – and you said you have – you also do not remember that she had been trying to meet with you for some time onsome issue that related to the Portfolio Committee in which she was involved before – before this incident?    Hm.    Yes.  And that is the person through whom she wouldhave had to go    To go in order to arrange for a meeting?    Yes.      Hm.  You – you  might not be able to say but do you by any chance know why if indeed this did not happen why Ms Mentor would say it happened and gave – and give the kinds of details that she has given?    You do not know?    Yes.   Of course in this commission the investigation has not been finalised as far as I know to establish whether the airlines have got a record of her flying to Johannesburg on the dates that she had given.  So we are waiting to see whether there is such a record of her having come to Johannesburg then.    But I just thought it is important that I get a categorical answer.    Hm.  And then I would like to take you back to Mr Maseko.  You do not have to go to the statement.  When everything is done I have to make certain findings on evidence that I have heard.  And it is important therefore that I should get clarification and get perspectives from different people.  Mr Maseko has come to the commission and said he had been CEO of GCIS and he had performed his duties very well.  No-one in terms of his seniors had complained about him not doing his work properly and he says – he said Minister Chabane actually said that he was a very good I think civil servant might be the name – the word that was used – the term that was used.  He said he was very happy with his work and he says he never asked to be removed from the position of CEO of GCIS and to be transferred to Director General of the Department of Public Services and Administration.  And he says the only reason why he was – as far as he knows he was removed is what he was told by Minister Chabane. Namely that you had called and said Mr Maseko needed to be redeployed or his services terminated.  And actually if I recall correctly he said Minister Chabane told him that by the time you arrived back in the country Ms Maseko should no longer be at GCIS.  And he says he believes that he was removed from this position at GCIS of CEO because he did not cooperate with the Gupta’s.  Now part of this has been – you have been given a chance to comment of [indistinct] but I think I wanted to give you a full picture and enable you to see whether you have anything to add to what you had said.    But is your evidence that this is what normally happens – this is what normally happens in terms of the removal of DG’s and you cannot specifically remember the circumstances under which Mr Maseko was removed or is the position that you have a clear recollection that the circumstances under which he was removedinvolved Minister Chabane asking you if you could transfer him to the Department of Public Services and Administration.    He said also that as I understand his evidence I hope I am not misrepresenting him.  As I understood his evidence he said – or suggested that his removal was done very urgently.  Was effectedvery urgently, very quickly because of what he said Minister Chabane told him that you – by the time you arrive back he should not be in that position.  And he says it was so urgent that Minister Baloyi who was Minister of Public Service and Administration at the time had not been consulted about him – that is Ms Maseko being taken to his department to be DG.  He says Minister Baloyi had for the first time from him that he was going to be his new DG.  You do not know anything about that?    Ja.      Yes.    Hm.  Because…    And he said that as a result of the way in which he had been placed in the Department of Public Service and Administration Minister Baloyi was not happy and their relationship did not become good and he resigned before his term could come to an end.  So I am just giving you the full picture.  That is the – that is what he say – he is saying – he says I had no reason to leave GCIS I did not ask to betransferred to the Department of Public Service and Administration.  My Minister was happy with my performance and I was transferred to the Department of Public Services and Administration in circumstances where the Minister of that department was not consulted.  He was not happy that I had been imposed on him.  Our relationship was not good.  I resigned before the expiry of my term.  You might not have anything further to add but I am just giving you a full picture of what his evidence is.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    Well the actual statement starts at 400 is it not?    The actual statement Mr Pretorius?    May – maybe Mr Pretorius – maybe – maybe let me put it this way.  I think I understand what you – you want to put to him.  It looks like what Ms Hogan is talking about is that there was a review of how decisions to appoint CEOs of SOES had been taken by Cabinet over a certain period of years and it looks like she is saying that was a review of how those decisions were taken during the period April 2002 to February 2009. Do you know anything about such a review to see how Cabinet had been making those decisions between that period – 2002to 2009?    You do not know anything about it?    Yes.    Okay.    It might have been a departmental review that might not have involved maybe the Cabinet Mr Pretorius.   Yes.    Okay.    How much time?    Oh for the day?    Okay.    No.    We can adjourn.  You overruling the formerPresident?    Mr Pretorius any problem?    A long day, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  Well I must also say earlier on I had given instructions that the air conditioner should be put on.  It was quite hot.  I do not feel like it is on now.  I do not know whether that instruction was not carried out or whether it is just that the house if fuller than normal.  Alright.  We – we will adjourn for the day and we will start attomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Good morning.    Just…    Thank you, thank you.  Chairperson I just thought I should put on record something.    For us to know.    Yesterday night between seven and eight my PA that from the ANC side was phoned by a person she does not know and this person said you must tell Zuma that we are going to kill him.  We will also kill his children as well as some people around him.  So she informed me this morning and I am sure Chair you will recall that I said a lot about how my life has been attempted.  But also my senior counsel Advocates Sikhakhane this follows threats that had been made to him, very serious ones as will and the – in the shortwhile about a week or so ago we received that.  I am putting this on record because later at some point after the questions I would like to come back to this issue.    Because I have lost a child and I now know what happened.  So…    So the threat I can say it has been implemented already.    But I would like to come back to that.  I just thought for record this commission must know.    That my life and my children, my lawyers are now under threat.    Thank you very much.    Thank you.    Yes.    It is very difficult.  It is too small.   I tried to.    Strain my eyes but …    Very small.    No he never.    Sorry?    He was a Minister.    In the Presidency.    Yes.    No I had not discussed that with the Ministers.  As I say the – I discussed this with the Secretary General and Deputy.  It was not a matter of government.    He might have known he might not have known I do not know.  I had never – I had not discussed with Chabane.    No I had not discussed that.   Sorry?    No this was not government thing.  This was done by business people out there.    No, no I never said government was involved here.    I think I made the point very clear I informed the Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General because they are ANC.  This had nothing to do with the government insofar as that discussions were concerned.    I cannot – I am not sure whether I hear…    No why I am saying so because you are asking a question as if I should have discussed it.    With the Minister.    No so I am saying the Minister would – that did not feature in my activities as I say.    Because this was not a government project.   Yes.    No this – this was a private.    Project.    By a business – by business people.    You mean when I…    Hm.    Oh yes, yes.    Yes, yes.   I discussed with them.    From a personal capacity.    Yes.    Well if you read what is here.    I think that is what it shows. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    I am – I am not sure.  Whether I should really interpret peoples mood and how they – they address one another because it is here from the – from Mr Maseko who discusses with Gupta.    No how do I interpret them?  I think the trend has been that we actually saying I should be sayingsomething on interactions that I was not part of.    Hm.    Hm.    I do not know really.    Because I – I have never participated in a discussion that discussed that much with Government people.    Hm.    Ja, definitely.   That would be correct.    Yes.    No I do not know.    No I did not.  Did not get that.    Huh-uh.    Well from time to time they briefed me.    Hm.    No.    No.    No.    They were just briefing me on the progress they were making.    Establishing that business – the newspaper as it were.   No not the financing.    Hm.    Hm.    Well I would not be able to answer the question correctly because I really do not know what made Mr Gupta – Mr Ajay to say that.  The senior that on operational matters the immediate senior and who deals with all of these things would be the Minister not the President.  It would be the Minister.  That is why Maseko would go to the Minister and report the kind of treatment that he has got from an individual and it ends there.I am just making a point that you cannot have the President participating in those kinds of discussions in all departments.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Yes.    No I am able to say so.    Absolutely.    Yes.    Yes.    I said so.   If they discuss anything with – we did not discuss the operational things.    Yes.  I think he left around that time.    It would – yes.  It would be the decision taken in the main between - what – what would have happened.  The Minister would have briefed the President because theDGs are actually deployed by the Cabinet – by the Cabinet.  That type of report will therefore be given to or reflected in the Government but Ministers would have discussed that with the President.    They come because of whatever to say Mr President this is what I am doing and if the President thinks that this is unfair whatever will say but why.  They will have to explain.  If the explanation – at times the explanation might not even be satisfying but if the Minister says look I just cannot work with this DG. It happens all the time.  You cannot force the Minister.  So Iwill say okay proceed and then follow the process.    In the?    Just repeat.  I do not know whether I am getting you.    Huh-uh.    Ja.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Definitely.    Not just by the Minister in the Presidency only - all Ministers.    All Ministers.    No.  I never – I never instructed the Minister to do so.    No the Minister discussed thefact that he would like to transfer Mr Maseko.    Well I think there was an issue between the two of them.  I cannot remember the details.  I cannot remember the details.  Like all Ministers he would come for us to be able to either agree so that an action is taken not to discuss - and if at all there were issues which were necessary to be said because it is a big decision he will indicate that.  That is because of this and that because …    Ja, because either we – we can no longer work together or because we do not agree or because I think I do not need him anymore whatever.  The discussion would – because he cannot take a decision to change the DG without – because that is not his decision.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    That specific …?    Hm.    Well I do not remember exactlybut I know that there was a bit of shifting of the DGs around that time …  And the department that handles that is Public Administration.    Who will then discuss with the Ministers.    On whatever reasons …    And then once that happens and that would then be reported.    Once it becomes a decision tothe Cabinet.    I might not remember the details why this happened but I know there was a movement …    That was done.    But I cannot remember the exactly what was the course.  At times the changes come because other – a DG could perform badly in one place and therefore he must go helpthere and another one is replaced but I cannot remember exactly what - on this particular DG - what was the problem but that matter would have been discussed more in some details at a level of the Minister and the Minister of Public – Public Administration.    Once they have agreed they will then come with a recommendation.  They generally come with a recommendation unless if there is a problem.  For example if they cannot work together or if they think this particular DG would perform better there and once they report and say we have discussed the matter.  We have agreed …    And then the Cabinet will – we take a decision.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No.  I – I think I have a difficulty with that.  If – let - let us assume I wanted Maseko out.    I will wait until I leave thecountry and when I am very far away then call.  It is quite funny.  I am not running a department.  Why would I have not talked to Minister Chabane when I was here?  Why should I wait until I go?  It is a little fishy.  Now I do not want to make a point but I can make a point because this Commission has experience with this. At time people use the names of the President.  I am sure you had a witness here …    Which said – he was lying.  He had never – he had never had any instructions from the President.  Iam sure that could happen with the Ministers as well if the Minister is finding it difficult to say to the DG I am now saying go and use the name of the President because I do not see why I should leave the country. Only when I am abroad then I must attend to this issue.  It definitely – it is very strange and funny and I – I never phoned Chabane about the – this DG when I was abroad.  Not at all.    Yes.    No I do not know the – thatmessage.  I never gave any instruction to that effect.    No.  I think as I said earlier at that time there was shifting of the DG’s between the departments for a variety of reasons so I never issued any instruction.    No I recall that the Minister coming to me reporting this and as always then they were going to respond to the newspaper.  It was just informing me.    No he did not give me – I mean he did not discuss the matter in terms of the background.  He was just saying they have got to deal with this matter because at that time there was a shifting of the DG’s but he did not discuss the causes as to why the other DG was going this way.  What he was concerned with at the time was to correct the impression that was being given by the media that he has been sacked.  That no he has been shifted to another department.    Yes, yes.    No the decision was made by the cabinet.    No.  I was not the cause of his being shifted.    No.    Yes.    Yes.    No I had no interaction with this witness, nothing.    I know nothing about it.    No I know nothing about that.    Who paid for?    Transnet?    No I know nothing about that.    No I do not.    I do not.    Well I have gone to China several times.    I might have to look at my records.    Ja I am not recalling it.    Yes.    Ja because I have gone to China a number of times.    If I do not check my records.    I will not be able to be exact and give the exact answer.    No I do not.  Though never – I do not remember them in any state visit.    No I say – no I have just answered to say I do not remember.  Them being a part of our visit at being taken prominent role, what would they be doing because they have got nothing to do with the visit?    Yes that happens but…    No one of those businesspeople would play a prominent role in the visit.    They meet other business people.  In fact if you go like that only once you go to address them together with the President of that country.    You come in, you address, you go away.    You do not participate in theactivities.    All the state visits.    Ja.    Yes.    Not at all.  Not at all.    No.  Nothing of that nature.    She assumes that well it is her who saw the person.    I know nothing about it.    Page 59?    Paragraph 59.  The first thing she says there is that she had been trying for some time to meet with you regarding the Pebble Bed Modular Reaction amongst other things.  Do you know anything about her attempts to meet with you about that issue?    Ja Ms Kaunda worked in my office.    Not Kaunda.  Kaunda had nothing to do with that.    There are other officials who were dealing with those kind of arrangements not Kaunda.    No.    No.    Not at all.    I know nothing.   Ja there was a reshuffle I think.      In terms of reshuffle that happens regularly when it is to happen.    No.    No.  Ajay Gupta was not part of Government.    Was not even part of the people who normally get consulted.    He should not have known.    Yes definitely.  I consult …    Very selected a few people.    I always consult.    At no stage I could do the reshuffle without people knowing who are supposed to know.  For example it would be the top six for example would have to know what Iam doing.    Top six of the ANC, yes.    As well as if it is – all of it as well as the alliance top six or five.    Those are the people we consult with.  So it would not be the knowledge that is on me only.    There would be those kind of individuals who would know.    Yes.    Absolutely.    Yes definitely.    Paragraph 91.    Okay.    Huh-uh.    I do not know what could my response – because they were discussing two of them.    I had nothing to do with it.   Absolutely nothing.    No not at all.  He had nothing to do with what happens in the – in – in Government.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    No.  That is why I am saying discussing two of them about either offering whatever.  Other one is being surprised.  I am not there.  I do not know why they reached that kind of a discussion.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No never.    No there is nothing of that nature.  I know nothing of – of entering some room.    No.    Never.    Yes.    Yes I do recall.    Yes I recall her.    No I do recall her.   I do recall her.    He was one of the staff in the Presidency dealing with communications.    Yes I do, my office came to check after getting the information from the communications whether I know anything, at that time I must be honest, I had no recollection of this name, totally I gave a very honest answer I’ve never – I don’t know who is this, only after some time when I saw her picture I realised it is a person I know, I couldn’t put the name to the face.    Ja.    Yes absolutely.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I understand.    Yes.    Oh in the – oh its page 55, the red?    Okay.    The small one?    No this one is small.    Ja.    No, the one…(intervention).    Yes because the print is smaller there.    Well I thought we had clarified the point, that when I was asked about her from the beginning I couldn’t have any recollection, so I gave that answer, that I have no recollection.  Then when I saw her, afterwards, I remembered and therefore she was responding to the statement made by the Presidency at the beginning.  What I – I think also what she has written here that I introduced her to the Caucus, I think she’s very much mistaken.   In the Caucus, the Chief Whip introduces whatever changes that are there,certainly in Parliament, I’m not sure she was sitting next to me, I’m not sure we need to get to those details really because, in Parliament it’s me, a person who sits next to me is the deputy President, next to the deputy President is the speaker, next to the speaker is the deputy speaker so I don’t think we need to get into that really.    No I hear you Chair, all I’m saying when I was asked first, I couldn’t remember the name, only later when I saw her and I remembered, oh this is the person.  So at the time that I did not remember her, that’s when I said, no I don’t know this person, that’s when she responded but if later I recognise and I remembered her then I remembered her.  All I’m saying with thesedetails which have – that objective to say is impossible but I’m saying she’s as well exaggerating because she never sat next to me.  I’m just explaining that one without wanting to talk about it, whether it’s important point or what but it’s not true that she was sitting next to me always, I introduced her to the Caucus it’s not the job of the President it’s the job of the Chief Whip or the Chairperson of Caucus.    President attends the Caucus meeting, if he’s there.   As a member.      No as a member of the ANC.    Sorry?    No I don’t remember, I don’t remember it.      Paragraph 118?    Page 50 – page hundred and?    Okay.      Hm-mmm.    Just [microphone off].    The red 50 yes.    Ja 33.    I have got there.    And then 50.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.   34 yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Hm. 159?    118?    118 yes.    Yes.    Nothing yes.     Well I know nothing about this matter.    No I have got no idea what is happening here.    Well it is difficult to have acomment because I do not know why even that statement was made.    I do not know what caused them to make such a statement whatever.    No let me not comment because I do not know what was the cause of that.    Yes correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    No.    No recollection at all.  Nothing absolutely nothing.    Never, never.    Yes.    I do not remember that either.    Members of Parliament there is a person in Parliament who is responsible for the matters of the President and Deputy President.  Anyone if you have difficulties to find the President or the Deputy President will go to that person who works with the President and that is the person who arranges meetings.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely that what – would have happened.    I do not know why.    I do not know.    Absolutely.    Okay.    Okay.   No I have nothing to add.Absolutely nothing.  Because DG’s deal with Ministers not the President.  There is no President who can say I do not like this DG.  Not working with me.   Unless you talk about the DG at the President – at the President’s office.  No reason why I should look at the DG down there and say I do not want - take it – take him out.  It can never happen.  It is Ministers who deal with the DG”s.  If there would have been any discussion there will be discussion if the Minister is reporting to the President and says this is what I wish should happen.  In other words presenting the matter so that the matter is going to be discussed.  It never goes this way.    No that is what happens.  Ministers if they have got whatever view about their accounting officers they make – they have the case whatever it is they then consult with the President.  It has never started from the President because the President is not working with the person.    No nothing.    It does not work like that really.    I do not think you could have a Minister of Public Administration not knowing and then just people saying here is a person.  Because Ministers if for an example there is to be a shift Ministers discuss among themselves.   And they come to say when the – they have got an agreement to say no this is what we are doing.  Seeking endorsement therefore from the cabinet.    Hm.    No I have nothing to add really.    I have nothing to add.    Ja we can continue.    Bundle B.    Hm. It is there okay.  I thought it was called bundle B.  Oh ja.  Here it is.     Yes.    399.    Okay.    Ja it starts at 400.    Okay.    No.  I think the – the process as described here that is how it is.    Hm.    Even before and there is one – there is one system that works.    Ja.    It is correct.    No comment.    Which survey?    Review of the SOEs?    They would – I mean the review of decisions not a particular decision.    Hm.    I – I do not …    I do not recall it …    For now.    Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.      Yes we are.    I need to report back Chair in relation to documents.  I understand that there is no substantial issuein relation to documents any longer.  It is acknowledged that all but two documents were received last year.  The two documents in question are the statement of Mr Mbalula.  No 3.3 was issued in relation to that document and therefore it was not sent last year but was sent this year.  I will delay questioning on that until the end in order to accommodate my learned friends and Mr Zuma in relation to possible preparation.The second document is the second statement of Mr Agrizzi which was also not sent by way of a 3.3 Notice because of the consideration that it failed to implicate the President certainly directly and I do not intend to ask any questions about that statement as atpresent advised.    Thank you Chair.      In relation to what has been said this morning may we just add that the secretariat has an investigative capacity.  The issues raised by former President Zuma are a matter of regret firstly and concern secondly and we will ensure that as previously where it has happened before in this commission the matter is fully investigated and insofar as we can assist in any way whatsoeverat least with advice around our experience in the commission in regard to protection or protection itself both in relation to Mr Sikhakhane and former President Zuma it will be done and we will report back to you.    Mr Zuma we will with your leave still be dealing this morning for a while at least with the evidence of Mr Maseko and your response or version in respect of the issues that he raises and we were on page 7 of the bundle FPJGZ7.    Yes.  Bundle A.   GG[a]     Exhibit GG[a].    I am sorry Chair.    Yes we did.    But there is no harm in repeating for the sake of efficiency particularly in relation to documentation Chair that we dealing with two bundles.    Yes they do not just a minor point contain any statement of the former President but they do contain statements relevant to the questioning this week.    Correct.    That by way of introduction Mr Zuma may we go to page 7 and paragraph 32.  The next…    In the meanwhile I will try and arrange from the secretariat for large copies.    By way of background to the next section of the evidence of Mr Maseko Mr Zuma.  Mr Maseko testified that around the end of November 2010 he was driving to the North West on a personal journey and he received a phone call from an unknown person who said he worked for the Gupta Media Company and that gentleman requested a meeting with Maseko the following Monday in order to discuss government advertising and the soon to be launched New Age Newspaper.  By way of introduction it seems that what follows was a second attempt to persuade Mr Maseko to divert or cause business to be given to the New Age Newspaper by way of government advertising.  But that by way of background – was any report against the background that the Gupta’s would have known that you had aninterest in this project.  In fact it was initiated by yourself as I understand from what you said yesterday.  The financing of the project clearly would have been a concern to the Gupta’s.  Did they report to you any concerns about their inability to persuade Mr Maseko to assist them?    Right. Then if we look further down on page 7 in short what happened was that Mr Maseko put the caller off.  He said look we will discuss it on Monday.  But then an hour later and I am at paragraph 35 on page 7 the phone rang again that isMr Maseko’s phone this time it was Mr Ajay Gupta.  He sounded very agitated and he started the conversation with an aggressive tone. He said and I am now over the page on page 8.  He said his people told him that I was being difficult.  I told him what happened in the    Who was Minister Chabane at that stage, what post did he hold?    In you…    In the Presidency    And Mr Maseko says he reported it to him.  Now Minister Chabane would have known surely that youwere in favour of the progress of the New Age project, would he?    Alright.    So as I understand your evidence then Mr Zuma you say that you saw a need for fair and objective and comprehensive publicity and newspaper reporting and as part of that you discussed with the Gupta’s at least the New Age project for now the ANN7 project came later and that you did not discuss that with the Minister in the Presidency?    Would it not be something that you would discuss and – ordinarily?    Would it not be something that one would have expected such a thing to be discussed with the Minister and the Presidency if it was a matter that concerned you as President?    Was it a private arrangement not government?   Alright.    Alright so if I may understand then your interactions with the Gupta family certainly insofar as the New Age Newspaper and its establishment were concerned was done in a capacity other than a government capacity not as President?    Well not as head of the executive you say it had nothing to do with government?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes    Yes that is how I understand it.    So how would you categorise the project then?  Private, party political?    A private?    Yes.    Thank you.      We may come back to that issue in relation to another matter arising in the statement of Mr Maseko but for the moment what is apparent from the statement of Mr Maseko just read to you is that the Gupta’s were to put it mildly quite forceful in their request or demand to Mr Maseko.  That so much is apparent.  Do you agree?   Yes.    Yes.   No I understand that and you – you make a good point.    My question though had a different object and let me …    Rephrase it.  The factual question that I ask is did Mr Gupta enjoy - as he appears to have said he did - Government support in the New Age Project.   You do not know?    Alright.  He goes on Mr Zuma on    Right but again it is evident that the New Age Project under the Guptas if Mr Maseko’s evidence isaccepted was being vigorously pursued.    Did they ever report back to you on this?  Did you have meetings with the Guptas about the progress of the New Age Project?    Right and would they have …    Briefed you about how thefinancing of the project was to be achieved?  It would seem     A maybe reasonable assumption to make.    No?    What – what did they brief you on?    Oh and what type of progress would that have been then?    But you say not the financing?    Alright.  The next section of the evidence that we would like your comment on Mr Zuma is under the    You did say Mr Zuma that these sorts of matters would not be discussed with a President but you have also said the matters were indeed discussed privately?    Some matters were discussed privately?    So – so …    The Guptas might have felt free to discuss these issues with you in your private capacity as you have already said?    Paragraph 47 if I may read it to   And I do not want to go into the detail of the law with you but as I understand it if Mr Maseko was transferred as he was to another department the law says that would be your decision.  Do I understand correctly?    Yes.    So in the ordinary course as required by law you would have participated in any decision regarding a DG in the Department of the Presidency?    In the Presidency.    Well …    We dealt with this matter yesterday but it is well to clarify Mr Zuma.  As the Head of GCIS Mr Maseko worked in the Department of the Presidency.    Correct?   Which fell under yourself at the time?    And the Minister then was Minister Chabane?    So in any decision about the termination of service of Mr Maseko or relation to his transfer you would have been consulted?   Right.    Right, okay.    Okay.  Well Mr Maseko’s evidence is that Mr Chabane told him that he had been instructed by the President to redeploy me or terminate my contract henceforth.  What do you say about that statement?  If you can help us.    Did you discuss the issue with the Minister?    Did he say why?    Chair there is a request to address you.    Thank you Chair.  I do not want to enter into a long debate as to what questioning is and what cross-examination is, save to say that there is no pleaded case or charge sheet which we are seeking to validate or sections of which we are seeking to prove through our questioning.  So insofar as it may be alleged that we are seeking to question, to prove a particular pleaded case in a civil matter or a particular criminal case as represented by a charge sheet that is simply not correct.  What we are doing is affording Mr Zuma a full opportunity to deal with all the factual evidence that Mr Maseko led, and indeed the implications of that evidence, and it would be grossly unfair to Mr Zuma not to allow him that full opportunity to deal with what might have been said by Mr Maseko and also what might have been intended by him to have been conveyed, and once Mr Zuma has dealt with it, as he is dealing with it, I really don’t see that we are traversing any  rules, but insofar as we are Chair you will no doubt pull me up and guide me accordingly, and I am quite willing to accept such – obviously such intervention by yourself.The second point is in relation to assumed obligation to call the Guptas to corroborate Mr Maseko before questions can be asked, I am not sure that it is correct at all to say that you cannot ask questions about the evidence of one witness until it has been corroborated by another witness.  One need not deal with that issue any further.Thirdly in terms of reference, I understand the argument to be that unless there is a direct allegation of fraud and corruption against Mr Zuma we are precluded from entering into this arena.May I just highlight paragraph 1.1 of our terms of reference, which just says whether and to what extent and by whom attempts were made through any form of inducement or for any gain whatsoever nature to influence the improper influence of members of the National Executive and the improper influence of Mr Maseko falls squarely within our terms of reference and it is only fair to Mr Zuma in these circumstances to ask him what  he knew, if anything, about him, toenable him either to distance himself as he has to date completely from that undue influence or to admit that I did have because I was in support of the project.  It’s not unfair to ask Mr Zuma those questions so he can give his version as to what the import of the evidence of Mr Maseko might be and Mr Maseko’s evidence which we were dealing with now which gave rise to the objection, at least the timing of the objection, is particular in that what Mr Maseko says is that following in the context of Mr Maseko’s failure to accede to what may well be argued improper influence he was fired and it would be grossly unfair to Mr Zuma if the leading team were to ask you to make findings in that regard because the evidence was unchallenged and Mr Zuma hasn’t had an opportunity to deal with it.Let me deal with another term of reference, 1.6, it says whether our mandate is to investigate whether there were any irregularities, undue enrichment, corruption and undue influence in theawarding of contracts, government advertising in a New Age newspaper, so this whole issue of government advertising is particularly highlighted in the terms of reference in relation not only to fraud and corruption, but in relation to any influence that might be argued to be undue and quite fairly to Mr Zuma he commented on that yesterday, saying that the influence sought to be exercised was not entirely proper, he used his own words, I cannot recall them at the moment.So basically all one needs to do for the moment and going forward is in fairness to Mr Zuma put to Mr Zuma the import of what MrMaseko has done, I do not have far to go at all, and I submit the line of questioning has been not only proper but necessary in order to ensure that in relation to all the evidence its import Mr Zuma has a fair opportunity to deal with it.  I have never said to Mr Zuma I put it to you as cross-examiners who featured prominently on TV in the past have done, that you are wrong and this is the version that we seek to prove.    Thank you Chair. Mr Zuma before the long adjournment you and your representatives were handed a copy of a media statement in more legible form that appeared in the bundle, it’s apparent from the document at least, that a media statement was issued by the Presidency on the 15 t h of Mach 2016 and may I ask who is Bongani Majola or who was he?   The statement reads, and it’s at page 55 – sorry page 54, this document which is at page 54 which is illegible Chair will be replaced by the document now handed to you, headed, social media comment by former member of Parliament, if I may read it to you sir, it reads,“The Presidency has received media enquiries about areported comment on social media by former ANC member ofParliament Ms Vytjie Mentor, the second paragraph reads,President Jacob Zuma has no recollection of Ms Mentor, he istherefore unable to comment on any alleged incident in hercareer”,Do you know anything about this statement being issued on your behalf?   So do I have it correct, you do, having been reminded of how – what she looked like have a recollectionof Ms Mentor?    And insofar as this particular suggests, otherwise the statement is incorrect?    Chair the statement says President Jacob Zuma has no recollection of Ms Mentor, the explanation I understand it to be, is that at that time he had norecollection but later on recognising her face, he did have a recollection and that’s why I qualified the question in the manner I did.    It’s equally correct, I hear what you’re saying that’s what I understood the position to be and I think what Mr Zuma understands the position to be, I think we’re all in agreement, but the point is that insofar as the statement which seeked to suggest that he never has had any recollection of her, it would be incorrect, but it doesn’t suggest that, if the tense is correct, President Jacob Zuma has no recollection on the 15 t h of March 2016.    Yes so I don’t think there’s any…(intervention).     For completeness of the record Ms Mentor did respond to that Presidential statement or statementissued on behalf of or by the Presidency in NPM6 which is at page 55. Have you a clearer copy of NPM6 Chair?    Do you have a copy of a clear NPM6, the re-typed note 6?    Literally thank you Chair. I thought he said NPM5.    Now that is in very small print it being an extract from social media, have you been given by your legal representatives, a clearer copy, it was given to them before the long adjournment, has it been given to you?    Chair it’s after lunch, it’s been a long day, let’s take it slowly.    What we have done is we’ve made a clearer copy of page 55 in a text that is legible, it was handedto my learned friends before the long adjournment and I had hoped that he would have been given a copy, but I’m now asking whether he’s had an opportunity to read it.    No look, Chair, if I may just stay in control of this process, all I’m asking Mr Zuma is, did your legal representatives give you a clearer copy of page 55 in the long adjournment?    Alright so we must give it to you now?    Chair I would have hoped that the document that I gave to Mr Zuma’s representatives would have been discussed with him, that was the purpose of giving it, it seems it wasn’t so let’s start again.    It was clear Chair, I don’t want there to be any argument about trivialities or these arguments to be blown up, everybody knew we were going to deal with it…(intervention).    We’ve got copies Chair, I can hand them…(intervention).    And do you have a copy Chair?   Just for the record if a copy is given to my learned friend during the course of evidence the clear intention is that the copy is given so that the witness can be given an opportunity to be recognised in relation to it, as I understand it, you have it – no that’s what I said before the long adjournment.    I said it before the long adjournment.    Yes on my instruction.    Be that as it may Chair.    Let’s move one, let’s not…(intervention).    No Chair, let me explain, if one goes to the original NPM6.    Yes the original page 55, you will see – if I may explain Chair, Chair if I may explain it will – you needn’t read it, the first three lines, the first paragraph…(intervention).    No is cut off, it’s not complete.      The complete version appears on the clearer version.    Right but I’m not going to deal with that, I’m going to deal with the second paragraph on both pages and the second paragraph is the same on both pages.    It seems that shortly after reading the Presidential statement, Ms Mentor posted on social media her response to what appeared in the press release, that you had no recollection of Ms Mentor and she said,“I Chaired the ANC National Parliamentary Caucus whenPresident Zuma was he deputy President, he sat next to meand spoke through me and with me in Caucus each Thursdaywhen Parliament was in session.  I sat with him in the ANC’spolitical committee each month too, he is the one – it saysWHI but it should be who was sent by the top six then to tellme that the ANC has deployed me to the Chair of Caucus then. He is the one who introduced me to the ANC Caucus then asthe new Chair of Caucus.  I had a bi-monthly with him in hisTuinhuis offices then, he knew me right from when he arrivedfrom exile, he met me frequently on the ground in the NorthernCape on many occasions.  I know President Mbeki andKgalema Motlanthe will never ever say they had norecollection of me. As for the Gupta’s I’m not there yet a lotstill need to be told, will leave this here for now”,And the rest is not relevant to the identification issue. Do you have any comment in regard to that, she says, in effect, that she knew you well from a number of interactions over the years and that by inference you knew her well?    Thank you Chair.  Was the statement ever corrected?    Was the Presidential statement that you had no recollection of Ms Mentor, ever corrected?    Yes because it gives anincorrect impression.    Chair that’s  matter for submissions later but clearly the impression gained from the  Presidential statement is an impression that turns out, it appears, to be certainly capable of qualification and I’m simply asking was it every qualified or corrected, I don’t want to make a big song and dance about it Chair, really.   Can we move on Mr Zuma to paragraph 118.    Yes, what happened thereafter is that Ms Mentor wanted to lay charges and she says in paragraph 118 on page 50.    Paragraph 118 page 50.    It seems you and I are the only ones that get on very well in this role Mr Zuma, she wanted to lay charges, do you see that, against you and some others.    She says she made a statementand then at a later stage she requested her statement from the police but said that it had been – she was told that it had been sent to Pretoria and then they were asked – she was asked to meet with representatives of the police.  Let me just get my note, if we could go to paragraph 119, I’m afraid Chair there’s a page missing, I don’t know how that happened but I worked off a copy where the page was not missing so I have my notes, and can we take a short adjournment so I can get the page?    Five minutes Chair.   But for the moment can we turn to page 403?  One of the topics that has been dealt with by a number of witnesses Mr Zuma in this Commission thus far is the manner in which State Owned Entities Board Members are appointed and the manner in which Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers and perhaps other Senior Executives are appointed and perhaps you can help uswith the knowledge and experience you have in regard to appointments of SOE Board Members and SOE Senior Executives and the relationship between the manner in which those appointments take place and what we have learnt is the policy of deployment and if I may I would like to ask you some questions about that in relation to what Ms Hogan says in particular.  If I can read paragraph 18 of her    That is how it is?    And when you say how it is, isthat for the time during which you were President or including before and after?    One system?    In paragraph 20 she says   It is correct.  Then she continues    She then says in paragraph 21   She refers to a survey or a    Yes.  Appointment – well it is a review of previous decisions of Cabinet.  In other words what was reviewed were the decisions of Cabinet relating to the appointment of CEOs of a variety of State Owned Entities.  So it is a review of Cabinet decisions but those decisions of Cabinet related to appointments of CEOs of SOEs.   No not of a particular decision.    It just – it appears that the review was (intervenes).    I have no objection.  It has been a strenuous day …    And …    Far from me to judge it seems that …   It would be appropriate …    To take a break. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  No, I am Mr Thabani (intervenes).    However – however …    Yes.  Chair – Chair, we together with just the legal team we have a duty to raise concerns …    When we see a development …    In the manner in which our client is being cross-examined.  Essentially what is going on now …    Is that Mr Pretorius is cross-examining Mr Zuma.   He is cross-examining about issues we are not clear about.    Insofar as the terms of reference are concerned.    We – as you – as you recall Mr Chair …    The – Mr Zuma has read this affidavit.  We have read it.    We took the view that it does not implicate the President in any of the terms of reference that this Commission is about.  That is the attitude we took.   Now of course in your – in your discretion you decided the President should come …    And – and take – and give his version of – of events.    What is going on now …    Is not Mr Pretorius assisting Mr Zuma to givehis version.    What he is doing he is cross-examining him …    But which is not a problem if Mr Zuma’s attitude had been that there are aspects in the statement of Mr Maseko that implicates him fraud, corruption and this State Capture.    We – we are not able to follow …    How to fit this cross-examination in which he seeks Mr Zuma to recall meetings where he was not present.  In which he seeks Mr Zuma to – to interpret what those meetings meant or even to give a view of whether those meetings were appropriate or not.  It isnot fair if this – if the legal team of the Commission wishes to cross-examine Mr Zuma it is important that the – Mr Zuma is in fact given an opportunity to then reflect with a view that he is going to be cross-examined, to reflect on all these things because you said the rules of the Commission say you look at an affidavit that implicates you or that mentions your name. You make a judgment call on whether or not that the allegations made in that affidavit are of a nature that fit within the investigative powers of the – of the Commission fraud, corruption and State Capture.  Now he is being asked to recall phone calls andmeetings where he was not present and to interpret what those meetings would mean. We think it is unfair because what essentially it means is this if he cannot say for example that he thinks that the meeting between Mr Gupta – Ajay Gupta and Mr Maseko was inappropriate.  Then you must read something into it.  It is not right.  If the – if the Commission rules for example that this line of questioning is the correct line of questioning that must be adopted. It is no longer a – a – it is cross-examination.  You are trying to prove that Mr Zuma’s private conversation had a – had – were somehow relevant to his – the public – to his public interaction or his interaction with the Guptas in – in public.  Give him an opportunity to then look at this with a view that he is going to be cross-examined and then he can prepare adequately for cross-examination. Not what – not this – this would say in our – in our view – inour assessment as lawyers it is cross-examination for which a witness ought to have been given a fair opportunity be told that if you are not going to – if you are not going to for example respond to Mr Maseko you may then - let us be called and be cross-examined or not Mr Maseko’s case. He is being cross-examined on what Mr Maseko said.  How can the President be expected to remember meetings where he was not there, phone calls that occurred years ago.  I do not recall phone calls that happened last week.  Now - now Mr Zuma must recall conversations that he had with Mr Maseko years ago and what he may have meant.    I think let us be fair and stick to what this Commission is about.    The terms of reference bearing in – in mind that Mr Zuma’s assessment of this affidavit is that it does not implicate him in fraud and corruption.  If the Commission’s view is that it does let them put those questions to him.  Not ask him to remember meetings and – and – if this affidavit anywhere says that Mr Zuma is corrupt in A, B, C and D then he must put that to Mr Zuma because that is – that is exactly within the terms of reference that this Commission is about. This line of – we do this often but we do it to opponents – Imean to witnesses who we are cross-examining.  Not witnesses we are supposed to just inquire about information because we expected that the Commission will be asking for clarity on certain things not pose questions that amount to cross-examination. That is what we – we – that is what we – we thought we would bring to the attention of the – of the – of the …    Of the Committee.  Mr Chair we wanted to do that in Chambers …    But we thought no actually it is probably up to - to bring it to your attention now.    So that – so that if there is a need for us to then regroup and determine how – how we deal with it.    Then we deal with it because if Mr Pretorius wants to continue with cross-examination …    We – we waited yesterday because we realised it was actually cross-examination …    But we said no maybe later on we will see a – an approach that seeks to establish facts.  If Mr Zuma says I do not remember that meeting that should be the end of the matter.  Whyshould it then be asked oh but you would have discussed this privately?  What – where is he taking this to?  Terms of reference in the terms of reference.  Let us be loyal to the terms of reference.    That is – that is what we – we …    We want to put.    Sorry, sorry, perhaps before you take ...(intervention)    Firstly in relation to what the Chairperson has just sketched out the first point would be this, Mr Pretorius must say that they are going to bring the Guptas or whoever they allege in the Guptas placed – I mean the witness from the Guptas are going to say that they – who is going to confirm this interaction that Maseko is talking about, because it is not, you see Chair what you said in termsof your – in terms of reference, was that if you are implicated on the issues that are within the terms of reference then you are going to be given an opportunity to put your version and then put your – and then of course you will be, somebody might ask to cross-examine you, someone might ask to cross-examine you.   We didn’t get the impression that the evidence leaders here job would be to cross-examine witnesses, but even on the issue that Mr Maseko complains about that he was fired or he was transferred because of some intervention that came from the Presidency, that’s an issue that he says we are assess it, we say in terms of the terms of reference there are no allegations he’s making on corruption, if you bring Mr Ajay or Mr – or any of the Guptas here in the Commission and they say to you we did speak to Mr Maseko, we in fact told him that we are the ear of the President and that if he is not cooperating on this business we will certain invoke, we will use that relationship and gethim removed.  We think it is highly unfair if the Guptas are not going to be here to testify and to corroborate what Mr Maseko has said here it is just unfair to ask the President to recall or to interpret what role he may have played in the removal of Mr Maseko, but the other thing that reason why we did not think that falls within your terms of reference is because it is something that has to do with how government decides to remove people who are employed there or deploy them or transfer them into different units.It is not within – if Mr Maseko’s allegation is that there was corruption he must say so in unequivocal terms, or that his removal –his transfer was in pursuance of a corrupt deal, he must say so, it cannot be read through cross-examination, which cross-examination we are not prepared for, because what we were prepared for when we were invited by the Commission was for Mr Zuma to be asked clarity questions, clarification questions, not going through pages and paragraphs and cross-examining him on issues that he has elected to take a position, a legal position which is that he is not going to get involved in Maseko’s speculation about what his meeting with the Guptas, who authorised it what else.  If Maseko is bold enough to say I was removed because the President was unhappy that I was not doing the right thing he must say so, and that this right thing that I was being asked to – this right thing that I was doing was in accordance with the law but the President wanted me to do something corrupt, then we are in the terms of reference, then we would have said to the President Mr President Mr Maseko says you are corrupt and this is how he says youare corrupt, and then Mr President would have said okay let me respond, this is my statement.  The Commission would have a statement answering allegation of corruption or State Capture or whatever it is that – and fraud.  If Mr Maseko’s accusations of Mr Zuma amounted to that he was corrupt, there was a fraudulent conduct on his behalf or that there was something about State Capture that one must read in it.  You can’t – it is not fair to call a former President to come and talk about how an official of government was removed, when you are not alleging that there was corruption.  Please make the allegation that there wascorruption and then let the President deal with that, or that there was fraud.    With respect I understand that Chairperson.    But even within the Commission of Inquiry firstly it would be a misunderstanding if you understood Mr Chair that I was invoking a litigation strategy.    All I am saying is this.    That in the statements that you get, even if a complainant comes here before the Commission and complains, thecomplaint must be investigated if the allegations that that complainant makes fall within the terms of reference of the Commission.  I am saying we advised Mr Zuma that Mr Maseko’s statement did not accuse him of any corruption or any fraud, or any State Capture, he is unhappy with some things and all that.  What is happening here, and so we said to Mr Zuma so we do not think that you should put a statement, so that is why you do not have a statement.  In terms of the rules you are allowed not to put a statement to explain what Mr Maseko says, because he does not implicate you in what the Commission is about.  So Mr Zuma decides he is not going to put a statement, that is what he has done, but what has happened here is that having taken advantage and used the full right he has in terms of the Commission rules, not to respond to a litigant or to a witness who says, who makes allegations that do not amount to corruption.  What is happening here is just not what we think should be happening and that is why as theysay Chair we sit there and we thought no, actually let – because he is a guest of the Commission, let us see how – what they really want from him, what information are they looking from him in relation to Mr Maseko.  Does he make the allegation of corruption, fraud and State Capture against him for which he should be called to answer?  And that is why we are anxious with these kind of questions in this kind of forum a lot can be read from the questions that he reads and from the answers they get, and we do not want this Commission to end up in a situation where it is unfair to Mr Zuma because it is said to Mr Zuma if no one makes allegations of corruption or fraud or StateCapture you do not have to put a statement, you do not need to ask Mr Maseko – to cross-examination Mr Maseko on it, and he has done that.  We accept that you can call him to ask clarity questions.  Please ask clarity questions and not questions that amount to cross-examining because we go into credibility when we cross-examine a witness, we go into credibility so Mr Maseko is being measured against – his allegations are being measured against Mr Zuma, and we want to be sure that that is not something that you are trying to invoke, the credibility of the witness and whether he can be trusted for his recollection of what Mr Maseko says, so we are asking the Commission to be fair to the extent that it accepts that Mr Zuma has been called at its instance to seek clarity questions, not to ask questions that amount to cross-examination on what has been happening as cross-examination.    Thank you Chair.    Yes, in the tradition of audi I like Mr Pretorius respond to some of the things that he says.    Firstly Chair what is astonishing for us is that this Commission clearly was created around the work that the President had done.  We have not received a single invitation from the evidence leaders for them to interview Mr Zuma, privately, as they havedone with the other witnesses, to say to Mr Zuma we would like you to give us a view of what is going on here, and to explain certain things, which is what they have done.  Mr Zuma has not been treated the same way that other Ministers who have appeared here, who are – appear to be witnesses of the Commission. A decent way of dealing with this, and I don’t mean disrespect to the Commissioner or to the evidence leaders, would have been to say he is a major witness of what they are investigating, let us talk to him first, let us understand what statement we can get form him, because then it is easier to lead him as they have led other witnesses,other ministers they have led here in the Commission.  They have led them because they have been able to put together a statement from them with evidence and therefore they can take the Minister through the aspects.  Why has Mr Zuma been brought in this manner, if it was not cross-examine him, so I am saying in respect – this – this – he says well you know this is not a criminal charge, we are not proving a charge, we are not in a civil trial.  He is simplifying the issues, he knows that what is going on here is of interest to the criminal law enforcement processes, he knows that.  Why is he diminishing the value of this process by saying nothing, we’re not – we don’t have a charge sheet, we are not trying to prove a civil claim.In fact it is not right, now that I know what his views are on this issue it is not right the way he wants to carry on with this.  The decent thing to have done if this was a Commission witness, as others have been Commission witnesses the decent way to have done it is tosay you have the helm of the executive that we are looking at, we would like to talk to you about it.  We – they addressed a letter to Mr Mantsha, Mr Mantsha will say okay guys we will talk to the President, you come and see him at Nkandla, he will tell you exactly what you want, they then create a statement as they have done with other ministers.  Why have they done it this way?  So I am saying ...(intervention)     So I am saying let us be fair, in fact when he says it will be unfair to Mr Zuma, he is not being – that is really astatement that I shouldn’t – I think should not be dignified, because what is fair to Mr Zuma is to be treated in accordance with the spirit and the purpose of this Commission.  It is not in the spirit of this Commission to come here and say well it is in the terms of reference that we can investigate anything.  What he has just read specifically says it – it is specific, it requires that a witness makes an allegation that there is fraud and corruption, he is not left to speculation, and in fact they could have sorted out most of these things that they are asking now if they had done what they had done with the ministers.  If they had gone to him and said look I mean we’re now in the middle of a Commission you established, we would like to hear what you say about some of the things that have come up.  We will then do a statement and then we are going to bring it to the Commission and then we are going to lead the evidence, lead the evidence not cross-examine you.  So what are we meant to do with this?  It is not right, we would suggest that you seriously consider that proposal of asking them to talk to him about the things that they want; to then make a statement if they want to make a statement and then to lead him properly.  This is cross-examination and as his legal team we cannot sit there and – he can say whatever he wants to say, you do not, a cross-examination question is not – it is not practice, and he is more senior than I am, it is not practice that you say I put it to you, that is not how we identify whether this is a cross-examination or not.  The fact that he does not say I put it to you does not mean that the question is not a cross-examination question.There is serious credibility issues that he is pursuing here, that we are concerned about.  This is not how we envisaged that this Commission intends to pursue this issue.  We would seriously urge Chair that you consider asking them to see if they cannot have a conversation with the President about these issues so they have a statement from him, not to simply spring things from him that the way in which they are conducting themselves, that is why I asked the question why has he been brought here in this manner.  Why has he not been firstly invited to bring a statement, because they can do that, they cannot tell us that the Ministers that they brought here were firstly implicated on paper and then of course they must have consulted with them, I don’t – he can correct me if I’m wrong, a statement was created and then of course you have got their statements here.  Mr Zuma does not have a statement created by the evidence leaders.  Why is that so?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair, my learned friend for the evidence leaders, Ms September, during lunch gave me a single copy which is a copy that we put in the file together, I did not understand it.    That we needed to give it to…(intervention).    Chair the     I understand the question to be that the Hawks said something about this matter.    But this is not an affidavit from the Hawks.    This is Mr – this is an affidavit from Ms Mentor.    Ms Mentor.  It must be made clear that it is Ms Mentor who says this is what they said.  Not – the impression mustnot be given that the Hawks.    Are themselves saying this. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair.    Mr Zuma may we proceed then?  Thank you.  You have before you copies of the statements that have been enlarged.  I hope that is more convenient for you and that we may continue our engagement.  Thank you.  What I would like to put to youin relation to the evidence of Mr Maseko is simply what he told the Chair in his evidence so that you have an opportunity to respond to it.  And the import of what his evidence is so that you also have an opportunity to respond to that.  And if I may ask you to look at paragraph 47 and 48 on page 9.  What Mr Maseko says is that he was told by Mr Chabane that he had been instructed by the President that is yourself to redeploy me or terminate my contract henceforth.  You have already told the Chair I understand that you gave no such instruction and you explained how it would come about in the ordinary course that Director General may have his employment terminated at the hands ofthe reporting Minister.  Do you recall that?    Right.  He then says in paragraph    Yes.  Yes.  What – what is being said I think by Mr Maseko is that as far as Minister Chabane was concerned he had not done anything wrong, do you know anything about that statement and Mr Chabane’s attitude?    Then over the page on page 10 there is reference to a cabinet meeting and what Mr Maseko says in   Did Minister Chabane give you any background to the – and I use the word firing advisedly because it isused in the statement of Mr Maseko?    Did you know of the transfer then because that is dealt with in the remainder of page 10 of Mr Maseko to the post of Director General at the Department of Public Service and Administration?    Was that part of any decision thatyou made?    By the cabinet.  Let me just give you an opportunity to comment Mr Zuma on the import of the statement of Mr Maseko. Mr Maseko his evidence is that an improper approach was made to him to ensure that the full budget of the various departments for Government advertising was allocated in favour of the New Age Newspaper.  That is his evidence.  And what he at least seeks to conclude from his statement is that t the very least he was punished fornot cooperating as he was requested to do by Mr Ajay Gupta and in quoting the Minister Chabane as he does in his statement he attributes the decision to dismiss or transfer whatever that decision was to yourself.  Do you have any comment on that?    Right    If we may move on…    I would like to go to page 17 if I mayand that was the statement of Ms Mentor.  Now I am mindful of certain comments made Chair yesterday about the evidence of Ms Mentor whether it was reliable or credible in any sense and whether it would in those circumstances be fair to Mr Zuma to put anything about what Ms Mentor said.  From the legal team’s point of view firstly that is what was presaged in the correspondence but that is a formality.  It needs to be emphasised that no finding has yet been made about the credibility and reliability of her testimony.  That is a matter for later consideration and decision by yourself Chair.  Having heard all the evidence and having given everybody whois concerned an opportunity to talk.  So whatever may be said about her evidence it is cogency or otherwise it is incumbent upon us  I understand nevertheless to put her version to Mr Zuma for his comment.    In summary Mr Zuma what Ms Mentor testified to was that a member of the Gupta family “offered” and I use that word advisedly in inverted commas because whether it was an offer or not I will deal with in a moment.  A Ministerial position in exchange for favouring the commercial interests of the Gupta’s and that she goes further – she says that that offer insofar as it was an offer was made with the knowledge and approval of yourself.  Now we can go through it bit by bit.  There are other surrounding aspects of her evidence that I can put to you – I should put to you briefly in fairness but that is the essence of her evidence.  Do you want to answer it at ageneral level or shall we go into the detail?    Right.  She says in paragraph 16 to 21 of her evidence or of her statement rather that she occupied the position as Chair of a Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises.  She said she was and she uses the word elected as Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises in 2004 and that in 2010 she was removed from this position.  And again what she says is that in her opinion the reasons for her removal were twofold that she refused tomeet with yourself on that China state visit which I think you would recall because it is central to her evidence.  Let us just place that evidence properly in its context.  There was a visit to China at a stage at which you were present.  She says that there was a request that she meet with you and that she refused.  Do you recall anything about that?    Right.  She says that another reason for her removal as Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee was that she refused to assist in the closure of the SAA, South African Airways route to India. Do you know anything about that issue?    Right.  She does say that she was taken to task in relation to the China trip because Transnet actually paid for that visit and she was taken to task for that?   Transnet.    Yes.  Paid – do you know anything about that issue?    Yes well it may be put that that was the real reason and that is why I am …   It is a Parliamentary issue.    No, no but in fairness to the President I felt it in order to remind him that many people say that that was the reason and not the other reasons.  Then she talks at paragraph 26 and following Mr Zuma of the visit to China.  And she said that she travelled to China in her capacity as Portfolio Committee Chair of Public Enterprises.  Do you yourself recall that visit to China?  It was in and about August 2010 I know there may have been plenty of visits and it is …    Yes it was a state visit and in factthere was a state banquet according to her evidence in China in August 10.  A large contingent of South African officials, Parliamentarians, government officials, executive members apparently intended – attended including she says the Gupta’s. And she said at that visit the Gupta’s played a prominent role or an organisational role in the visit.  Do you recall anything of that nature?    Okay.    2010.    In or about August 2010.    Would you recall any state visit at which the Gupta’s were present and played any role whatsoever?   Would that have happened to your knowledge given your knowledge of the Gupta’s and state visits and the like?    Alright.  She also said in her statement Mr Zuma that on the evening of the state banquet in China she was approached by a gentleman who told her that you wished to meet with her at the Chinese Presidential Guest house.  Do you haveany comment or recollection in regard to that?    She of course assumed that the man who spoke to her was one of the Gupta brothers.    She assumed that.    Then in paragraph 59 if you would turn to that please Mr Zuma.   59 – paragraph 59 I am sorry.    No.  Nothing.    She says too that she communicate with Ms Lakela Kaunda who at the time she thought was your personal assistant in order to secure such a meeting.  If we could take that step by step.  Did Ms Kaunda – Ms Kaunda work in your office?    Yes.  And who – whoseresponsibility would it have been to make arrangements to meet with you?    Not Kaunda.    Right.  She says that one evening on a Sunday in or around October 2010 and in fairness to that version changed to September I think or times other than October 2010 shesaid she received a telephone from Ms Kaunda to say that you could see her the following day.  Do you recall anything of that?    Right.      In any event what she then said in her evidence and I am moving to paragraph 63.  She said that she would be met at the airport in Johannesburg and taken to a place where she would meet with you.  I understand from what you have said is that you do not recall any interaction with Ms Kaunda at all.    So the details of that interaction is not necessary to deal with.    Yes – and sorry I might have madean error.  No interaction with Ms Mentor.    No not at all.    Yes.  She then says that she was picked up at the airport, taken to a certain business premises Sahara Computers and then taken to what has become known at the Saxonwold compound.  She says there that in the course of events that morning Ajay Gupta told her that you knew of this meeting but I take it that consistent with your previous answers that is not a matter that you can comment on.    Various issues then were discussed in that meeting but at a stage she says firstly that there would be a cabinet reshuffle in the next week or so.  Do you know of a cabinet reshuffle in October 2010 for example and if I could help you there the cabinet reshuffle where Minister Gigaba was appointed to replace Minister Hogan.  That happened around October 2010 as we understand it.      Yes.    If she is to believe – be believed at all and I qualify that what I am to put to you on that basis.  It appears that Ajay Gupta would have known of a cabinet reshuffle to occur at the end of October.  Now in that regard you did say earlier that there is aconsultation process that happens before a cabinet reshuffle. Could someone like Ajay Gupta have known of such a reshuffle?    From your own knowledge.    No I understand.    So your response to that evidence isnot that he might have known but that simply the probabilities are that he did not know?  As I understand.  Ajay Gupta according to thestatement at least – the written statement that you have before you – said to her two things and I am referring to paragraph 91 if you want to go there Mr Zuma.    He said   Paragraph 91.   So what she said that Ms Mentor …    Is and perhaps for the sake of accuracy I should read paragraph 90 …    Because the status of the offer    “Immediately after his statements about SAA’s India route Ajay Gupta then very casually and much to my astonishment,proceeded to offer me the position of Minister of Public Enterprises if I would agree to facilitate the closure of SAA’s India route when I became Minister.  Ajay Gupta said there would be a cabinet reshuffle in the next week or so and he said he had an offer for me.  He said that I could be the next Minister of Public Enterprises if I agree to facilitate the closure of the route.” But the import of her statement is qualified and in fairness that qualification should be put to you.  She goes on in paragraph 91 to   May I conclude the question or do you want to interrupt Chair?    No.    No.  Let me make it clear.    In fairness to all concerned she says two things.  In paragraph 90 she said he made me an offer.  Ajay Gupta made me an offer of a presidential position.  She qualifies    Yes.    No I understand.    So for – for clarity sake …    The question put to you is not to comment on what was said between them and to interpret the conversation that happened between them …    But merely to raise the factual question arising out of that.   That Mr Gupta appeared according to Ms Mentor to be of the opinion that he could talk to you about ministerial appointments.  That is the question that has been rephrased by the Chair and is that correct or not correct?  You have an opportunity to deal with that allegation.    Then I have not made myself clear and perhaps the Chair needs to rephrase his question as well.    The question is not what happened …    Or what is interpreted about a conversation at which you were not …    Present.  The question is did Mr Gupta ever speak to you about an appointment into a ministerial position.    She then continues in her statement to say that at that stage she became angry, began to speak very loudlyand she had become what she refers to as confrontational and I am referring to paragraph 92 and it was at that moment she says that you entered the room and that she immediately informed you of the “offer” that had been made and that you did not react to that communication but tried to calm her down. That is the essence of what she says in the remaining paragraphs.  I am not sure …    Well perhaps again to afford you an opportunity to respond on page 54 and Chair …    No I am going exactly to that point.    Again MPM5 on page 54 is illegible.  So it is not of any use to anybody but I do want to refer to a betterversion of that document.  A more direct route this time Chair.    Yes.    It maybe that I should afford time to consult.  It is 1 o’ clock.  I do not know when you intend taking the …    Long adjournment.    And then the matter can be discussed in the meanwhile.    Thank you Chair.    The pages were all there in the first place they were just misplaced.    So if one looks at the typed page on the original – typed number on the original page one will see page 50 and page 33.  Do you see that Chair?    Then the next page is page 34 butpage 49 read.    And then the next page is page 51 paragraph 35 typed.    Red numbering is wrong but the page numbering typed on the original page is correct.  Are you with us Mr Zuma?    So Mr Zuma all we need for now if you would look at the black numbering is pages 33 and34 we need notworry for the moment about the rest.    So basically if one looks at paragraph 118 on page red 50.  You have that?    18.    118.    Do you have that?    On that page and in that paragraph Ms Mentor says or said that she went to lay charges against yourself and some ministers of cabinet and certain board members of certain state owned enterprises.  She did that in Cape Town.  Then inparagraph 119 she says she subsequently requested the statement from the police but was told it was with the Hawks.  And that was in Pretoria.     Nothing.    Never com.    The conduct reported here that a complainant had been advised by a member of the Hawks to exclude the President’s name – any President for that matter.  How do you regard such conduct?    Is such conduct acceptable though, that is what I am saying?  Had you known about it or had you been told about it would you have responded in any way?    Ja I am just asking if he has any view of the allegation made by Ms Mentor.  You are free to comment.    No I…    I am inviting a comment or you need not comment if you wish.    Right.  Well if I can just clarify.  What the Hawks said was that they could not proceed with the complaint – they do not say they were told or given orders by anyone.  They simply say that as long as your name appeared in the charge sheet or in the charge laid rather they could not proceed with it.  That is what they say.  Do you have any comment on what they said?    Right.    Well clearly they believed that they could not proceed with the complaint. If this is to be believed and I qualify on that basis.      Yes.    The question is simply do you have the – I am inviting you to make a comment if you wish to make a comment on the allegation that a member of the Hawks told a complainant that because your name appeared in the complaint they could not proceed with the complaint.  That is all I am saying and I am inviting you to comment if you wish.    The matter proceeded at – not in any respect that needs to be dealt with …    I thought I had made that clear but I hear what my learned friend says.    But I am…    Well Chair I recall saying at a stage if the statement of Ms Mentor is to be believed at all.  She alleges that Advocate Mtolo advised me that the reason for the delay was that I had complained about President Zuma and that their hands were consequently tied.  So if there has been mis – any misunderstanding itcan be clarified on that basis.  I am not sure if affects the gravamen of the question but the point as Ms Mentor said and if she is to be believed I repeat she says that Advocate Mtolo of the Hawks advised that the reason for the delay in processing the complaint was that you had been mentioned.  I invited you to comment and you have given your answer.      As I understand it you have had an opportunity to examine the statement.      Yes.  Mr Zuma in fairness to yourself once again we can open a channel of communication of some order here.  Your legal representative and I stress the singular will have an opportunity to re-examine you as a matter of right.  And if anything needs to be clarified or if you ever think of anything by way of explanation that opportunity will be available.  But for the moment if you want to take a moment to read you have been informed that Advocate Mtolo has a different version but what I am putting to you here is the statement of Ms Mentor not Advocate Mtolo that is what she says.  And you have given your answer.    So at least we are on the same page I think.     Thank you.  The matter then came before the Public Protector and I know in your opening you have made some submissions or statements concerning the Public Protector process and so if you wish to comment on any of the paragraphs following paragraph 124 on page red 51 please feel free to do so.  If you need time to look at them that is in order. I know it is a matter of some – that to which you paid some attention thus far in these proceedings.  I do not intend to ask you any questions in relation to the latter part of the statement.     But if you wish to comment you free to do so.    May we then…    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Zuma you didmention that you were suffering from the flu is it okay to continue still?      Good.  May we go to bundle B I would like to deal with the statement of Barbara Hogan.  It is in bundle B.    GG[b] Exhibit GG[b].  You will find the statement at the beginning of that bundle under Tab 5.      Do you have that bundle before you and that statement?    And can I take you please to the second statement because there is short statement which I am not going to deal with but a longer statement which forms the subject matter of evidence.  It appears at page 399 in the red markings.      Yes.      Yes the contents page is page 399 and the substantive part of the statement is at page 400.  If I am – inthe – I will come back to the paragraph headed the Purpose of the Statement at the end. These are really conclusions that we may deal with at the end of the statement. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. 
ADV DANIEL MANTSHA:  Sorry Chairperson I just want to put certain point here.      I was before the commission…    I think it will be fair to put to the witness that Mr Mtolo has applied to cross-examine that witness.  Meaning that the statement which is attributed to him are in dispute by him.  So it is notfair if there is a version already of Mr Mtolo that it is also not put to the witness. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  That is the point I want to make.    Chair I think – I think he should proceed.    And I will deal with …    I think the point is made. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  Chair …    I am about to overrule my own client.  I think it is – I would like us to adjourn for the day.    It is with your …    If he is not – no for the day.    Yes.    If it is fine with the Chair.    I am overruling the former President.    It is the only time I will ever have to do this.
