CHAIRPERSON:Good afternoon Mr Seleka, good afternoon everybody.    Are we ready?    Good – good afternoon Ms Daniels.    We are grateful to you for agreeing to come in and continue with your evidence this afternoon incircumstances where you were only scheduled to continue with your evidence on Friday.  We are happy that you were able to accommodate the commission.    Thank you.    Please administer the oath or affirmation again.    Thank you.    I have got it.    Mr Seleka.   The emails that Mr Koko was talking about in this context do you have any recollection whether Ms Daniels was copied on them by Mr Koko so that they would go to the Infoportal email address and to her?  Do you have any recollection of that or some of that may have been?    Yes.   Ja.    Yes.    Well I am just thinking about Mr Koko’s version.    Which you have – out of which you havejust restated because it is common cause that he sent those emails to the Infoportal email address.    It is to be accepted that it seems that therefore those emails would go to whoever was using the Infoportal address.    At this stage the evidence does not suggest that it was Ms Daniels who was behind the Infoportal address.  In other words that whoever wassending emails to the Infoportal email address was communicating with Ms Daniels. I think the – so far there is no evidence to that effect.    So – and except for what Mr Koko saidhe was told by Ms Daniels.    Namely that the Infoportal address was Dr Ngubane’s address.    Factually the evidence does not suggest that Dr Ngubane was the person to whom correspondence was directed.    By whoever was sending emails to theInfoportal email address.    Therefore if that is all correct the question that would arise is on Mr Koko’s version and I mention that because he probably is listening or watching so he and his lawyers may know what I am thinking.    On his version how would Dr Ngubane and Ms Daniels have received those emails of his?    Because they would not have gone to them.  He accepts too now that the Infoportal email address for somebody else.    So whatever emails he sent using thatemail address those emails were going to somebody else not to Dr Ngubane and not to Ms Daniels.  So when he says he had meetings with them and they had those emails how could those emails have landed in their hands?    So that – that is one of the questions he would have to deal with.    On his version.    Ja okay alright.  You understand that Ms Daniels?  You were following me?    Yes.     Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay you must just remember Mr Seleka.    At some stage Dr Ngubane would need to be questioned about this part of Mr Koko’s evidence.    To see what he knows about this version.   Ja okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay alright.    Okay.     I can see it.     I can see it.    H’m.     H’m.     H’m.    H’m.     H’m.     Do you see ...[intervenes]      Do you say that that sentence where he says give me a fixed price, I think he says, I give you the partner...  That TBC there, what is that?     Yes. MS     Oh.     Oh, then ...[intervenes]      Oh, that would tie in with the fact that noprice is given next to Project Libra Bundle?     And the fact that he writes    And ...[intervenes]      So that sentence is there to ensure that somebody gives him the price, the fixed price, that would go in there, in that price.     Okay alright.  So ...[intervenes]      H’m.     H’m.  So when he says “give me a fixed price” that would be for coal or for what?     “And I give you the partner.”  A far as you understand, what partner would he be talking about in this context?     H’m?     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      But did Eskom have the parties of giving service providers or product providers – service providers giving them partners, BEE partners?  Did they not come with their own BEE partners?    H’m?     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Now who was this note directed to, if you know?      Who was meant to read this?     Who was this meant for?     Yes.  So your issues with his note is one, the fixed price, and two, the partner?     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, proceed.     Where is the T-guys?     The last one is Komati replacement.  The one above is that ...[intervenes]      Oh, in handwritten notes “stop paying T-guys.”  You say you understand – youunderstood T-guys to be a reference to T-Systems?     H’m.  Do you know if that is still ...[intervenes]      Do you know whether that is still the same handwriting as the handwriting above or you ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Okay.     H’m.     H’m.     Yes?     Okay Mr Seleka.     Well, it is on the page.     Ja, it looks like z-e, either R or S, and either t-l-o-r or h-o-r.       But you see it on page 87.88 Mr Seleka?     Ja, okay.     H’m.     Oh, okay.     Okay.     Yes.     I think she is frozen again.     Are you back?  I think you froze for a few seconds.       I think she is back.     You can ask your question.     Ja.     Mr Seleka is going to repeat his question.     Well, that ties in with the question I wanted to ask you.  I see that those figures on that document represent revenue not for Eskom but for the entities, for certain entities, now it would be quite strange, would it not be, for Eskom to be preparing a document to see how much revenue somebody else would be making.  Would you agree with that?     Yes, Mr Seleka?     Ja, the connection is quite unstable.  It looks like you are back, Ms Daniels.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?     Okay, I just want to repeat what I understand you to be saying because as you were speaking, the connection was unstable, we could not hear parts of what you were saying.  One, did you say that you deny having arranged visas for Mr Koko and his family?     Okay, did you also deny – do you say you deny that he gave you R5 000 in regard to the arrangements for those visas?     And you said you were not moonlightingas an Eskom employee as a travel agent at the same time.     Okay, so you never arranged or you were never involved in any arrangements to help him get the visas.     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka?     I am sorry, Mr Seleka, have you moved away from bundle A or are you still with it?     Eskom bundle 8.     You are going back to Eskom bundle 18?     I think we need just to take a short adjournment so that the registrar can get my pen, it has fallen too far.  We are going to adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    I am grateful, the registrar has retrieved my pen.  Okay, now we can continue.     Yes, you can continue.     I would like you to refer to the document.     Ja, ja.     The first signature you said whose is it?     Oh, because unfortunately …[intervenes]    Okay.  It is unfortunately they did not write the names of the signatories so you either have to know their signatures or try and make it up – or rather, try and make out what it says.  So like that one [indistinct – dropping voice] that seems to be …[intervenes]     H’m?     Oh, the names are above, ja.  Okay, I think I expected them to be below.    Oh, okay.  No, no, ja, now I see it, thank you very much.     Why does it say at page 829.31    Okay.  Mr Seleka?    Did the committees not need their decisions to be approved or ratified by the board?     Okay.    Do I need to have a look at it?     No okay.     Mr Seleka I see it’s 4 o’clock, let’s take a ten minute break and then we continue.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.     Sorry Mr Seleka.     The last I heard you read out was through the resolution of Board and the committee but I do not think that is where you are now.     Have you gone back to an earlier bundle?     Because I missed you referring us to it, did you get another bundle.     Oh, okay.     I do not think both my registrar and I would have missed it, maybe I may have missed it.      I just want to have a look at what you were reading.    I am not sure that I follow Ms Daniels, I followed the logic of Ms Daniels answer but maybe it is because I am not looking at the document, when she says the legal review was still out but the decision had beentaken.  So I just want to have a look, I have been shown page 944 of Eskom bundle 14.     943.     Okay, Ms Daniels, I may have missed something.  It did not seem to make sense to me that the decision would be taken to make payment while it wasknown that a legal review was to happen, because I assumed that a legal review would give legal advice which would be necessary for the decision whether to make payment or not. Do I misunderstand something?     So - but was your understanding that the legal review was important for the BTC to have in order to make the decision whether or not any payment should be made?     And…[intervene]     But going back to the discussions at the meeting, was there anybody who said something to the effect despite the fact that we are here to receive the legal review we should authorise payment as the BTC, was their anybody who said that, or something to that effect?     Despite the fact that the legal review had not yet been received?     So the BTC, as could be expected was aware that there was a legal review still pending?     You are able to say that, and are you also able to say, they also knew that the legal review would deal with the question whether any payment should bemade at all or any further payment?     Yes, that they knew that?     Do you recall any reason that wasadvanced by anybody to say that legal review, we should not wait for, why they should not wait for the legal review.  You say they based that on their 8 August decision, you say?     I am trying to understand why a committee of the Board would say authorise payment in circumstances where it was aware that there was a legal opinion/review that was pending, which would advise onwhether there be further payment.I am trying to understand that and you have already said that as far as you are concerned, they were fully alive to the facts that one, there was still a legal review pending, two, that the legal review would deal with the question whether there should be any further payments. So I am trying to understand why they would not say let us wait for the legal review.      Well, as the company secretary, you were a company secretary at that time, is that right?     Did you say to the BTC, but it does not make sense to authorise payment before we know whether legally they should be further payment, or anything to that effect?     Oh, then I may have missed something. Did I miss something Mr Seleka, I thought we are talking about them having authorised payment of R134million or something?     Okay, do you want to take it from there?     Oh okay, but you can continue.      I thought that was…[intervene]     You accept that now?    But what does that mean?  What I am looking for - just to remind you, what I am looking for, is whether there were sound reasons why the BTC decided to authorise that payment, even before they could get a legal opinion that they knew was pending on whether any further payments should be made, because it does not sound sensible, it does not sound logical for them to authorise payment in circumstances where they accept that theyneeded a legal opinion on whether there should be further payments.  It does not sound - it does not make sense to me.  So I am trying to understand whether something somebody said something at the meeting, which would make sense tosay no, let us authorise this payment nevertheless, because of A, B, C, D and you are saying they authorised this as part of the settlement in terms of the decision of the 8 t h of August. So my question is, what does that mean, in the context of what I am looking for?     Legal review?     But was it excluded from the ambit of the legal review?  In other words, was the legal review not going to include whether such a payment, that payment should be made?     Okay, Mr Seleka.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Ja, they were not aware of that or werethey aware of that, that is the BTC of that correspondence?     Yes.      Would you have that letter in your – among your documents Ms Daniels?    Okay, alright.     Yes, but before Eskom would pay such a large amount of money, allegedly in terms of some contract, would the legal department not first have had the matter brought to them to say, can we go ahead and pay - would it be lawful if we pay or would that not happen? I am wondering whether before Mr Mabelane sent that letter you would not have sent it via or rather first raised the issue with the legal department to say, we are about to pay, is it okay, legally?     Yes.     Even if it is a large amount or maybe R134million was not regarded as large.     Was not a large amount, ja.  Okay,alright Mr Seleka.  Oh, you wanted to add something?     Are you mentioning that with a view to saying it would not fall under further payments?     Mr Seleka.     Okay, alright.  Well, subject to what somebody else might say on the face of it, it seems to me that either the BTC did not apply their minds properly to what they were doing before making this authorisation or they may have some understanding that I have not been told about, what do you say to that?   From your point of view, does their decision make sense?  That is what I want because you were at the meeting, you are the group company secretary, are youable to say you think it does make sense because of A, B, C, D?     Mr Seleka.    And that – and that of course would include you because as Company Secretary as I understand the position you are required to advise the board on compliance is it not?  The compliance with the law.    Of what – what page are they?    Oh bundle – start with the bundle    Yes.    875.    Was it not the Eskom Bundle.    Okay.  Yes.    Oh you just read the resolution part?    Is that the one that is says the feedback on the settlement?    Okay.  Yes.    And – And quite frankly when it comes to suspensive conditions it does not seem to me that you need a lawyers only.  I would image that people who are at management level, senior management level even if they were not lawyers they would know that if their department or their entity concluded an agreement with somebody and they were suspensive conditions they would know that until thesuspensive conditions were complied with then they would have been under no obligation.  Well do you want to deal with what I have just said now before you go to what Mr Seleka said?    Do you have a different …    Ja but was that not after some payments had been made?    Well that would make it worse is it not?    If – if June they were aware that suspensive conditions had not been met and they knew the effect of the non-fulfilment of suspensive conditions and nevertheless a month or two later they went along with the authorisation of payment and the payment that it just makes it worse.  Would you – would you – would you not agree?   Yes because I was raising this issue of saying well you do not have to be a lawyer really to know the effect of suspensive conditions.  You might be – if you are a senior manager; if you are at a certain level you would knowor you should know as far as I am concerned.  Now if they knew but nevertheless went along to make payment or to say payment must be authorised then – then certainly one is not dealing with an issue of oversight then.  One is maybe dealing with something much more serious than that.  You would go along with that?    Yes Mr – well of course on the basis of what I said if they knew that suspensive conditions had not been compliant with and they knew the effect of suspensive conditions then it was not – it could not have been a mistake.  They made payments knowing that they should not be making payments or they authorised payments incircumstances where they knew that they should not have done that. They must have had some other reason for doing so.  You -…    The benefit of the doubt.    Hm.    Hm.  Mr Seleka.    Did he say something you cannot say in public?    Ja that is what she is saying.      Whatever it – whatever it is.    Whatever it is that he said what did it reflect about how – what he thought about what you had raised?    And then the word that you cannot say?   Okay.  Did – did it – do you think he was making you to think that it may have been a genuine mistake?    Ja.  But at that time that – is that the impression you got that he was – he had – he was accepting that the – he was saying that we made a mistake – we made a genuine mistake?   Ja.    Ja.  Okay.    Did you also take him through the same process?    Ja the reasoning okay.  Mr Seleka.   Mr Mabelane in that letter seems to write on the basis that the R134 million is excluded or was excluded from the – or – ja was excluded from the pending legal review.  I think this is something that you seemed tohave said – to have said earlier on in response to one of my questions too.  Is that your understanding of his letter as well?    What was the basis for excluding any payments from the legal review as you understood the position?    Hm.    Hm.  But the – it had been decided by whoever it was who made the decision that there was a need for a legal review on whether or not payments should bemade or further payments should be made.  When was that decision taken by whoever took that decision?    Ja.    So that was a decision that you took and you took it in December 2016?    Way after the meeting of 8 August?    And – and Mr Mabelane’s letter is dated ...[intervenes]      13 December?  Was that – was that after – that would be after you had made a decision?     But when you made the decision, did you exclude the R 134 million from the need for a legal opinion?     Yes.     Yes.  So ...[intervenes]      Yes.     But was your decision this.  We need to have a legal opinion on whether any payments should be made to Trillian or McKinsey?  Was that the ambit of your decision?     Which seems to be – which seems to me to have been all-embracive?     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m?     H’m.  But earlier, on the 8 t h of August, the BTC had said some payments needed to be made.  Is that correct?     Ja.  And did that decision – did the R 134 million fall within the payments that the BTC said should be paid on the 8 t h of August?    As you understood the decision.     Yes.     So you understood the officials who, including Mr Mabelane, who said that R 134 million was owed by Eskom, you understand them to have regarded theR 134 million as part of the R 800  and something million that the BTC talked about?     H’m.  Mr Seleka.     Yes.    Also, do you know of any reason why anybody who knew that you had said that there was a need for a legal opinion on whether a further payment or payments should be made by Eskom under this contract,why they would have gone ahead to have payments made without saying to you, your issue relating to legal opinion, does this affect this as well or not?  Do you know why they would not have done that?     Because I think that even with the fact that the BTC may have made a decision in August, that certain payments should be made, once you raise the issue, I would have thought that anybody who was awarethat you are raising the issue of whether Eskom was legally obliged to make any payments, I would have thought that they would say, hang on, let us wait for this opinion, even about whatever the BTC may have decided because they may have made that decision without the benefit of a legal opinion, and if the legal opinion came, it might persuade them to rethink their own decision.     H’m.    Okay Mr Seleka.     And the letter is on?     Or the memo or whatever.  The letter or memo that she says she signed?     Oh, okay.    And but it was signed on the same day?       Was it signed on the day you received it?      Or when did you sign it?     21?     H’m.  Okay.  We stop there...?     H’m? ADV SELEKA     Okay we will stop here, Ms Daniels, fortoday but of course you will be coming back on Friday at two o’clock.     Is two o’clock the earliest you can makein terms of – from your side in terms of the difference in time or is one o’clock also doable?     Oh, okay.     Okay.     No, no, no.  That is fine.  Let us leave itat two o’clock.  It is just that, Mr Seleka, I am thinking we might finish earlier with the morning witness of Friday.  Is it Mr Pamensky?     Oh, okay.  Okay.     No, no, no.  The ...[intervenes]      Okay.  No, no.  No, no.  I thought it wasMr Pamensky.  No, no.  Let us leave it for two o’clock because...     We might finish early.     H’m.     With Ms Daniels?     Ja.  No, okay, let us leave the arrangement at two o’clock.  Say you will testify at two o’clock.  Okay alright.     Okay thank you.  I am going to take a short adjournment before the next witness takes the stand.    To give you a chance to settle.     Okay we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay.     Are you ready Mr Seleka?     Yes.       Yes.    Yes-no, that is fine.  I understand she is legally represented.  Shall we ...[intervenes]      ...have her legal representatives to place themselves on record first?     You can do it from where you are if your mic is working.     Okay.  Thank you.  Okay please administer the oath or affirmation.     Sorry.  I am not sure if that was loud enough.  Please, just speak up more.     Thank you.  You may be seated.     Kusile.     Ja, basically, Ms Kraai is the person thatMr Masango says he told or informed her about the meeting that he says he attended with Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa at Melrose Arch ...[intervenes]      ...on the 10 t h.     So Ms Kraai’s evidence will seek to say whether that is so but if it did happen, it happened in the telephone conversation that Mr Masango says he had with Ms Kraai ...[intervenes]     ...after that meeting on the 10 t h as well as in another meeting or in a meeting the following day.     But Mr Masango may have talked abouta meeting on the side of the road and so on but Ms Kraai will deal with all of that.     Okay alright.     You may proceed.     And maybe just to mention because noteverybody might remember the meeting of the 10 t h as much as we do.     The meeting of the 10 t h of March 2015 that Mr Masango testified about, is the meeting where he says he was told about the suspension of the Eskom Executives even before they were suspended and Mr Koko has said no such meeting took place.     Okay.      Oh, just explain the black numbers to her.     That is the signature on – just above the words “signature of deponent”.  Is that your signature?     Yes ...[intervenes]      There are two signatures.  So I just wanted to make sure that you know which one we are talking about.     Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     59, the black numbers on the top left-hand corner.     Is that page where your signature is, the one we were talking about just now.       The affidavit of Ms Nonhlanhla Dahlia Kraai starting at page 52 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit U-26.1. AFFIDAVIT OF NONHLANHLA DAHLIA KRAAI IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT U-26.1     And that affidavit is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit U-26.2. SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT OF MS NONHLANHLA DAHLIA KRAAI IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT U-26.2     Congratulations.     Ja.     At Kusile?    Ja, okay.     Well, before you go there Mr Seleka.  Do you want to ask her what her duties were in her position in 15?  What were your duties, generally, insofar as they may be relevant to your interactions with Mr Masango at work?     In other words, what connected you with Mr Masango.     What was...  So were both of you based at Kusile Power Station, that is yourself and Mr Masango?    In 2015.     And what was Mr Masango’s position or title at Kusile at that time if you are able to remember?    Yes.     Had the two of you been working at Kusile Power Station for quite some time by March 2015?     Yes, okay.  Did your duties require you to have meetings with Mr Masango at certain intervals or atall or not really?     H’m.  And when you talk about the risk to the project or risks to the project, you talk about the Kusile Project or ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Oh, okay.     Okay.     Mr Seleka, you want to take it from there?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     And what meeting was that?     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      Was that meeting a meeting of a certain committee that has got a name or ...[intervenes]      It was ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Who were going to attend that meeting?     What were their names?     Or ...[intervenes]      Ja, you do not mention all of them.    But at least those or some of the people ...[intervenes]      Ja, you said one of them was Dudu who?     Okay.     And you mentioned another one, the first one ...[intervenes]      Oh, reporting to you?     Okay.     And was there somebody not reporting to you that was going to attend?     You have mentioned two ...[intervenes]      Mention the two of them for me?    Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     No, that is fine.     It is fine.  By the time you left Eskom, were they still there?  Were they still employed by Eskom?     Okay.       Do you have any reason to believe that they would remember the issue of that meeting?     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Okay, alright.     Okay continue.  I interrupted you.    Okay.     So are you saying that whenever there was to be a meeting such as the one that was planned for the 11 t h ...[intervenes]      ...he would want to have a meeting with you ...[intervenes]     ...ahead of that meeting?     So that you would brief him on ...[intervenes]     ...on issues.     Yes.     Oh, okay.     Mr Seleka.     Okay, okay before he said that.  What gave rise to him saying that?  Did you phone him?  Did you meet in the morning or how did...?     And ...[intervenes]   And around – do you rememberroundabout what time of the day or morning this was, when his secretary called you?     No?     The day before the 10 t h?     The 9 t h?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay alright.     So the secretary was arranging a meeting for you and Mr Masango ...[intervenes]      ...to ...[intervenes]   To meet during the lunchtime ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Ja.     Okay.    Ja.     Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     First of all.  Had you agreed to the suggestion that the two of you should have a meeting ...[intervenes]     You did?     Ja.     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Okay but you say the meeting did not happen?     Okay.     Mr Seleka is asking why did it not happen.     You say it did not even go into voicemail, your call …[intervenes]     It was full?     And it did not ring?     Or did it ring but did not go into voicemail or did it not ring at all?     Oh.     Mr Seleka?     So he called you?  And what did he say in the conversation?     Ja, tell me about that telephoneconversation between the two of you.     As fully as you are able.     That is what he said in the telephone …[intervenes] MS     And what did you say?     Okay.  Did the conversation end?     Yes.     Now you referred – you said he said there was indoda emfushane in that meeting, do you wantto …[intervenes]     Hang on, hang on, do you want to say what you understood indoda emfushane to mean in English?     Okay, that is what that phrase means?     Okay, alright.     But you said he – I think he was returning your call.     But if your call did not even go through he would not have known you had called.     Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?    In that telephone conversation.     Yes and did you meet the following morning?     Around what time was it?     Yes.     And the meeting that was going to involve the other – or project managers I think you said, the other people, the bigger meeting, what time was it going to be?     Okay and you met with him at 6 a.m.?     Yes.     Yes.  So he was going to tell you …(intervenes)     What his views …[intervenes]     Which he would share with the others at the meeting.     Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     So on the 10 t h when he spoke to you on the phone he told that the reason why he did not make it for the lunch meeting that was [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Hang on one second.     Hang on one second.  He told you that the reason why he could not make it for that meeting with you was because he had been called to a meeting at Melrose Arch and he had been called by Mr Koko and he had had a meeting with Mr Koko and a short Indian man, isthat right?     And when you asked him what had happened at that meeting, he did not tell you on the conversation but he said …[intervenes]     …he would tell you more …[intervenes]     When you met in the morning on the 11 t h.    And on the 11 t h when you met the issue was discussed but he just told you that he had been told at that meeting that he would act as Group Capital?  What is the title?     Group Capital Executive, ja.     Who position was that?     So he said he would act – he had been told he was going to act in that position?     And you …[intervenes]     You were surprised and you asked him what would happen to …[intervenes]     Yes.     And he did not give you an answer for that?     Then you asked who was going to act inhis position?     And then he gave you answer?     He said he did not know.     And he did not tell you about any suspensions?     Yes.    Okay, is that the sum total of your conversation at that meeting of the 11 t h insofar as it related to his meeting the previous day?MS     Whatever else you discussed related to the presentation.     Yes.     Yes.    Okay, alright.  Could you be mistaken about your conversation with him on the 10 t h on the phone and your conversation with him on the 11 t h?     Yes and on the 11 t h?     Yes.  But the things that you say hementioned, could you be mistaken about them?     About them, they things that you say he did mention, could you be mistaken about them?     Okay, alright.     Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     Okay.   You [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Did he say they would step aside?  Do you remember whether the communiqué said that the executives would step aside? You cannot remember?     Okay.     Ja, yes?     Okay.     Okay, alright.     Did – going back to your meeting with Masango on the 11 t h in the morning did he tell you the name of the person to whom he referred to as a short Indian man?     He never told you?     And you did not ask.     Alright.     Yes.  Now I seem to think Mr Masango said he met with you on the side of the road on the 10 t h. Did that happen on the 10 t h when he came back from that meeting?     Okay, alright.  So he must be mistaken about that if that is what he says as far as you are concerned.     Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     Mr Seleka, the email screen shots or prints at page 55 and page 58, do we have something clearer than what we have here?    Oh.     Will she be able to – that is Ms Kraai – to read into the record what appears on those screen prints?    Cover that. ADV SELEKA     Let us cover that, ja.    As you have said, Mr Seleka, she is testifying on very narrow issues.     So I want to us to finish as soon as possible.     With her evidence.  There is no need for us to stay for too long because the area she is covering is very narrow.    Ja, okay.  Ms Kraai, will you be able to read?  Let us start with the screen print at page 55.     I think in the paragraph 10 you say    Who is the author of the document.     And to whom is it directed and what is the date of the document?     Okay.     It was directed to?     Oh and then the rest of the people that you mentioned?    Okay, that is fine, you do not have to mention all of them.     And what did it say – what was the date of the …[intervenes]     No, the actual …[intervenes]     The date of the print or whatever was sent to them, the email or whatever, what was the date of it?  Was it sent on the 10 t h or 11 t h or is that not clear?     Okay, alright.  What did it say to them,to the addressees?     Oh, what it is it?     Okay.     Yes and that is all that is important about that print that is contained there.     And then we go to the one at page 58 of your affidavit.     Page 7 of your affidavit but page 58 ofthe paginated bundle.  Yes, Ms Kraai?     Yes, paragraph 23 says    And you say on what day was that?     Oh, on the 16 t h.     Okay, alright.     Thank you.  Mr Seleka?     In other words, Mr Koko has said that Mr Masango’s evidence that he had a meeting with him and Mr Salim Essa, because that is what Mr Masango has testified, on the 10 March 2015 is not true.  He has given evidence as to why he says Mr Masango would falsely implicate him but he says that at that time he and Mr Masango had a -  were very close – they were getting onvery well, but he says later, and I think it may be 2017.     Their relationship seemed to have soured, but then I asked him well Mr Masango says he told Ms Kraai about this meeting on the 10 t h in a telephoneconversation and – about this meeting why would – and Ms Kraai confirms that in her affidavit, why would, then, Ms Kraai say that Mr Masango told him something that she didn’t tell him and I think Mr Seleka is going there to say, well what would you say if Mr Koko’s response is you were colluding against him, you were colluding with Mr Masango against him because I think he said – didn’t he say, Mr Seleka, that he laid some criminal complaints or he raised – he made some allegations of misconduct on the part of Ms Kraai?    I think you must put that.     That’s and Inquiry now?    Were you being interviewed as part of the investigation?    Not a disciplinary hearing as yet?     Okay.     But was Mr Koko, to your knowledge, involved in any way in these allegations being brought against you?     You don’t know?     And when you tendered your resignation, did Eskom allow you to serve your notice…[intervenes].    Hang on, hang on, Ms Kraai, we can’t speak at the same time.     Did they allow you to serve your full notice?     They didn’t say after you tendered your resignation, okay you don’t need to serve your notice youcan go?     Yes, was that before they proffered any disciplinary charges against you when you tendered your resignation?     Was it before they tendered any charges or proffered any charges…[intervenes].     Yes.     So, in your letter of resignation ofMarch, you continued to cooperate with them…[intervenes].     Even after you were…[intervenes].     And did they follow-up?     Up till today?     Have you been charged criminally about anything arising out of that?    Ja, okay, Mr Seleka?     Did you know Mr Koko before the 10 t h of March 2015?     Had there been any issues at any stage between the two of you before …[intervenes].    Before he gave his evidence before this Commission and said whatever he said about you, did you know of any issues that might have been there before…[intervenes].     Yes, okay, alright.     Mr Seleka?     Is there anything you could have benefited by falsely implicating Mr Koko?     Hmm.     Okay, alright.  Counsel for Ms Kraai do you wish to re-examine.     Okay, thank you.  I think we are going to adjourn at this stage, tomorrow is it Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Seleka who is giving evidence tomorrow?     And who is giving evidence tomorrow?     Oh, it’s a different work stream.     Oh.     Well, we must talk because my schedule reflects him ja, and I’ve not given any permission that he should not come.     You will remind me, have I given?     Oh, okay.     Well, if you say I have given, I willaccept your…[intervenes].     Oh, is that so?     Oh, so I was quite kind. Okay, alright,   Okay, I’m not able to tell the public who will give evidence during the day tomorrow but in the evening, for the evening session I will hear the evidence of the former Minister of Transport, Ms Dipuo Peters who will continue and completeher evidence and then on Thursday you said it will be Eskom.     Ja.     Okay, alright.  Ms Kraai thank you very much for availing yourself to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very much.     And, to come in the evening and thank you to your legal team as well.     Thank you, we are going to adjourn for the day, we adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Afternoon Chairperson.    We are ready Chairperson.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels thank you again for making yourself available.  Chairperson with the arrangement made with Ms Daniels coming up today is thatshe will deal with certain aspects of her evidence which will exclude the last item we were dealing with with her which was the penalties and the details on the penalties, the calculations, the concerns that were raised by CDH what – she will deal with that on Friday when she comes back at two o’clock again.For present purposes there are certain items of her evidence that she will deal with and that Ms Daniels emanate mainly from the allegations made by Mr Koko in relation to yourself and then we will deal lastly with theMcKinsey Trillian matter insofar as it pertains to your involvement.  You follow that?    Thank you.  So even though we are notgoing to deal with the – the penalties Ms Daniels we were busy in your last appearance leading your evidence on the penalties but I would like you to by reference to your affidavit explain to the Chairperson and I will give you’re the reference now.Chairperson that will be her affidavit on the transactions which is Eskom Bundle 18(a) it is Exhibit U34.1 on page 236.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels dealsspecifically with the – with the transactions from page 264 with the penalties.  Ms Daniels what I would like you to explain to the Chairperson as you said last time that the concerns that were raised by CDH were communicated to the Executives; could you be specific in regard to the Executives with whom those concerns were raised and what was the attitude of the Executives in response to those concerns?    Can you recall the basis on which Mr Koko suggested that the claim be settled at R500 million?   And what was Mr Singh’s attitude or reaction?   You said you refused the proposal to settle at R500 million what was your basis for refusing?    No.  Could you please tell the Chairperson about the memorandum that you and amongstother Mr Snehal prepared and signed I think you submitted it to the board – to the BTC.In that memo if you please can tell the Chairperson whether you recommended settlement at any particular amount and I say this because Mr Gert Opperman hasgiven a figure of R740 million and in Mr Snehal’s affidavit we came across reference to R1.17 billion as the potential claim that Eskom would have had against Tegeta.So in your memo if you could tell the Chairperson what is it that you told the BTC?    When Mr Molefe was here; Mr Brian Molefe he mentioned that the figure of R2.17 billion was properly documented.  Your comment on that?    Hm.  Yes I think you should make it clear  whether the ultimate view which you submitted to the BTC to settle the claim at a lesser amount than you had – than you had in mind either the R740 million, either the R1.1 billion that had been suggested by CDH give us a senses of whether the factors that motivated the settlement arose only in 2016 when you took over or were they there from the very beginning when the claim was instituted against OCM under Glencore?    Hm.  Can you recall exactly when was that meeting?    Okay.  Now in regard to the emails that Mr Koko sent to Infoportal from the 25 – no the 20 t h of July15 when he comes back from suspension Mr Koko has said that – has in fact conceded that this email address belongs to a person outside of Eskom but he has nonetheless maintained that after every email that he sent to Infoportal you and him and Dr Ngubane would have a meeting about the document attached to the email.  What do you say about that version of his that you had meetings every time after he sent the email to Infoportal?    Hm.    Yes.    I have – I have the answer - ah no Chairperson.  The emails were not copied to her.    There is only one email it is not even copied it is a forwarding to her.    The one which she has just mentioned of the guarantee.   It came from Infoportal on the 10 t h of December 2015 setting out the terms of what should be the guarantee.  That email Mr Koko forwards to Ms Daniels’ email address and Ms Daniels then instructs CDH on the basis of that email.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    That is right Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes    Yes.     Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.  Correct.   Ja.    Yes Chair.    Correct.    Yes.    Chair I – I have already long ago reached out to his attorney and asked him to provide us with an affidavit.    And I have also recently asked him – followed up on that.  I understand from him that the draft is ready but the client is going through it which is Dr Ngubane.   So we will …    Hopefully give you 00   Ja.  Ms Daniels talking about your knowledge of the – some of the transactions you see in those emails we have when Mr Koko was here tried to compare those transactions to the list that you have attached to your affidavit – I mean you superimposed on your affidavit but you also attached it to your supplementary submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  Are you able to take us through that and see the extent to which there is a comparison between the two?    I can tell you where the list is.     Okay.  It is in Eskom Bundle 8.  I will use your supplementary submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on page 87.88.     88.     SMD ...[intervenes]      Sorry.  SMD-4.     Okay.     Yes?    Sorry, Ms Daniels.     Sorry, just before you go on to McKinsey.  I just want to read to you.  You have mentioned     Yes.     Okay.  You have said that this list, Mr Koko had it with him on the 20 t h of July 2015 as a list of transactions his principals have told him to focus on. When Mr Koko was here we put that version to him and in response he said the list, actually, it was given to him by yourself.  What is your response to that?     Yes.     H’m.  He has also said that he recalls the list and that the handwriting on the list is his.  I do not know whether you are able to tell?  I mean, if he concedes that is his handwriting, I suppose that is what it is.       Yes.     Is that at the part where the ...[intervenes]      Yes?    Yes, proceed.     It is right at the – after the ...[intervenes]      After the ...[intervenes]      It is below the table.     Yes.     And the alphabet F that is written below that, do you know what that is supposed to mean?     Thank you.  Now Ms Daniels, can you give us the spelling for that name or the name of that company.     The one of that company.     Yes.     Okay, Zeselor, l-o-r?    Okay.  Or Zestilor or something.  You know, I just remember from the Eskom media reports that that company belonged to Mr Essa’s wife.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.  No, I am there.       I just wanted certainty on the spellingof that.     Yes.     Yes.  Then Ms Daniels, there is McKinsey, the third item.  Do you have anything to say on CPI Investigations? MS     I think it is frozen.    Yes.  Do you have anything to say on CPI Investigations?    Alright.  I see what you are saying.  So the revenue ...[intervenes]      Sorry, the sound seems to be distorted and delayed.  Can you hear me now?     Yes.  So what you ...[intervenes]      Yes.  In regard to the revenue, you are saying these are revenue projections, not for Eskom, but it would be revenue projections ...[intervenes]      Yes, it would be revenue projects forwhoever wants these transactions to be procured for them.     H’m.  Do you know, subsequent to you seeing this list - and as you said made a copy of it – do you know whether a party or parties were given contracts in relation to some of these transactions?     Well, I do not know ...[intervenes]     Yes, proceed.     Yes.  The Online Vending cash unlock, do you know what does it entail or did it entail?     Did you hear Ms Daniels?     H’m.     Can you hear us?     Ja.     Yes, we can hear you now.     Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]     Yes, thank you, Chair.  I asked whether you know what Online Vending cash-unlock entailed?     Okay.  Do you know whether McKinsey was contracted to render that service?     Okay.  You do not know personally?     H’m.  So then, just to finalise on this.  Is – what is your testimony on this, what is your evidence on this?  Is it that this list - just to be clear, this list would have been a list from a third party outside of Eskom given to Mr Koko, showing a list of transactions with projections of revenue that the third party outside of Eskom wouldhave wanted to procure for their own entity for themselves with Eskom?     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  And lastly, Ms Daniels, because what took us here was the emails, MrKoko’s emails.  We have seen they do give us free features in those emails, online vending, cash, unlock features in those emails but there was also an email regarding his visas travelling to Dubai with two members of his family and he said that was arranged by you.  Your response?    Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, there is another – oh, then I asked you – yes, that was about the visa, that is right.  There is a statement you made – and Iwill come back to this later on, but I want to read it to you, your last affidavit, talking about the BTC which approved a transaction with Trillian, the payment to Trillian.  We will come back to it but let me read to you and see whether it relates to some of the items you have read on the list.  It     Does this by any means relate – or some of these items related in list that we have just gone through?    Yes.  So we will come back to that BTC approval.  That means McKinsey did get  - to be paid in relation to some of these translations on the list.  I mean, Trillian.     Yes, I beg your pardon.  Maybe we should go into the Trillian matter.  So according to the testimony of Ms Mosilo Mothepu, there is proposal to be made firstly by Regiments which is thought to be teamedup with McKinsey.  They are making those proposals to offer services under the master services – the master services agreement, the service level agreement.  And as I read from a paragraph in her affidavit, some of the projects were included to the original or initial proposal by Mr Kokoand Mr Singh and she specifically mentioned online vending …[intervenes]     From which one, Chair?     Yes, I am moving away from it.  I want to …[intervenes]     I want to go to Eskom bundle 14C andE, 14B and C in Eskom – I think the files have been regularised, the affidavit I would be referring to, Chair, is in 14(B) of Moodley, Mr Moodley specifically from page 941, Eskom bundle 14(B).  Thank you, Chair.    Ms Daniels, you can hear us?     Yes.  I would like you to deal with thematter, now that we have gone through the list and McKinsey is mentioned and reading from the affidavit of Ms Mothepu, that paragraph and your paragraph relating to the approval by the BTC in August 2016 to make a payment to Trillian in the amount of R207 million in respect of some of the transactions we have mentioned.   Mr Moodley of CDH has submitted an affidavit to the Commission in which he deals with certain aspects relating to McKinsey and Trillian that involves you in the instructions to CDH and recommendations made to theboard.  Now we know from the evidence before the Commission that huge amounts of money were paid to Trillian to the tune of 1.2 billion.  In fact the BTC had approved R1.8 billion to be paid to Trillian.   There is a submission made in December 2016 which deals partly with some of the payments to Trillian and then ultimately the decision made by the BTC in February 2017 that deals with the last payment for Trillian and McKinsey.  Now it is alleged that you also played a role inensuring that the BTC approved those payments.  I would like you to give your version to the Chairperson and if you want me to give you more information I could do so but to the extent that you would have read Mr Moodley’s affidavit, can you please deal with firstly the termination of –purported termination of the MSA agreement by Eskom and how these payments to Trillian and McKinsey were made.     Yes.     Yes.  Can I – Chair, I …[intervenes]     No, no, that is alright, I just want to find out from the Chairperson something.  Chair, I could refer to the documentation in order for the Chairperson tofollow the evidence or she could, you know, go freehand …[intervenes]     To the documentation.    Thank you.  Well, for that reason, Chair, we will have to change the file to 14C.  Eskom bundle 14C and we will start on page 829.25.  Ms Daniels, have you found that page?     It is a submission document.     Yes, no, that is alright.  Just follow the page numbers, 829.25.    You have that.  Now I know you have talked about the period in July 2016.  We see in this submission the figures that you are referring to.     No, I think you are correct about the termination which is made in July or in fact it is June 2016 but please identify the document to the Chairperson?     So who would have compiled this document?    Yes.     It should be there, Chair.    The names should be there, just above their designations.     Yes, that is right.     Yes, Chair.  Ms Daniels, do you say it was approved by Mr Anoj Singh?     Yes and what …[intervenes]     Yes, thank you.  Ms Daniel, we go back to page 1 of – the first page of this document, which is page 829.25 and explain there the resolution which is required in the submission, the submission document dated 8 August 2016.     Yes, the termination letter.  Sorry, just mention the page reference is on page 877.26, it is a termination letter by Eskom to McKinsey dated 16 June     Ms Daniels, insofar as you say the reason for termination was, I think you said, due to the parties’ failure to reach an agreement on the terms and I want you to come back to this because CDH was advising you on whether or not this master services agreement ever in fact came into being and my question, just before you move on, is this.  If the parties could not agree on the terms was there in law or in fact an agreement to terminate?     Okay and by the way you will see that – I just want to mention this because you mentioned the agreement was concluded early in the year.  The affidavit of Dr Weiss says that he received a copy of a signed – assigned by Eskom of the MSA towards the end of September/early October 2016 when he signed it and backdated it to January 2016.  So just to mention that to you, are you aware of that?     So what it means is …[intervenes]     Carry on, sorry?     What it means is that at a time the agreement was purported to be terminated in June 2016 when the BTC takes a decision on 9 June 2016 in fact there was no agreement signed at least by McKinsey.       Ja, we will take you to his affidavit in a short while but let us go through this.       What is required in the submission?     Explain the submission to the Chairperson.     Yes, so the agreement – this followsafter the agreement, if you take the sequence of events, there is a termination or purported termination of the agreement.  There is then submission to the BTC that according to CDH it follows after a letter of demand from McKinsey.  After Eskom terminates, McKinsey sends aletter of demand saying pay me x amount.  The executive then make the submission to the BTC that Eskom would be liable to 2.8 billion but they have negotiated an amount of 1.8 billion and they want the approval of the BTC for that payment to be made to McKinsey and a BEE partner, is that correct?     Did you play any role in regard to the submission?     Well, the BTC resolution is to be found on page 875.2 in respect of the submission.  875.2.  Let me know when you are there?     Now it is a resolution, it is an extract from approved minutes of the special Eskom board tender committee on 8 August 2016 at 15h00 and I see the extract is signed by you.  Do you see that on the 8 November 16?    And it says    Ja, but what does that mean when you were parting ways with them, you terminated their – or at least insofar as Eskom is concerned, has terminated theMSA, what further engagement was there to be made with the supplier?     Okay, so you know that, that R800million was paid?     Okay, so that – the payments weremade on the 12 t h of August , two payments to Trillion directly and one payment of R596million to McKinsey on the 15 t h of August.  Let’s go, specifically, to what happens in December.  So, this is in August 2016, let’s go specifically to what happens in December where you aredirectly approached by Mr Prish Govender.  Now, Mr Moodley in his affidavit has said, you approached – you wanted him to give advice and you need to tell the Chairperson what that advice was which you wanted from them.  A submission was being drafted which contained an insertion that legal review had been obtained from CDH and you have been criticised for having including that insertion in that submission and thereby caused the BTC to make a decision for further payment to Trillion. Would you please explain to the Chairperson your – your role in thatmatter?     Mr Moodley is Eskom Bundle 14 (b) on page 941. Now, in December, while you go there, a payment of  R134million was made to Trillion.     No Chair.     Sorry, Ms Daniels, because I think you need to explain to the Chairperson, the advice that had been sought from CDH because part of that – it did not relate to whether you could defend the claim or the demand that was being made by McKinsey and Trillion.    Yes, and Mr Moodley says, they did not advise Eskom on the conclusion of this contract so they required the contract to be provided to them. Upon studying the contract, they saw that the contract used the terminology that was foreign to them, they were not familiar with the concepts and they asked for documentation from Mr Prish Govender and I think, also, from yourself, is that correct?    And – now we are in December when they ultimately got the documentation and were in a position to provide you with a final opinion on the matter.  That opinion indicatedthat there were suspensive conditions in that agreement that appeared to them not to have been fulfilled on the due date and the due date was the 31 s t of January 2016, the opinion was given in February 2017, you recall that?     You confirm that?    Can you then…[intervenes].     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels with that explanation or feature or facts in mind of what CDH was required to do CDH ultimately advised that the suspensive conditions appear not to have been fulfilled, now you can take the Chairperson into the meeting of the 13 t h ofDecember 2016 because that meeting, that is where the submission was made and the significance of what was said to the BTC in respect of that submission, and that CDH’s services were retained.     Sorry, Ms Daniels just before that report. Are you saying despite the insertion, in the submission, that conveyed the message that the legalreview had been obtained, in the sense that CDH had been retained to advise Eskom on whether or not to proceed with payments to McKinsey you advised the Board that that legal review had not been received?     But I understand that that message was in fact not conveyed to the BTC, what is your response to that?     So why then did the BTC approve the payment of R134million to Trillian?     So are you saying the legal review was of no significance with the BTC decision?     The reason I am asking you that is because that legal, the insertion that was made in the submission, says that Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr was retained to conduct the review and the conclusion is that Eskom needs to enter into a termination agreement with the parties to bring the matter to finality.  This will absolveEskom from any further liability once the termination agreement is in place.  Now, that was not correct?     Ja, but it was also never correct because when CDH ultimately gave the legal review, if you like, they said something opposite to this, they advised that in fact, it appears that there is no agreement to terminate.     Yes…[intervene]    Yes, Chair.     No, Chair, we…[intervene]     Not even an earlier one we are – ja it is one of the earlier ones in Mr Moodley’s affidavit Chair.    Okay, 14B.     That is 14B.     14B, page 943.     Yes, page 943.     Go to the 943 Chair.     The one before, paragraph 96, you will see a quotation with eight external legal review, the number eight external legal review.      They authorised that payment, Ms Daniels.     Yes, the submission – that is what the submission request - but now it is in a different file Chair.    Yes.      Let me read the resolution, the resolution of 13 December 2016.  Which, again Ms Daniels    The – yes and I understand the Chairperson question.  Ms Daniels, I think just clarify to the Chairperson, what happened Chair, Oliver Wyman and Marsh does that draft report in which there is a - after they have reviewed the invoices of Trillian and McKinsey there appears to be this R134million that has to be paid.  But     This falls outside of our scope.     Are you talking about the letter of 16 February 2017?     Because we do not have the letter you are referring to.     The R134million?    But if it is made or issued after BTC meeting, it was then consistent with the BTC decision which I have just raised or I read it earlier.  They are approving a payment of R134million to the BEE partner who is not mentioned in the resolution, but we know it is Trillian which is owned by Mr Salim Essa as the majority shareholder, we do not have that letter.     Yes, no, we have those – the minutes and that extract, that extract I read to you Ms Daniels, it reads, they read the same.    Thank you, Chair Ms Daniels that wasnot the last payment because there is another meeting which was pending – well maybe not pending but would take place in the following year in February 2017.  And another payment was made in fact two payments; one to Trillian and the other to McKinsey R176 million toTrillian and R348 million to McKinsey.  Can you tell the Chairperson how that came about because it still ties in with the legal review that you are still waiting for.  That legal review has not been received and a decision was made again to make these two payments; one to Trillian and the other to McKinsey.Well let me – let me say this to you because you would have seen from the affidavits of Mr Moodley affidavit, what Mr Koko has also testified about that you signed the memorandum I think on the 20t h of February 2017 whichagain they say caused payment to be made in February 17.So they blame you again for signing that memorandum.  Now please tell the Chairperson what happened?    Yes please.    No sorry Ms Daniels just sorry, sorry I am interrupting you but the suspensive conditions how is it that external lawyers saw the suspensive conditions but Eskom and the internal lawyers did not appreciate the need for the fulfilment of those conditions?   Ja which – which makes it all the more important to wait for the legal review.  Were you – you had two meetings during the time Eskom was awaiting a legal review and those two meetings in two separate – on two separate occasions decide to make payments without the legal review. And when the legal review ultimately comes out it tells you that that this agreement does not seem to have    Ja.    The – the 8 t h of February 2017 meeting we have the minutes and we have the extract again signed by you.  It is definitely a payment approval.  So and I will read for the record it is in Eskom Bundle 14(c) page 875.3. “It was resolved that the feedback on the settlement reached with McKinsey and thepayment of R460 million by Eskom as part thereof in full and final settlement of all claims in terms of the Master Service Agreement be noted and supported by the BTC.”And then the Chairperson was asking a question whether this is going to pay McKinsey and the BBEE partner the    So on the 17t h.  And they gave the final one on the 28t h of February 2017.  By that time Eskom had paid all the – all the money that it had undertaken to pay.    But anyway the facts Chair are just the same in respect of the December payment the same applies December 2016 the same applies in February 2017.  Thelegal review had not been obtained and decisions were made    Oh.  You have…   Eskom Bundle 14.    Page 875.3.  Oh 14(c).    875.    .3.    So 875.3 is an extract again from theminutes which is signed by Ms Daniels.  The minutes continue on the next page.  But I just read the resolution to her.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    The feedback on settlement reached withMcKinsey and the payment of R600 and R460 million by Eskom as part thereof in full and final settlement of all claims in terms of the Master Service Agreement be noted and supported by the BTC.  It even seems Ms Daniels as if the BTC was simply rubber stamping or noting what hadalready been done or decided to be done.  Did you hear me?    Because they note and support.    The payment of R460 million.  Do they    No.    So what did Mr Singh say when you approached him?    What did Mr Singh say?    Oh is that what she is saying.    Thank you.  Ms Daniels but was he not already aware that there was no legal review yet when decisions were – when these two decisions were made in December and in February?    Mr Singh was at the meeting of the 8t h of February.    Then he would have known.  Ja I can immediately see whether he was in the December meeting as well.  But anyway you said earlier that the Executives were manipulating the – the situation in order to make the payment.  Are you saying this now on reflection or did you observe this that time when this was taking place?    So Mr Singh was at – had tendered an apology in respect of the meeting of the 13t h of December 16.  But he was one of the officials authorised in terms of the resolution to negotiate and conclude the settlement process with McKinsey.  So I suppose you would have told him after this meeting.    So – okay.  So your answer to myquestion is you knew already then – you observed then that they were manipulating the situation to make this – to make this payment?    Only after.   Yes.    Just the one last thing Chair.  Ms Danielswe have just been emailed a letter that you referred to.  The letter of the 13t h of December 2016.  I will read it to the record.  It is a letter from Eskom to Dr Eric Wood Group Chief Executive Officer Trillian Capital Partners Melrose Arch Sandton. “Dear Dr Wood, McKinsey Master Service Agreement.  Further to your letter dated 27 August 2016 Eskom would like to inform you of a decision taken by – by board of Eskom on 13 December 2016 in relation to theMcKinsey MSA Contract settlement process.  It is our understanding that you were the BEE partner on this contract.  Upon an external review of the program benefits including payment made to date it has cometo our attention that the BEE partners portion has not been fully settled.  To that end an amount of R134 million is due to yourself.”     13 December 2016.     Yes.  So Ms Daniels, even on thatbasis, on that score, the draft report of Oliver Wyman which I have read earlier did say in respect of the R 134 million that we are not making a legal opinion in respect of that share of the BEE partner.  That is out of our scope.  You need to obtain legal advice on that.  Even on that R 134 million.  So how could they ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I am just testing this reasoning.  Why would they still say this amount of R 134 million should not be subjected to legal review.  It should be taken as part and parcel of the decision that was made on the 8 t h of August 2016?  And...  Ja, why exclude it when the very aspect you have obtained to give you an assessment on the work that was given, he is saying to you it appears that amountmight be due but I am not giving you legal opinion on it.  Please obtain legal opinion.     H’m.     Yes.  Chair, the last question.  But Ms Daniels, you know when the Executives come here, they are going to blame you.  They are going to say you did not advised them or that you signed for something to be done which should not have been done.  And even the memo – Mr Koko has said you told the Parliament – or you said in your supplementary, it was an error of judgment.  So you need ...[intervenes]     ...allegations.    Yes.  Yes, that is correct.     The letter ...[intervenes]      Oh.  She said she received it on thet h of February.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  That is – but let me just add what she was saying by this time.     Yes.     No, it is the former Minister Lynne Brown.     Yes.     Ja.     But we might finish early.     With her.    With her, we might finish early.     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Mr Chair.     We are ready.  We are readyMr Chairperson.     Our next witness is Ms Nonhlanhla Kraai.     Shall I first take the oath or...?     Oh, yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Just by way of background information for the next witness and I will refer to the files in due course.  Ms Kraai is a former employee of Eskom.  Her testimony to the Commission is on a very narrow aspect.  This is the person who Mr Masango said was supposed to meet with way back on the 10 t h of March 2015.  He could not meet with her because of the meeting he had with Melrose Arch on that day. On his way back to – whatis it?     Kusile.     On the way back to Kusile, he telephoned Mr Kraai and told her about this strange meeting, as he calls it, that he had at Melrose Arch.  They then had another meeting on the 11 t h, early morning on the 11 t h of March 2015 and in respect of both the conversation and that meeting, Ms Kraai will give her recollection of what happened.  She might at the end also be given the opportunity to respond to Mr Koko’s allegation in regard to her.  Thank you, Chair.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     That is correct, yes.     Thank you, Chair.  The affidavits – Ms Kraai has provided the Commission with two affidavits ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kraai has provided the Commission with two affidavits.  They are found in Eskom Bundle 14(a).  The first one is on page 52.  Ms Kraai, you will have the same bundle in front of you, Eskom Bundle 13(a), page 52.    If you...  Ja, page 52.       Ja.  Ja, she will help you.       Follow...  okay.     Ja, that is her first time Chair.  We follow the black pagination on the page that is right at thetop left-hand corner.       And...  So are you there on page 52?     There is an affidavit there.  I, the undersigned, Nonhlanhla Kraai.  The affidavit runs up to page 59 ...[intervenes]      ...where there is a signature.  Do you confirm that to be your signature?    The affidavit ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.  The affidavit is dated 24 November 2020.  Just go back to that page withyour signature on it, page 59.     Oh, have you moved ...[intervenes]      That ...[intervenes]      On what page are you now?    If you go back.     Yes.     Yes.  You confirm the date so?     You confirm the correctness of the contents of your affidavit?     Okay.     Okay so those corrections will be apparent in your supplementary affidavit.    Okay we will go into it.  Chairperson, I beg leave to have this affidavit on pages 52 to 59, dated 24 November 2020, admitted as Exhibit U-26.1.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kraai, then turnto page 59.1.       You are there?     Between those two lines are those twolines that you see supplementary affidavit.     You see that?  I, the undersigned, Nonhlanhla Dahlia Kraai.  That is on page 59.1.  This affidavit runs up to page 59.14.  Do you see that?     And above the word deponent, there is a signature there.  Do you confirm that to be your signature?     It has a date stamp.  On the commissioner ’s stamp is 11 December 2020.  I read that one because I see you did not write the date on which you signed it.     Do you see that?     Other than that, do you confirm the contents of the affidavit to be yours?     And the correctness of what is contained in there?     Thank you.  Chairperson, I beg leave to have the affidavit marked supplementary affidavit onpage 59.1 to 59.14 admitted as Exhibit U-26.2.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kraai, just by way of background.  Could you tell the Chairperson what is your profession or your qualification?     Thank you.  Congratulations.     Yes.  You – and when did you join Eskom?     I see.  And you would have progressed in your career, I suppose, or positions within Eskom?     H’m?     Yes.  So between 2009, April 2009 to October 2016, you say you were the Project and Financial Accounting Manager?     Ja.  So it will be fair to say you are a learned person?     A learned person.     Very knowledgeable.  [laughs]  So if you had an encounter at work which was different from normal, you would notice that, you would remember that?     Ja.     Now Mr Masango has testified beforethe Commission and has provided the Commission with an affidavit.  We have given you that affidavit.  And I know from your affidavit that you have listened to his testimony.  He talks about given you ...[intervenes]      Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  SoMs Kraai, you – I was going into the telephone conversation that Mr Masango has testified about and wrote about in his affidavit, that he gave you that call, it was a return call on the 10 t h of March 2015, to tell you why he could not answer your calls to him and why he wasunable to be available for a meeting.I would like you to give the Chairperson your recollection of what transpired on that day and how it came about that Mr Masango spoke to you about this meeting he had.     A recollection.     Yes.     H’m.     Thank you, Chair.     Uhm ...[intervenes]      Yes.  So did you have a meeting on thet h?     What happened?     Yes, that is right.     Is this now on the 10 t h of March?     H’m?     Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  Now you have called – or the PA has said he has not – or the secretary has said he has not come back, you take the step to call him, you are unable to reach him.  What do you do next?  Do you go about your duties?     Yes.     Does he ever come back to you?     Thank you.  So, Ms Kraai, did he mention to you that he had a meeting with this short Indian man and Mr Koko?     And you are not mistaken about that?     And so he agrees with you then – well, let me ask you this before that, did he mention anything about the suspensions to you on the telephone call?     On the – ja.  So he then agrees with you or proposes to you that he will tell you more details …[intervenes]     The next day.     Now in this – this is no on the 11 March.    In the morning.  He has promised you he will tell you the rest and the next morning, that is the morning, does he – do you ask him or does he volunteer to tell you the rest about the meeting he had on the 10 March?     Yes, thank you, Chair.  Did you at any time thereafter, you know, on the 11 t h or the 12 t h or the 13 t h learn about the suspensions?     Did the communiqué mention anything about the suspensions of the executives who occupied the positions, one of which being where Mr Masango was going to act?    Yes, thank you.  Thank you, Chair. That is on page 59.22, Eskom bundle 14A.  So were you – I suppose you were not surprised by that or were you surprised to learn – to see that Mr Masango is going to act in the position that he told you about the day before?     Thank you.  Did you enquire from him why he called this meeting strange?  Did you find out from him?     Yes, Chair.  We have tried to do that prior to the hearing and Mr Padayachee, the attorney for Ms Kraai, has re-emailed to us those screen shots.  We can enlarge them on the computer but I am told when they get to be printed out they still come out small.     Ja.     Yes because the names …[intervenes]     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes.     Sorry, sorry.     Yes.     The date of the email.     It is clear on my side, Chair.     She says    Okay, so now – so that we understand this, on the 4 March this email communicates the rescheduling of the meeting and gives a new date being Wednesday the 11 March at 10.00.    Yes.     That is it, Chair, yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  So the person he was introducing is the person going to act in his position?     Okay.  Now if it were to be said that you are colluding with Mr Masango to implicate Mr Koko, what would be your response?     Yes.     Ja.     Yes, Ms Kraai your counsel has provided us with a printout of the transcript of Mr Koko’s testimony, an extract from there reads, “On 2 March 2017, not only did I, this is Mr Koko testifying, not only did I give the Board that dossier, but I also gave the Board the names of the people at Kusile that I think were in a corrupt relationship with Mr Masango and one of them was Ms NhlanhlaKraai, she is no longer working for  Eskom, I do not know why.  I was not surprised when I saw her evidence with Mr Masango joining what he says is their Koko hunt”,So, my question to you is, if either him or whoeversays to the Chairperson, well Chairperson, in this case it’s him these people were colluding against me, they are joining, as he says their Koko hunt, all what you’re saying is not true, it’s only because you’ve joined the bandwagon of people who want to bring him down, what is your response?     Yes, but do you know anything about what Mr Koko is saying there about the dossier, corruption at Kusile and that you were part of it?    So…[intervenes].     I think one important question is this Ms Kraai, the questioning – the people who were questioning you about these allegations they were making against you, was Mr Koko part of those people?     Okay, so he wasn’t present.     So – and you have said, you don’t know whether he was behind this?     Would you have any reason to join the Koko hunt?    Ja, Chair I think that’s it, are youaware of any investigation by, what’s his name, the gentleman who’s mentioned by Mr Koko, Paul O’Sullivan?     Paul O’Sullivan.     You don’t even know the man?    Okay that’s alright.      On the 18 t h Chair.     It’s a different work stream.    I believe it’s a different work stream Chair.     Because we couldn’t sync Mr Singh’savailability for tomorrow.     I will remind the Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes.     He’s coming on the 18 t h.     Ja, with the proviso that, if we are not finished, we will schedule him for another day.     Yes.     And Friday.
MS DANIELS:  Good afternoon Mr Chairperson.    You are welcome Sir.    Suzanne Margaret Daniels.   No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes.  Yes I do.    Mr Chairman just to give you context I – I took over the – the matter in late 2016 when I startedacting as Head of Legal and Compliance.  There had been a number of opinions as you will – we will go through on Friday.  There were a number of concerns raised by CDH and I started – I also asked him to do an assessment onthe merits and I started discussing these with Mr Singh and Mr Koko.  The reason for discussion with Mr Singh he was in his capacity as CFO he was my immediate superior and as Mr Koko was the acting Chief Executive at the time we discussed it with him as well.I took them through the various concerns that were raised in the assessing the evidence I had asked them you know particularly Mr – Mr Koko because he had been operationally involved and I think it was early December when he changed from you know the litigation posturing tosaying that he would be quite comfortable if we settled the matter at around R500 million.I was quite surprised because you know the posture up until that point or Eskom’s position had been quite strong about litigating and going to arbitration on the matter.Thereafter when we were sort of going through the evidence I once again go to him and said you know we have these issues with the evidence as presented.  At that stage the person who had calculated the penalties, theoriginal sheets had actually left the employ of Eskom.  There were technical reports that showed that you know the substance – the substance of the claims that Optimum was making may – may have merit.  We did not have the technical evidence to sort of counter it at that stage.So these are all the issues that we were discussing in this period.  And the – the attitude was well you know we might as – we should work towards settling the matter.I was quite hesitant to do that given the publicity that we had – Eskom had made about this matter and I suggested that I was not going to make this decision on my own.  I went – I wanted to take the matter to the board Tender Committee.    He actually had no basis other than he wanted the matter to go away.  You know there was not a technical basis or a legal basis or a response to what I was saying.  It was actually in a meeting that we had and where I was briefing him on the issues that we have had in the matters – in the litigation matters they said he would be comfortable settling the matter at around R500 million that was the figure that he could live with.    Mr Singh was – was more you know looking at the figures and – and he said if you know identify this    I think my basis was not from you know objectively it would – that would come out later.  Objectively it would have been – it would have been prudent to settle. My position at that point when I had just taken over in late 2016 was that we had made such a big publicity – I do not want use the word stunt but it had been a very public statement that Eskom was going to claim R2 billionfrom Optimum.We had just now gone through a change of ownership, new owners and it seemed sort of an abrupt turnaround that we would now be willing to settle the matter at R500 million.My reasoning was that we should at least go through a legal process.It should not be Eskom withdrawing the claim and then settling at this stage.    Just – I actually – what I did in the memo to the BTC Mr Chairman is – is extract the relevant bits from the CDH opinion which was attached to the memo.  It was quite in detail.  We also ex – we also explained at the meeting of I think it was – it was February the minutes arein the – in the bundles the – the issues involved.I think the reason that the claim – there were various basis for calculation and as time went by depending on the formula that you used one would get to a different – different calculation.So the – the amount varied from about R479 million to R1.17 – R1.7 billion and you will see that later once the entire exercise had been done we were comfortable with recommending the R577 million.On my own estimation and based on my experienceI had also estimated around R700 million would be the claim but because of all the various inputs into the spread sheet there was no consistent approach to how it was dealt with and you know while we each had opinions there had to be an objective verification and CDH had at one stage hadthe R1.17 – R1.17 billion as a figure.And then as – as time went by we did not have the technical evidence to support that nor did we have people that had been consistently involved in the matter to actually give this bad kind of evidence to support it.  And it was on that basis you will see that we went to the BTC explained in detail; BTC was actually quite I would say irritated with me for wanting to take them through that detail but I wanted the board to be absolutely clear and informed as to what we had – what the decision was basedon and what the – why we were asking for a mandate to settle instead of just you know accepting the settlement.    I – I disagree with him there was – there has not been in my experience; in my tenure at Eskom there has not been a consistent contract management approach to Optimum to coal contract so the evidence that we had there was a lot of documentation but it wasconsistent and would stand the test of – of legal rigour that para would dispute and because as you will see from the CDH opinions there was not a consistent approach to how these penalties were calculated or applied and you know I – I do not agree with him.   Mr Chairman the issues were – were therefrom the beginning in terms of the basis for calculation of the claim.  You will see from the opinions submitted attached to Mr Moodley’s affidavit from CDH that in 2015 there were already issues before the issuing of the summons, before the mention of the claim.  I think even Mr Bester testified that there was – he was sceptical as to the amount.  He raised the risks with Mr Molefe and these were ignored.I was not you know around at that time I was not involved in the matter that time.  I recall being called intoone meeting with myself, Mr Bester, Mr – Advocate Silanko  who was the Head of Legal at the time and Mr Moodley and we – they did explain – the three of them explained to Mr Molefe and Mr Koko that you know these were the issues.  And notwithstanding that explanation from three peopleinvolved in the matter they were adamant to go ahead with the institution of the claim.    That meeting was in 2015 I think it would have been around early 2015 because there was a meeting scheduled with Glencore around about either that day or the next day.    Mr Chairman that is un – untrue.  I meanthere was at no stage that that – those meetings happened in the manner – there were no meetings subsequent to emails.  I did not – I did not print out the information for Dr Ngubane.  Dr Ngubane was not an Executive Chairman so he would not get involved in the matters that were on those– those emails in transactions in the manner that Mr Koko is trying to present to the commission.Also you know I noticed that one – one of those emails was about the R1.68 billion guarantee.  We – Mr – if that was sent to him we would not meet there was no time at that time to meet about those guarantees and we would not have gone into the detail that the – that Mr Koko seeks to present to the commission.    Yes Mr Chair.  Yes Mr Chairman.    I was following.  We did not have those documents Mr Chairman when he – when he sent those emails.    Some of – some of those transactions I do – I do recall but that was based on the fact that Ms Mtetwamentioned them and also that they appeared before the – the board sub-committees.    It is in that context that I recalled it but not from an email from Mr Koko or not from a meeting from –with Dr Ngubane, Mr Koko to specifically discuss those transactions.    Just that I can …    Yes, do that.     87 point...?     88.  Okay I found it.     Mr Chairman, I...  Sorry.    Ja, I have it.     Mr Chairman, I submitted this to theParliamentary Portfolio Committee in 2018 already but its significance grew when I listened to Ms Matshepo’s evidence and as well as some of the evidence of Mr Koko in relation to the emails.  So I then went through the list again, and you know, Mr Koko tried to distance himself from the transactions but it is quite important for the Commission to note that in these transactions Mr Koko was either the, what in Eskom terms, is the end-user, was the recipient of the service or was the driver or, you know, the personresponsible for those transactions to take place.  So when he talks about this list, I was quite taken aback by the manner in which he distanced himself.  I, at no stage, came to him with this list.  On his own evidence, he says that, you know, I would not have at that stage, been able to have so much detail, which is true, because I did not know this.  This would not also originate from the board’s side because these transactions were extremely operational transactions.  The once that are of significancefor the purposes that I could – of this Commission that I could tie in with the evidence of other people, was especially when Ms Matshepo testified, was the Duvha 3 which is now Item 1 on the list.     And you will see that is valued at R 5 billion.  Now the reason the figures are of significance for what I, you know, my assessment when I relooked at it, because she was very specific in saying that this for – you know that Eskom did not need these services.And when you look at the Duvha 3 transaction itself, it was an engineering transaction.  The Duvha 3 boiler exploded and needed to be replaced.  At one stage, Mr Koko was the Engineering Manager at Duvha.  At the stage when this transaction was in the process, he wasHead of Engineering.  He was also the Head of Group Technology and Commercial which then took part – which then – in his capacity he oversaw the engineering, the procurement of, you know, the replacement boiler.So he would have been intimately aware of this transaction.  You know, I would not be able to go to him with this kind of paper and give him this value and ask him for an explanation.  That is absolute nonsense. He would have had intimate knowledge, given his position in the organisation and what he had controlover.  So, you know, when she points out that there was work asked by – of Regiments or Trillian or McKinsey, I am not sure because this was an engineering issue.  There was an insurance component as well through this matter which was dealt with by Mr Singh asthe CFO and there were issues regarding – the underlining issue here was around the contract, the manner in which it was procured.  Mr Koko had insisted on using a non-BEE qualified supplier and those were specific instructions that he gave to the Procurement Team which caused issues later on for Eskom. So that is the big overviews.  So all these issues, all these transactions had some significance of which Mr Koko had some role to play for example the nextone was the McKinsey which I highlighted ...[intervenes]      ...because ...[intervenes]      Yes, it is Mr Chairman.  When she talks about the Duvha insurance claim and the rebuild, the onewere – the one component was to get the money from the reinsurer to actually replace the boiler at Duvha.  And then also the other part was to recover the normal insurance claim.  So that is – that would have been dealt with by Eskom insurance.     We had our in-house Insurance Division.     Well, that is – I categorically deny that and that is why I say to Mr Chairman that it is not possible thatI would have come up with this list because of the nature of the transactions, the value of the transactions and the knowledge of this.And if I recall his testimony, he also said that, you know, I said it came from the board.  That is just not plausible because the detail here, the Non-Executive Board would not know.  I would not be able to come to him to ask for information to this degree.     This list was provided to – he discussed itwith me when he came back from suspension.  I said at – in my supplementary to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee and I stand by that.     Well, Chairman I would ask you if he conceded that it is his handwriting, he must please explain to you a couple of issues that I have identified on the list. I would like to draw your attention to the notes that he has there.  Next to Project Libra Anglo which is Item...     Seven.     Yes.     He says    That is illogical for someone within Eskom to say that, you know.     In terms say    Now this project in itself, Mr Chairman, is the coal supply to Fusile Power Station which was problematic because of the nature of the coal, the price of the coal, et cetera.  So at that stage, there was no BEE partner for Anglo, you know.  Anglo was doing it through its holding company.  It had not – that is why it is called Project Libraat that stage.  You will find that in the Eskom documents, you know, when the project start out, they are called Project Alpha, Project Libra and those things.     Ms Matshepo also testified that is how wedid things.  So ...[intervenes]      He would have to explain to you why he     If I look at the others, I think it is the Rand value to be confirmed because you will see the other onesall have Rand values.     ...you know, in the normal ...[intervenes]      ...standard terminology, that would be To be Confirmed.     Yes.     To be determined.      Yes, that is correct.     That is correct.     And he would have explained why someone would say – why he would say “we could buy”.  He is at Eskom.    You know.  Eskom would be purchasing coal from a supplier.       Yes, that would be for coal.     I would assume that that would be the BEEpartner.     The request – the requirements of Eskom at the time was that coal be supplied by you know, BEE compliance companies or at least they must be workingtowards being BEE compliant in terms of the Mining Charter.     At that stage, I know or was aware that Eskom – that Anglo was not yet BEE compliant.  It was looking for a partner.     No.     Exactly, Mr Chairman.  Sorry.  Exactly, Mr Chairman.  That is why I say, no, Eskom did not have the practise of giving partners to suppliers.       That was – he must explain to you why he would be giving the partner and why he would be asking for a fixed price ...[intervenes]      ...from internally ...[intervenes]      ...at this stage.     Mr Chairman, what ...[intervenes]      Who...  I am sorry, I did not hear the last bit?     From my understanding and the discussion that we had.  This was meant for Mr Koko and he had indicated to me that this was instructions from his principals.  Those were his words.  And at that time, my understanding was, that this referred to the board.    Yes ...[intervenes]      ...that is the one issue.     Then, as I identified, you will see these transactions Ms Matshepo talked about, the load management, the five release cash unlock and the Online Vending cash unlock as well.  There is also a note here    No, the T-guys...  At the bottom.     [No audible reply]      So this T-guys, in my understanding, this is T-Systems because at that stage there was an issue with the payments of T-Systems.     At the bottom.    Well ...[intervenes]      In... ja.  In handwritten notes Mr Chairman.     Yes.     I am not sure what that is.      What that is Mr Chairman.     It is looks like it is - Mr Chairman, but I am not a handwriting expert ...[intervenes]      ...specialist.    But what I am saying is.  Mr Koko needs to explain to you what does this mean?     Because this does not look like an instruction from an Eskom person.     You know, a person of his position.  And then there was – and it ties in with what Ms Matshepo said that there was this, you know, fee instruction.  If you lookat the calculation and – I mean, fee extraction.  If you look at the calculation and the values and so there was a concerted effort here to evaluate what could be extracted.  That is what made me relook at this list in that light of her testimony and what I had submitted earlierto Parliament.  I could, you know, clarify more and it also gave more significance having relooked at this list.  The other issue is.  This word here, to the left, this Zeselor (Zestilor).     Of the document.  It has been widely reported in the media, and one would have to check this, that Zeselor (Zestilor) is the company that Mr Salim Essa’s wife was the shareholder and owner of.  So Mr Koko would explain – have to explain how, you know, these elements,how he was tied up in this at Eskom.       What is that?     Oh.     It think it is Zeselor or...  Z-e-s-e-l-o-r.     Yes.     Ja.     Can you please repeat that Mr Seleka?  I had to close that.     I was not sure what that was Mr Chairman.  I checked the reports but as it says there, again R 150 million per annum.  You know, so there was an estimation of what kinds of revenue this would bring.  And this would not be to Eskom.  So, you know, Mr Koko would have to explain how he, why and on what basis he would do that kind of calculation.       ...here.  At various stages during...    Yes.     Yes, I can hear you know.     No.     That is correct Mr Seleka.  I am tying it to specifically – because Ms Matshepo, when she was talking about Regiments and Trillian, she mentioned, you know, how they established the fees.  I think even Ms Goodsonmentioned some of it.  And if you look at this list, it ties in, it makes it more clearer what this was actually about, was those revenue projections as to what could be extracted from Eskom.     [No audible reply]      Yes, they were given contracts.     These matters did serve before the Board Tender Committee and the various sub-committees in Eskom at given times Mr Chairman.  So it would be, you know, easy to check.  Like I said, I remember that the Duvha 3 contract was problematic because of the supplier that was...  [break in intermission].  We know about McKinsey.  The other one that I could identify was the Project Libra.  The Online Vendingwas another issue.  That contract served before the BTC a number of times.  There were issues that were involved.  And I think the whole IT Support Services was an issue.  That contract – Eskom’s position and strategy changed a number of times during 2015/2016.    [No audible reply]      [Interruption in transmission]     Oh, okay.     Yes, okay.     Can you hear me?     Okay.     It was very technical but I can just tell youhigh-level.  It was to put in place an electronic IT support system for purchasing of electricity.     They may have been involved.  I think you should look at the Steering Committee of the – what is that – this – the services agreement or there might be a separate agreement.     I do not recall specifically.  I just knowthat, you know, the Online Vending was an issue.  It appeared a number of time, as I said, during the period 15/2016.  It appeared a number of times before the board committees.     That is my evidence Mr Chairman.  In listening to what I know and what I said, this represents what was given to Mr Koko and what he had to execute interms of... revenue from Eskom.     That is correct, Mr Chairman, that is why Isay to you I reject Mr Koko’s view that this is, you know, a document prepared by me on basis that the board wanted this.  This is a document that he came with that he came with that he said this is what – these are the transactions that my principals want me to focus on and this is what he started asking his subordinates for the information and it ties in with the emails that he sent.     Mr Chairman, I would like the opportunity  to categorically state here that I did not under any circumstances moonlight as a travel agent (indistinct – recording distorted) unlike my seniors I had a job at Eskom, I did not organise his travel visas at any stage, he did not request me to do so, he did not pay me R5 000 to do that, I did not (indistinct – recording distorted) of Dr Ngubane in this matter.  As I said before, procuring of visas or…. (Break in recording)    Yes, I can, Mr Chairman.      That is correct, Mr Chairman.    That is correct, Mr Chairman.     That is correct, Mr Chairman.     Not at all, Mr Chairman.     Yes, I did hear that.     Yes, Mr Chairman, you will see there is the funding restructure that I have highlighted.  There is Duvha 3 and there is online vending cash unlock, those are thedirect cross-references that I could make.     Trillian, yes, that is correct.     Yes, I can.     Okay.  Mr Chairman, I confirm that I have read the affidavit of Mr Moodley and that I have submitted my own version.  I also got involved in the tail end of this transaction in late 2016.  Some of the facts that I am going to put before you I know because I was involved in my capacity of head of legal.  I had to do the 48 hour reports, as it became known.  It was reports to Minister Brown on the payments to McKinsey and Trillian and that involvedgoing back to 2015 when the matter came.  So some of my knowledge is from that, some of my knowledge is from the investigations that Bowmans did and in compiling that 48 hour report, which is part of the bundle, CDH, Bowmans and the auditors assisted with the information so I am going to rely on that body of information to give you the facts which I do not personally know.  Is that okay?     Alright.  So insofar as the cancellation ofthe McKinsey contract one needs to go back to around July 16 in the Eskom records and it is a BTC meeting in July that the authority to cancel the contract is provided to the team and it is noted that Eskom might have to pay up to – I think it was about – it was over 2 billion that the team –and when I talk about the team, it was represented by Mr Prish Govender and Mr Edmund Mabelane.   Mr Prish Govender was the project manager for the McKinsey/Trillian project.  I do not know what to call because at one stage it was the engineers, the top engineers programme and then it became the McKinsey/Trillian project, though I am not sure what they called it.  But at one stage Eskom identified that it may need to pay up to 2.84 billion to – I think it was up to 2 – ja, 2.8 billion to cancel the contract.  At the meeting in July they indicated that they had negotiated a figure of – a settlement figure of 1.8 billion and this was approved by the BTC subject to certain conditions.     Is that okay?  Does that give you context to…?     Let me just…     I just have one bundle 14.     Okay.  Yes, I have it.     Okay.  I may have the date wrong, if that is 8 August, I would go with this submission.     Okay, this is a submission to the boardtender committee Mr Chairman and it is feedback on the McKinsey and company top consultants programme MSA settlement process.     This document was compiled by – I will tell you now – I think it was Mr Govender.  Yes, Mr Prish Govender.  As you will see there, his signature on page 829.32.     With Mr Mabelane, the Chief Procurement Officer and approved by Mr Anoj Singh.     It is Mr Prish Govender.     In terms of the – yes, in terms of the Eskom procurement process, Mr Chairman he was the delegated official, the project manager for the McKinsey project.     Well, you will see Mr Anoj Singh signed the documentation and in Eskom delegation of authority the people who sign the submission document take accountability for the contents and presenting it to the relevant board committee.  And this is the reporting line,you will here, just to give it more context, Mr Chairman, the reporting line was that Mr Govender would have reported to the Chief Procurement Officer, the Chief Procurement Officer reported to the Group Financial Officer.     This was a standard submission format that Eskom had for submissions to board so if there wereother approvals, regulatory approvals, external approvals that were required, this is where the executives or the compliers of the submission documents were expected to note that.     Okay.  Just before I explain this, I just wanted to mention one thing that in the submission in June or July, I just cannot remember the date, the reason for the cancellation was provided to the board tender committee is that there could not – the parties could not reachresolution on the terms and conditions of the contract.  So, you know, that was just – that was stated in the documentation at the time.     It was a BTC decision.   You will find, Mr Chairman, that in the Eskom documentation there is not a distinction between board and subcommittees so when people talk about a board decision more often than not itwould be the board subcommittee that they are referring to.     Nothing ratification but what happened on a quarterly basis is that we would prepare committee reports and they would go to the board for notification.  Those that required ratification would be ratified or those that required decision would then be tabled for decision.     Mr Chairman, this is what we weregrappling with at the tail end with CDH and myself.  By the time – I just need to put it into context, by the time I got involved in December, I was presented with an email from Mr Govender, he provided me with a copy of the MSA, he provided me with the letter of demand from McKinsey andthe letter of demand from Trillian and at that point factually about over 900 million had been paid out to the parties and but those are the three documents that he presented to me and it was on that basis when I looked at that, I did not have any context, he asked that I must please review the documents and that he was discuss it with me.  I remember he driving up from Durban or somewhere and I had a look at those documents and I thought it quite peculiar the agreement was signed – I think it was early in the year and then in June there was – Trillian’s demand came before theMcKinsey demand.  They were like a month apart and it was on that basis that, without context, that I asked for the legal review and you will see that is why I specifically asked for that in an email and I actually wanted to know from Mr – when I discussed it with Mr Moodley, what exactly was Eskom’s rights in this regard.  At that point I did not know specifically of like, you know, there was the – the terms and conditions was the reason or the failure to reach the terms and conditions was actually the reason presented to the board tender committee.  It took us quitea while to get the documentation from the project team.     I was not aware of that.     Because the document that I …     I mean, I was just going based on the document that I received, you know, that it was datedearlier in the year, I was not aware that it was backdated.     Ja, that would be correct and if he says it was backdated.     Okay.    Say that again please, Mr Seleka?     Okay.  What they are doing here is asking– they are saying to the board tender committee, and when I say they, it is the submitters, Prish, Mr Govender, Mr Mabelane and Mr Singh are saying that they have negotiated a lower settlement fee of 1.8 billion.  They needed to pay out 800 million because these would cover costs to date and then the current consultants, which I assume is McKinsey, made an offer to reinvest 1 billion to cater for a transition period and so it sort of a settlement plus a renegotiation of terms kind of arrangement that appears here and that McKinsey and partners decided totake some sort of let me say – yes, a new contracting mechanism and this involves that the Group Chief Executive Officer, now the Group Financial Officer and the Group Executive Generation and Technology are authorised to negotiate more favourable terms on conditions to the settlement process and at this time in August 2016 the Group Chief Executive Officer is Mr Molefe, the Group Financial Officer is Mr Singh and the Group Executive Generation and Technology is Mr Matshela Koko.     That is correct.     No, I did not, at that stage I was thecompany secretary, Adv Silanko was the head of legal and he was dealing with the matter directly, he was not present, if I recall, at this meeting of the 8 August but he did send a legal representative.  They did not raise the – Mr Chairman, the company secretariat and the legal department were separate departments so the head of legal used to attend the  - or a legal representative from his department would attend the board tender committee meetings to deal with the legal issues.  At this particular meeting there were no issues raised when this matter wasdiscussed from those parties although it would subsequently emerge that they did have concerns and they did raise them and there were actually opinions about the McKinsey settlement agreement or the master services agreement that were ignored by the parties mentioned inthe submission.     I am there.     Yes.     I will attempt, I will try, I am not sure if I will get this right but what I think it is saying is that Eskom agrees to pay R1.8billion in settlement fees.  We will pay the R800million now.  The consultants will not take their one billion, they will set it off against initiatives or savingsinitiatives that we identify and we will put another contract in place.     Well, in real terms it was actually not a disengagement, well it was styled as a disengagement process because it would take them six months to exit Eskom but also during that time they would re-negotiate another contract. ADV SELEKA     Not, I don’t recall, to my knowledge that,that happened during the time that I was there.     Yes, it was paid, in fact more than R800million was paid because they added the VAT component when they paid it, so in December when Mr Govender send me the contract and the letters of demand, R943million had been paid.So, I assume that’s R800million plus VAT.     I will do so, Mr Seleka, can you please just give me the reference to Mr Moodley’s affidavit again?     Alright, Mr Chair, my reasoning for askingfor the legal review at that stage, was because of the contract and the two letters of demand that I had been emailed by Mr Prish Govender and he had asked me to have a look at it and to give him an opinion.  I looked at the date of the contract and the letters of demand and Ithought this was quite peculiar, I didn’t have all the facts at that point, I didn’t have any other documentation and for me I wanted to understand what Eskom’s rights were. I see from Mr Moodley’s affidavit that I did ask him more detailed questions in a subsequent telephone call.  So, I must have then gotten, you know, the facts but in terms of payments because that – I confirmed in my – that 48 hour report that we had actually paid over R900million at this stage and for me, I wanted to understand if we could – if we could recover any of that money, if – you know what was thesituation.  At the same time there was a BTC meeting in December, I had anticipated the legal review would be a quick desktop exercise and that it would not be as complex as it turned out to be.  So, in anticipation of that, I had written the clause that was inserted in the submission that the legal review – that I’d briefed CDH and that the legal review had been completed.I did send that to Mr Moodley, as he states in his affidavit and I did ask him to opine on that, I think, by the time he got back to me I had already submitted thesubmission because of the time requirements and I think the submission was already late, so I was pressured for time but we had a discussion and he told me that he did not have the necessary documentations to do the review to the limit that I required and that we would need to – youknow, we would need that documentation before we could opine on that and the person that we needed that from was Mr Govender.  We did go to the BTC meeting of – I think it was – I just can’t remember the date now let me just check it – the 13 t h of December 2016 and …[intervenes].     Yes, based on – I wanted to know, the demands that they set-out in the letters respectively, because both of them – the respective organisations approached it from different angles.  I wanted to know how defensible is it, how arguable are their claims based on what Eskom had done to date and I wanted a more, you know, detailed view, than just saying, we will fight his because having already paid out money, would that prejudice us, how did it actually work, is what I wanted to understand.  Because remember at that stage I had nocontext from the legal perspective as to what had transpired beforehand. In fact, what I recall from the McKinsey process, it was actually a very protracted negotiation so one would have needed to have understood what had taken place and we were presented with a signedcontract, so I needed to understand, what are the terms and conditions of what we had in place.     Yes, that’s correct because that was the one problem because this is the first time that a risk based contactor had been concluded in Eskom in this manner.  We were – subsequent to getting the documentation we would find out that, you know, there were all sorts of other advice – it is correct that CDH was not involved.  I, personally, was not involved either so it was a learning experience for us because now we actually had to – we literally, Mr Chairman, had to hunt for the documents because they weren’t forthcoming and readily as one wouldhave expected.  I think Mr – you know, Mr Govender expected us to give an opinion based on what he had put before us and we said that’s not possible, given the terminology that was used and the, you know, the calculations etcetera.    Yes, I recall that.     Yes, I confirm that, in fact, we only got the documents in early – I think it was early February, Mr Chairman, it must have been the first week in February, we had to literally hound Mr Govender to get the documentation.  I, in fact, insisted that Mr Moodley meet with Mr Govender, face-to-face to take him through the issues that we were having and I remember that they met – I couldn’t attend that meeting but I insisted that they go ahead and meet so that we could get to the bottom of the issues because the non-fulfilment of the suspensiveconditions was actually a new factor, that we had not seen before.     Mr Govender led the discussion, Mr Chairperson so I cannot remember I would have to rely on the minutes of the meeting in terms of what he said about the transaction.  In terms of the review, I did tell the committee that we had not completed the review, and that it was still in progress and that would still have to comeback to the committee.  There was a further report, also presented by Mr Govender.     But it was still in process, yes Mr Seleka you will remember, sorry, Mr Chairman, you will remember that I said that I had, we had prepared the submission in anticipation that it could be done.  But by the time we got to the meeting, it had not, I do not even think we had started, we had only just asked for documentation.  So Idid bring it to the committee's attention that we were still busy with the legal review.     No, I did tell them that it was in progress.      The BTC approved R134million, based on what Mr Govender said and as part of the settlementprocess, and that was a decision that they had already taken in August, as we had earlier discussed.     Not at this stage, I think that they saw it aspart of the settlement process, we were still busy with our legal review.  So I would not say that it was of no significance, but it was still in process.  So I would not have asked them to base it on that.     No, it was not correct and that is why I brought it to their attention at the meeting.     Well, we did not know that in December16, Mr Seleka or, Mr Chairman, that would only come out in early February, Mr Moodley and I had then had the opportunity to look at all the documents, and he and his team did a very extensive analysis.     No, you do not Mr Chair this is where the, sort of the what actually happened and what is on paper, you know, gets fuzzed and this is how – for want of a better word the officials manipulated the process, because at that meeting, we did state that legal review was in progress, okay.  I did make it clear that we had notcompleted the legal review. However, what the officials then relied on, there was a draft report by Oliver Wyman, which was not a legal review. It was an assessment of the monetary claims and it is in that report, that they also talk about a legal reviewthat needed to be done which, you know, I had not initiated the CDH review for want of a better word based on that report. I had done it because I was presented with a contract and two letters of demand and I wanted to understand what Eskom’s position should be in that regard.  What the officials did subsequent because the BTC said that the R134million should be paid as part of the settlement process they relied on the August decision to make the December payment.    Yes, because it was it was too - it actually was to deal with what further payments Eskom should be making, if any and that is why I asked for the legal review if there were any payments that Eskom still had to make and should we be in a - are we in a position to recover what had already been paid?     You know because that was the - my apologies Chairman, that was the sort of the when I got the contract plus the two letters of demand, you know, I was stepping into something that I had no context about at thatpoint and we needed to get the documents and CDH said look, this contract is the terminology is different, it was different to what we had dealt with before.     There was actually a resolution that the R134million should be paid as part of the settlementprocess.     Yes.     Yes.     Any further payment that should be made?     Yes.     The legal review was not discussed in that detail Mr Chairman, from my recollection.     I am not sure Mr Chairman, that meeting was quite, quite rushed because it was the last meeting ofthe of the year.  You know, so I am not sure but what I remember it was - we did not really go into too much detail.     Yes.    Yes, I did tell them that caution needed to be exercised because the legal opinion had not yet been received.  What I am saying is I do not think it is necessarily at the Board Tender Committee but, you know, the way that the resolution is crafted, I do not think that they actually gave payment authorisation at that meeting.    Did they?     Okay.     I accept that, okay, but as I said, it is made as part of the August 2016 decision.     Okay, let me give you that context was Mr Chairman, there was another report that another review that was happening at the same time, Oliver Wyman…[intervene]    No, this is a management consulting team. They were part of the Marsh & McLennan Group was doing a review on assessing the veracity of the claims submitted by the partners, the McKinsey and Trillian in the project, and at that stage, there was a draft report available and in that report, it said that an amount of approximately R134million was owing, or can be said to be owing to the sub-contractor which was Trillian. And it was - and that report also recommended thatany further payments, that should be subject to a legal review.  They do make the disclaimer that it is not a legal opinion and they set out the basis for their calculations, the methodology that they used to check the claims that McKinsey and its partner made, and that is the basis forme of that you are looking for on which the BTC then made that decision and said, okay, because it is still outstanding, it can be made as part of the settlement process.     That was how it was interpreted at the time subsequent to that we would then you know, change our view.    That is correct, Mr Chairman, but what I wanted to say to you it might also have been fear at BTC level.  What happens factually in the operations is that Mr     Which is aside from what is happening, the decision as the legal opinion.     At the time they were not because that happened immediately after the meeting.  I am not so sure about the timing, but it was in that period, that letter went out very quickly, Trillian invoiced Eskom, Eskom paid I think within a day.     No, that is…[intervene]    No, that is something - because there was a specific letter about the…[intervene]     The R134million.     Mr Chairman, I should have it, I will provide it to the Commission.      It should be attached to that report that I was mentioning as well, so I should have it.     No, Mr Chairman, it is not always the case,that would have been within his delegation of authority to pay.     So it does not always, not all payments would come to the to the legal department.     In the Eskom context R134million was not large Mr Chairman.     Yes, Mr Chairman, I just want to – I will also give you the approved minutes to say that the payment of R134million was to finalise payments up to August 2016.  So I will just double check with Mr Seleka because that is the minute that I have.     Ja, we have those minutes.     That is why I said, that is how the BTCunderstood it, if I have the correct extract.     Okay.     It is very difficult hindsight to say that Mr Chair for just one reason is that, you know, the information put before them but what I can say is that the meeting was incredibly rushed.  I do not think that the BTC applied its mind to the extent that it normally did, because it was a December meeting it was quite rushed.    Mr Chairman Mr Koko has been gloating about this memorandum since the Parliamentary Committee days and ja it actually just quite a deflection of what actually happened at the time.I cannot quite remember the meeting of the 8t h ofFebruary but what I can tell you was around the circumstances around the – the memo if that is – if that is okay.    In early February we still did not have the –the full documentation and we had to really – really hound Mr – Mr Govender to provide the documentation that was required.  I think Mr Molefe provided a list to Mr Govender’s secretary as to what was required.  And it took some time to get back.  I think the meeting only took place on the 7t h of February between Mr Moodley and his team and Mr Govender and the team that was managing the McKinsey project.So the documentation and the rigour review was not done by the 8t h of February when the meeting took place. Iwould have said that it – it was not done.  I think then what happened is Mr Moodley and his team went away and worked on the documentation and it was only subsequent to the meeting that – that the findings were that we actually may not have a contract.  You would have seen it in Mr Moodley’s documents in his affidavit.He raised quite a – a number of issues and the fact about the suspensive conditions only came – came about subsequent to the meeting of the 8t h of February.I think it was then that – that we…   Mr Chairman it is a – I cannot answer for the lawyers at the time because there were – there were – I was not involved when the contract was put in place and by the time I got involved to all intents and purposes the contract was cancelled.And the only issue that we were talking about wassettlement and payments to the parties.  So it was from that perspective because the – the issue of the suspensive conditions only arose once we went through all the documentation.    I follow but you must understand I did not – I did not read the 8 t h of February meeting as approvals for anypayments because we were still busy with what we – what we were doing and it was only during that process that I – I think a more thorough investigation into the contracts and how it came about was actually taking place.    If you look at the documentation before that I cannot remember the advocate who – there was – there was actually a senior counsel opinion who said that Eskom should not get into this contract the operations people ignored that.  But that – that only surfaced much later so thatis why I am saying there is – you are assuming a well-oiled system here but the documents were fragmented and not presented together so it was very hard to see the full picture until after the fact.    On the 17t h of February I think it was.    That is correct.  And in that time CDH was instructed to draft the settlement letter.  It was signed by McKinsey and Eskom.    I am – I am just trying to – ja I am just reading again Mr …    Yes they noted and supported it and I am just trying to think what were they – what were they supporting?    I – I..   I – I agree with Chairman and I think that that is why there was that move to cancel – well to cancel the contract or the purported cancellation way back in June 2016 when they said there was a failure to meet the terms and conditions.    I do not think payments had been made justyet Mr Chairman.  They actually made payments starting from I think August 2016.    Yes.    Yes I agree with that.    I – I would go along with that Mr Chairman that was the conclusion that we came to after going through all the documentation.  I had very, very lengthy discussion with Mr Moodley once I had the chance to read his opinion. We had then – well I did I cannot remember if Mr Moodley was on the phone or what but I went and spoke to Mr Singh and said that we had actually – we had actually made a mistake by making these payments.    I would agree with you knowing what I know now Mr Chairman you know at this – at that stage I waswanting to give     The benefit of the doubt to my colleagues.    But from what I know now I would agree with you.    I want to be perceived 00   Yes.    I would even – I would be – I would be swearing.    I would be swearing.   He said oh my word we are …    That I cannot say.    Knowing what I know now Mr Chairman I think he was trying to do that.    I do not think I would go as far as that I just think what he was saying is oh my gosh we have screwed up you know.    In colloquial terms.    But it was at that stage I saw it – when I said to him – because Mr – Mr Moodley I have taken at – then taken me through in a very lengthy process the – the thought process behind how they got to the conclusion.  And I – and Iimmediately went to see Mr Singh about it.    The reasoning’s.    I am not sure Mr Seleka I do not recall Mr Singh being present at the meetings.  We would have to check the minutes but Mr Govender was in – in contact with him. But like I said just for the – for the benefit of my colleagues at the time that is – that is so I just assumed it was bona fide.   Okay then he would have known.    It was not – it was not immediate at the timebecause Mr Chairman the – my attention at that stage was between the McKinsey Trillian issues, the nuclear issues, Eskom was being sued in terms of municipal debts and all of those things or we were suing and there was quite a bit happening.  When I had the time to reflect and I testified about this in Parliament that this is – this was my conclusion having then put everything together because subsequent to February 2017 we then did our own investigations.  There were – there were quite a number of investigations into the McKinsey Trillian matter.There was the Pre-9 Forensic Services Report, there was the Bowmans Investigation and there was my – my own teams’ investigation into it and we put all of this information together so we then could see that the processes were –were manipulated.    Or Mr Govender he would have gotten it – that is why they – I would have prepared the extracts.    No, no after.    Yes.  It was – it was not obvious at that stage Mr Chairman because like I said there was – what was happening at committee level and then the processes that were – the payment processes that were happening, the letters that were being written etcetera.    At operational level which we – which we not ordinarily have sight of.  And Mr Govender had full delegated authority in this matter.    Yes at that stage but it was subsequentlydisregarded.    Yes Mr Chairman that is my understanding of his letter.    As at that time they utilized or let us say the officials utilized the decision of August 2016 and togetherwith – when he talks about the external benefits review in that letter he is talking about that report that I mentioned the Oliver Wyman Report.    And it is in that report that they say there may be R134 million to the BEE partner to the sub-contractor.    I took the decision on the 5t h of December.    2016 – the Oliver Wyman Report that cameout on the 15t h of December also recommended that Eskom conduct a legal review.    Yes.    Yes.     But ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Mr Chairman, my decision was not based on figures or payments or anything.  It was – it would included the R 134 million in – if I look back now becausemy decision was based on that that I was presented with a contract and two letters of demand, one from McKinsey and one from Trillian ...[intervenes]      ...regarding payment from Eskom.    Yes.  So it was not yet related to, for a want of a better word, the nitty-gritty of ...[intervenes]      ...which payments were there.     Yes, Mr Chairman.    Yes, because firstly, the contract was dated January.       I think the first letter of demand was dated June 2016.     The other one was dated August.  They were – you know, it was so quick.    Those were the red flags for me.     And that is why I emailed Mr Moodley and said we need to do a legal review here.    Because I had no knowledge of the other issues at that point.     That is correct.     The ...[intervenes]      On the 8 t h of August, the amount was R 800 million.     So what the officials did, is that R 134 million was then calculated into that R 800 million.     Yes, that is correct Mr Chair.     So...  [break in transmission] ADV SELEKA     Okay.     Mr Seleka, I cannot speak or the officials involved in terms of their thinking because they had not consulted me.  What I am saying is, based on the way thatthe manner in which the letters and correspondence is phrased, that is how the system was manipulated.  I accept that, you know, Oliver Wyman did not give a legal opinion on that but if you look at the documentation, that Oliver Wyman report was used as the rational basis for making that payment.     I am not sure Mr Chairman.  They – you know, in the manner in which the Eskom Executives worked is, when they – it was not consistent.  So they would consult the legal team when they needed to or when they thought it was necessary or when they created issues but in this instance, I think it was not to bring it to myattention.     I agree with you Mr Chairman.  You know, it did not happen in this case.     Yes, Mister...  [laughs] ADV SELEKA     Okay.       Okay.  I think the first one is.  I think one needs to be aware of the hierarch of power and authority within Eskom and you know these Executives must take accountability for the decisions they made.  My tenure or during my time as Company Secretary, Compliance Officer, Legal Advisor – when it suited the Executives, they would get the opinions.  Unfortunately – and then, you know, conveniently say to     Ja.  So by the time when I get the memo,you know, payments are already in place.  So payment – the processes are already in place, the settlement has been signed and ja...  The reason I say it was a lapse in judgment Mr Chairman is.  Mr Govender came to my office.  I had external parties.  He waited outside until I signed.And I actually – I did sign it without asking for the supporting documentation.  So that is where I took the accountability of saying I did not actually apply to my mind to that but I think Mr Koko must not mislead the public and you by thinking – by saying that, you know, look here, I was responsible.  I did not sign this – that the payments had already been made or were in the process of being made.  So the signature or non-signature of that document is actually irrelevant.  The fact remains that Trillian andMcKinsey were paid the balance of the payments.   ADV SELEKA     No ...[intervenes]      No, mister ...[intervenes]      Mr Chairman, I signed it late the next day.     Because I was in meetings.  And then it still had to go to Mr Koko and it was not... [break in transmission].  So, you know, that document – he refused to sign it.  He said I forwarded it to him.  I did not.  It went through – Mr Govender was the one that... with the memo.  And it really – it was not signed by Mr Koko.  He was thenChief Executive at that time.       Yes.     It is doable Mr Chairman.  I will just have to go to bed earlier.  It is ...[intervenes]      ...five o’clock in the morning here ...[intervenes]      ...if it is two o’clock in the afternoon.     Thank you, Mr Chair.

Yes, that is correct.     On page 59?    That is correct.     That is correct Mr Chair.  That is my signature.     Okay just wait.       Dated 2012/11?     I am on page 59.14.     Okay.       24 November 2020.    [No audible reply]      Yes, it is correct although I had to correct some errors.     Yes, after I submitted my initial affidavit.     In my supplementary affidavit that I signed.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes, I do see that.     That is correct.  That is my signature.    Ja.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, it is mine.    Yes, that is correct.     My qualification is Bcom Honours inAccounting and I just obtained my master ’s in Development Finance.     Thank you.     Thank you.     I joined Eskom in 1994 as a graduatingtrainee because they were sponsoring my studies.       Yes, I did progress.  And if maybe I can take the Chair to that progression at high-level.    As I have said, I started as a graduating trainee in one of the power stations.  Then I was appointed as a Management Accounting Manager in 2002 in another power station.  And I moved to the Middle-Manager in 2006 also in different power station.  And in 2009, I moved to Kusile Power Station Project as a Middle-Manager, Project and Financial Accounting Manager.  Then in 2016, I was appointed as a SeniorManager in Oversight and Monitoring Assurance in the portfolio delivery of the project.  Then my last was – my last job was Senior Manager for Procurement Primary Energy in Eskom.       Accounting Manager.  That is correct Mr Seleka.       At Kusile Power Station Project.       I am?    I think it is fair and I am also very knowledgeable.       I do so.     I will remember.  I think so.     Mr Chair ...[intervenes]     Okay.  I belonged to Group Capital Finance or I will say the Finance Division and when I was appointed, you get seconded to your project where we signed, we callit a Service Level Agreement, to say you will be providing the services in terms of Financial Accounting, Project Accounting, just making sure all your accounting entries are taken care of.  But I was also responsible to make sure your – we call it Short-term Budget, Medium-term Budget, the preparation thereof and the submission, responsible for all your financial audit within the project.  Your cash flow management from your monthly, quarterly, yearly and your cost to completion.  Your overall business case of theproject.  I think it is important that I mention that the delegation of the business case which was your 169 billion including your ITC was delegated to Mr Masango.  My delegation was only limited to my Finance Cost Centre but I was there to make sure that there are processes in place, that the business case is executed within the budget that was allocated to the project.     That ...[intervenes]      Yes, that is correct Mr Chair.     Mr Masango was a Project Director for Kusile.  Basically, he was responsible for the project.     Yes.     Yes.  I joined Kusile Project, Power Station Project on the 1 s t of April 2009 Chair.     Yes, my duties required that I have meetings with Mr Masango except for our standing meetings.  We used to have a Steering Committee which used to sit on Tuesdays where we would discuss the progress of the project but from different stakeholders.  But as a finance person, it was important that from time to time we engage ourselves – we will engage, sometime on a weekly basis f it is necessary if I foresee the risk.Because part of my responsibility was to identify the risk and say from the financial point of view how can it be mitigated because your numbers, they talked to the scope of work, they talked to the milestone, what needs to be executed at the project.Therefore, I cannot just take a financial decision without Mr Masango and other project manager in the project.       The Kusile Project, yes.     The financial risk of us going beyond the allocated budget, approved allocated budget, the businesscase, yes.     Because that was my role to make sure that I identify those risks.  We put mitigation in place and say what are we going to do.     Yes.     Thank you, Mr Seleka.  Mr Chair, before I can give a ...[intervenes]      ...recollection of the events that happened over the phone with Mr Masango.  I think it is importantthat I just give the background to that.       What led to Mr Masango calling me.     Making the call.     Yes.  I prepared a presentation, looking at the cost to completion or should I say, we call it the MYTD-3 which was the target.  It is your Miles To Year PriceDetermination that Eskom use when they apply the tariff increase to...  Once it was approved, you are get given the target to say this was the target, you work within that target.  There was a meeting that was scheduled to takeplace on the 11 t h of March 2015 but ...[intervenes]      Yes ...[intervenes]      ...the meeting was to discuss the presentation and highlight fuel contracts or we used to call them packages that we are going to overspend and we had to make decision to say, yes, as much as we were still within the business overall budget for the project but those specific contracts are beyond their allocated budget.      No, no, no.  It was not a committee.  Ja.    Because if you check the subject on the email, it was saying MYTD-3 Discussion.     So we were going to discuss with specific project managers whose contract or packages were overspending.     It was going to be myself.  I think and two of my colleagues were invited.  And those specific projectmanagers.     Okay I will try to recall.  Can I...?     Okay.  It was myself, there was Thumelo(?), there was Dudu from the Finance side and I can recall a Ruben Mamorabe(?) was - Azihn(?) was going to attend and ...[indistinct] was going to attend.  There was a B&B guy.  I cannot remember the name.     Ja, yes.     Basically, it is your multi-discipline from construction, contract management facilities.    Dudu Nthonghema(?)     Yes.     Thumelo.  Those were my finance managers reporting to me.     Yes, they were reporting to me.    Yes, the others I have mentioned Chair.     They were reporting to Senior Project Managers or contract – they were – I would say technical people.  They were not finance people.     It was Ruben Mamorabe.     It was Awe Deyase(?).     If I can recall.    And there was a construction manager ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes, they were still employed by Eskom.     Yes.    Oh, okay.  I think I was still going to explain to say – but the meeting was going to take place on the 11 t h Mr Chair.     Yes.     But I think they can recall that because the meeting did continue ...[intervenes]     ...although without Mr Masango.     Yes.     Yes.  That is the background I wanted to give Mr Chair to say the importance of that meeting because it was – we are already highlighting the risk that these packages were going to overspend by, like, two billion.     Yes.  So it was important that Mr Masango becomes part of that meeting to attend.  But normally what happens.  He would request that me and him will meet so that I brief him of the challenges, what are we seeing at the Finance Department so that when he meets the Project    Yes.     Yes.     Yes, ahead of that meeting.       I brief him on ...[intervenes]      ...on finance issues.     Correct Mr Chair.     Yes.     Okay.      So on that day, he said he has got work commitments, that is on the 10 t h of March.  He said he has got work commitments but when he comes back from Megawatt Park ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry.  The secretary arranged – called me to say Mr Masango would like to have a meeting withyou when he comes back from Megawatt Park during lunchtime so that you brief him about the meeting.     ...about the presentation.  Sorry.     No, Chair.     I think that was the previous day.  I cannot remember.     The day before the 10 t h, yes.     The 9 t h.  To say Mr Masango would like tohave a meeting with you on the 10 t h.     Yes, during lunchtime.     So that you take him to the presentation.     Ja, in preparation of the meeting that was going to take place on the 11 t h of March.     Yes.    That is correct ...[intervenes]      ...during lunchtime.    Yes.  And it was ...[intervenes]      ...not unusual Chair.     Because when he has got an issue with finance, even when he is having lunch, you know, she will call – he will ask the secretary that ...[intervenes]      ...that Ms Nonhlanhla must come and see him ...[intervenes]      ...so that we discuss few issues.     That is correct.     No, Mr Seleka...  No, Chair, we did not have a meeting.    I think around lunchtime ...[intervenes]      Yes, I did agree.     Because we are both on site.     It is happening onsite.     You quickly go to his office.     You brief him.  Then you continue with your normal duties.    The meeting did not happen.     Yes.     Okay.  During lunchtime, I think, I called the secretary to check if Mr Masango is back from hiscommitment at Megawatt Park.     That is the 10 t h of March.     Then the secretary said    I am not sure if it was full or what, it is just like “ting”.  There was no space for me to leave.  Ja, therewas no like…     I am not sure whether it was full or what but it just did not go to – let me say it did not go to the voice message.    No, it did not ring.     No, it did not ring.     Yes.     I am not sure, like I cannot – like I am saying I cannot recall but I do not remember leaving a voicemessage.  Yes, Chair.     No, I think I – Chair, I went back to my normal duties, as I have mentioned that it was month end there were a lot of reports that had to be submitted, we had a deadline of five o’clock that day to submit our report.    Yes.     Mr Masango came back to me, I cannot recall the exact time but I think it was around four.  But later thatday, you know, he came back to me, Chair, and apologising not coming back …[intervenes]     Ja, he called me.     He said oh, I am sorry, I could not come back site, you know, something strange happened.  Then I am like oh, something strange …[intervenes]     Yes.     Okay.  Mr Masango called me, he said  -obviously he was returning my call saying he could not come to site and have the meeting as planned with me, apologising for not coming back to site during lunchtime as arranged.  Then he said to me something I was called – I was called by Mr Koko or Matshela, to come to a meeting at Melrose Arch, okay?  I just listened, you know, becausethen she said it was a very strange funny meeting.  So I was just listening.  Then when I arrived there the reason why I could not call you or to say I am not going to be able to meet a meeting it is because my phone was taken at the entrance.  I met Koko, I think at the balcony, they metsomewhere, then Mr Koko took him to some room at Melrose Arch where at the entrance he was asked to surrender the phone at the entrance.  They took his phone at the entrance.  Then she was taken to some room and in that room there was a indoda emfushane that is what he said to me.     Then I said oh, okay, what happened in that meeting?  Chair, as far as I can recall hundred percent Mr Masango did not go further.  He said to me let us meet on site in the morning so that you still take me to the presentation and I will tell you the rest of like the story what happened.  Because for me was oh, they took your phone, you know, what kind of meeting was that?     Ja, the conversation end, the conversationwas very brief, Chair.     Yes.     Ja, she said to me …[intervenes]     It was a short Indian man.     Ja, that is what the phrase means.     Yes.    Yes.     As I am saying, it did not ring, it only said “ting” so I am not sure like it was recording and maybe the voicemail was full, I do not know, but I could not leave the – ja, the message, Chair.     That is correct, Mr Chair, he did mention to say he had a meeting with Mr Koko and the Indiangentleman, the short Indian gentleman.     No, I am not mistaken about that, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, Mr Masango did not mention anything about the suspension of the four executives.     Ja, on the conversation.    Ja, like …[intervenes]     Yes, if I may say, Chair, it was like a casual – you get what I am saying, it is like let us meet in the morning, I will relate the rest of the story in the morning, not something – I will say not something like tense or – if I may say…    Yes, we did meet, Chair.     It was around, if I am may say, around 6 a.m.because he said to me he needs to rush, there is another meeting at Megawatt Park.     Yes, there is another meeting at Megawatt Park.     It was going to take place between ten andtwelve.     Yes, we met at 6 a.m. because he said he is not going to attend the meeting.     He needs to go back Megawatt Park but I can continue with the meeting after I have briefed him.     You know, about the presentation, the risk that we have identified and what will be the way forward interms of handling the over-expenditure that we were anticipating.     More or less …[intervenes]    Ja, what his views are.     Which I would share at the others but they still need to take me to the details of why we find ourselves in this situation.     Yes, Chair.     If I can recall, Mr Chair, I think he volunteered.  He started – as we were going through the presentation and he is like hey, obviously repeating what he said to me over the phone to say this strange meetinghappened at Mel – I am not going to repeat that but then he went further, Chair, and said in that meeting, as I was asking what happened – my last question to him last night was what happened, when he said okay, let us meet, continue with the meeting, do not cancel it, the meetingthat was going to take place between ten and twelve.  In the morning he says I was told in that meeting that I will be acting as a Group Capital Executive, as executive for Group Capital.  Then I think for me more than – I was like surprised and said oh, okay, where is Mr Dan Marokane going, who was his current manager, you know?  And I cannot recall, Chair, what was his response to my question, you know, because I even asked and say who is going to take over at Kusile, you know?  Then that one I remember, he said I do not know.  But still in the morningof the 11 t h he did not mention the suspension of the four executives.     Yes, the reason he was calling me to – the reason why …[intervenes]     Yes, he could not come.    That is correct.     That is correct.     When we meet.     That is correct.     Group Capital Executive.  Ja, Chair, ja.     Yes.     That was Mr Dan Marokane’s position.    In that position.     I was a bit surprised, hence …[intervenes]    Ja, where is Mr Marokane going?     I thought maybe they are moving, there are some changes happening in the organisation.     No, he did not.     At Kusile as a project director.     He said he does not know.     Yes.     No, Chair.     As far- ja, he did not tell me about any suspensions.     It was related to the presentation because I had to quickly brief him about the presentation.     Because I remember, I think I – he said I need to be out by half past six.     You know, just to – ja.     Chair, on the 10 t h, I am not mistaken.  He did not mention the suspensions.     On the 11 t h he did not mention the suspensions.     About the…?     Chair, I am not mistaken.    That is what I can recall what happened in          that morning, Chair.     On the 12 March, I think it was around about eleven, there was a communiqué from corporate communication to the whole organisation relating to thesuspension of four executives already mentioning the names of the people that were going to act in those positions and Mr Masango’s name was one of the names that was there, exactly the same position.  He told me he was told he was going to act.     I think I sent the – if I can recall the communiqué, it was just saying the four executives – I am not sure whether did it say they will be suspended but it was saying the four executives, I cannot remember where to where but I did – it was there affidavit.    Ja, I cannot remember but it was – it did say to say these are the four executives and while – I think there is some investigation happening, if I can recall, and these are the current executives that will be acting in those positions, I cannot remember word to work.     Can you repeat that, Mr Chair?     I think so, hence I am saying I cannot remember.     Where – oh, there is the communiqué, sorry, Chair.     It was just saying the executive – ja, to step down while the inquiry is underway.  I remember something inquiry.    As if there is some inquiry happening.     Yes.     I think I will say I was surprised also the step down of these four executives more than anything to say, oh, okay, the four executives are stepping down but just the middle manager in a project and these are executive changes happening, so I was like oh, okay, you know, this is what Mr Masango told me that he will be acting althoughhe did not tell me the reasons behind.     Mr Chair, he never told me.     No, he never.     No, I did not ask.    I do not remember asking but he never told me and I would say I was also not interested, if I may say.     Chair, as I have said, Mr Masango called around four, past four, I was still on site.  As I have mentioned previously it was month end reporting, there were reports that were due at five.  I think that day I left the site around six, past six, which was just normal for us, you know, sometimes even eight at night we will leave the site if it is month end reporting, but I never met Mr Masango on the side of the road.    As far as I am concerned, ja.  I think it is up to him to prove it, yes.     Chair, I did not – for me I assume it isstrange because they took his phone from him.  I never enquired to say – I think if I can recall, Chair, I think it is even there in my affidavit, I only asked a question to say why was the meeting not at Megawatt Park and I cannot remember the answer from Mr Masango.  I rememberasking that to say why was the meeting at Megawatt Park but at the same time, Chair, I did not read that much because it was normal for Mr Masango to – whether Megawatt Park to meet stakeholders, you know, ja.  Ja, for meetings.  So I did not really enquire, ensure – there was nothing suspicious or untoward for me to be enquiring to say who was this Indian man.     Okay.     Okay.  The first screen shot relates to paragraph 10, Chair.   “It is a rescheduled meeting, it was supposed to takeplace on the 4 March but it was rescheduled to take place on the 11 March.  The subject of the meeting…”     Oh.  Oh, okay.  I think it will reflect as if itwas – it was coming from Tapiso Rapport(?) who was my secretary.     Yes.     It was directed to the following people, Mr Masango, Abram Masango, Nonhlanhla Kraai, Dudu Ngema …[intervenes]     Ja.  Boitemelo(?) Kanya, [indistinct – dropping voice] Mosiwe and …[intervenes]     Yes.    The meeting was 11 March 2015.     It is not clear.     Tapiso send – Tapiso Rappowe(?) sends the email on Wednesday 4 March 2015 at 7.08 and she says – can you see it now?     Yes.     Project director ’s boardroom.  Mr Masango had his own boardroom where he discussed his – ja, presentation, his own issues that relate to his office.     That is correct, Chair.     Okay.  Is the one that relates to paragraph 23, Chair?     Thank you, Chair.“The meeting was sent out on Friday the 13 March which was after the Group Corporate communiqué was already out talking about the suspension or step down of the four executives where Mr Masango requested a meeting with his management.” We used to call it steering committee, we meet people which is all the discipline within the project.  As you can see the meeting took place on the 16 t h – I think it was a Monday, if I can recall, where Mr Masango came to address us to say he is moving and it was with immediate effect,you know?  And if I can recall, which I did not mention in my affidavit I think on that day he already had the person introducing a guy who was going to take over at Kusile.     On the 16 t h.    The very same meeting when he called of us, all – ja, all the managers as per the invite      Yes.     Who was going to act in his position, that is correct.    Thank you Mr Seleka, Mr Chair, I did not join the bandwagon, I’m not colluding with Mr Masango.  Based on the evidence that I’ve given under the oath to this Commission that’s my vision of my own truth and the truthonly, it’s not based on the collusion with Mr Masango.  I’ve provided, I believe the evidence that I’ve provided.  It’s sufficient  enough to prove that I’m not colluding with Mr Masango, hence I provided the emails and if I can recall, Mr Seleka, you even requested the presentation itself to prove and the presentation, luckily, because I still had my backup taking into account what happened to me within the organisation.  So, the presentation, if you can recall, Mr Seleka, it was even written 10 t h of March which was, say you know, this is the presentation and it’s written NYPD3and the appointment also supports my provision of what happened.     I think, I will speak for what happened to me to say, I did not leave the organisation because of – I was corrupt, I was never corrupt, and I was also not in the corrupt relationship with Mr Masango.  I resigned in July 19 or I formally left the organisation in August 2019 but what led to my resignation is, on the 1 s t of March, I’m just going to be at high level, I got an appointment in my diary that there’s a meeting taking place at – because by then I was with procurement as a senior manager, primary energy responsible for – ja.  Then it was just a – it was like abusiness meeting, then 12 o’clock I go to the boardroom then I found my manager who was my manager by then and there was a HR person there, HR/IR Person.  Then the next thing what happened there, I was told of the intention to be suspended which I was shocked, I remember so well, I even cried because I was shocked to say, okay – then there was just – I’m not going to go to the details but there were just two allegations.   I want to answer the issue of corruption to say, the allegation, we’re not talking about corruption.  The twoallegations we’re talking about a conflict of interest to say, I declare that my husband is owning a company because my husband is a businessman, but I declare – it’s like playing with words, it said, I declare as a Director, I think it’s there in the – it doesn’t say, I did not declare it says, Ideclare as a Director not as a shareholder that was allegation number one.  Allegation number two was, I sent the document to my husband somewhere in 2017 and even the declaration is talking about 2017.  I think for me, I’m saying it’s 2019, the organisation stayed with this for two years then you come and suspend me.     Then, during my – just to be brief to get where I resigned, then I was subjected to – those are the allegations – then let me respond, I deny those allegationssaying I did declare the document I sent to my husband was nothing to do with him getting business in Eskom it was just an example of something he requested, you know, I did not hide, just to say example, look this is how we do things in Eskom, there was no conflict of interest but just to go further Chair, then I participated – that was in March where they asked questions about my husband, everything what happened, you know, and I participated fully, that was March.  Then it was quiet…[intervenes].     Sort of an inquiry, ja I got called somewhere in Pretoria to answer about those allegations, provide information, provide everything, then…[intervenes].     Yes, I was being interviewed.     No, it was not a disciplinary hearing.     I was just being interviewed but even that interview it became more personal because it was more about, I would say, the assets we owned, just to be at high level.  How did we, you know, acquire those assets and all, you know, it wasn’t more about the two allegations for my suspension.    I don’t know Chair.     I don’t know, I really don’t know.  I participated in March Chair, nothing happened, I waited and waited and as I said, somewhere in May something happened and I said, now it’s a personal attack where a video of my house was shown throughout the organisationand the allegation was – it was built by a contractor. Then I realised that my relationship with Eskom was irreparable, hence in July I tendered my resignation.     They allowed me to serve my notice, I left…[intervenes].     Sorry Chair.     They did Chair.     No, Chair, they allowed me to serve the notice.     I can’t hear you Chair.     No, no charges were brought against meChair, when I resigned.     But in my letter I stated that I will continue to participate if there are any charges against me.     Yes, I wanted to continue to cooperate.     Even after I’d left the organisation.     Nobody contact me, nobody till today.     Up to today, Chair.    Nothing, Chair.      No, no I think – if I can recall, they hired a company, was it Bowmans, it was Bowmans.     No, he wasn’t Chair.    No, Chair, I don’t have …[intervenes].     No reason to join the Koko hunt, Chair.     Yes, I know Mr Koko from Generation when I was working in Generation at Kriel Power Station and Mr Koko was, I think and Engineer at Duvha Power Station, but we will have those meetings where he’s there, I’m there but I knew Mr Koko and there’s nothing ja.     Nothing that I know of Chair, till today.    No, we don’t have any issues with Mr Koko.      Yes, Chair     Who’s that?     Okay Who’s that?    No, I don’t know who’s that, Chair.     I don’t know who’s that, Chair.     Me benefiting?     Nothing, Chair, there was no benefit for me, even to collude with Mr Masango.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair and thank you to Mr Seleka.
