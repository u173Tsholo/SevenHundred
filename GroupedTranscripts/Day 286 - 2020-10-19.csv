CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Good morning you may be seated Mr Mkwanazi.    Thank you.  Are you ready Mr Myburgh?    Yes okay.    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.  No, no that will be in order.  But in the meantime we can continue.    If the three – the three issues had been handled specific.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  Mr Mkwanazi you see if on 16 February you and the board realised that the advice from Deneys Reitz is poor advice; it needed to be augmented and you do not wait for them to augment their advice before you take a decision it gives the impression that you have made up your mind by the 16 t h that irrespective of what whether the advice that gets augmented or the augmentation of the advice puts the advice at an acceptable level in terms of its legal strength you do not – when you do not wait for that it gives the impression that you have made up your mind and it does not matter what the augmentation will produce you are going ahead because you are clear in your mind that this is the decision you must take. Do you have something to say on that?    Yes.    Hm.  Mr Myburgh.    Did you and the board – when you were dealing with these matters – with this Gama matter – remember that there was a charge which had got nothing to do with procurement.    You did remember?    Yes.  Yes, no I am talking more then rather than now.  You were aware at the time that there were three charges?    For which he was dismissed?    Would you agree that it would appear that it was – that Mr Gigaba if your evidence is true may have also suffered from the same oversight because when he – on your evidence instructed you to review Mr Gama’s case he does not seem to have said anything about the third charge; he talked about condonation and procurement.    Yes.      Ja, no, no.    Yes, yes.  No Mr Gigaba will come also at some stage and give evidence.  Okay thank you Mr Myburgh.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  Of course Mr Mkwanazi is it not remarkable that so many people in the board overlook if it was overlooking something so important to say why do we not – why are we not talking about the charge that has got nothing to do with procurement?  And Deneys Reitz the attorneys also seem to – to lose sight of that.  Why are they not – why is there not a single person in the board who say, but hang on we are talking about taking – reinstating Mr Gama on the basis of condonation but condonation has – does not apply to the other charge – what do we have to say about that?    Yes you see..    Yes you see it is exactly that that I am asking – I am asking you about whether it is not remarkable?  Namely that despite the fact that Mr Gama had been dismissed for three charges; despite the fact that the board had available to it a detailed rulings of the Chairperson of the disciplinary hearing which made it clear there were three charges and that one of them did not have anything to do with procurement.  Despite the fact that the board had available to it Mr Todd’s opinion / report which made it clear that there were three charges one of which had nothing to do with procurement.  Is it not remarkable that the whole board left out this particular charge which has got nothing to do with procurement?  It is; is it not?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Of course somebody analysing this or listening to the evidence relating to Mr Gama’s reinstatement and so on somebody might say, well it was oversight and that is it.  Somebody else might say, maybe it was oversight that happened because the board was too keen to take Mr Gama back and that is why they overlooked something so – that was right there in front of them.  Maybe somebody might say, you see they had found what they believed was an answer to procurement.  There was no answer to the other charge.  So focussing on this other charge would spoil the – the arrangement now.  Because if we do not have an answer to this other charge how do we take Mr Gama back?  So let us focus on procurement.  You want to say something Mr Mkwanazi to the various scenarios I am saying people listening to the evidence might think about?    I see that almost all the members of the board who deposed to affidavits and that have been given to the commission say there was – they were not aware of any role played by anybody outside of the board or outside of Transnet in the reinstatement of Mr Gama.  But Mr Mapoma did say there was pressure that was put on him by Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu the special advisor to Minister Gigaba.  Of course Mr Mahlangu has denied that he put any pressure.   You did not have any pressure brought upon you to try and make sure that the board agreed to reinstate Mr Gama?    Hm.  Of course you know the – the advice from Deneys Reitz one has got to go back to it.  As I recall it does not deal for example with the issue of     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Myburgh.     Why did you and the board not take the     But was that not the problem Mr Mkwanazi, namely ...[intervenes]      Namely...  I am sorry.  Was that not the problem ...[intervenes]      Oh, can you hear me?     Oh, okay.  Is the problem... was the problem not exactly that, namely that you and the board were looking for a different advice?   You were not looking for another advice which could be the same as the advice that had been given before by Bowman’s and from Mr Todd?   So as long as you had not received a different advice, you would not be happy?  You wanted a different advice and when you got it, even if it was poor, you were happy to rely on it?   Is that not the problem that you should not have been looking for a different advice?  You could have been looking for a different law firm to give advice on the same issues that Mr Todd had given and mister...  I mean, Webber Wentzel had given but the advice did not need to be different from theirs.  You should have simply been looking for another advice that may not be different.  If it was different, fine.   Then if it was different you would compare its soundness with the soundness of the other advices that you had received.   Do you understand what I am saying?  That maybe the problem is that you were looking for a different advice?     No.  Thank you.  Before I let Mr Myburgh continue, I just mention this.  As I understand the position.  Mr Gama has raised the issue of condonation at the disciplinary hearing.   He had raised the issue of inconsistency at the hearing.  Now, one of the issues which I think, I if am correct in that, one of the issues that the board should have thought about     I think 22 December ...[intervenes]      22 December 2010 is the letter.     Ja.     Yes, but ...[intervenes]      But even with that.  I do not think that the Public Protector would have had any problem if the board said with regard to Mr Gama’s dismissal, we have set up an independent forum and a fair process at which Mr Gama is ready to put his case as fully as he wants.   He has done so.  This is the outcome.  He is now going to another independent forum.  There too, he will have a process where he can make out his case and we as the board will abide by the decisions of that independent forum.   Why did you and the board not take that principled approach?     Mr Myburgh.   ADV MYBURGH     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, as I understand what you are saying, Mr Mkwanazi, and as I understand Mr Mahlangu’s email to his minister, it appears that the two of you, namely yourself and Mr Mahlangu had regular interactions about matters relating to Transnet and that included discussions relating to the matter of Mr Gama, is that correct?     The interactions that you had with Mr Mahlangu, were they on the basis that he would convey to the minister whatever you conveyed to him in regard to various issues at Transnet including Mr Gama’s matter?     To state owned entities in general?     Yes, okay.  So are you saying that a lot of the discussions that you had with Mr Mahlangu related to state owned enterprises under the Department of Public Enterprises?     Oh, okay, generally, the discussions related to Transnet matters but sometimes they would also related to other SOEs, is that right?     Yes.  But when you were having discussions with him relating to Transnet was it on the basis that he was, so to speak, the conduit for him to pass on to the minister the updates or whatever you told him, you were not just telling Mr Mahlangu in his personal capacity, your were telling him because he was special adviser to the minister.       Yes, okay, ja.  So the basis for your engagements with Mr Mahlangu was that he would brief the minister on your discussions, is that right?     Yes.  Well, maybe you have answered the next question I was going to have.  Namely, with the Minister Mr Gigaba having instructed you, on your evidence, to review the Gama case whether you subsequently ever had a meeting with him where you told him how far you were with the review process either before it was completed or when it was about to be completed?     Ja, okay, and he would have – your expectation was that he would then share the briefing with the minister?     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     That affidavit, Mr Mkwanazi, would have been one of the affidavits that were sent to you together with the letter that invited you to depose to your first affidavit.     Maybe find the bundle first.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh?     I am sorry, I was still concerned about Mr Mkwanazi’s response that he did not get or see that affidavit of the company secretary [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I will deal with it later.  What page is – I missed the page numbers you were referring him to.     And the …[intervenes]     The bundle 1, nè?     One second?  That is on bundle 1, nè?     Yes, okay, I have got it now.     Gaba, Gcaba.     That would be Gcaba, hey?     For the transcribers, Gcaba will be G-c-a-b-a.  224 you say, Mr Myburgh?     I take it that you approached those 30 names or so where condonation had been granted on their submission that the employees concerned would have applied for condonation, is that correct?     Were there some who had not, as far as you know?   As I understand the position, condonation was not supposed to be had for the asking.  Was that your understanding at the time as well?     Yes, no, what I mean is that the position, as you also understood it, I understand the position to have been that just because somebody, an employee asks for condonation, does not mean that they will get it.     It remained dependent on the merits of each request and the circumstances of the – of how the irregularity happened, is that correct?     I also got the impression from some of the documents from Transnet that the idea was that condonation could be granted for non-serious irregularities if I understood correctly.  Maybe non-serious is not the correct term, I do not know whether it is non-material, I am not sure, but I got the impression that there was a clear distinction made to say the more serious the deviation or the irregularity, the less likely that an employee would get condonation.  Is my understanding the same as what your understanding was at the time.     Yes but leaving out the question of whether it was a good idea to make a distinction between serious irregularities and maybe not so serious irregularities, or material irregularities and non-material irregularities, leaving aside the question of whether it was a good idea to make that distinction.  Is it your recollection that there was such a distinction in terms of the policies?     Yes, but would it be correct to say that the authority considering a request or application by an employee for condonation would have had to take into account among other factors the factor of how serious the irregularity was, would it be correct to say that     Yes, okay thank you.  Mr Myburgh?     Six months Mr Myburgh.     Yes.     You mean condonation could have been denied?     Mmm, but whether granted or denied that would not impact on whether he should be disciplined or not, that would be a separate issue?  MR     Yes, so as you said previously even if you are granted condonation you can still be disciplined.     Okay.     I was thinking of asking something, but I have decided to let you carry on.     And isn’t the position that actually the rulings of the Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry, because there were two, one on guilt, the other one on sanction, isn’t the position that the mere instruction that you must review Mr Gama’s case had to start with a reading of those rulings and seeing whether they could be faulted, even before you can look at anything else.  Wouldn’t you agree that ...[intervenes]      Okay, alright, Mr Myburgh?     I am sorry Mr Myburgh, you probably mean the R17million in terms of financial benefits to Mr Gama.     Of course the settlement agreement went even far beyond that, there’s legal costs and other things.   You mean the financial benefits to Mr Gama?     Yes, no, no, no I think I understand what you mean, I think your statement, I understood your statement to be saying you wanted to confirm that he knows that the settlement agreement cost Transnet R17million.     And I was simply saying you haven’t counted the legal costs that they paid to Mr Gama’s, which would be far more, you probably are just talking about what you just said ja.     Well Mr Myburgh’s question is even with the two procurement issues.     Ja, why did you and the Board decide to settle the matter just because there is some doubt that was created by a poor legal opinion, or weak, I think that’s the term you used, a weak legal opinion that was not reasoned in any substantial way when you had about three legal opinions saying you are on strong grounds against Mr Gama in regard to this arbitration.  So Mr Myburgh’s question is help us understand why the Board thought it was the right thing to settle in circumstances where this settlement was going to be so expensive and yet the prospects of Transnet winning the case were so good, to your knowledge in terms of the three legal opinions.     Mr Myburgh?     I don’t think you have got an answer.     But of course if Mr Mkwanazi doesn’t have an answer he doesn’t have one.  Feel free to deal with the issue the way you see it, it is an important issue.     What would you say if somebody said this decision by the Board is indefensible?     Mr Myburgh?     Okay.     Maybe before that Mr Myburgh Mr Mkwanazi while on that page 168 won’t you – or no it is at page 168 you will see at the bottom of that page that the     Those seem to be the factors which the memorandum says should be taken into account when considering whether or not to grant condonation, you accept that?     And on the next page, page 169, you will see a heading that says information to be contained in a condonation submission, can you see that heading?     And then it says    Now in relation to the thirty or whatever the number is of condonations that you said had been granted in terms of the list that was – that you had before you in a spreadsheet you would not have had all of this information to see in which case in order to be able to compare with Mr Gama’s case, isn’t it?     You would not have had all of this information regarding each one of them.     Yes, Mr Myburgh?     Let us take the tea adjournment and we will resume at half past eleven. We adjourn.     Thank you.  You may seated Mr Mkwanazi.  Let us continue.    Let us continue.  Your microphone Mr Myburgh.    Oh otherwise the TV people.    Okay alright.    Does that mess up your plan with your table there?    Ja.    Ja.    Well Mr Todd says clearly – he clearly says it was not a matter that would fall under condonation that would attract condonation.  As I – as I understand his argument maybe not just based here but maybe based elsewhere in his affidavits as well.  This was a case where the board had given in effect an instruction and that instruction was effectively defied by Mr Gama.  Condonation has got nothing to do with that does it?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay alright.    Well you do recall Mr Mkwanazi do you not that when you did your first affidavit.    The commission had taken trouble to make available to you the two rulings of the Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry as well as…    As well as Mr Todd’s affidavit as well as Mr Todd’s report that was before the board.      To make sure you could refresh your memory, you remember that?    Yes okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    Or if you did read them you may have decided to disregard them.    Either you read them – or either you did not read them or if you read them for whatever reason you may have decided to ignore them.  Okay.      Yes.    Yes.    Do you have a clear recollection that you had read the two rulings of the disciplinary Chairperson – the Chairperson of the hearing?    Is Mr Todd’s one.    Well – well you see those two rulings are quite comprehensive. It seems to me that anyone who has read them will not forget that they had read them.  They are quite comprehensive you have to put aside time to really read them.    Do you recall that you did read them?    Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    He is a senior counsel, he is a labour lawyer from what I have read, he had been – he was acceptable to all sides to run the disciplinary hearing.  When you look at his rulings you can tell that he took time to deal with issues that had been raised very, very thoroughly.  So Mr Myburgh’s question is, why did you and your board think that you could just override his decision when these very issues had been raised with him and he had considered them thoroughly?    Mr Myburgh has at some state effectively said to you; you could not settle because there was some doubt because in litigation in arbitration there is always some doubt.  There is no hundred percent guarantee that you are going to win.  Even when you have a strong case there is always some doubt.   Therefore when you were told – when you were given an opinion that in your view created some doubt that should have been neither here nor there until the doubt that was created said to you we do not have reasonable prospects of success.  As long as it was just some doubt that is like any other case.   That should not have weighed with you at all because there is always doubt in arbitration.  There is always doubt in litigation.  So what he put you – to you is that should not have swayed your view of what you should do.  What do you say?    Hm.    Mr Myburgh.   I am going to... I am going to ...[intervenes]      Mr Mkwanazi, I am sorry.  I am going to stop you there.  Go back to Mr Myburgh’s question.     And just answer that question.  Mr Myburgh, do you want to repeat the question?     Well, you have an issue that has... that had been dealt with by the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry which Mr Myburgh you to at page 164.  So it is quite clear the chairperson dealt with this issue of inconsistency.  He says reference was made to 42 instances, incidents or transactions.  So he...  Mr Gama had the opportunity to present his case that he had been treated inconsistently to present it before an independent forum chaired by as senior member of the bar paid for by Transnet.   He was allowed to use his own team of lawyers.  Lawyers of hic choice so that he could... they could present the best case that they could for him.   He says – and then you are instructed to review his case.  You come back.  You review his case.  You do not say     But you agree or do you not agree that that should have been your attitude?  Then that should have been your board’s attitude?     So do you agree or do you not agree that at the time of the settlement, the correct approach on the     But of course, you will concede, will you not, that you should not put yourself and the board and your board... you should not put the matter as if you and your board were the victim of some poor legal advice.   Because you did have sound and strong legal advice at your disposal that had been given by Mr Todd and you chose to follow what you call the poor legal advice.   It was your choice.  It was your board’s choice.  It is not as if there was no choice to follow sound legal advice.  You agree?     Yes.  Mr Myburgh.     Ja, let us just get that one.  So what is the answer to that Mr Mkwanazi?     But he is talking about you and your board.  He says it is not correct that you and your board did a review.  Because when you do a review in a matter like this, you would have had to go to Mr Antrobus’ rulings and look at them carefully which does not appear ...[intervenes]      H’m.  Mr Myburgh.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  I just want to follow up on your last question.     Mr Mkwanazi, sorry.  I am just interrupting Mr Myburgh.       Understanding that Mr Gigaba had, according to your evidence, instructed you to conduct a review of the Gama matter and understanding that he had said that, on your evidence, there was unfairness.   Understanding that he had given a list, a basis for his thinking that there was unfairness, namely, as I understand your evidence, some executives were treated less... more leniently or less harshly than black executives. And yet, he had almost mentioned the issue of condonation.  Are you able to say what outcome of the review would have addressed his concerns on your understanding?     I am sorry, Mr Mkwanazi.  I am sorry, Mr Mkwanazi.     I might not have articulated my question as clearly as I should have.  The question is not about features of the review process, okay?     It is not about that.  It is about what outcome of that review process would have addressed his concerns that there had been unfairness on your understanding?     Mr Myburgh.     Before that Mr Myburgh.  We have the situation Mr Mkwanazi that although you make the concessions that you have made and I think they are properly made about the matters that Mr Myburgh has just raised with you with regard to the findings of the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry.       Yes.  And you said in effect by your     Yes.     Your board.     Yes, yes.  Mr Myburgh.     That is Bundle 1.     I am sorry.  You said we must go to the settlement agreement at page 36?     Mr Myburgh?     Okay alright.       Well, you signed on the 22 n d of February.  Mr Gama signed on the 23rd.     Ja.     [laughing]  Well, Mr Mkwanazi.  I am thinking of a stronger word.  I think Mr Myburgh is being very kind to you ...[intervenes]      ...and your board.     [laughing]     Mr Mkwanazi ...[intervenes]      Mr Mkwanazi.     Mr Mkwanazi, you called this is a settlement agreement.     Is it not?     You sought to settle a dispute, is it not?  And that dispute was Mr Gama’s unfair dismissal dispute with Transnet, is it not?     He had referred his dispute to the Transnet bargaining council to try and get relief from his grievance, his feeling that he had been treated unfairly, is it not?     And if he got what the bargaining council could give him, what he would have called his first prize there, he would have been very happy, is it not?  If he got his first prize.     He had a first prize obviously.     You go to court, you have a first prize, you go to arbitration, you know what you would like to get.  If you do not get your first prize, you might have your second prize.       If he got his first prize he would have been very happy.       Now his first prize would have included reinstatement, is it not?     And reinstatement with full back pay and benefits, that would have been, I guess, his first prize.  Maybe he – well, having looked at his statement that he sent to the bargaining council, I did not see anything that says he was seeking costs from the bargaining council.  It may be that that may have been dealt with in some other document but that was not there.  But you gave him much more than the bargaining council could have given him.  At least that much you know, do you not?     Well, the bargaining council, if it found that he had been – his dismissal was substantively unfair, it could have ordered his reinstatement which could have meant full benefits and back pay but it could also have meant he would get reinstatement but no back pay because it might say it is not as if he was innocent, he had done something terribly wrong.  You are admitting …[intervenes]     So it might have said no back pay, you know?  It might have said not even reinstatement but maybe should be given some compensation, maybe six months compensation, maybe one year, but no reinstatement because it might say this person was a CEO of the largest division in Transnet, he was found guilty of serious acts of misconduct, he admits that he was properly found guilty, this person should not be taken back or it might have said let him go back but not with full back pay.  I doubt that it would have ordered costs but maybe it would but you gave him much more than that.  That you do know, do you not?     Yes, Mr Myburgh?     Mr Mkwanazi.     Mr Mkwanazi, sorry, but you cannot – it does not just look like it is a generous, it is an extremely generous settlement to him.  I thought you would make that concession at least.  It is not that it looks like, it is an extremely generous settlement.     Yes, okay, continue.     Well, Mr Mkwanazi, let us – I just want to mention something.  You said sometime, I think on Friday, that Mr Gama wanted – was the one who came with the idea of having a one-on-one meeting with you.  You remember that?     Well, maybe Mr Myburgh will deal with that in due course but in the – I think in the consultation note from Deneys Reitz, either that or another letter of memo, it is said that you said you want a one-on-one meeting with Mr Gama.  That does not suggest that you were saying Mr Gama wants a one-on-one meeting with you, it suggests you were the one who wanted the one-on-one with him.  Do you remember seeing that note?     Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     It is as if you are dealing with somebody that had done absolutely nothing wrong and was just dismissed by Transnet, somebody who is innocent, completely innocent.  You understand that?     Yes.  Mr Myburgh?     Yes.     But, of course, if you agree on paying somebody 75% or whatever cost …[intervenes]     …you would have an idea what the total cost would be and what therefore 75% will be.     Do you want to comment on what Mr Myburgh has just put to you?     In regard to somebody who had been properly found guilty of three very serious acts of misconduct?     You are Chairman of a very large state owned entity, Transnet.     [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] you must have a final written warning that will start operating when you written.  Why do you not say that?     I do not normally use strong language, Mr Mkwanazi, but what would you say if somebody says this was a nonsensical final written warning?     Yes but my question is, you are negotiating a settlement of a dispute, a dismissal dispute, the employee concerned is a former CEO of the largest division of Transnet, he has been found guilty of three serious acts of misconduct.  By this time he accepts that he was guilty of these.  Now you are saying okay, we will reinstate you but there must be some sanction for your misconduct.   I take it that you must have said – or when you spoke about a sanction, a final written warning with Mr Gama or his lawyers, you must have been talking about a final written warning that would be operative when he came back and would be operative for six months.   You were not – when you started talking about it, you were not talking about a warning that would have expired by the time he came back, were you?  When you [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] the issue for the first time because I assume it came from your side.     But, Mr Mkwanazi, if he deserved a final written warning it should be there when he comes back.  How can you say he should not sit there with a final written warning?  That is what happens with every employee, why should he be treated differently?     Actually you should be stricter, should you not with senior people than with junior employees because senior people cannot plead ignorance, they know – they know the rules, they know the policies, they are supposed to be exemplary to the junior employees, is it not?     So I come back to my proposition or my question, what do you say if somebody says this final written warning that you agreed to as the chief negotiator for Transnet for Mr Gama, is a nonsensical final written warning because it is February 2011 when you are negotiating and you are agreeing to an arrangement in terms of which Mr Gama will be deemed to have carried this final written warning from end of June 2010 to December 2010 when he was not at Transnet.  What do you say when somebody says it was a nonsensical final written warning?     Yes.  Mr Myburgh?     Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment, we will resume at two.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let us proceed.     One second, Mr Myburgh, has that supplementary affidavit arrived?     May I have a copy while you are questioning.     Oh, is it in.     Oh, don’t forget your line of questioning.     Just after his main affidavit?     Yes.     Oh, okay.     It’s the settlement agreement.    At page 38 of Bundle 1 and he was reading paragraph 3.5.      No, no he’s still at 3.5.     Ja.     No, Mr Mkwanazi you’ll have to really explain to me and the public, properly, what your decision was, really here because I can tell you this, I’ve been on the bench for close to 24 years, I’ve never seen anything like this, I’ve never seen anything like this.  This, Mr Gama, had launched an urgent application against the Board, against Transnet and he cited individual members of the Board in order to stop or interdict the disciplinary proceedings that were being instituted against him, he lost because Transnet and the Board, at that time, which was not your Board, the Board that preceded your Board, opposed that application because they must have seen that, this application that he brought had no foundation whatsoever.  There was a need for a disciplinary process to be instituted and he should go through that process.  If he was found not guilty that would be fine, if he was found guilty then there would be a sanction for that, they opposed that application, successfully and a High Court Judge concluded that, Mr Gama should pay Transnet’s costs as well as the costs of the individual Directors whom he had cited in that application.  He applied for leave to appeal against that decision that was refused, that was the end of the road for him in regard to that and in that application, he had argued that there was an agenda that underlay the disciplinary proceedings, namely to stop him from being appointed as Group CEO. The Judge rejected all of that and dismissed that application, that was done.  Now, he went through a disciplinary process, he was found guilty and he was dismissed, then he goes to the Bargaining Council, refers his disciplinary to the Bargaining Council but now he says, by the time you are negotiating this settlement, he says, I accept that I was guilty, I’m guilty of the three acts of misconduct that the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry found me guilty of, I accept that.  Now, you then say, in settlement of the dismissal dispute, not the High Court dispute, because that’s, been sorted out, you say, you know what, Mr Gama, the costs that the Judge said you must pay us, pay Transnet, you don’t have to pay off that. That has got nothing to do with the dismissal dispute, the Bargaining Council, even if Mr Gama had won against Transnet the Bargaining Council Arbitrator would never have interfered with that.  He would not have changed Mr Gama’s fortunes in regard to the High Court, Court Order. So, why did you interfere with a cost order made by a Judge in a separate litigation which Mr Gama had lost and say, you don’t have to pay those costs because Transnet was not at risk in regard to those costs, that was finalised, why did you do that?     No but Mr Mkwanazi, that’s not going to be good enough.  Remember, before you deposed to your first affidavit that you had filed in the Commission, remember that?     Remember that you filed your affidavit pursuant to a letter from the Commission which said that the Chairperson would like you to explain the terms of that settlement, do you remember that?     Do you remember that, that letter, specifically drew your attention to certain features of the settlement agreement, including the issue of costs, do you remember?     It gave you a chance to explain, among other things, why you and your Board decided that that the costs which a High Court Judge had said Mr Gama should pay to Transnet, why you said he should not pay those.  Actually when you – Mr Todd, testified that he and his firm had gone to the extent of having those costs taxed – actually it was not all of the costs because he said there were two law firms, his firm represented Transnet, another firm, Eversheds represented, I think, individual Directors but I think the cost that related to Transnet and not individual Directors, he said they had taxed that bill and that bill in terms of the taxed costs, Mr Gama was owing Transnet about four hundred and twenty six thousand rand something and he said, you, through somebody at Transnet instructed him to stop all processes aimed at recovering that money from Mr Gama, R426 000 that Mr Gama owed Transnet, you said they must stop trying to recover that, why did you do that?     Why, why because that’s a question you would have asked anybody who told you that, you would have said why?     But that’s an obvious question that a Director of a company should ask in such a situation, to say, a High Court Judge has said Mr Gama must pay Transnet these costs, this matter is finalised. You are telling me that, now we must abandon those costs, why, that’s a question that a Director would ask, why didn’t you ask that question?     But do you not accept that it’s an obvious question to ask?     I’m sorry, Mr Myburgh I know you might be having – you and I might have the same question but I’m going to ask this.     Not only that Mr Mkwanazi, not only do you then decide with your Board that Mr Gama should not bother to pay R426 000 that he owed Transnet and actually it was going to be more because there was the cost relating to the Directors, probably it would be about a million maybe about R800 000.  So, you say Mr Gama, you don’t have to bother paying that, in effect, forget about what the Judge said, you don’t have to bother about that, you don’t have to pay that but not only that, you then say, you know what Mr Gama, we Transnet who won that case are going to undertake to pay 75% of your own legal costs that you incurred to unfairly take us to the High Court, that’s what you – in effect what you said, isn’t it?     How do you explain that, how can that possibly be in the interest of Transnet, how possibly could it be said to be acting in the interest of Transnet when you act like that?     What would he take?     The value that a CEO who signs documents without reading them would bring to the company, is that what you’re telling me about?  The value of a CEO who defied a Board instruction, is that what you’re talking about?     Or did you think he defied that other Board, but he would not defy your Board?     Were you sure that he was not going to sign documents without reading them?     So why you want him back because there is this risk.  He signed – on his version, he signed documents without reading them that had millions of rands of implications for Transnet.  The next time he could have signed a document with, even a large amount in terms of implications.  Weren’t you concerned about that?     Mr Myburgh, I’ll leave it for you to take further, that issue.     But that legal opinion never advised you to offer costs to…[intervenes].     So, you can’t invoke that legal opinion to justify why you undertook to pay 75% of the cost because the lawyers, at least in that legal opinion, never said you were at risk of being ordered to pay costs.     Mr Myburgh?    Did you ask any of the lawyers that were available to you whether Chris – Mr Todd or – of Bowman Gilfillan or Deneys Reitz or Webber Wentzel to say just guide me on the issue of costs?  What could happen and what could not happen at the Bargaining Council?  Did you ask for guidance?    Well Mr Todd’s report or opinion made it clear that Transnet had reasonable prospects of success therefore I do not think that they would have mentioned anything to you about any risk that the Bargaining Council could award costs against Transnet even if Mr Gama were to be – to win.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Mr Myburgh.    Okay let me try that.  You see Mr Mkwanazi in Bundle 2 page 8.    You have a draft settlement agreement that had been signed – that was signed by Mr Gama on the 10 February which you did not sign.  Okay?    In Clause 3.5 of that draft settlement    That draft settlement agreement was saying that you will pay 75% of his legal costs relating to the unfair dismissal dispute. That is the referral to the Bargaining Council.     And you will pay 75% of his legal cost incurred in connection with his disciplinary hearing.      That is what that clause says.  Now you did not sign that – that draft settlement that has got that clause.    You signed the one that we have got at Bundle 1 at page 38.  Now paragraph – clause 3.5 of that – of the agreement – the settlement agreement that you signed says Transnet will make a contribution equivalent to 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed legal costs incurred during Gama’s high court application.  So in other words where the draft that you did not sign said incurred during Gama’s disciplinary hearing it was replaced with incurred during Gama’s high court application.  And Counsel’s question to you – question to you is this must have meant that you rejected the idea of paying 75% - a 75% contribution towards the legal costs he incurred during the disciplinary process.  You rejected that idea.  That is what Counsel is saying.  Would you not agree?  Because that is why it does not – it is not reflected in the final settlement.  But you replaced that part with the part that says incurred during Gama’s high court application.  So Counsel was saying to you, you specifically applied your mind to the question whether you should undertake to pay 75% of Mr Gama’s legal costs in relation to the disciplinary process.  You rejected that.  So he is saying you could not have subsequently thought that this final settlement agreement includes Mr Gama’s legal costs in relation to the disciplinary hearing.  What do you say to that?    Yes.  So you had rejected the idea of paying a contribution towards his legal costs in the disciplinary hearing?    Yes.  Yes okay.  Mr Myburgh.    No I do not think you need an accountant Mr Mkwanazi.  You just need common sense.    But it is not just the numbers it is the principle.  Why in the first place in a labour matter when you are settling the matter that is pending before the Bargaining Council for arbitration you agree to pay the opponent’s legal costs of 75% at all.  Somebody who accepts that he is guilty of three acts of misconduct.  That I think both you and I agree were serious acts of misconduct.  Why is it that none of the board members says hang on, hang on, hang on a minute.  Why must we do all of this when the man himself admits that he is guilty of three acts of misconduct?  Why must we treat him as if he is innocent?  Why must we deal with the matter as if he is wrong anywhere?  As if Transnet just unjustifiably brought these charges against him  Why is it that there is not a single member of that board who says hang on, hang on, we are – there is something I do not understand here.  Why must we do that?  It is just difficult to understand why not a single person in that board was able to say really even with reinstate – well I should not say single person because there was a minority – there was a minority.    Ja there was a minority who said no, you know.  But it looks like it was maybe only two people.  And the rest – so it is not true to say there was not a single member of the board who – who could see that there was something wrong here.  There was a minority which did but …    Ja the majority did not seem to think there was anything wrong in doing – handling this matter in this way.  Mr Myburgh.    But Mr Mkwanazi this was not the first thing that could not be explained about this agreement.  There were a number of things that had happened which could not be explained.  We have dealt with some of them in the settlement agreement.    Hm.    You see –    You see Mr Mkwanazi Mr Mapoma says if you go to the settlement agreement.    The 75% costs that it talks about are taxed legal costs.  Okay.    You understand the concept of taxed legal costs?    Yes okay.  So he says in accordance with the settlement agreement they were insisting.  He said Mr Langa that is Mr Gama’s attorney sent an invoice or a bill I am not sure for a certain amount I do not know whether it was R12 million or what and it was not taxed.  So he says he was insisting that 75% - the 75% of legal costs that Transnet would pay would only be of taxed legal costs that incurred by Mr Gama and he was insisting on that with regard to Mr Langa.  But he says Mr Langa did not want to submit a taxed bill – a taxed cost and there was a delay because there was this issue.  Mr Mapoma was insisting that it should be taxed costs and Mr Langa was not submitting that.  Maybe he was not prepared to submit that and in the meantime there was a delay.  So he says with the delay – now I do not know whether Mr Mkwanazi can…    Oh there is something wrong.    With the video.  Okay I wonder whether we should adjourn for somebody to deal with that or are they going to be able to deal with it while we are talking?  Do you know?  I do not know whether it is to be fixed from this side.  Looks like we have – where are our technicians?  I just need – at – you can still hear me?    Oh it is just the video.  Okay let us talk while …    Let us talk while they fix the video and if we need to adjourn to – okay I am told that it should be fine now.      Yes okay.  Okay.  So I am – I was saying to you Mr Mapoma says there is a context to the position that ultimately paid 75% of its own legal costs to Mr Gama’s attorneys.  And he says the context is that Mr Gama’s attorneys did not want to send a tax bill or was delaying or was reluctant to send a tax bill.   And in the meantime, he was getting pressure from within Transnet to pay Mr Gama’s attorneys.  And he was the     H’m.  Myburgh.     [laughing]       So how could you have expected that Mr Gama would have paid Transnet’s legal costs when you had instructed that all steps to recover Transnet’s legal costs for Mr Gama should be stopped? MR     What obligation now you are talking about now?     In regard to what?     But you never went back to Mr Todd and     Yes.  He had... Mr Todd gave evidence here and said ...[intervenes]      ...after the high court had ordered that he should pay costs, they were in communication with his lawyers and he was not paying the costs.   So they had to get the costs taxed in the high court.  There was a tax bill.  They informed him that this is how the costs have been taxed.  Still did not pay.   So they then embarked upon the execution process.  That is the process which you instructed him to stop     ...you said to him  But Mr Mkwanazi, remember the timeframe.  It is around mid-January 2011 that you instruct ...[intervenes]      that you instruct Mr Todd to stop the process ...[intervenes]      ...of getting from Mr Gama the money that he owed Transnet in terms of the high court order.     You stop him.       And the reason given is that you are stopping him so that... so as to give the settlement negotiations a chance.  That is the reason that was advanced.     Okay.  So obviously, pending the outcome of the settlement, that process of recovering from Mr Gama was at a standstill.  You accept that?     It could not be ...[intervenes]      It could have been ...[intervenes]      Let me repeat that.  That process of recovering the legal costs from Mr Gama for Transnet, could not have been ongoing while the negotiations were ongoing, is it not?     It was at a standstill that process.     So when you were settling, negotiating the terms of the settlement, you knew that the process to recover Transnet’s legal costs from Mr Gama was at a standstill.  You could not have thought that he had been paying anything in the meantime.  You could not have thought that.       It was only about a month before that you     So I am putting to you that when you were negotiating and settling the matter and talking about 75% about Transnet undertaking to pay 75% of Mr Gama’s costs, it could not have been because you thought Mr Gama had been paying some money towards Transnet in terms of legal costs.  It could not have been that.       Mr Myburgh.      Yes?     Yes.     Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  I am sure that in part it is the answers that come from Mr Mkwanazi that continue to leave questions.  But it is okay.  I understand.  Mr Myburgh, do you want to say anything?     Yes.     That is bundle 3.     It is that period of the settlement agreement, Mr Myburgh, and it is within two weeks after he has assumed duty.  I just make that observation.     For another reason that will be – I will deal with later.     I mean, Mr Mkwanazi, it is the same people – the same people who invoked condonation, the condonation process at Transnet to justify reinstating Mr Gama.  It is the same people who on the 11 April say they are requesting management to make a presentation to deal with very basic questions.  The first question they want management to deal with is, what is a condonation process?  But they are supposed to have known that by then because how could they have invoked the condonation process to reinstate Mr Gama if they do not what a condonation process is at Transnet?  You understand our difficulty?     But, Mr Mkwanazi, that is what is – that is what makes it even worse.  I mean, a question like this, what is a condonation process, is a question you should ask before doing you first condonation case, it is not a question you should ask after doing 20 condonation cases.  You understand what I mean?     By that time you are supposed to be very familiar with this, you cannot be asking that basic question.  If you ask it after doing 20 condonation cases, you know, people will be tempted to say it mean this person did not know what he or she was doing through these 20 condonation cases if he or she does not know what a condonation process is at Transnet? You understand what I mean?     Mr Myburgh?     Yes, yes.     Yes.  No, but you think that my reaction is based on Mr Mkwanazi’s statement that there was a need for induction or anything to do with induction but my question does not stem from that.  It stems from the mere fact that the minutes reflect that this committee said they wanted to be addressed on what a condonation process is so that that is where it comes from, so that is what I am saying.     No, no, no, …[intervenes]     Yes.  No, just to clarify and we will proceed just now.  So the idea is that somebody or the committee would not ask the question what is a condonation process if they know what a condonation process is.  That is the point of departure.  But okay, let us continue.  Mr Myburgh.     Thank you.  Now, Mr Mkwanazi, were you, as a board, concerned that if you did not settle the matter of Mr Gama’s unfair dismissal claim on the terms on which you settled it, something would happen that would not be in the interests of Transnet?  Is there something you were concerned would happen that would not be in the interest of Transnet?     Now if you refused to include a contribution of costs in the settlement agreement in relation to the High Court matter.     What did you think was the worst thing that could happen to Transnet if you stood your ground and told Mr Gama and his lawyers we are not going to make any contribution to your costs in regard to the High Court application?     Do you think Mr Gama would still have signed the settlement agreement or do you think he would have proceeded to go to the arbitration?     But like what outcome do you think could have happened?  In other words, you know when litigants settle a matter that is standing in court or in arbitration, each party weighs up its risks and its prospects.  If I am the employer and I do not want the employee to be reinstated, I look at the prospects that I could lose and the employee could be reinstated.  Okay?     And I say well, we will give you an ex gratia payment or compensation or 12 months, equivalent to 12 months salary.  If you take that we call it quits.  Then, from the employer ’s side, I know that what I am getting is that the employee is not coming back because I think it is a bad thing for my company for the employee to be brought back, okay? Now if you are an employee, you want your job back, you push for that but if the employer resists you might end up saying okay, I can take money because you say you think if I insist and the employer refuses and we end up in the arbitration, I might get nothing.   Okay?     So what is it, if there was anything, that the board of Eskom – you and the board of Transnet were fearing could possibly happen if you did not agree to contribute to Mr Gama’s High Court legal costs?     So you feared that if you did not reach agreement with him you will not have him back and therefore would not have somebody to fix those problems at TFR?     So that is how badly you wanted him back?     And so is that why then you were prepared to contribute 75% of his legal costs in regard to the High Court?  Is that the reason?  Because it is an extraordinary thing to do that, what you and your board did.     Well, what were these – what was this special expertise or something that you and your board thought Mr Gama had which you thought that would add value to Transnet despite what we have been talking about in terms of what he had done and the type of CEO he seems to have been in terms of what he was found guilty of?   What is it that seemed so special that you did not think you could get if you advertised his position, if you did not take him back, you advertise his position and asked the public, people who qualify, to apply for his position?   You could not somebody more experienced?     But you could get somebody with even better skills, somebody who would make sure that they read documents before they signed them and did not put Transnet at great risk by sighing documents without reading them.     Now after you had reinstated Mr Gama, I understood you or the documents to suggest that the board instructed Mr Brian Molefe, who was CEO then, Group CEO, to discipline various members, management members and staff who may have done something similar to what – well, let me not something similar and say who had deviated from procurement processes, is that correct?     And there were many of these, is that correct?  [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     yes.     Yes but in terms of Exco there were some Exco members.     One of them was it Mr Maharaj or not really?     Mr Moses, Ms Moses?     Yes, yes.  That Mr Maharaj, is that the same one who had been asked by Mr Wells to make a decision whether to charge Mr Gama or not?     Yes.  Now their – the irregularities or deviations for which they were to be charged, did they occur prior to the board’s decision to reinstate Mr Gama, condone his transgression, bring him back or did they happens after the board had reinstated Mr Gama? MR     And so in regard to other staff members who were not in Exco, the same was going to apply, those who had transgressions that had happened a number of years before would also be judged.     Oh, did he not report back at some stage while your board was there, while you were there, because you only left at the end of 2014, so this was 2011, so he must have reported back to you.     I understand from what I have read that with regard to Mr Maharaj he resigned when this happened, is that correct?     And Ms Moses do you know what she did, I think she also resigned, or did she not?     Yes.  Now this is quite strange to me what you and your Board did, as I understand it insofar as you and your Board were concerned, or  may have been concerned that for a number of years there may have been a lot of transgressions in terms of deviations by Exco members and other senior managers, and that you wanted to – and no action had been taken.  I would have expected that if you were feeling sympathy for Mr Gama you would then effectively grant condonation, or maybe I shouldn’t use the word condonation, so to speak or give everybody who had done that or that period and say we don’t know, it looks like there has been confusion, we don’t know what has been going on, but from now on, from a certain date here is a directive, from now on nobody can tell us they don’t know what the position.  From now on if you deviate this will be the consequences and then you from then on anyone who commits these deviations can be dealt with, but it appears like with regard to Mr Gama you said there were deviations nothing had been done, so he must come back, and then you gave him an ineffective warning and then you said others who had done deviations also during the same period you said Mr Molefe charged them. That seems a – it is like this was a dispensation for Mr Gama only, the rest they must face the wrath of the Board.         You see when you and  your Board talk about how you reinstated Mr Gama you create the impression that you sought to uphold the principle of consistency in discipline, you say there were so many people how had done the same thing and had not been disciplined and Mr Gama was disciplined, it looks like he was singled out.  You then condone his transgressions but then instead of condoning the transgressions of others you say to Mr Brian Molefe go for them and one of those is Mr Maharaj who had brought charges against Mr Gama, that seems very, very, very, strange, and he resigns.  Where is the consistency, you just said Mr Gama must get an ineffective final warning, why don’t you say to the others, to Mr Brian Molefe okay give a final written warning to everybody who in the past did the same thing.  Why don’t you say that, in that way then you treat them like Mr Gama?     Yes but if he fired anybody in that process that would not have been inconsistent with what you asked him to do, he could give a warning, he could fire, because you didn’t say to him discipline them but don’t fire them because we haven’t – we have reversed Mr Gama’s dismissal.  You left it to him what sanction he would give.     But in regard to Mr Gama you have chosen that dismissal was not the right sanction.     And you would consider I would assume that the perception among the management and staff of what they were hearing, the perception they got arising from the decision of the Board must have been terrible because particularly for Mr Maharaj who was charging Mr Gama.   Mr Gama the Board is saying Mr Gama you must come back, get full back pay, get all your benefits, this sanction recommended by the independent chairperson of the inquiry is no good, you deserve a final written warning but that final written warning mustn’t even start – mustn’t be there when you return to work, it must have lapsed so he as all of this and then the next he hears that the same board has said to the Group CEO charge the others.   It must have felt like look we must go, obviously Mr Gama is very influential with this Board, Mr Gama is the one who was criticising us publically for putting in charges against him, although he has conceded now that he was guilty and we were justified in bringing charges but we must be charged now, so he resigns and Ms Moses resigns. You would understand that perception if it happened?     Okay now the Board, you and your Board should not have reinstated Mr Gama, isn’t it?   No you have had the benefit of looking at the whole thing properly, do you not come to that conclusion.     Yes.  Even if for some reason he was reinstated what would you say to the proposition that he should not have got, he should not have been given full back pay, he should be – if he was to be reinstated at all, he should not have been given full back pay as if  he was not guilty of anything, as if he was innocent, would you not say that?     Yes, would you also not concede that you and your Board should never have undertaken to pay any of his high court legal costs, because litigation was done and he had lost, he should not have brought that application against the ...[intervenes]      Yes, well would you also not concede that even with regard to his labour matter, the unfair dismissal matter, you should not have offered or undertaken to pay any of his costs because he himself accepted he was to blame also, he shared a certain amount of blame, he accepted that he was guilty of three acts of misconduct, would you not consider that?     Yes.   Now would you not concede also that at some stage you should have gone back to Mr Todd and said proceed with the steps to recover Transnet Legal costs from Mr Gama?     You should have gone back to him.     Yes, now of course what this means is a lot of taxpayers’ money went to Mr Gama and his attorneys, firstly in terms of the back pay for nine months, secondly in terms of the legal costs for the high court and the legal costs for the unfair dismissal matter, which at least now you are able to say should not have been offered.   Now would there be anything unfair I know that there are other members of the Board who might still come and testify and make representations but you are – you have given your evidence and you have dealt with issues and where you have dealt with it you have a certain realisation in regard to certain issues that you might not have heard before, wouldn’t you – would you say there would be anything unfair if at the end the Commission were to recommend to the President that steps should be taken to recover from members of the Board who supported the settlement this money that  where you and I agree should not have been offered to Mr Gama by the Board.     Yes, yes, because – and of course there is the question of I mean Mr Myburgh said that in terms of back pay for Mr Gama and legal costs I think he said we are looking at about R17million Mr Myburgh?     Ja, does that include Eversheds part of the legal costs?     So back pay and legal costs we talk about R17million but of course there is the R426 000 which was not included there which Mr Todd was trying to recover from Mr Gama so you know all of those amounts you know taxpayers say you know that money could be help in somewhere, it should not have gone to Mr Gama in the light of all of this evidence, but I think you have made your point that you understand the situation.  Is that right?     Okay anything arising Mr Myburgh?     Okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr Mkwanazi for making yourself ...[intervenes] yes?     You would like an opportunity to say something?     Okay alright, okay do that  yes.     Sorry Mr Mkhwanazi to the extent that what you may be wishing to say might fall under argument, we would make arrangements for arguments at the right stage, so if that is what you had in mind we can leave it for when you present argument.     Okay, alright fine.  Thank you very much to you and Mr Mkwanazi the witness and to you Mr Mkhwanazi the lawyer and for all the cooperation and thank you Mr Mkwanazi for availing yourself to come and testify before the Commission and provide explanations to the best of your ability on some of the decisions taken by your Board, we appreciate it and if a need arises, I think there probably will be another occasion when you need to come back on other aspects but thank you very much we appreciate the fact that you have made yourself available. Thank you very much.     We are going to adjourn, it is nearly twenty five past four, we will adjourn and then tomorrow we will continue with evidence relating to Transnet, who is our witness tomorrow Mr Myburgh?     Okay. That’s fine but if you reach agreement then it would be Mr Mhlanka.     Okay no that’s fine.  We will then adjourn now and tomorrow we start at ten as usual. We adjourn. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Good morning Chairman.    Thank you.    Good morning Advocate Myburgh.    Yes I do.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes I did admit that it was not thorough – it was poor yes.    Certain aspects of it were persuasive but if a better analysis could have been done it could have been a better advice for instance yes.  But that analysis was not very clear at the time.    Yes Chairman I think we did because even as a sub-committee and board when we got that initial advice we were not impressed.    Felt from the board as well?    Yes.    That is correct.    Ja – yes you are correct.    Chairman I am in agreement with your observation but again I need to sort of qualify it in that that advice although it was almost a generic advice was not thorough in dealing with the three matters separately that advice was required on. On the procurement matters that advice somehow I – I indicate that it could have been appropriate.  But on the questioning of the attack on executives and the board that advice said nothing about that.    And I think as I indicated it could have been oversight on the side of the board or not particularly following up on that issue of the attack on the executives and the board members.    Advocate you are correct.    Advocate Myburgh you are correct.    I agree with you Advocate Myburgh.    I agree with you Advocate Myburgh.    I agree with you Advocate ja.    Maybe not but as you rightfully point out if ideally at the time in retrospect the board should have even sent back the second advice to say, hold it you are still not specific enough.  Yes I agree with you.    That is correct Advocate; ja.    I am there Advocate.    Yes we – we did – we did Advocate yes.    No do not forget that memorandum of the 15 t h is earlier than this so call augmented advice.  Yes we – ja.    This was done on the 22 n d if I recall.    Yes.    I agree with your assessment.    I – I see what you are talking to.    No I do not recall – it was their memorandum of the 15 t h I am not sure now what it said.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    I might have – I do not recall a specific one other than this one of the 22 n d.  But on that one of the 15 t h February or 14 t h February if that goes on to create doubt about whether we will win at Transnet Bargaining Council.  But again having indicted earlier that – even that memorandum that of the 14 t h or 15 t h February was not specific to the three items.    That any unfairness could have been identified.  That was not specific.    Depends of [00   No at the time we did not do that Advocate; yes.    No it does not.    No – no we did not.    We omitted that.  No we did not at the time, yes.    Not really.    They still do not deal with it ja. ADV MYBURGH    We did not do that on the 15 t h February yes and even on the 22 n d we did not go back to them and say, but you have not dealt with the third matter in terms of the issues that you are supposed to deal with.    No I know we did not go back.    That is correct.    No I am aware yes Chairman.    Chairman.    Chairman at the time the focus was on the procurement issues.  The focus was not on the last matter of the attack by Mr Gama on the executives and the board.  The focus was on the procurement issues and I think if it was an oversight of the board not to have focussed even on the third and just thought that the procurement issues were sufficient to deal with this issue in a particular way.  Ja it was an oversight.    No Chairman your analysis could be correct but I assume that Mr Gigaba is also going to come and have his say and also Mr Gama is going to come and have his say on these issues.    I would sense that what you saying is true Mr Chairman.    Chairman your observation is spot on but then I just need to highlight one small matter that at the time when this matter was being dealt with the board’s focus was on procurement and the perceived unfairness of how Mr Gama was not afforded the other process of condonation.   In other words the – the focus was on the unfairness on the first two charges and that is why even maybe at board no board member then said, hold it but it is not only these issues there is this other major issue which was the third charge of him attacking the executives and the board?   Yes the board neglected that angle and in hindsight the board should have – somebody should have said, hold it but these are not only the two issues that we are dealing with yes these are procurement but here is this other one of attacking the executives and the board.    It was not raised by any board member at the time.    It is Chairman.    It is a serious oversight.    By that whole board and the – I admit that it was a serious oversight.    Chair – Chairman your observation is correct but as I indicate that board for some reason I hope other people would come in and actually give more information on how the environment, the atmosphere etcetera on this matter was because particularly on procurement issues.  There was a – a strange perception that maybe Mr Gama was targeted because there were certain similar – although they are not similar – in terms of procurement there might be but this other last charge frankly was something unique and maybe the first time that – and that board should have looked into at the time to say, yes there are three issues; two are procurement, one is this attack on the executives.  Unfortunately Chairman at the time that board did not focus on that matter because it focussed on procurement issues thinking that there was no consistency in the organisation in dealing with procurement.    I would not call it pressure.  Yes there was a request to review if the sanctions of dismissal were – were fair – that was by the shareholder.  Yes there was a request that we review the sanction of dismissal.  And – and have I lost sound?    No we can hear you.    Then having said that that is why then even I think even when we looked at alternative advice the shortcoming of the advice we got it did not deal specifically with the three issues as the advice from Mr Todd did deal with the three issues.   Now therefore the advice that we used from Deneys Reitz came with almost a general recommendation which I must say was not the best advice because they should have said you have got chances with one and two but you have got no chances with three.  Then that board I doubt if it would have come to the same decision.    Chairman yes they do not talk about – they are not specific.  That is why I say in hindsight it was not the best advice because they should have dealt with the three issues.  And also, they should have dealt with even this condonation matter as advisors because condonation, at the time, did not necessarily imply that then you are free from any potential disciplinary action post condonation.   Because my understanding of that condonation policy.  There must be consequences for the fact that you even go to the extent of requesting condonation.  Why did you not do your homework properly before?  Yes.       But yes, the advice from T Richard was not the best advice.     That is correct ...[intervenes]      Actually, I agree advocate.     That is correct, advocate.     Advocate, maybe let me try and...  We felt that as a board, the advice we had got on the 14t h or 15t h of February was weak and therefore we said augment it.   And funny enough, even after augmenting, they came back with what I can call weak advice because they did not deal with the specifics of the three issues and the possibilities of winning at the Transnet Bargaining Council or losing at Transnet Bargaining Council.   So yes, they did not touch on the third matter of an attack of executives.     [No audible reply]      Yes, that is correct.  I do not know whether it is failure or weakness of their submission.  I would call it more weakness because it did not deal with... my understanding, if you deal with, I want advice on this issue and these are the three issues.   Then the advice should have addressed the first issue, second issue and third issue.  And Deneys Reitz’ advise did not even articulate the three issues.     Chairman, at the time we... the doubt created of winning or not winning at Transnet Bargaining Council sort of played a prominent role in us making that decision then.     Chairman, as I might have indicated in the past here.  We did get good sound legal advice from a number of legal firms including Mr Todd’s note.  And at the time, we felt that hold it.  Let us pursue, because we have time to review the sanction.   Then we indicate that let us then get a different law firm with different legal advice because my sense, by the way, based on the legal advice that we have had before, I doubt if the companies that were involved in the actual disciplinary process in Transnet would have come with a different legal advice.   But yes, be as it may, we felt that let us test if is there a different legal advice out there.   Unfortunately, it came and it was not very strong legal advice because it did not touch on one of the key issues which is not procurement related.     Chairman ...[intervenes]      Please continue, Chair.     Yes, I can hear you Chairman.     Chairman, what you are indicating could be true but maybe let me retrace the process a little bit.  On the procurement issues, the two procurement issues.   The advice could have been different in that the so-called similar procurement, the irregularities in Transnet had not been considered when that sanction was determined on the first two matters.   So on those two matters, I do think there was a need to get sort of a review of... on the similar case matters relating to procurement.  What was done?   And these matters went back as early as 2005.  So on those, there could have been a different legal opinion on review.   But on the third matter, irrespective of whatever review you would have had, my sense is that that review would have come out and said on the third matter, the sanction is a fair sanction.       Chairman, I need to go back a little bit and indicate that there was a Public Protector later, around the 22n d of December twenty... I do not know the exact date, 10.  Ja.  Now ...[intervenes]      In 2010.     Yes, yes.  In 2010.     Now in a way, it is that Public Protector letter which elevated the letter to the chairman’s office.  And your analyses is correct but then once this matter was then elevated to the chairman’s office, the company then had to respond to the Public Protector and as part of that, certain allegations were made there.   And as part of that response, the initial process was to appoint KPMG and Nkonki to look into the facts now.  And then they did and for some reason, if I recall, their first draft report was sometime in January.   But that draft report as... in retrospect, they sort of file on Monday once it was brought in by some staff members.   No, on Friday, last week Friday from the Zondo Commission.  That first draft report did not contain the details I thought it did in terms of dealing with this issue.   But yes, what triggered the matter to go to board was the Public Protector’s complaint, if I can call it that.       And the, it became sort of a board member, a board matter, ja.     Chair, at the time as a board we did not take that approach, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.       That is correct, Chair.  But let me qualify that.  You know, these things, when you look at them ten years or nine year later, there were other reports that were produced in Transnet which were indicating...  I am focussing on the procurement matters, that there could have been unfairness on the procurement issues.  That is correct Chair, yes.   And still today, I do not have those reports and hopefully, one day they will surface.     That is correct, Chair.       You could be correct in indicating that but yes, I could... wrong legal advice at the ...[indistinct], yes.     To say decide is too strong a word but we were in discussions based on the information we had, even as early as the 1s t of February, if I recall.  I am not sure what sub-committee that was, et cetera.  We were in discussions on some form of review of the Gama sanction issues, yes.     It was a consultation process at the time and with no final decision because only around the 14t h, 15t h of February, would then a final decision be taken by a sub-committee of the board and also elevated to the board.   ADV MYBURGH     Yes.     Bundle 1...       One, seven, zero.  Ja, that is the one.  Okay.  Thank you..     Yes, I have got that.     Yes.     I would not call that a decision.  I would all that part of a review process which had been requested by the shareholder much earlier on.   And also, if I do recall, there was some other information that I had seen in January, much earlier in January on irregular procurement in Transnet.  A number of cases.   It was a matrix of some Excel spreadsheet which indicated offences by certain executives, et cetera and condonations granted, et cetera, et cetera.  And the amounts involved but that information is not available.   So at... like knowing what the system information was at the time, I was aware that there was something not on about the fairness of the sanctions on Gama on the two procurement issues.  That I was aware of.   And then of course, in discussing with the board even before the 1 s t of February, the board was then made aware that I was in consultation with Mr Gama on some of the issues that would have come out of his disciplinary process.  But having said I was in consultation.   Even at that time, the consultation was more of the procurement issues and, therefore, that is why some legal eyes were needed into looking into these issues.   And what is interesting even if it is legalised, it did not focus on the third issue or the third offence of criticising executives.  Yes.     Yes.     It intended to review, not reinstate.     It is a strong word.  To review.     It should be.  It is a review because yes that review that had been requested by the shareholder in October 2010.  Yes.     Not reinstate.     I am not sure.  But he is coming, I am assuming, as well to have his say on the Zondo Commission.     Yes.     Page 178.     Yes.     If I got it wrong?  Yes, he got it wrong.     Yes, that is correct.  I am not sure around which time exactly but yes I would have been talking to him.     No, the review that had been requested by the minister, not the reinstatement.     Yes.  Yes, I think I did.  Yes.       Yes.     That is correct.     Phew!  Let me take out that piece of paper, for which Chief Executive.  Yes, please continue?     Yes.     I do not recall – wait, wait, wait.  I do not recall in the opening statement that he makes there but, if I do recall, at the time we might have already advertised for the filling of the vacancy of Group Chief Executive, yes.     I would have.     I am not sure what he says that advertising was a mistake.  It was not a mistake.     Yes, I was in discussions with him regularly, yes.     To review     Yes, that is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair, from the perspective that yes, the minister had requested a review, yes.     I am not sure if he would but if also I recall at the time the focus of the discussions were not necessarily – they were related at times generally to state owned entities, yes.     Under Public Enterprises.     Related to Transnet specific but occasionally other SOEs, yes.     That is correct.     When you say in personal capacity, in a way because he is special adviser to the minister my understanding was that then he would brief the minister because I never interacted with the minister a lot.     That is correct, Chair.     I do not recall sitting with the minister briefing him in detail on progress on the matter.  The only person who would have been briefed is Mr Mahlangu.     That is correct.     Yes.     Can you – wait, I am not sure that the page is correct, ja.  What pack is it?     I do not think so, I do not recall that big submission of Mr Todd serving on the board or even serving in one of the subcommittees, ja.     I do not recall, no, because ideally if it had it would have been part of a bundle in terms of the board pack and I do not recall how the board pack looked like at that time.     My understanding, I had received it.  If I recall, it was done on the 2 February and given to one of the group legal people.  Yes, I would have received it and yes, I would have read it.     If I recall, there was a subcommittee before that board and again these minutes – ideally it would have served there and also when I say served there, coming say from group legal because we worked very closely with group legal at the time.  It would have served in a subcommittee, yes, but not necessarily a board, no. Now, that subcommittee, I do not know if I have got a minute of it, but if I do recall, there was a subcommittee before the board meeting of the 16 t h, there was a subcommittee.     I have not seen that affidavit, can you take me to it?     Page 15, bundle 1.     I am going to do it.  Page 15.  Okay, dated 16 t h, a document dated that, okay.       On paragraph 12, yes?     Page 42.     To…?     To 68.  Okay.  I see it.     No, no...     Yes.     When you say it was not before the board I see it was before the board based on this document, yes.     But I did not recall it anymore but I had seen it before, by the way before the 16 t h.     Ja.     Yes.     On the 16 t h, yes.     No, no, I do believe that it did serve on the board of the 16 February.     Yes.  Gcaba?     Yes, I did get them, yes.     Yes, on the 16 t h, yes, Chair.     That is correct.     That is correct.  That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, I do recall.     Yes, that is correct.     It could have been a list of procurement processes and also condonations granted, that is correct.     Now when you say you had this list, at the time, frankly, there was a spreadsheet which had been developed which indicated some of these irregularities and some of the condonations granted and in some areas not even granted, for that matter, but with notes that disciplinary action would be taken, etcetera, etcetera, yes. Now subsequent to - that list would have been circulating sometime in January.  Now having – I am also trying to find that list.  I have not seen it since.     Bundle 1.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.       Yes, I did.     Yes.     That is correct.     785.       784.  Yes.     Yes.     That is correct, ja.     It would have been a couple of transactions, whatever they were and of course it would have covered a number of years, if I can use the word, maybe from 2005 to 2010.  It would have covered the actual procurement, whatever that was, and the fact that it either exceeded the mandate or it was irregular.  There would have been columns with some analysis and it would have indicated whether condonation was granted or not granted.  Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     That is correct, yes.     No, I would not know the detail, no, no, no.     In fairness, they are comparable from a procurement principle that certain things were not done according to the procurement procedure manual of the time.  That is the only comparison, not the quantum and not a lot of other issues but the fact that they did not comply with the PPM at the time.     That is correct but the third one was not even something that I would have submitted to the board in terms of comparability, there was no similar case.     That is correct.     I should have said that, ja.     That is correct.     Chairman, some of them did, that is correct, yes.     Chairman, some had not and for some reason although they were in the minority, those that maybe might not have applied but nothing was done, etcetera, etcetera, yes.     My understanding, Chairman, is that you could ask for condonation but when you say ask for it, you talk to your immediate supervisor about the issue and in most cases it involves Transnet internal audit and you then talk to your boss about whatever you have done wrong and then your boss can then decide whether through the necessary counsel that had approved that transaction that the matter can go for condonation or you must discipline or whatever but it is through the approving authority, who would have been your supervisor.     No, no, no, Chairman.     Chairman, I agree with you, yes.     Chairman sort of but the question of seriousness is not an easy one to get into because how do you define the seriousness, is it a one billion, two billion, what’s the quantum because some of these issues that eventually had to be condoned ran into billions of rands.     Chairman there would have been, I am now trying to assume what I haven’t read the PM, the Policy Procedure of Manual of Transnet in a long time, but yes there would have been there because I am not sure where fraud comes in here because some of these things could have been fraudulent, and also I am not sure where fruitless and wasteful expenditure comes in on these, for some of them would have been fruitless and wasteful, they were of different categories.     You are correct Chairman.     That is my understanding at the time yes.     My understanding yes it would have contained some people.     Maybe I need to state the scenario a little bit because the question of condonation is a strange matter, let me make an example of one particular contract where I got directly involved.   It was the VAE contract, I don’t know what the company name was, but the increase in amount, the issue was people who kept on paying a supplier on what was then an irregular contract, and that made the contract value increase from 98million to about 1.8billiona and where now the question of the number of people, in fairness just that one contract alone, about plus minus eight other people were involved in making these adjustments where ideally some of these people should have called the process to a halt and say hold it we are busy making payments against an irregular contract. I am trying to indicate that when I say the number is 30 that contract alone would have had about eight and another contract would have had a certain amount of people, that is how people got attached to an irregular contract.     Frankly that homework will have to be done, because these numbers that you are mentioning, I don’t have an exact number, frankly at some stage while I was there we thought the number was even over 100 but through going back into the history of the various procurement irregularities the numbers in January 2011 would have been about 30 and some of those numbers interestingly enough are also calculated in the KPMG final report of November 2011.     Not at the time yes.     Yes, yes.     Hold it, don’t forget Mr Gama’s matter is threefold, two are procurement and one is non-procurement.     That is correct.     What page is that?     Okay, page 34, my assistant has just gone to – okay I am on page 34.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, yes, yes, I agree, they were not like for like.     Yes.     That is correct.     It means that the – in the system there were too many condonations and authorities floating around requesting condonation, so what the company as trying to indicate is that it should cease and only one person would have the authority to condone and at the time the idea was that it would have been Brian Molefe, or the Group CEO who would deal with those condonations.  And yes subsequently if I recall I had to deal with one condonation, the VAE Condonation if I can mention it ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     Chairman I am indicating that the Board was of the view that under normal circumstances a final written warning would have been given.  It is not 100% correct statement because the authority, or authorising individual would have taken a view based on its case whether a written warning is taken or whether a disciplinary – that sentence is incomplete, but ja, that’s correct.     It could have been denied as well, yes. ADV MYBURGH     ...[Indistinct] but it could have been denied.     Denied yes.    That is correct Chairperson.     Chairman it depends on each individual case, because at times how these condonations were coming, they were coming through what you call divisional internal audit committee meetings, where you then review offences, procurement offences if I were to call them that, and then based on that divisional internal audit an opinion is then formed that these offences can apply for condonation and these offences need to be elevated to the authority and some of them maybe they need disciplinary action, because offences are completely different, there’s your theft for instance.   I don’t think any condonation would have been given for theft, and those who assault and a few other things, there’s no condonation would have been given ja.     Ja.     No that is correct Chair although it had seen the Antrobes’...[intervenes]       The request was a review, and upon that review the procurement issues there was some elements of unfairness on those two issues but the third matter of him ...[indistinct] Mr Chris Wells and the Board it was oversight on the part of the Board not to tackle that specific issue, because I do not think that that Board would have taken a different decision to what Mr – Advocate Antrobes and may Mr Todd had also recommended ja.     No, no it does not refer to it yes.     Chairman in hindsight that should have been done yes.     I agree with you Chairman.     I wouldn’t call it legal advice that said it was too harsh, all I was indicating, I might have said it, was that if this thing is taken on the Transnet Bargaining Council process there were chances that the Bargaining Council could come with a different option of how the matter could have been handled.     That is correct.     I am aware yes.    That is correct chair.      In hindsight Advocate yes.     Yes.      Chairman yes there was that doubt and on the procurement issues but in  hindsight I don’t have any doubt that on the third matter of attacking his executive sir had the Board applied its mind to that third matter, I doubt if this – that Mr Gama would have been reinstated, no there I would have supported the dismissal as well.     Other matters?     Chairman I have indicated that yes there was this review by this – which came in the form of this weak legal opinion, which then created doubt but unfortunately it was not part of it, because it was a general statement on doubt without looking at the three issues separately, because as I indicate just on the 3 r d matter alone, which not procurement related a different decision would have been reached by that Board, if there was more emphasis on that matter which is not procurement related.     Yes I do accept that. ADV MYBURGH     No it doesn’t ja.     Advocate yes at the time that is the view we took as a Board and even that advice as I have indicated was not thorough particularly along the issue of the third offence and that is why had it been highlighted this third offence, I doubt if the Board would have reached that decision, but on the other two matters there could have been some doubt, definitely yes.     That is correct Advocate, Chair.     Chairman as you rightfully pointed out advocate the issues of litigation can go either way and at the time if I recall the Board could have been worried about this thing taking abnormally too long and therefore the Board could have felt that it needs to be resolved but it is then wrong legal advice which is the basis of saying yes maybe on the first two issues there could have been some doubt, but on the third issue no, the Board didn’t have good advice and also – ja.  If basically the Board would have sustained the decision of the disciplinary committee.     Chairman I would tend to agree with you because it is indefensible because the Board did not have the facts of the last matter in terms of that particular offence, it never surfaced on documentation that this third offence was almost a dismissible offence, under any circumstances Chairman I agree with that.     Three?     I’ve got it in front of me.     I agree with that ja.     I agree with you Chairman.     Ja, I agree advocate.     Okay.     I agree with you.     I agree with that.     Yes.     I agree yes.     They are distinct yes.     168.     Yes I do agree.     I see it ja.     I agree Chairperson.     I can see that heading.    I see that Chair.     I would not have had that.     I would not have it.    Indeed Chairman.    The page.    They want to see your face better.    I – I understand fully the argument of Mr Todd.  Having said that though and as he rightfully points out in terms of that board decision.  I am also now not sure if this matter is actually meaning in retrospect a condonable matter.  I am not sure.    I am not sure.    It does not.    I agree Chairman.    That is correct.    Yes.   Yes.    I know [00   Yes.    Yes.     I accept that.    No I agree with that ja.    The – the committee yes applied its mind and looked at the two issues as I indicated.  And the – there was nothing wrong with the finding of that particular committee meaning the Antrobus processes.  There was nothing wrong with them yes.    Chairman based on Mr Todd’s submission which is what we have got now there could have been a different interpretation of whether the condonation could have or could not have been granted.  But Mr Todd’s analysis indicates that no condonation would have been granted under these circumstances.    Based on his submission I accept that but the thing was not tested.  When I say not tested at the time I am not sure if did Mr Gama discuss some form of condonation.  I am not Mr Gama’s representative.   Because based on – on a different type of – the first one by the way on the Fifty Like New was a strange one. He basically did not follow a board process.   But then the question then becomes did he do a confinement in terms of discussions with the authority that had approved this?  That is on the first one.   The same on the second one did he do a confinement on the GNS I do not know but based on what he then said as well that this thing was wrong etcetera, etcetera. But he did not test condonation on the two issues.  The last one of misconduct I – I – the dismissal was a fair assumption.    Yes.    I agree with you.    Yes.    No you cannot condone that either.    Ja.    No, no please continue.  No, no continue.    No correct.    It is – now in hindsight the – if I was the authority to look at condonement and things I would – I would not have condoned that TNS thing as well.  Also based on his own admission when this matter was brought into the disciplinary inquiry..    Ja that is correct Chairman yes.  Advocate.    Yes.    Not really because still at the time when even I looked at my own submissions to this process I did indicate that there was serious oversight on the type of the advice and the recommendation to the board that the last matter which I viewed almost as a serious misconduct of attacking his colleagues is not a procurement matter and is not condonable – that matter.    That matter definitely he should have been dismissed.  Now at the time of writing my first affidavit I interpreted the first two matters as procurement matters.  But now as we go through that process – this process I can see that he conceded – him; himself as well that there were not necessarily hard-core procurement issues.  Which is why the Fifty Like New the board had to cancel that contract with the suppliers.  And also he himself as well admitted that on this TNS contract according to what you are indicating that there was something fishy about the contract.   But myself at the time of doing my affidavit I just viewed these two items as procurement – the first two items as procurement, irregularities or as – as issues relating to procurement and no necessarily even issues relating to misconduct as is indicated by the Fifty Like New in not following a board instruction.   And also even the second one of him signing that GNS contract where from what I pick up – I am not sure if it was a confinement or what but there is no clear submission that this should have been condonable as a confinement, I do not know ja.    Yes.    They did.    The board yes.    Yes I do.    Ja I concede that yes.      It is not a question of…    Chairman I – I did read Mr Todd’s submission of the 2 February 2010 if I do recall.    But the – I did read Mr Todd’s submission but at the time the – that is why even my analysis of what I called similar procurement issues they are not identical to this.    The other similar procurement issues could be minor but again somebody must look into them compared to what is sitting in front of us.    Chair I would have read these but the one I do recall …    A little bit more is the Mr Todd one of – which was submitted to the board of the 2 nd February or around that time I do recall that one.    Not to – I do recall Chairman.    Chairman not as comprehensively as Mr Todd’s submission of the 2n d February.    Yes they were considered.    Chairman I did need almost what you can call a – a separate and different view of these issues particularly in view of the Public Protector matter etcetera, etcetera which would have come much later compared to all these other processes that had been going on.  So in trying to – to – to look at the Gama matter there were some un – un – and I view them almost as not identical.  There were some areas where Mr Gama or whoever would have thought that the processes that dealt with him were unfair but looking at the issues themselves the – they were not that unfair.  But they were some procurement processes which were not handled the same way as Mr Gama’s matter was handled.    I would not call it override except that we do – we did look for another opinion particularly in view of the Transnet Bargaining Council process and this other opinion looked at this issue and created some doubt that we could or could not sustain our case at the Transnet Bargaining Council.    In hindsight Chairman I would agree that that doubt should have been examined further to look at the actual risks and which might have come back and said that risk is – there is actually no risk.    Ja I agree with your input Chairman.    No.  Yes.    I agree Advocate ja.    Advocate I did indicate that the Deneys Reitz advice was frankly very weak.  Because it did not focus on the specifics like Mr Todd did the Deneys Reitz was a weak legal advice as I indicated even though there were these three issues the last issue of misconduct by Mr Gama in terms of attacking his executives is almost non-confirmable if I can use the word.   But because of the interpretation at the time of thinking that these other two issues are actually procurement issues and therefore when the statements were made on unfairness either to the Public Protector or to whoever and things were looked at we thought that there could be a slight risk in those first two.  But now in hindsight looking at the submission by Mr Todd again those were not necessarily procurement irregularities they – they were almost misconduct of – of not following board resolutions that is the first one; the Fifty Like New.   And the second one as well the GNS was a different type of misconduct looking at it now where the individual concerned did not apply his mind thoroughly before signing whatever documents that he might have signed.  Yes.    Yes I might have said that yes I agree.    Let us settle yes.  Paying the quantum you have mentioned at the time I am not fully aware of the exact quantum but it would have come to that based on the detail then that had to be entered into to quantify whatever settlement amount was involved.    Page 86 okay.  I have got page 86.  Yes.    Yes.    No I do accept.     Ja.     Yes.     164...     Okay I am there.     H’m?     Yes.     That is correct.  Yes.     [Indistinct]      That is correct, advocate.     Yes, I do.     The instruction was a review and somehow at the time, also based on some information which I had, this 30 or whatever list of people which I had seen in January of 11.  And although, as I have indicated, they are not like-for-like to even the first two matters, it did create some doubt on fairness ...[intervenes]      ...of the ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Not that... it was not an instruction to reinstate.  It was an instruction to review.  Yes, we did look into that but based on this latest information that one keeps getting.   Even that review would have been fault or false review in that some of the matters that Mr Gama was charged for, he was dismissed and even that board, had it had that information, would have confirmed the dismissal.     At the time, I did not say that to the minister, yes.     At the time, based on whatever review that could have been done, that review would have highlighted that the Transnet Bargaining Council could have dealt with this issue in a particular way and even confirmed some of the sanctions that were applied by... into that process.     Chairman, that could have been the approach.  I do agree with you.  But for some reason and in view of an element of certain allegations in the Public Protector’s letter, then that review made sense.   But even though that the view made sense, the legal advice we got was extremely weak.  And also, the so-called procurement irregularities that were sort of alleged to have happened.  In Mr Gama’s case.   The two key matters, the ...[indistinct].  It is not a procurement matter anymore rather than be a... not following board instruction but that is different to procurement.   And even the Genis(?) matter, from what I pick up here, he himself did agree that it is... that procurement process was faulty, et cetera, et cetera.   Now at that time, as looking at that review, we... even the advice we got, did not fundamentally go to the source of where this alleged procurement is coming from.   Because if you go to the source of where this alleged procurement is coming from, the complexion of the matter differs completely.   Because yes, that should ...[indistinct] issues and then there is an issue of fair, what I will call misconduct, ja.     I agree with you, Chairman.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Advocate ...[intervenes]      The advocate’s question is correct because when you do... when you ask somebody to do a review, be it that legal firm, whatever the case.   They must go back to the actual outcomes and then do a proper review.  I do not think they did.  They just came with a very weak document indicating doubt on the process going forward, ja.     It is not a thorough review.  I concede to that as we are talking to now.     It was not the instruction to reinstate.  It was an instruction to review the dismissal sanction on the man.     Chairman, my understanding.  That outcome would have addressed a few concerns that he might have had.  That review would have looked at whether the Gama was fair and they were all aware that a process was very fair.  And also then, that review would have looked into what similar offences were committed ...[intervenes]      Yes?     Okay.     Now, my interpretation of whatever outcome.  It could have indicated that yes there was unfairness in how the Gama matter was handled.  But that outcome did not even go to the detail of some of the so-called perceived unfairness around how the Gama matter was dealt with.     Page 81...  Yes, I am there.     Yes.     I see that.     It is compelling, yes.     You cannot, yes.     Yes.     It is compelling, yes.     [No audible reply]      I do accept that.     Page 88.     Yes.     Yes.     I agree, Chairman.     Chairman, I agree with you or your comments.  Yes.     Chairman, in hindsight as you articulate these, it is inexplicable particularly, as I have indicated earlier on, the last charge ...[intervenes]      ...of fighting the CEO and your board.     It is totally unacceptable.     File 1...  I am not sure....  Okay, let me put ...[intervenes]      What page?     Page 36...     Yes.     Yes.     Page 41.  Let me go back there.  Just... Yes, on the 23 rd of February.  That is correct.     On the 22n d of February.     Okay, the 22 nd... I think it is the 22 nd here.  I cannot see.  Ja, the 22 nd of February.     It appears that, yes.     In hindsight, Mr Myburgh, Advocate Myburgh.  Just based on that last item we have been discussion of misconduct to his colleagues, the CEO and the board.   There would have been no such settlement agreement because I would have supported the view of a dismissal.   But on what I can then define as a preconceived interpretation of procurement irregularities on those two other matters which now in hindsight, some of them are not even procurement irregularities.   If you look at the Fifty-like-New, he basically did not follow a board instruction.  Then on the Genis contract, there is an element of a procurement irregularity because he confined something that he had not applied his mind too.  Yes.   But based on that last matter of taking his colleagues, this thing would have not been even negotiated and I would not have accepted such an agreement. ADV MYBURGH     Oh, yes, yes.       Please continue.     A complete capitulation is a strong word but yes I would accept it.     Ja.  Maybe ...[intervenes]      No.  Ja.  Maybe advocate, as you take me through some elements of this settlement agreement, I can explain the thinking at the time.       Complete is a strong word but I accept that it looks like it was more in favour of Mr Gama than in favour of Transnet.     I do not know.       That would be speculation in 2020.  Where are we now?  2020.  This was 2011, yes.     Now, when you say a worse deal.  You would have to think about the circumstances at the time in terms of whether there could have been a worse still?   The answer is maybe is yes.  I do not know.  But that questioning might be asked and I might have to respond, inviting ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I do not know, Chairman     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chairman.     Chairman, yes, although myself too I am not sure now what the bargaining council could have done or whether would the bargaining ruling would have covered coverage of costs, etcetera.  As I sit here, I do not recall the exact documentation after he had submitted, ja.     I agree with you, Chair.     Yes, I do know, Chairman.     Chairman, my understanding at the time, as we were discussing this settlement, the other route could have been coming out of that Transnet bargaining process could have led to further litigation and I am not sure in terms of the legal route but it would have taken – it could have taken quite a long time in terms of settling the matter and yet the business at the time was not doing that well, too many Acting CEOs, etcetera, it had its own internal problems which needed to be tied down.     Not really.  I would have to go back to the history of the documents that were circulating and see what he had asked for.  I do not recall, Chairperson.     Chairman, yes, it might on the face of it looks like a generous settlement but there are some elements of it which are not that generous.     Yes.     It is, Chairman, ja.     The word generous ignores the fact that when we looked at his legal fees from the two separate processes, that he must be refunded 75%, he still was liable for the 25%.  That is maybe on the legal fees.  Now on the other matters that dealt with that settlement, the assumption would have been that if you look at the Transnet remuneration policy or whatever at the time, I am not sure then what other benefits as this final written warning would have meant in terms of him recouping some of the lost income that he lost due to suspension, yes.     Chairman, I do not think it is an easy word to say, capitulation.  My understanding, he might have been asking for more.  I do not have the audit trail of some of whatever he might have been asking for, I do not have it in black and white.     Ja.     Yes.     That is correct.     There was only meeting, if any, but I would like him as well at some stage because this thing of these closed door assumptions, it is a long time ago.  I do not even recall really if we had that one-on-one even though I accept that it might have happened.  But ja, let us assume that it did happen but I hope at some stage he as well will make his own affidavit, ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     I do recall and his argument then, that is why - this thing happened nine and half years ago, his argument then was he did not trust the confidentiality of our discussions if there were too many people in that room.    Chairman, I do not recall saying I wanted a one-on-one but I do recall Gama requesting a one-on-one.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I understand, Chairman.     That is correct.     Page 80.     That is correct, Chairman.     That is correct, Chairman.     That is correct, Chairman.     Chairman, the question of sound corporate governance, what one was trying to do here was to restore to the individual what he might have had had this process of - that led to his dismissal would have been found wanting or unfair but then again, based on my submission that this individual would not have been reinstated if charge 4 of attacking his colleagues had surfaced strongly in the legal advice that one had got then.  So all this found not have been paid and all this type of settlement would never have happened.     Chair, I am being assisted here.  Page 164.  Okay, I need to take it out, the writing is quite small.  Chairman, I have got this document page 164.     It looks like a schedule in blue, yes, it is.     The last three lines, yes.     Yes.     I see it as the document indicates here.     Ja, I see it, Chairman.     Yes, I am, Chairman.     I am because my interpretation of his so-called legal costs and that me that do not understand – ja, I am stunned, yes.     Not true, Chairman.  At the time this detail was not in front of me, yes, true.     Yes.     I did not have a full picture of it and funny enough, looking at this schedule from Advocate Myburgh, I see he was paid something on the 16 April 15.  I do not know what that payment was for because whatever payment that should have been done, they should have been done in 2011 and no payments should have been done in 2015.  I truly do not know what these payments are for.     At the time, Chairman, yes, I did not know because I did not have the information in front of me.     Okay, Advocate Myburgh, I am there.     I would like to comment.  For whatever reason, I was under the impression that the so-called Gama’s costs were far lower than this and also some of those that were paid in 2015, it is like I do not how many.  I do not know what they are but even those that would have been paid earlier on, my assumption was that the people processing, which would have been in Group Finance and Group Legal, would have looked at the validity of each invoice before paying, yes.     38 of bundle 1.  I think it is this one.  Page 38, I am there, Chairman.     Correct, Chairman.     That is correct, Chairman.     Chairman, that was the proposals at the time and in retrospect it should have been different, ja.  Should have been different, I agree.     Yes.     Yes, Chairman …[intervenes]     Chairman, I could have said that but at the time that is the view that I took and – ja.     Chairman, at the time this was discussed in one of the other committees, we did discuss other types of final written warning but eventually we agreed on doing it this way.     Chairman, it was debated in one of the subcommittees and I will now put some other thinking of what maybe could have swayed that subcommittee to look at it this way.  Maybe it was to try and get Mr Gama back and almost operative from day one so that he does not sit in such a key position with a final written warning on his back.     No, Chairman, I understand your anxiety.     Chairman, I agree with you fully.     Chairman, I concede.  Even as I read it, it does not look right, Chairman.     That is correct yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes.     Ja, you may put it that way.     Chairman, at the time, that’s sort of the legal advice we got on how to phrase that thing.     Ja, I might not have.     Deliberation in that sub-committee which then made a recommendation to the Board ja.     Well, understand, I was the lead negotiator that is correct.     Just remember at the time that’s the advice I would have got from my internal legal people yes.     That is also true, I don’t deny that yes.     Yes.     No – yes.     Yes.     Sorry what bundle was it again?     Yes, I see that.     Six now, but we’re at paragraph 3.5 yes.     3.5, yes.     Yes, I am familiar.     Yes, I’m aware.     Yes, there was.     Yes, there was.     Yes, I am aware.     Yes.     Agree with that.     Chairman, as I’d indicated at the time that there was this potential litigation which we never knew when it goes to Transnet Bargaining Council which way it would go, yes, which is why then, that decision was taken.     Yes.     Chairman, as I indicated there was this view that this matter were to go – because I don’t recall the submission of Gama’s team on these issues, whether they were claiming that Transnet – I really don’t recall, should pay all costs of the Transnet High Court and also the disciplinary proceedings in the matter I would have to get the document in front of me to understand what that firm of attorneys – it could have been Langa or whoever, might have put on the table…[intervenes].     Chairman as I indicate there were other documents or submissions from Gama’s attorney which, in a nutshell were also trying to recover those costs and it is on that basis that then this type of settlement agreement could have arisen ja, I don’t recall the full submission.     Ja.     Yes.     I do recall.     Chairman, that is correct because at the time, in the – the interpretation that we were getting was that, now that this matter was going the Transnet Bargaining Council route, although that High Court decision to a certain extent, maybe is not related to this, but yes, at the time the view was, even that cost needed to be part of that settlement discussion.     Chairman I did not necessarily ask the question, why?     Chairman, that question at the time, was not dealt with the way you are putting it yes.     Chairman, I agree with you because there are two separate issues as you rightfully point out. The one is that application of Mr Gama where he accuses the company of unfair – of trying to block him from applying a position, that’s a separate matter and then the other matter then deals with the actual disciplinary process itself.  Now on that first matter, yes, at the time, the question was not posed as to why then link the two because the two, frankly are not linked.     No, that is correct Chairman.     Chairman, yes at the time that is how this matter was looked because there was this other matter of the value that, that individual would take if brought back to the company yes.     No, no the value add of being CEO etcetera, etcetera that was perceived to – would have happened when that individual comes back to the company.     Chairman, I’m talking about that, yes.    Not exactly, I’m not sure Chairman but – I’m not sure if he would have defied my Board, and yes Chairman, I’m not sure, maybe he did but I’m not sure Chairman.      Chairman, I was not sure.     Chairman, in retrospect, yes the matter that he – the two matters that he you know quote, do indicate that this individual was not the best individual to be, sort of, brought back into the company but at the time we had other operational problems etcetera and we were of the view that this individual would still add value into that company and yes, Chairman, you’re spot on there was this new risk that this individual would defy this Board as well.     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi are you able to tell us why, not only, did you let him off on what would have amounted to about a million rand that he owed you but then you agreed to pay 75% of his costs.  You landed up paying him about a million rand, he should have owed you a million, you let him off that and then on top of that you paid him a million.  Now, apart from the fact that, that’s what he wanted, why did you do that?     Advocate Myburgh, you know, when you mention these payments, somehow they don’t make sense to me as well because I’m not sure how Group Treasury and Group Legal interpreted these payments, I’m a little bit perplexed myself on all these additional payments which, somehow I don’t understand.     I’ve tried to explain to the Chairman that there were certain payments that would have been made in terms of this settlement agreement but from what you are saying there were other payments that I’m not privy to which were made under the assumption that they are part of this settlement agreement and I may disagree with those payments.     Yes.     Chairman, there was that weak legal opinion which created doubt and yes, based on that weak legal opinion we felt that there was this litigation risk if we continued with this matter at Transnet Bargaining Council.     No, it did not, one fully agrees that legal opinion – I fully agree Chairperson…[intervenes].     Chairman that legal opinion did not quantify the costs and the 75% it just created doubt that if further litigation was to happen in the Transnet Bargaining Council, the costs could be higher or lower, that is correct Chairman.    Chairman I’m not sure at the time if I knew the exact costs but the assumption is that, yes there would have been costs and based on that then 75% of those costs, if he had incurred them, would be refunded by the company yes.     That is correct Chairman.     Advocate Myburgh, yes, your questioning is correct, that is why then I – I do not recall the full submission that was dealing with the referral of the matter to the Transnet Bargaining Council.  I would have to go back I think there was a document submitted in October 2010 I would have to go back to that.  Your analysis is spot on.  I do not recall that submission spoke to the high court matter at all.  I do not recall.    Hold it Advocate maybe you will recall that he had this matter where he – he took the matter to the high court.    That is a separate matter.    Then the other matter is the disciplinary process to himself – itself.  I am addressing the disciplinary process costs itself and the fact that then when this matter is taken to the Transnet Bargaining Council there could be that probability that he could win; he could lose and therefore his costs to that Transnet Bargaining Council process and the disciplinary process were to be lumped into one and dealt with as something that the company would pay so in fact I sent off.  But the other costs relating to the high court matter I am indicting that I do not recall what his submission in October 2010 was indicating.  I would have to go back to that submission.    Chairman at the time I do not think I was aware of that but an impression was created that when now this matter goes through litigation costs could be far higher than what they might have been had we gone this route.    Chairman I do not think I did ask Deneys Reitz but Chairman I am aware that Mr Todd or the other law firm maybe he would have touched on that in the submission of the 2n d February to the board.    Chairman I do recall Mr Todd’s submission basically it was indicating a hundred percent confidence level of winning this matter.    Should it go the Transnet Bargaining Council.    No I did not know at the time but yes I do know now.    Yes.    For Bundle 2    Page 8 Bundle 2.  Bundle 2?    Okay let me put it this side.  Yes I am now on Bundle 2 page?    I am on page 8 yes.    Bundle 2 page 8.    Clause 3.5 yes I can see that.    I see that Chairman.    Which one if the final clause Chairman – 3.6?    Interesting.  I – I see – I see that Chairman.    I see that distinction.    Chair can you repeat I am now looking at the two documents.  One is paragraph 3.5 of Bundle 2 page 8.  And the other one is Bundle 1 page 38.  Can I take you through…    Please can you repeat?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    No that is what this last agreement indicates.  Yes.    That is – that is what this agreement says.  I agree yes.    Bundle 3.    Page 31.  I am there.    Yes.    Yes.    I have got that.    Yes.    No it does not.    It does not make sense.  I am not sure at times that people who employ how they interpret these issues but this does not make sense.    There is something wrong with that.    Chairman…    I am also seriously confused.  I would need to sit with an accountant to explain why some of these payments are interpreted the way they are done – or with a legal person.  They do not sound right    I agree Chair.  There is something wrong with these numbers Chairman.    There was a minority.    There was a minority Chairperson.    Do not forget the interpretation is as    Yes.    No, no. no I did not.  It was of the costs that Transnet had incurred.  Well I think Mr Mapoma misinterpreted what I was saying.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja he was correct.    104 of Bundle 1.      Yes.    Yes.    Oh no it is so wrong.    Yes I am not sure between so many people who – why they could not understand the interpretation.    No.    Yes.    Yes I see that.    I mean this is strange.  Because even Mr Mapoma and Mr Singh should have gone back to – to that settlement agreement and interpreted it properly.  Now they then elevate this matter in a completely inaccurate manner.    Chairman I cannot explain this wrong interpretation by Anoj Singh and by Mr Mapoma.    93?    Yes.    Chairman he was correct to be concerned and to elevate it but then what I find strange is that even Anoj at the time did not bother to go back to the settlement agreement.  That is not a proper interpretation even if though maybe Mr Mapoma could have said I said.  I could not instruct Mr Mapoma to do something that – to me it is illogical what he then interpreted is what the agreement said.    No.    No Chairman.    I am not sure how these people – Chairman I am not sure how these people were interpreting that clause 3.5.  I wish somebody had come back to me – ja – but that was now operational.    Yes.    I deny that instruction to Mr Mapoma.  I would have said go back to the agreement and implement what is in the agreement.    Because what implemented is over and above what was in that agreement.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do.    There is something wrong here I need a help.    With the video.    I can hear you clearly Chairman.    It is…    It looks like it is back.  Yes.     No, Chairman I did not.     I did not.     Hold it.  Not really.  I think you are on the right track, Advocate Myburgh.  Please, continue.      Not really.  But let me still try and explain what this was supposed to be even though Mr Mapoma interpreted it in a strange way.  The assumption would have been that Mr Gama would have paid certain costs at that high court process.   Then the idea was that if he had to pay those, then Mr Gama needed to be refunded 75% of those costs only but still paid the 25%.  Yes.     Yes.     I did not.     I am not sure who did.  I did not.  Ja.     No.     I do not.     Bundle 1.  One, four, two?  Okay let me go back to 142.  Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I see it, yes.     Yes, I see that.     I would have received it at the time, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I accept that, yes.     I accept that.     That is correct.     [No audible reply]      No, I see the figure.     But the question is.  Did Gama paid Transnet in the first place?     Because that is my problem as well.  That is why I shake my head.  Because the idea was that... the assumption was.  Gama has paid the legal fees of Transnet’s lawyers, et cetera.     That is correct.     Whatever legal fees had been incurred by Transnet’s lawyers.     In regard to the high court matter.     If I recall, I did not do that because I was communicating some of these decisions particularly to stop with the Transnet’s Group Legal.  But the question you are posing is a relevant question in that it sounds like no Transnet’s legal fees had been paid even by Gama at that time.     Yes.     Yes.     Chairman, I would not like to agree to fully that interpretation because at the time when this issue was being discussed, my assumption was Gama owes various lawyers a certain amount of money.   And my assumption was he should have paid by then although yes in terms of the Advocate Todd.  He might not have paid but the assumption was he was going to pay.   Therefore, whatever he would have been refunded would have been based on him having incurred certain costs which would have been then 75% of those costs.   Not the other way around where he has not even incurred... he has not even paid and he gets paid.  That is a total misinterpretation of that agreement.     That is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     [No audible reply]      Not so if he could not...[intervenes]      But I will accept that, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Chairman, I am not sure what should have been paid by that time but what I can indicate here, there is a serious misinterpretation by a few people of what that settlement agreement meant. Those people include Mr Mapoma and they include even Mr Anoj Singh.  There is a serious misinterpretation.       Yes, it was compromised.       Yes, I do remember.     I do understand.  Yes.     Ja, also by the way, if I can add on advocate?     Even that one point seven which say, I say I understand.  It would have been on the basis that Gama would have paid a certain amount, not just on the basis of him being given a freebie.  No.     Yes, thank you.     Yes, I agree with you.     I did but at the time, my interpretation... of course, I am copied here.  There are these two people interacting now.  The Group CEO and Mr Mapoma.  And at the time, I was under the impression that, particularly Mr Mapoma, understood what the intention of that settlement agreement is.   But this memo here was wrongly crafted.  Yes, I should have highlighted that even say to Molefe that this was not what was in the agreement.     Let me think of it carefully.  In the agreement, entitled to which costs.  Can you please repeat?     My understanding of the agreement.  It did not cover that for one or the other reason.  Yes.     Yes.  Yes.  That agreement did not cover that.     Bundle 2.  Okay let us check this... Aside, ja.  We have Bundle 2.     Page 41.  Oaky I am on page 41.  Wait.  Forty-one or 21?     Forty-one.  Okay.  I have go that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I have seen this document.  Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     I see this.     Yes.     Yes.     I find it strange that even though this thing is an opinion of the same entity, Deneys Reitz, that much earlier on, sometime in February, it created doubt on the possibilities of success if this matter was taken through the Transnet Bargaining Council process and through to the fact that this doubt was created, then this settlement agreement was reached.  And of course now, there is this shame which then says Mr Gama’s dismissal is now academic.  I see that, ja.     There is a point ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      No ...[intervenes]      Chairman, I concede at the time that yes there was this doubt but... because even as early as that as well, Deneys Reitz in that earlier letter, did indicate that Transnet did have a strong case, yes.     That is correct.     Where is it?  Is it page 48?     Bundle 2, page 48.  Yes okay.  Yes, I have got it.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     Oh, yes I see it.     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.     That is correct.     Chairman, as you can see.  Even in my submission to the Public Protector, there is always this may have, may have.  And interestingly enough, as we have discussed... even the few examples that maybe I made of the V and E(?) and al. these ...[indistinct] contracts.  They are not identical to the offences that Mr Gama committed.  That I concede but... ja.     [No audible reply]      Chairman, yes I understand fully.  Please continue.     Chairman, I had indicated that there was this doubt created that we may or may not win this thing when it went thought the Transnet Bargaining Council.     Let us indicate that when you say carefully considered response, a letter like this would not have been authored by myself, as such, but it would have been authored in organisation in support of what I could have been telling them, yes.     At the time, yes, I agree with but based on these discussions that we are now having, there are some interesting holes on similarities which frankly are not there in terms of whether the Gama matter was a procurement matter or was a misconduct matter.     That difference is beginning to emerge, ja.     Ja.     File 3.     Bundle 3.     Page 479?     Okay.       I have got that page 479, yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Chairman, maybe not.  Let me try and explain at times how these things were evolving.  You still need to recall that yes, that board, when it was dealing with certain issues, was a new board and it almost needed a re-induction because even when an induction could have been done it might not have been done to that detail to that board.  Yes, that is how I interpret 5.2.3.4.     That is correct, yes, [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     That is what I am saying, yes.     Yes, he did.     I understand, Chairman.  Maybe let me try and get a little bit of – it is not background but at that time in almost the first two months of 2011, maybe first three months – again, I do not have proof, but we could have dealt maybe with close to condonation applications and therefore that is why then this board was saying hold it, there is too much of these condonations, can somebody come and explain in detail what are these condonation all about?  Yes.     I understand where you coming from.     I understand, Chairman, yes.     Bundle 4.  Yes, please hold.     Before tab 19.  Okay.  Chairman, I have got it in front of me.     I have got that in front of me.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     We have dealt with it, yes.     Yes.     Chairman, yes, there was some report but it was not extensive.     There was a report around the 24 January by KPMG.  I say it was not extensive as in terms of dealing with the real issues on the Gama matter.  It was more a planning report by KPMG.     It was progress report, that is correct.     That is correct, yes.     Chairman has already touched on that.     In some of his remarks, yes.     That is correct, Chair.     That is also correct, Chair, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     That is correct, yes.     Yes.     No.  Advocate, no, nothing except that I did indicate that I did not instruct Mr Mapoma, in my interpretation to do something that is almost illegal in terms of what he claims, to pay Gama’s lawyers, the way they interpreted that agreement.  To me, that I did not instruct Mr Mapoma to do that.     Chairman, I am not aware of something that could have happened.  No, I am not aware, Chairman.     Yes.     Chairman, I do not think anything would have happened to Transnet.      Chairman, I do not know if he would have signed at the time but – and would have proceeded to arbitration but based on the post events that we are observing, had he – had Transnet refused to deal with certain things and then say had he gone through the Transnet bargaining council process, different outcomes could have been on the table, ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Chairman, maybe let me put the issues a little bit differently.  While Mr Gama was on suspension, etcetera, Mr Tau Morwe was Acting CEO and while Mr Tau Morwe was acting CEO, that business frankly was not doing very well either in terms of operations, etcetera.  If I recall at the time we almost had derailments every week at the time.   So then we somehow knew that we still want this executive back to come and fix some of the things that were not going well in that particular business unit.     Chairman, the situation was not looking good in terms of operations.     Chairman, yes, it is extraordinary but the interpretation I am seeing now is not what was intended.  So there is something not right with that implementation, yes.     Chairman, we could have gone that route of getting somebody new but here was this experienced individual particularly …[intervenes]     ...many years in Transnet and he should have got in running to try and fix the problems that we were observing as that new board.     Chairman, I agree with you there.     That is correct, Chairman.     There were many, Chairman, but do not forget as a board we could only focus on what you would call the Exco then.     Not all the people involved.     There were two, if I recall, Chairman, yes.     Yes and the other one was Ms Moira Moses.     Ms Moira Moses.     Chairman, yes, it is the same gentleman, yes.     Chairman that is correct but my recollection is that one particular individual the CEO did deal with, I don’t know in what form, but his name is Mr Gary Peter and there were others that then the Board had expected Mr Brian Molefe to continue dealing with in terms of disciplinary processes.  I do not have feedback on the rest  Chairman, I would have to go back to some other notes to find out who the rest were and also I would have to go back and ask the organisation as to what did Molefe do about this.     Chairman he did report to the Board on what I can call the two Exco members, then the Board then left it to him to deal with the rest, and now I don’t think as a Board we got a summary of what he had done with the rest, whatever the number might have been.     That is correct but then I don’t know the detail because Mr Maharaj was interacting with Mr Brian Molefe.  I don’t know the dynamics.     She also resigned but again I don’t have the detail of the dynamics between Mr Moira Moses and Mr Molefe at the time.     Chairman I wouldn’t say the rest must face the wrath of the Board because we did issue a memorandum for the organisation at the time I could  have signed it, talking about these condonations and irregular modifications of contracts and I did issue a memorandum putting a stop to that, and also I suspect in that memorandum I did indicate that any future condonations had to be approved by one individual, who is Brian Molefe, because there was confusion of too many people thinking that they had authority to condone.  Naturally I think the PPM, the Procurement Procedures Manual, might have allowed that and as well then Chairman that Board did deal with sort of condonations of big ticket items which would have been approved by  that Board before in terms of the authority that approved the initial contract.  I did mention earlier the VAE Contract, I did mention a few others, other appointments and yes I did mention a few, which then came back to the Board and the Board did condone those.     Chairman in a different way we are actually saying that to Mr Molefe, we were saying let all these condonements come to your office and you then decide on what steps to take post them being submitted to you and there was a lot that came in and I am not sure now of those, I think one of those would have been a repeater for instance where I know that  he might have got a letter of warning please don’t do this again.   Now it was up to Mr Molefe then to decide on the rest including Mr Maharaj, including Ms Moira Moses but yes we did elevate others to then say there must be consequences for people, they must not do it again etcetera, etcetera, but I do not recall actually instructing that people then should be fired.   I would always indicate let them submit all the condonations and take a view whether you want to condone, want to give a written warning, final written warning and that was the discretion that was Mr Molefe was given.     Ja.     Chairman your observation is correct because the guidance that he got from the Board was not that specific but there was a board resolution which was done on how he should deal with the rest of these irregular procurements that were emerging.     I fully understand Chairman but there is this example of Mr Gary Peter who – I don’t recall now the detail but he also was party to some irregular contract but he was not dismissed, between I am not sure how they handled it, but between Anoj Singh and Mr Brian Molefe they dealt with this through Gary Peter, but I am aware that he was not dismissed.     Chairman in hindsight I come to that conclusion because the three key matters that the process of Advocate Antrobus looked into and came to decisions on.  The last one which was charge 4 it is serious misconduct, if that matter had been elevated properly to that Board I would have also indicated that a sanction of a dismissal must stay and again in hindsight even on the other two matters which at the time looked like procurement related they were not, they were actually misconduct and if that part of it had been discussed thoroughly by the Board I think that Board would have arrived at different decisions.      I concede Chairman yes.     I concede that too Chairman yes.     I would consider that Chair.     ...[Indistinct – record distorted] yes we should have.     Ja, because he had made a convincing submission.     Chairman I would not be opposed to that and because there are certain levels of recover and also of certain ...[indistinct – distorted] direct involvement on some of these issues because it goes even further Chairman to the point of saying what about all these monies which was paid to Langa’s Attorneys in some funny way but ja.     Yes Chairman.     Thank you Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.    Mr Chairperson I have just received I think what is referred to as a supplementary statement or affidavit which I understand Mr Mkwanazi wants – wants to hand up obviously with your leave.  It is a short document – it is about five pages long.  It addresses the things that he accepted were outstanding.  We personally do not have any objection to its introduction.  The Secretariat is in the process of making copies and will add it to the bundle at tea time.    In my submission it need not hold up.    The continuation of – of the questioning of Mr Mkwanazi.    Thank you.  Good morning Mr Mkwanazi.    When we broke on Friday evening I was questioning you about the two bits of advice you     But perhaps I could just take you to that advice.  If you turn please to Bundle 2.    And if you could turn up page 13 that is the memorandum of the 15 t h and then as you know at page 19 is the report of the 22 n d.  Correct?    Now I would just ask you to confirm that your evidence was that the first bit of advice in other words the memorandum of the 15 t h if my notes serve me correctly your evidence was that you accepted that that memorandum and the advice was poor, is that correct?    Would you accept then that on the face of it when you say it was poor and not thorough it certainly was not persuasive?    And it was on that basis if I understand your evidence correctly that you asked Deneys Reitz in the word that you used was to augment their advice, is that right?    But then why did you follow it?  This is what I do not understand.  Why – why did you think it was appropriate having received a piece of legal advice that you were not persuaded by – why did allow Deneys Reitz the opportunity of augmenting it after the board meeting of the 16 February?    Chairman we did allow Deneys Reitz and also you – you – you will have to understand that there were three issues that sort of Deneys Reitz was trying to give advice on.  And they did not give advice specific to certain issues which frankly would have been a better approach.   Where they should have taken the first matter, second matter and third matter and gave advice on the three almost independently.  They somehow tried to give summary advice on all three matters.   And in my interpretation the gravity of the three matters was not the same but having said that I do not have a serious problem with the advice say on the first two offences which relate to procurement.  But I have a problem with the advice on the third matter which related to the attack of Mr Gama on the executives and board of Transnet.   But on the first two other matters – because do not forget from – at the time from where I sat the issues – the focus was on procurement where the – irregular – other irregularities – yes the focus on procurement.  But I truly say that advice did not address the issues individually and I suspect the outcome could have been different.    You suspect the outcome could have been different?    Yes.    But…    Mr Mkwanazi really what I am driving at is you get poor legal advice; it does not deal with everything but you still take the decision on the 16 February.  You do not wait for the augmented legal advice, correct?    Is that correct?    Right.  So let us then go to this augmented legal advice.    Yes thank you.  Now just to go to this augmented legal advice that you receive on the 22 February which you find at page 19.  Mr Mkwanazi it also does not deal with all three charges.  Correct?    You still then do not go back to Deneys Reitz and say but what about charge 3 or where is the analysis?  All they do is they repeat the generic advice that they gave you before.  Correct?    But why did you not go back to them?  I mean the truth is you had no sustainable legal advice.  You had generic advice which did not deal with one of the charges at all.  Correct?    And then there is a bigger problem and that is you; yourself accept that Deneys Reitz’ augmented legal advice was contradictory, correct?    But still you do not go back to them and say, but hang on I do not understand what you actually saying, correct?    It really bears out your desire and the desire of the board to reinstate Mr Gama at all costs, does it not?    But the board had already made up its mind by that time on the 16 February?    So let us – let me press me if I might in relation to paragraph 1.1 at page 20 of Bundle 2.      At paragraph 1.1 it says there   Yes.  And then after that did you receive the memorandum of the 15 t h that they gave input into?    So well let me – I am not sure.    Yes. MR    Yes but Mr Mkwanazi they dealing with the history here.    They say   But here they say…    Mr Mkwanazi here they refer to an opinion where they said that Mr Gama’s prospects of success are not good.      You cannot explain this?  Was that in their memorandum of the 15 t h or was it in some other document?    But just so that you understand.    Just to refresh your memory.  Remember the memorandum of the 15 t h it had…    It was produced with the input of Deneys Reitz.    But your testimony was that it was presented to the board or the committee as a memorandum from Group Legal.    So had you seen a prior opinion from Deneys Reitz that said that Mr Gama’s prospects of success were poor?    Yes.    So I have got two more questions.    I have got two more questions for you before I move on here.  Firstly why did you not go back to Deneys Reitz and raise with them the contradiction in this opinion?  At 1.1 they are saying we have given you opinion saying his prospects of success are poor and then in their conclusion as you put it they raised out.  Why did you not go to them and say, clarify this?  What actually are you saying?  Why did you not do that?    Yes but that – we know that.  My question is, why did you not do that?  It seems so obvious does it not?    Right.  And then having specifically asked them to augment their advice you say because they did not deal with the third charge they do not deal with it here you still do not go back to them and say, deal with the third charge, correct?    Why not?    It seems the obvious thing to do does it not?    Mr Mkwanazi please just let me understand.  You go to Deneys Reitz you ask them to augment their opinion.  Amongst the reasons that you want them to do that you say is that they do not deal with the third charge on 15 February.  They then provide an augmented opinion and they still do not deal with it.    And you cannot explain why you did not do that?    Alright.    But…    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Could you please go to the draft settlement agreement?     Yes, thank you.  So Mr Mkwanazi, what you have accepted is that it was, as you put it, a serious oversight on the part of the board not to consider the third charge on the 16 t h of February?     And you say if the board had done so, its decision might very well have been very different.  Correct?     Is that correct?     But what I do not understand is that you knew of the shortcoming because you went back to Deneys Reitz so that they could augment their opinion in respect of the third charge.  That is your own evidence.  You see the contradiction?     Mr Mkwanazi, perhaps you are not following my question.  It was not an oversight.  You identified the failure and you asked Deneys Reitz to address it.  When they did not address it, you just pushed on in any case.       It was not an oversight.  You are... on your version, you identified the failure.       But then why did you not go back to them when they did not address the failure or the weakness that you had identified?     Signed in draft form.  Signed by Mr Gama on the 10t h of February 2011.     You have said that you were the lead negotiator.  Is that correct?     So by the 10t h ...[intervenes]      By the 10 t h of February, you had already, at least for yourself, decided that Mr Gama should be reinstated as the Chief Executive of TFR, correct?     That, of course, was before Deneys Reitz’ advice?     Yes, but the point is that your evidence has been that you appointed Deneys Reitz to bring fresh eyes to bear on this issue.  What you land up doing is deciding for yourself that the man must be reinstated before those fresh eyes produced any advice, correct?     Yes.  But does that not bear out then Mr Mkwanazi that, really what you were looking for is legal advice that accorded with your decision, correct?     Is it not so that you had decided to reinstate Mr Gama even before you went to Denys Reitz?     But you have repeatedly told the Chairperson that why you went to Deneys Reitz, is you wanted them to bring fresh eyes to bear.  It does not seem to me that you waited for their advice.  You had already decided.  Certainly, you yourself had decided that Mr Gama was to be reinstated before that advice.     That you find in Bundle 1.       I would like you to turn to page 170.  One, seven, zero.     [No audible reply]      Alright.  So on Friday, we dealt with paragraph 7 at page 170.  I want to direct your attention to paragraph 6 and then I want us to read the two paragraphs     That is what he is referring to.  He     Mr Mkwanazi, perhaps I could just ask you for a direct answer.  Did you ...[intervenes]      ...or did you not tell Mr Mhlango before you had even appointed Deneys Reitz that Transnet intended to reinstate Mr Gama, yes or not?     So you did not tell him this?     But how does he get it so wrong?  Reviewing and reinstatement are two completely different concepts.     Yes, you simply ...[intervenes]      You simply repeating your evidence.  Do you remember my question?  My question is, how does he get it so wrong?     And then if we go to his emails.     Page 178.  I think ...[intervenes]      I think you have told the Chairperson as well that he got it wrong.     Where you told the minister on the 18t h of January that you were nearing a settlement.  He also got that wrong.  Is that right?     I see.  Were you... you say though that you were speaking to Mr Mhlango around this time.  Is that correct?     And did you speak to him about Mr Gama’s reinstatement?     Well, I think that is very important evidence.  Did you speak to him about the fact that, on your version at least, the minister had instructed you to undertake a review of Mr Gama’s dismissal.  Did you talk to him about that?     Right.  And if you go to page 181.  There is an email from ...[indistinct] to Mr Gigaba on the 4 February     And he said    You had had a meeting with him about your negotiations with Mr Gama and his position in relation to applying for the GCE vacancy, correct?      Well you had a meeting with him dealing with two subjects, correct?     Now what gave rise to this meeting on the 4 February?     So were you keeping Mr Mahlangu apprised of developments in the light of the instruction that you got from the minister to, as you put it, review Mr Gama’s dismissal?     Is that what you were doing?     Sorry, my question, Mr Mkwanazi, is were you …[intervenes]     Yes but you were having these discussions with him in light of the instruction that you received from the minister.     You say to review Mr Gama’s dismissal, correct?     And this is a discussion that you were having with the very person that suggested that you should appoint Mr Sbu Gule, correct?     So let us go then please to the …[intervenes]     Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Mkwanazi, I would like now to move to the board meeting on the 16 February.     I want to start off …[intervenes]     I will come to the minute in a moment but I want to start off just by finding out from you precisely what was before the board at this meeting on the 16 February.  Let me start by asking you was Mr Todd’s opinion before the board on the 16 February?     You do not recall that?     But, Mr Mkwanazi, you had received Mr Todd’s opinion, as I understand it, you had read it as well.     Do you not think it would have been important for it to have served before the board then on the 16 February?  I mean, why did you not ensure that it was there?     So you would have seen the affidavit from the company secretary who says that the Todd opinion was part of the board pack of the 16 February.  You have seen that affidavit, have you not?     If we go to bundle 1, page 15.     Wait, let me go back.     So three lines down at page 12 – or paragraph 12.     “Therefore the said document...” And there she is referring to Mr Todd’s report. “...and the draft settlement agreement were tabled for consideration before the board.  When the board authorised the finalisation of Mr Gama’s settlement agreement, a copy of this report is annexed marked MPM6.” Now can I just take you to MPM6.  That you find at page 42.     She has put up a board pack, it seems, Board of Directors Meeting 16 February 12.32.05, Royal Elephant Conference Centre, Centurion and then you will see that there was spiral binding on the left hand side of Mr Todd’s report, you can flick through it and go all the way from 43 …[intervenes]     To 68.     So is it still your recollection that the Todd report …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, the page number …[intervenes]     Chairperson, I was referring to …[intervenes]     To annexure MPM6, that is at page 42.     That is correct.  And then Mr Todd’s report, Chairperson, goes all the way up to 68.     Mr Mkwanazi, is it still your recollection and of course you can only testify to what you remember but is it still your recollection that the Todd report was not before the board on the 16 t h?     Right.     Yes but I want to – I think it is very important for the Chairperson to know precisely what information was before the board on the 16 t h.     Now I can take you to two affidavits by your fellow directors, Ms Gcaba and Ms Tshepe who both confirmed …[intervenes]     And you might have seen that, who both confirmed that the Todd report was in fact before the board on the 16 February.     Do you need me to take you to those passages or would you agree with that?     And you have seen those affidavits, I mean you were given all of these files over the weekend, correct?  You have seen the affidavits of Gcaba and Tshepe?     Alright.  So can the Chairperson then accept on the strength of the board pack and on the strength of what they say that you then accept that the Todd report is before you on the 16 February?     Now you and other board members talk about legal advice that was before the board.  Now do I understand you correctly that what you placed before the board after the memos of 14 and 15 February was what Mapoma sent you on the 15 February further to the input of Deneys Reitz and you presented that memorandum as the opinion of group legal.  Effectively, Mr Mapoma’s opinion, is that correct?     So when we look at these affidavits and reference is made to legal advice, that legal advice, and correct me if I am wrong, comprises the advice of Mr Todd and effectively, the advice of Mr Mapoma, is that correct?     And you have accepted previously that the advice of Mr Mapoma that you placed before the board …[intervenes]     Where you say some doubt was created, was entirely in conflict with the advice that he gave the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee on the 3 February when he told  members of that committee, including a number of your directors, that Transnet had a very, very good case, correct?     Right.  You have accepted as well that as of the 16 February there was nothing before the board from KPMG/Nkonki.  You confirm that?     What we have seen from the affidavits of Gcaba and Tshepe is that both of them say that you informed the board that you had a list of contraventions that were comparable to Mr Gama’s case.  Neither of them say you introduced this list, they simply say that you informed the board of a list of contraventions that were comparable to Mr Gama’s case.  Do you confirm that?     And you have given evidence – and I think I have taken you to the relevant prior extracts where you seem to have talked about a list of 30, is that correct?     And, if I understand your evidence correctly, from what you have said earlier this morning and previously, that really was a list of persons in relation to whom condonation was granted, is that correct?     So you had this list?     Yes, I would like just to take you please to page – it is Ms Gcaba’s affidavit at page – bundle 1.     Gcaba, bundle 1, 224.     224.     If I could please direct your attention to paragraph 48.2?     She is here dealing with the board     Did you do that?     You told them that you have a list of contraventions that are comparable to the case of Mr Gama.     You did not – on her version, you did not share this list with your fellow board members, you simply told them that you had this list, correct?     Let us go please to page 785.     This is Ms Tshepe’s affidavit, she is also dealing with the meeting of the 16 February and at paragraph 37.2 – I beg your pardon, I want to take you to 784.     She also says at 37.2    So this is your list of 30, you say it was in the form of a spreadsheet.     And what did it show?  What did it reflect?  So you have 30 names.     This is important, Mr Mkwanazi.     You have a list of 30 people, so from what you can recall, 30 names …[intervenes] MR     If I can just summarise your evidence and then you can either agree or disagree.     You have a list of 30 names spanning the period 2005 to 2010.     The list would indicated the irregularity, as you put it, where the mandate may have been exceeded.     And then there was an indication of whether condonation was granted or not, is that correct?     Now how were you on the face of that list in a position to tell your fellow board members that those contraventions were comparable to Mr Gama’s case? MR     But even there you did not know whether they were actually comparable.  You thought broadly they were because they are now procurement irregularities but you did not know the detail of the 30, correct?     So you really were not in a position, Mr Mkwanazi, even to tell them in relation to the two charges that the contraventions on your list were comparable, were you?     So they were at best broadly comparable.     Yes.  So I suppose what you should have said – is you should not have said that the cases are comparable, you should have told them look, they are broadly comparable.     Because they are all involved in some or other way, procurement irregularity.     It is a different picture, is it not?     Yes, alright.     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi just correct me if I’m wrong, but as I understand it on this list of 30 people some of those people condonation had not been granted, is that correct?      And if I understand your evidence correctly the list might also have contained names of people who were actually dismissed for procurement irregularities?       Importantly, and in fact if I understand it I think on Friday you talked about a list of 22 and then we’ve seen when Mr Molefe was appointed, your affidavit says he was instructed to deal with 12, so can you remember how many people on this list with reference to those figures that I have just given you, were in fact granted condonation?   It wasn’t all 30.     I think really I am just looking for a number, because your evidence  you’ve spoken about thirty, you’ve spoken about 22, you’ve spoken about 12, are you able to help us with a number or not?     Now Mr Mkwanazi as I understand your evidence in response to questions from the Chairperson is that on the bare information that you had on the spreadsheet you weren’t able to identify or determine the severity of each individual case, correct?     But what we do know is that by way of comparison you were in a very good position to determine the severity of Mr Gama’s misconduct, correct?     And why is that?     Yes but you were in a very good position to assess it, I was driving that, because Mr Todd had done that for you over a space of 25 pages, correct?      Alright so let us go to the minute please of the meeting of the 16 t h of February.     The minutes appears in various places but the first time it was put up was by the company secretary.  Let me take you please to Bundle 1, page 34.     Alright, Bundle 1, 34, now let us go to paragraph 2.1.2.     Secondly Mr Gama’s sanction of dismissal was too harsh and the Board will support a sanction of a final written warning valid for a period of 12 months and from what you have told the Chairperson ...[intervenes]      I beg your pardon, six  months.     For a period of six months, correct Mr Mkwanazi?     And from what you told the Chairperson fundamentally what led the board to that conclusion is that you informed the Board that you had a list of contraventions that were comparable to Mr Gama’s case, where people had not been dismissed, correct?     You have admitted that you perhaps shouldn’t have created the impression that they were like for like, correct?     And then you go on to – or it goes on to record appreciation that Mr Gama can still add value in the company, there was a minority not in support of the reversal of Mr Gama’s sanction.     The company was mandated to finalise Mr Gama’s settlement agreement and then the condonation process is the norm within Transnet and to this effect the Chairman was requested to draft a memorandum to employees requesting that such conduct should cease.     What does that mean?     You have told the Chairperson on Friday that you accept that condonation and disciplinary action are two different concepts, correct?     And then at paragraph 2.1.3 the Board was of the view that under the circumstances a final written warning would have been given.     Would have been given, how would that have happened?     I mean what you say here is effective is that if Mr Gama had applied for condonation then this is what would have happened.        I just want to understand Mr Mkwanazi if you don’t mind.  When it says the Board was of the view that under normal circumstances a final written warning would have been given what do you mean by that, when would it have been given?   How would it have been given?     Sorry?     Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mkwanazi what you don’t see here is any consideration or undertaking by the Board of a review of Mr Antrobes’ decision, correct?   I mean no one says well this is what Antrobes found, we think it’s wrong for these reasons, the Board is just deciding this matter effectively afresh for itself isn’t it?       Is that what you were told to do, then, and this is an important question, is that what you were told to do by the Minister?   Is decide the matter afresh for yourself?     But Mr Mkwanazi this minute does not reflect any application of the mind by the board to a review of Mr Antrobes’ decision.  The Board just decides afresh what it thinks should have happened, correct?     But why not?  Unless you were hell bent on having Mr Gama reinstated why didn’t you undertake a proper objective review?     Thank you.  Just one last question on the board meeting, Mr Mkwanazi Mr Malangani he says in his affidavit that you said that you had received legal advice to the effect that the sanction of dismissal was too harsh.  Did you say that?     Yes, because I mean in truth you hadn’t received legal advice to the effect that the sanction of dismissal was too harsh.  At best you had received legal advice creating as you said many times “some doubt”, correct?     Perhaps this is an opportune time for me to ask you, you do now that this settlement cost the taxpayer, and we will come to the figures in a moment, I think about R17million.  Why do you settle a case just because there is some doubt?     Yes I will come to that.     Yes I think perhaps Mr Chairman I will come to that in a moment, but the – what was paid to Mr Gama was approximately R13million and then there was about R4million in legal costs, you are absolutely right, it is the two together, but my figure of R17million includes the two.     Yes.     Yes, well Mr Mkwanazi we are going to come to the figures in a moment, but you know that this was a very extensive settlement wasn’t it?     So that is really what I am driving at, why do you settle where the cost is enormous, just because at absolute best for you there is some doubt, that’s all.     Why didn’t you just let the process run, you could have saved this money, potentially?  Why were you so hell bent ...[intervenes]      Yes but Mr Mkwanazi I am going to press you on this, because this is a very important issue.   You have said time and time again to the Chairperson you settled because there is some doubt.  Well there’s doubt in all litigation.     I just cannot understand even on your own version what is the basis for entering into this very expensive settlement when all there is, is some doubt.  Why give away the money?     Yes Mr Mkwanazi I am not sure ...[intervenes]      I don’t think I have got an answer.     Mr Mkwanazi you accept that there is doubt and risk in all litigation.       I am just going to ask you once more I mean this settlement we will go into the figures in a moment, cost anywhere between 10 and 20million, that’s how much money you doled out to Mr Gama, and you did that simply because there was some doubt that was not even articulated in the opinion.  That is surely not rational.      Yes, but you are skirting around the question.  I mean if there was some doubt there was also we know a prospect that you could win.     Correct but then why didn’t you allow an arbitration to run its course then we could have perhaps saved somewhere between ten and twenty  million.  I mean you knew there was a prospect of being able to do that, why did you not allow the process to run its course.     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi what I now want to do is deal with relevant concept, condonation whether or not it was applicable and the like.  Can I ask you please to turn to Mr Todd’s further affidavit, that is in Bundle 3 at page ...[intervenes]      Bundle 3, and it starts at page 156.     So what Mr Todd does in this affidavit is if you have a look at paragraph 6, he deals with your reasoning and the decision to reinstate in the light of the issue of condonation, and then at paragraph 7 he says this explanation is in my respectful submission not rational, it does not ring true on its own terms.  The explanation cannot be correct for the following reasons, and then he summarises four points that he then expands upon.   First condonation was not – sorry condonation was a procurement process entirely distinct from decision making about the consequences that should flow, sorry follow from employee misconduct. Second, not one of the three instances of misconduct to which Mr Gama ultimately admitted and for which he was dismissed was capable of or suitable for condonation as an application of the procurement policy.  Third, such contentions as Mr Gama sought to make during the disciplinary process concerning consistency of treatment were fully, carefully and fairly considered by the disciplinary  chairperson as appears from his lengthy findings and then fourth, as far as I am aware there was no report or evidence before the Board when the decision was taken to reinstate Mr Gama which showed a track record of condonation being granted etcetera. Now I want to now go through each of those points, if I can take you please to the heading “condonation and procurement process distinct from decisions on employee conduct.”  Mr Todd says to the best of my knowledge condonation within the Transnet Procurement environment had nothing to do with condoning acts of misconduct by employees, and I understand you have accepted that. MR     Condonation was a procurement procedure under which a person or body with authority to incur expenditure was permitted to – and now he is quoting     I refer in this regard to the opening paragraph of the Transnet internal memorandum and we     And at 11 the distinction between condonation as a procurement procedure and disciplinary processes to deal with employee misconduct is a logical distinction which is apparent from Transnet policy directives at the time including Annexure A, you have already accepted that, correct?     That memorandum deals with the authority of what is referred to as the divisional acquisition council, the procurement body within a Transnet division to condone non-compliance with prescribed procurement policies and procedures, do you accept that?     As the memorandum makes clear condonations “are not there for the asking” correct?     It will be as a general rule condonation should be given for relatively minor transgressions of procurement rules and procedures and that material non-compliance will usually not be condoned because these have “PFMA implications which could result in civil, criminal or disciplinary steps being taken”, you would agree with that?     A condonation submission was required to state whether disciplinary steps have been taken because of non-compliance, correct?     And [d] ever matters have been submitted for condonation where certain individuals are found to be guilty of transgressions disciplinary action should be considered, you would confirm that?     I summary said Mr Todd the two processes, one condoning minor non-compliance with rules and procedures and 2 responding to employee misconduct were at all times, both as a matter of logic and as a matter of policy entirely distinct, correct?     And then you will see, I will come back to the affidavit or the body of it in a moment, but would you please go to page 168.     There is Annexure A and it is the PFM directive of March 2010 dealing with condonations and really what Mr Todd did is he analysed and quoted in his affidavit from this Annexure A, and you have agreed with his analysis, correct?     So then if you go back please to page 106 ...[intervenes]      Mr Chairman I see that it is quarter past eleven, is this a convenient time to take the tea adjournment.    Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi – Mr Chairman I have been asked to face…    I have to fact this way.    Yes.  So I am sorry.    Ja.    Thank you.    I will sort it out.    At lunchtime but I am sure I can limp on.    Mr Chairperson thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi can I please then take you to the next topic that is dealt with by Mr Todd?  And this is at page 160 of Bundle 3.     Ja well I think that is a concession fairly made.      Well let me then deal with that.    Then just to add to that Mr Mkwanazi so that deals with the misconduct side of it but on the condonation side of it Mr Todd says well condonation could never have been granted because this actually was not condoned.  What happened is that the contract was cancelled by Transnet and it incurred various significant costs.  Correct?    Alright.  Let us then go to page 161.    Paragraph 3.  We are now dealing with GNS.   “The procurement irregularities in relation to the appointment of GNS were completely unsuitable for condonation for various reasons. 1.  First that procurement process was so seriously flawed that no rational person could have attempted to use the condonation procedure to seek to regularise it.  I refer to the multiple and serious respects in which the process was found to be deviated – oh sorry defective by the Chairperson of the disciplinary proceedings brought against Messrs Khanya and Senemala.  As appears from the copy of the findings.” Now I have taken – you mentioned those before.    Those are the findings marked B the findings of Nazier Cassim SC you would have read them no doubt?    Yes.  And you will see that that finding tabulates an absolute litany of irregularities caused and affected by these two employees who were then dismissed.  Correct?    Mr Todd goes on to say   Mr Todd goes on to…    Mr Todd goes on to say   So we two down.  And then what Mr    Oh sorry what I meant to say is that one simply cannot justify the conclusion and decision of the board can you to reinstate Mr Gama on the basis of these paragraphs it is just impossible.    Yes.  And you accept that?    Yes but let me put it this way Mr Mkwanazi.  Let us just take the Fifty Like New.    You fairly conceded to the Chairperson that – well we know that condonation would never have been granted – that we know.  Because the contract was not condoned; was not regularised; it was cancelled.  But leaving condonation aside you have conceded to a question by the Chairperson that it did not detract from his misconduct.  That what had happened here is that Mr Gama had defied an instruction of the board.  Correct?    And important instruction and his misconduct is serious, is it not?    Right so that is Fifty Like New.  Now GNS just so that you – you follow.  Mr Todd accepted the proposition that I put to him that Mr Gama’s case in relation to GNS is that he signed what was a confinement blind without having any regard to anything and allowed a fraud to be perpetrated on Transnet.  That is his own case.  But you are not going to condone that are you?    And you would accept.    Yes sorry I did not want to – I do not mean to interrupt you.    And you would accept that for a CEO of a major division of Transnet to conduct himself in that way is quite appalling is it not?  To blindly sign a document that allows a fraud to be perpetrated on the company.  Correct?    You are not going to condone that and you accepted that is serious misconduct.  Correct?    Correct.  Because we know that you treated him on the basis as if condonation had been granted.    Mr Mkwanazi you say in hindsight and you make fair concessions here today.    But in hindsight because what Mr Todd is saying here is really no different to what was Mr Antrobus said in his findings.  The reality is that you did not come to the decision that you say you would have come to today simply because you did not apply your mind.   You had an ulterior purpose Mr Mkwanazi surely you must concede that?    Hm.    Then in conclusion Mr Mkwanazi what – what Mr Todd says at paragraph 14 of page 162 is to state in his circumstances that the board – and this is what you had said  “Had to somehow deal – sorry – had to somehow try and deal with Mr – with the Gama matter on the assumption that he had been granted condonation had it been offered and therefore had to try to put him in a position that he could have been in had condonation been offered simply cannot be correct.” And I think you concede that, correct?    But Mr Mkwanazi I am going to press you on why did you not come to that conclusion at the time?  It seems to me you could not have read Mr Antrobus’ finding.  It seems to me that you could not possibly have read Mr Todd’s report.      Yes thank you.  And then Mr Todd goes on at page 163 to deal with the contention that Gama’s own contentions on consistency were fully and fairly considered in the disciplinary process.  I mean did you notice that when you read when Mr Todd’s report that the concerns that you say you had about condonation and inconsistency those were considered by the Chairperson.  Did you see that?    Why did you not then simply leave things be?  He had considered it.  He had applied his mind to it.  He concluded that there was no merit in it.  Why did you just override that?    Yes but Mr Mkwanazi I think you are missing my point.  Mr Antrobus had applied himself to that contention that was made by Mr Gama and he had rejected it.    Yes thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi you see how you fall back now on the Deneys Reitz advice but the Deneys Reitz advice does not say anything about condonation or inconsistency; nothing.    Well then explain to …    How did you do this?    You used the words a slight risk.  Are we down to that now?  You settled because there was a slight risk.  That is what you said right?    So this cost the taxpayer somewhere between 10 and 20 million because you and your board said well there is a slight risk so let us just pay him that.  Correct?    We going – we going to come to that.  Just to end off on this topic about the fact that the Chairperson had dealt with this.  Can I ask you please to go to page 86 of Bundle 3.      So I would like to take you to the middle paragraph.  This is a finding by Antrobus SC. “It was contended that the first and second charges are an entirely new formulation at Transnet.  This is Mr Gama’s contention.  As it has never occurred in the history of that company that a CEO or Senior Executive for that matter has been held to have committed misconduct for activities and practices that are usually automatically condoned and accepted by various mechanisms and committees within Transnet.” So that is what Mr Gama and that is also what you found.    And the Chairperson goes on to say    A misconduct of different things.       And then he goes on to say    So let us go perhaps closer even to the mark, to page 164 forward in this file.       One, six, four.     So I want to take you to the quotation at the foot of the page. “It is further contented that I should take into account the fact that there were in the same financial year in which Mr Gama committed his acts of misconduct, some 42 incidents and transgressions of corporate non-compliance or irregularities in respect of which nothing was done “presumably” by way of taking disciplinary action.”     So Mr Gama made a list of 42.  You had a list of 30, right?     So he made this case Mr Mkwanazi.  You laugh.  But he made the case that you made at the board at the disciplinary hearing.     And the chairperson says    ...but you could not establish like-for-like similarity, could you?     So here is the irony.  The very basis upon which the board makes its decision is rejected by the chairperson and you accept that it was correctly rejected now in your evidence, correct?     Well, Mr Mkwanazi I am going to put to you again.  Surely, the only rational explanation for the manner in which you and your board conducted yourself is that you had an ulterior motive.  You were carrying out the instruction of the minister to have Mr Gama reinstated.  Is that not true?     Yes, I... essentially, what I am putting to you Mr Mkwanazi is the fact shows that you and your board acted so irrationally, that the only reasonable explanation is that you must have been carrying out an instruction from the minister to reinstate Mr Gama.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, you repeatedly say that before the decision was taken there was a review.  There was no review Mr Mkwanazi.  There was no review at all.   To undertake a review, you first have to understand and appreciate what Mr Antrobus did.  And then you have got to understand and appreciate why... what he did was wrong.  You did not do any of that.  There was no review.       Correct?     So insofar and I have put to you this already, insofar ...[intervenes]      Yes, I concede that.  But my board did not a do a thorough review.  It just went for a different legal opinion on the fairness of the sanction, et cetera, et cetera, on the two offences.  And yet, in hindsight, looking at even those three offences now, the legal review report was exceptionally weak, ja.  Or opinion was exceptionally weak.     Yes.  So I think I have already put to you that insofar as the minister’s instruction was that you should undertake a review, you did not do that.  Correct/     But insofar as the minister’s instruction was that you should simply reinstate the man, you certainly fulfilled that instruction.       I just want to then end off this by referring you to, I think three parts of Mr Todd’s report again.      Yes.     Not a problem.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, let me just end off by referring you to three passages.  If you go to page 81 of Bundle 3.     So this is where Mr Todd deals with how Mr Antrobus dealt with sanction and you see at the foot of the page, he deals with charge one.     He says    And then if you go over the page to page 82 at the bottom.   “Transnet is placing the position where it can really not have been confident once negligence of this nature has occurred that Mr Gama will in future be sufficiently careful to ensure that he knows whether what he is signing is a confinement or an open tender contract. Game is the CEO of the largest division in Transnet and in fairness, the company cannot be expected to continue to employ him in this role while the company lives with the doubt as to whether or not he will again in future make an error of this nature.” It is compelling, is it not?     I mean, you cannot have a CEO who signs a document blind and allows a fraud to perpetrated on the company, can you?     And then charge two.  If you go to page 84.       So now we are dealing with the Fifty-    And then, in dealing with the unwarranted criticism of Transnet and its executives.  At the     Mr Mkwanazi?     Yes.  And then, the damning finding which I have already taken you to earlier in my questioning at page 88.     Just above paragraph 60.     Halfway through that quote.     This is now dealing with charge four. “This charge goes to the heart of Transnet’s loss of faith in Gama and there can be no doubt that dismissal is the only appropriate penalty for Gama’s conduct under this fourth charge.” And you have accepted that on many occasions.     Right.  Let me then move to another issue and that is the terms of the settlement agreement itself.     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, please could you turn to File 1?     Bundle 1.     Page 36, the settlement agreement.     So as you know that the settlement agreement is found in many places in the documents but it first came to light ...[intervenes]      ...or was officially provided by the company secretary and that you find at page 36.       [No audible reply]      Yes, yes Mr Chairperson.     That is the one that you signed on the 22n d of February, correct, at page 41?     Now ...[intervenes]      And Mr Gama signed it the next day it appears.     I am going to come to the terms of this in more detail but Mr Mkwanazi what I am... I have always been intrigued to find out from you is. Would you accept that Mr Gama during these negotiations took you to the cleaners?  That you on behalf of Transnet completely capitulated during the course of the negotiations?  You could not have done a worse deal for Transnet.       The represent ...[intervenes]      ...complete capitulation and the bounty of benefits for Mr Gama.  So let me start by asking you the question again.  Do you accept that during the negotiations – and I am talking about the terms and conditions that we agreed upon, the payments that you undertook to make him, the costs contribution that you undertook to make – you completely capitulated during the negotiations, correct?     Well ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Chair.  Alright.  So you accept that it was a complete capitulation?     Well, could you do... could you have done a worse agreement for Transnet?     Mr Mkwanazi, I do not want to be flipper but how could you have done a worse deal for Transnet?       Yes, thank you.  And we will come to the detail.  But why did you treat him so generously?     So do I understand you to be saying that you were – your desire or need to have Mr Gama was so strong that you simply paid him whatever he asked for?  Is that what you say?      But, Mr Mkwanazi, what you do not see here is any give and take, so when you settle litigation of this nature, especially where someone is accepting a final written warning and they are accepting that in part they are to blame for their dismissal as a consequence, it is most unusual for the employer then to give the employee everything other than the kitchen sink by way of a settlement.  I mean, are you able to explain why you treated him so generously?     Why did you want to treat Mr Gama so generously?  Why?     But, Mr Mkwanazi, let me ask you this way.   Why did you capitulate in the negotiations as you accept you did.  Why?     Mr Mkwanazi, just at  - we understand, I mean, you were at the time and remain a very experienced business person, not so?     No doubt you have negotiated many deals in your time.     And what we do know is you were the lead negotiator here, correct?     And what we also know is that when you negotiated with Mr Gama you did that behind closed doors, one-on-one with him, correct?     Well, the point is there is no one that can tell us why you capitulated other than you because you brought no witnesses to the negotiations.   So let me just refresh your memory.  The Deneys Reitz consultation note of the 22 January reflects that after the caucus you then met privately with Mr Gama, correct?     Mr Mapoma’s evidence about – and that was on a Saturday, Mr Mapoma’s evidence about another meeting on the weekend at the Inanda Country Club is that he sat waiting while you and Mr Gama negotiated privately, correct?     I see.     Thank you, Mr Chairman.  So let us go to this settlement agreement, so as to speak.  At     So, I mean, a strange feature of this is that Mr Gama signs the agreement on 23 February and his duties then resume with effect from that day.  That we –     So there was no compromise, he did not give an inch and you did not require any compromise, is that correct?     Ja.     Thank you.  Then it says    Now if I could just ask you to turn forward to page 80 of bundle 1, the last page of the company secretary’s second affidavit.     And you see at the foot of the     And just to confirm, you did all of this because where we landed up in your evidence is that you were convinced that there was a slight doubt that you could lose the litigation.       I mean, Mr Mkwanazi, that is astonishing.  This is – we have not gone to costs yet, but the taxpayer forked out 13 million here because you concluded there was a slight doubt you could lose the litigation.     Does that accord with your principles and knowledge of sound corporate governance?     Alright then, Mr Mkwanazi, let me also then deal globally with the issue of costs and we will come to the detail perhaps after lunch.  Could you please turn to page – I want to take you to bundle 2 now and ask you to turn to page 164.     Alright and that a schedule in blue, is that right?     Alright.  So if you look – and I will take you to the detail after lunch but it you look on the far right hand side, the last three lines of the last column.     What you see is that there were three payments that were made to Mr Gama and/or attorneys of costs.  The first was for 1 million or so.     The second for 1.7 million and the third for 1.4 million.  So if you add those up, in addition to the 13 million that Mr Gama got by way of back pay, short term benefits and long term benefits or incentives, he was also paid R4 million in costs.  Do you see that?  R4 million.     Okay.       I see you – I see you are a little stunned.  I understand …[intervenes]     Ja.     But you were the negotiator.  You were …[intervenes]     We will come to the detail in the moment, Mr Mkwanazi, but do I understand from your answer to the Chairperson’s question that when you negotiated and you agreed on this 75% contribution, you did not even know how much it was going to cost Transnet?     But that is unbelievable.  Are you now conceding  before this Commission that you entered into an agreement with Mr Gama when you did not even know how much it was going to cost Transnet?  That is how generous you were.  That is how anxious you were to for some reason settle with this man.  Mr Mkwanazi.     Alright.  Well, we will come to that.  Now let us carry on with the settlement agreement back at page 38 please of bundle 1.     Can I ask you please to have a look     So by the time Mr Gama came back into the employ of Transnet with effect from 23 February 11 this final warning had come and gone.     Is that really the best you could do, Mr Mkwanazi?     But why were you so weak in the negotiations?     You are Chairman of its board.  Why were you so weak at the negotiations?  Why did you not say to Mr Gama, Mr Gama, you admit yourself that you were properly found guilty of three serious acts of misconduct.     Mr Chairman, I see that it is one o’clock, would this be an appropriate time to break for lunch?     Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mkwanazi before lunch we were dealing with the final written warning, do you recall that?     And I had directed your attention to page 38 of Bundle 1.     We dealt with Clause 3.3.     If I understood your evidence correctly you say that you agreed on this so that effectively Mr Gama wouldn’t have  sword hanging over his head once he resumed his position as Chief Executive, correct?     But again then, when your own evidence demonstrates that this is yet, another incident of you acting in the interest of Mr Gama as opposed to the interest of Transnet, correct?     Precisely, Mr Mkwanazi, the very reason that you, as an employer put an employee on a final written warning is to protect yourself as employer against a repetition of the misconduct and you were prepared, in this case, to forego that protection, why?  Well we know Mr Gama didn’t like it but why did you forego the protection of the organisation?     You haven’t given that evidence at all up to now, in fact…[intervenes].     Before lunch you said, well this was a decision of the sub-committee.     Well, the way that I read the affidavits of your fellow Directors, Mr Mkwanazi, and you can correct me if I’m wrong, is that almost to the man and woman they say that you were the one who was responsible for the negotiation of the actual terms of the agreement.     So why did you, again, act in the interest of Mr Gama and sacrifice the interest and protection due to Transnet?     Then what do we do with your evidence before lunch when you said, I did this because then at least Mr Gama didn’t have a sword hanging over his head when he resumed his duties as Chief Executive?     Yes, it has.     It’s in your Bundle.     If you just give me a second.     Mr Chairperson, you find that at Bundle 4A.     4A – Bundle 4A.     Yes, you’re correct, it has Mr Mkwanazi’s main affidavit.  His supplementary affidavit appears at page 414, just before the tab BB19.     Mr Mkwanazi the point that I was making is, the whole point of a final written warning is so that the employee does have a sword hanging over his head, that’s the whole point of it.     But you’re prepared to forego that, correct?     Right, let’s then deal please with clause 3.5.  What you will …[intervenes].     ...see Transnet will make a contribution equivalent to 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed legal costs incurred during Gama’s High Court application and in respect of his unfair dismissal dispute referred to the Transnet Bargaining Council.   Now, let’s take the High Court costs.     It’s Bundle 1 page 38.     So, Mr Mkwanazi you were familiar with the High Court application, were you?     So, Mr Gama brought an application in an attempt, really, to put a stop to his disciplinary hearing and Transnet and certain Executives were represented by Bowman Gilfillan and a strange feature of the litigation is that Mr Gama then joined a whole lot of Directors in their personal capacity and they were represented by Eversheds. Ultimately Mr Gama’s application was dismissed, there was found to be no merit in it at all and he was ordered to pay the costs then of Transnet and the Executives incurred by Bowman Gilfillan and also of the Directors, those costs incurred vis a vis Eversheds, you knew all of that?      And those costs were to include the costs of two counsel?  Those are very significant costs order in favour of Transnet, correct?     And in favour of its Directors?     And that’s, importantly, just to get your confirmation on, the High Court found that Mr Gama had mis-joined or impermissibly sought to join the Directors in their personal capacity and that was something that featured prominently in them being awarded their costs, did you know that?     So, effectively the High Court said you should not have brought this application against the Directors in their personal capacity.     What we know from this settlement agreement is that it was in full and final settlement of all claims that Transnet had against Mr Gama and vice versa.  So, the first thing that Transnet did, is it, effectively in the settlement agreement, agrees to abandon this costs order, do you agree with that?     Why would you do that?     Sorry Mr Mkwanazi, perhaps you misunderstand my question, of course this had nothing at all to do with the litigation in the Transnet Bargaining Council that was litigation about the fairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal.  This was a High Court application that was dismissed the year before.     What caused you to abandon the costs order made in favour of Transnet by way of an Order of Court, why?     No please go ahead, Mr Chairman.     Well can you think of any rational reason why, you would want to do that, apart from the fact that, that’s what Mr Gama wanted?     Alright, so if you go back to 3.5, 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed costs incurred during the High Court application, we’ve dealt with that and in respect of his unfair dismissal dispute referred to the Bargaining Council, why should he get those costs? MR     But Mr Mkwanazi, why because firstly, Mr Gama would have to win in the Bargaining Council and you said, maybe that might have happened.     But Mr Gama, it seems, we know, accepted that he was guilty of misconduct so the prospects of him winning hands down in the Bargaining Council were remote and also Bargaining Council and the CCMA, as you heard from Mr Todd, they grant costs very, very sparingly because they don’t want to discourage litigants from coming to those fora. Now when you consider that, why on earth, in the give and take and cut and thrust of negotiation would you just give away these costs, apart from the fact that, again, that’s no doubt what Mr Gama wanted, why did you give in?     Yes, you’ve said that many times – sorry carry on.     Now, what did you understand these costs to involve. It says 75% tax legal costs in respect of his unfair dismissal dispute referred to the Transnet Bargaining Council, now you negotiated this clause, what does it mean?  So, he gets dismissed and he refers a dispute to the Transnet Bargaining Council, and he does that by filling out a referral, so what costs are you dealing with here?     That would be costs in relation to the Bargaining Council referral, correct?     It wouldn’t include his costs of the disciplinary hearing?    Mr Mkwanazi I am not sure that I understand your evidence.  Do you agree that it would not include the costs of his disciplinary hearing?    Yes.    Yes.     Mr Mkwanazi a Bargaining Council arbitrator has got no power to award an employee costs of a disciplinary hearing.  I mean surely you must have known that?    So Mr Mkwanazi costs of a disciplinary hearing and costs associated with a referral of an unfair dismissal dispute to a Bargaining Council are two separate things.  Did you know that?    Well I am surprised because what I want you to do please is to turn – leave page 38 open in Bundle 1.    Please can you turn now to Bundle 2.    To page 8 and if you can hold the two pages open together.    Yes.    Page 8.  So this is the…    This is the draft settlement agreement that Mr Gama actually signed on the 10 February.  Have a look at clause 3.5.    Yes.    So this was the preceding formulation of the clause.   “Transnet will make a contribution equivalent to 75% of Mr Gama’s tax legal costs incurred during his disciplinary hearing and in respect of his unfair dismissal.” So there they were separate.  Disciplinary hearing and in respect of his unfair dismissal referred to the Transnet Bargaining Council.  Did you see that?    And then the final clause drops costs in respect of the disciplinary hearing.  Correct?    The final clause is at Bundle 1 page 38 Clause 3.5.  The one that you signed.    So what was …    On the face of it there was a deliberate decision made by yourself not to pay 75% of the costs of his disciplinary hearing.  Correct?    Mr Mkwanazi I am quite sure you understand the proposition.      Initially – well…    Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi perhaps to fast forward on the issue of costs.  Can I please take you to Bundle 3.    Page 31.    So this is Mr Mapoma’s affidavit at paragraph 12.    Please at page 31.  He says    “75% of the taxed costs incurred with Bowmans and Eversheds in the high court litigation. Secondly they were paid R1.7 million on 9 June being 75% of the taxed costs incurred by Mr Gama in the high court, his disciplinary inquiry and his referral to the Transnet Bargaining Council.” You have got those two amounts.  We know there was an amount of…    2015 let me not tax you about that because that was after your time.  What Mr Mapoma then does is he deals with the first payment.  Regarding the first payment it came about.    As follows   And he says you were the person who instructed him to do that.    You see what – what does not make sense is one he is let off paying your costs.  Then you agree to pay 75% of his costs.  Then you land up paying him 75% of Transnet’s costs and then over and above that we will come to in a moment he actually gets his high court costs as well.  But what is going on here Mr Mkwanazi?    Why are we dealing with this man so generously?    Why?    Yes thank you.  So Mr Mkwanazi did you or did you not instruct Mr Mapoma to pay Mr Gama 75% of Transnet’s costs in the high court?  Did you or did you not instruct him to do that?    Yes you just recite the agreement.  Mr Mkwanazi please answer my question?    Did you or did you not instruct Mr Mapoma to pay Mr Gama 75% not of the costs that he incurred but of the costs that Transnet incurred …    Well.    You think he misinterpreted what you said?    So Mr Mapoma says he was not really happy with the instruction.    And if we go to page 104 of Bundle 1.    You will see there that he addresses a memorandum to Mr Singh.    And if you look at 105 under Financial Implications.    Here at 75% of the attached invoices have to be paid to Mr Gama’s attorneys and those are 75% if you go over the page of the invoices received from Evershed Attorneys.  Those were the attorneys for the directors in the high court and then under that 75% of the taxed costs awarded to Bowman Gilfillan.  They were Transnet’s attorneys.  So you see here this memorandum recommends that Mr Gama is paid 75% not of the costs incurred by him but 75% of the costs incurred by Transnet and the executives and 75% of the costs incurred by the individual directors. It is quite incredible is it not?    Yes.    Well Mr Mapoma says that you told him to do that.    And that is why he sought the approval of Mr Singh and he addresses this memorandum to Mr Singh.    And do you see then how it lands up being signed by Mr Molefe?    Yes.    So just to continue with this if you go to page 93 of Bundle 1.      Yes.  You see Mr Mapoma was concerned about this so he was very anxious to record what had happened.  And on a series of taxed bills in relation to Bowman Gilfillan and Eversheds he then made this annotation.  Look at the foot of 93. “Transnet to pay 75% of the taxed costs above.” Right now these were in this document the taxed costs of Bowman Gilfillan.  And he sets out the figures and    And what he says Mr Mapoma is that you gave him the instruction – sorry Mr Mkwanazi you gave him the instruction.  He was concerned and he escalated it    No, no sorry that was not his interpretation.  You instructed him to do that.    That is his evidence.    Well when you say it is illogical you say it was illogical for Anoj to do that you see that Brian Molefe signed this memorandum.  And by the way clause 3.5 of the settlement agreement is actually reproduced at the beginning of the memorandum.    Mr Mkwanazi before I leave this subject someone did come to you.      Mr Mapoma came to you and explained that as far as he was concerned Mr Gama was not able to actually prove the incurrence of any costs.  And what you then instructed him to do was to pay Mr Gama 75% of Transnet’s costs.     So in other words, what he was saying     Is that what you told him to do?     Well, I think we all understand but that is what was supposed to have happened but it did not.     And Mr Mapoma said it did not happen because you instructed him.     Well, who did instruct ...[intervenes]      You do not know who instructed him?     Alright.     Let us go then please to Bundle 1 to page 142.     So what happened is, sometime later ...[intervenes]      ...mister... there was an inquiry by the Director General of the Department of Public Enterprises about ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Gama’s legal fees.      Why he wanted to become involved in this one, does not know.  But what happened is that Mr Mapoma then addressed a memorandum to Mr Molefe about Mr Gama’s legal fees.  This is the memorandum.  Do you see it?     And you see that it was CC’d to you?     Did you receive this memorandum?     Alright.  Well, that is helpful.  So let us go then to paragraph 6 at page 143.     Yes. “Mr Gama incurred legal costs in two matters.  The first is his application to the high court in which Transnet used two sets of attorneys, Bowman Gilfillan Attorneys and Deneys Reitz.”   I think everyone agrees that should read Eversheds(?).     Yes. “The second matter in which he incurred costs is the labour matter in which he was charged in a disciplinary process.  The costs in the high court were granted in Transnet’s favour by the court.”  That you accept, right?     Yes. “These costs were supposed to have been paid by Mr Gama on which ...[intervenes]      “...a settlement with Mr Gama,  Transnet sought and obtained the tax bills from these two firms of attorneys and paid 75% of the total amount.”   So here it is written in black and what actually happened is that Mr Gama was paid 75% of Transnet’s costs.   “The tax amounts included the fees of counsel which are indicated as disbursements in the attorney’s bill.  The amount of R 69 603,19 were paid to Langa Attorneys on 28 March 2011 being 75% of the tax costs incurred by Transnet’s to its attorneys, Deneys Reitz and Bowman Gilfillan, respectively.  The total amount paid to Langa Attorneys on 28 March was therefore R 1 016 000,00.” Do you see that?       And you shake your head.  Correct?     You shake your head.  It is unbelievable.     Yes.     No.     Come now, Mr Mkwanazi.  Come now.     You had issued an instruction to Mr Todd that he must stop the execution process.     Yes.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, one of the first questions that I asked you in relation to costs was, whether you accept that Mr Gama’s obligation to pay Transnet’s costs was actually compromised in the settlement agreement.  It was written-off.  And you said you agreed ...[intervenes]      Yes.  And you remember agreeing with that?     Ja.  Then paragraph 8    It is paragraph 7 that you do not understand how ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So what the one point seven compromised of and let me take you... well, I can take you to the documents if you want.  We have got the bill from Langa Attorneys, we have go the taxing master’s memo.   And she taxes it down to two point nine three and he is paid, 75% being one point seven.  What he submitted a bill and what he was paid for Mr Mkwanazi was the high court, his disciplinary hearing and the Bargaining Council referral.       So at paragraph 7, he had been paid our costs in respect of the high court.  And then in paragraph 9, do you see how he was then paid also his costs in the high court?  Astonishing, is it not?     But Mr Mkwanazi, you received this memorandum.  That is your evidence.     Do you accept that Mr Gama was not entitled to 75% of the costs he incurred during the disciplinary hearing given the changes in the wording of the two agreements, settlement agreements?  Do you accept that?.     Do you accept that he was not entitled to the costs incurred during the disciplinary hearing?     Yes.  Well, I think there we agree with one another.       Alright.  Well, let us then move on to something else. And I just got a few pieces of correspondence and the like that I want to refer you to.  And then I want to take you briefly to your supplementary affidavit.  Can I ask you please to turn to Bundle 2?  Continuing with the chronology.     Will you please go to page 41, four one?     Forty-one.  Four one.     Alright.  So the settlement agreement signed on 22 and 23 February.  Page 41 is dated the 6t h of April, a month or two later.     And on the face of it, Deneys Reitz’ response on behalf of Transnet to the Public Protector.       Did you come across this document?  Was it shown to you?     Alright.  So let us go then to paragraph 10 at page 44.  Mr Gule writes to the Public     Deneys Reitz say that    And then they go on to say at     ...Mr Gule tells the Public Protector that there are a number of opinions including by Denys Reitz that confirm that Mr Gama’s dismissal was substantively and procedurally fair.       This is the man you reinstated a few months earlier and paid R 13 million in LTI’s, STI’s and back pay and then the better part of R 3 million in costs.       How do you explain this?     But you see Mr Mkwanazi, you never took the trouble to iron out the contradiction in Deneys Reitz’ report to you.     ...on the 22 nd of January, did you?     So when you say ...[intervenes]      ...without a doubt, that was because you were reading and you were seeing that you wanted to.     Well, let me then deal with the next document.  You yourself some time later submitted a response to the Public Protector.     If you go to page 48, you will find it there.  I see that you have signed it at page 55 on the 30t h of June.     Yes, Bundle 2, page 48.       Now you were in a... by this time, we know that KPMG/Nkonki had issued their interim report, correct?     And that report was dated either 26 or 28 April.  Correct?     Now, Mr Mkwanazi this is quite a long time after Mr Gama’s reinstatement, some four months or so, after his reinstatement, right?     Let us see what you write to the     You say    “...and yet no disciplinary action was taken against him.”       “In such circumstances, there is an  argument that Transnet may have acted inconsistently.”     Not that you did act inconsistently.  Not that you knew that you were going to lose at the Bargaining Council. Only that you may have acted inconsistently.  Is that right?     And then look at, to drive home the point – look at 4 in brackets at the foot of the page. “It would therefore appear that to the extent that no disciplinary action was taken in these matters, Mr Gama may have been able to sustain the argument on inconsistent treatment.   Such inconsistency may have had a bearing, not only the on the decision to charge Mr Gama but also on the sanction dismissal.” Now why on earth do you reinstate the man and pay him R 13 million in back pay and benefits and R 3 million in costs when at absolute best for him he may have had a case on what you are telling the Public Protector?  How is that possible?       Mr Mkwanazi, why do you settle with a man when he may have had a case?     I do not understand that.     No, but it is not about you understanding fully.  And why do you then capitulate in the settlement negotiations?  At the best for him, here you telling the Public Protector, this is a carefully thought out, no doubt, response.  At best for him, he may have had a case.  What is going on here Mr Mkwanazi?     Yes, certainly.  Well, this line of questioning comes directly from Mr Mkwanazi’s own letter to the Public Protector.  I know that not in this context I guess that that is something I need not pursue any further certainly this letter.     But I just wanted to confirm, by the time you wrote this letter to the Public Protector you no doubt had considered the matter very carefully and it is a carefully thought out response to the Public Protector, is that right?     But it is something no doubt that you agreed with.     Yes, no, I think you might have …[intervenes]     I think you have conceded that fairly.     Let me move to another document please.  If I could ask you please to go to file 3.     And to page …[intervenes]     I beg your pardon, bundle 3.     To page 479.     Yes.     Are you there?     So this is a meeting of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee held on the 11 April and you see that you were present together with four of your fellow board members.     This is 11 April but two and a half months – sorry, a month and a half after Mr Gama’s reinstatement.     Can I ask you please to go to page 482?     Thank you, Chairperson.     So this is shortly after Mr Gama resumes his duties and shortly after the settlement.  At page 482, if I can ask you to go to the middle of page.     Paragraph 5.2.3.4, there the committee – this is the committee that you were chairing, Corporate Governance and Nomination.   “Requested management to make a presentation     But, Mr Mkwanazi, I think you are perhaps missing the point.  These are people who had voted to reinstate Mr Gama in the name of condonation, including you.     Who now needed an induction into condonation.  Is that what you are saying?     Well, that is precisely the problem pointed to by Mr Todd in his evidence.     Yes, thank you.       Thank you, just to end off, Mr Mkwanazi, do you have your supplementary affidavit?  It should have been added to bundle 4, just before the tab BB19.     Just before the tab BB19.     And the page number is a difficult one, it is bundle 4, page 21.414, are you there?     Alright, thank you.  Now, Mr Mkwanazi, given the lateness in the day, I am not going to take you through all of this and a lot of what you say here are things that I think have been clarified but paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 need no introduction of mention.  You say at paragraph 4 that in your initial affidavit you did not deal with certain things and you now address them in this supplementary affidavit.  Correct?     Then at paragraph 5 you say that you met with Minister Gigaba in October 2010.  That we have already dealt with.     At 6 you say    Then you say at paragraph 7 that on 22 December you received a letter from the Public Protector, the board then appointed a joint venture team of KPMG and Nkonki.  We have dealt with that.     You say    No.     When you say it was extensive, it was progress report, it did not deal with the facts.     Yes.  And I do not want to re-    I think as you have candidly answered in response to questions by the Chairperson that these were not the expertise that you needed at Transnet, a Chief Executive who blindly signed a document allowed a fraud to be perpetrated on the company, correct?     Yes, exactly.     And then paragraph 11    But the main reason that you took Mr Gama back, you have said repeatedly, is because there was a slight doubt that you might not win at the bargaining council, correct?     Yes.  And then you say    You say at paragraph 13    You say    Then under the heading    Then in relation to costs you say    And at 19    And in fact put to you that Mr Mapoma said that he raised the very issue with you and I have put to you what he says was your instruction.  Is there anything else you would like to add then, Mr Mkwanazi?     Thank you, Mr Chairperson, we have no further questions for this witness.     That is correct yes.     Yes.     No Mr Chairperson, thank you.    Yes we will fit him in, we will juggle around but it will be one or the other. 
MKWANAZI: And that other memorandum was prepared on the 14 t h or 15 t h February.   I am not sure if it was in the memorandum of the 15 t h but I see what you are saying post the first memorandum of the 15 t h then comes this advice on the 22 n d.  But their advice goes further to still create doubt that this matter in the Transnet Bargaining Council can go either way; yes.   Just [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]   They are not hundred percent comparable because Mr Gama’s case touched on two procurement issues and one non-procurement issues but where it touches on the two procurement issues, they are comparable but when it touched the third matter where Gama now attacks the other executives, there is no similar case to my understanding that is on record.  Ja.  So it is only on the two procurement cases.    Chairman there are certain circumstances where condonation would have been denied and therefore the next steps would have been disciplinary action needs to be taken.  The question of whether you’re condoned or not and therefore you are absolved never arose, except in situations where people do not even apply for condonation, which is different matter.     Yes Advocate I agree with that statement.   Again, Advocate Myburgh, the assumption was that, maybe at Transnet Bargaining Council he would have had a case but now based on the discussions that we are having truly on the last offence he didn’t have a case but then based on not waiting for litigation through the Transnet Bargaining Council processes then, yes, those payments were then looked at as something that the company could also pay.   My interpretation... I understand, Chairman.  My interpretation was that, as those processes were going, Gama was servicing his obligation to Transnet’s lawyers.   Chairman, their transgressions happened between 2005 and 2010.  That was before the board reinstated Mr Gama.  They are old transgressions, Chairman, very, very old transgressions. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     All rise. 
MR MKHWANAZI:   Chair, if I may, if you may indulge me, Chair?     Chair, I think it is a bit unfair on Mr Mkwanazi to assume that having an induction condonation who drive a lack of understanding or knowledge of what condonation is.  Many institutions, Chair, including, you know, lawyers and everyone from time to time have inductions around topics.  They already - for example, Chair, most of companies have inductions every day on King IV on the Companies Act, etcetera, etcetera, it does not presuppose that this person does not understand what it is.  So I am just trying to assist, Chair, to make sure that we help the process rather than trying to, you know, create, you know, false impressions. And then my submission that I am trying to make now, Chair, is that an induction does not presuppose lack of understanding of what is going on and I would like to leave it at that, Chair.  Thank you.     Yes, Chair, and I agree, Chair.  When we do, for example, board inductions, we start there as well, we start by asking what is King IV.  It does not presuppose that it means someone does not know what it is and most of the time, Chair, you do these inductions with very senior experienced board people who exactly, sit on various boards, but the inductions are used for different purposes including and showing that people have a common understanding …[intervenes]     Of the issues that they have because you may come from different institutions where the interpretation that the Transnet may have different but you are now making sure that that the organisation have a common understanding and I actually do not see anything wrong with that Chair, and I just wanted to clarify that.  But thank you for you [indistinct] 10.05 as well, Chair.  Thank you.     Is it possible that you could perhaps indulge me just to capture the main points, I think Mr Mkwanazi was presenting to the Commission for the past two days.      Yes Chair I would really like that, if I may Chair.     Alright Chair it is really true today I have learnt that it is very true that there is a lot of clarity in hindsight as we have seen based on the evidence that Mkwanazi has given and sometimes you run the risk of having that hindsight to you know make you know determinations that will give an impression that you know things were normal at the time of ...[indistinct – recording distorted] but I would just like to touch on a few things Chair that the role of the Board in terms of King 4 is to provide a direction to the organisation and what happened here is that in 2010 the ...[intervenes]     Okay Chair, that’s fine, I can deal with that, thank you very much. 
 MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, there would have been somebody else, yes. 
MR MYBURGH:  Well Mr Chairperson on the assumption that we cannot reach an agreement on the 33’s in relation to Mr Mhlanka then we will start our evidence in respect of the Manganese Expansion Project with the first witness being Mr Henk Bester.
