CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman.  Good morning everybody.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you.    Ja.  Okay.    Ja let us do that.    Yes I have got nine yes.   Yes.    Yes, ja that is very helpful.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Thank you very much.    Ja okay that is Volume 1 of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises enquiry.    Ja okay alright.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Like Volume 1?    Yes okay.   Yes.    Ja that is fine.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Do they include the high court judgment?    Ja I think there was a judgement, was it not?    Yes.    I think – I think it – for the sake of completeness it should be included.    Ja the judgment.    Then one knows that one can get everything in one place.    Ja.    Oh okay ja let us have – so there would be judgment by a single judge or did it go to three judges from the beginning?    Oh from the beginning?    Oh okay ja no let us have that.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    And it does not look like I have that here.    Is it behind?    Registrar.    Okay yes.  It is four volumes, is that correct?    Yes.    Yes.    I think that the..    Appropriate box should be found where they are.  They are not packed properly.   Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes thank you.  Are we not supposed to do the transcripts as exhibits as well?    Later?    Oh the…    Ja okay.    Okay.   Okay and the reports or not the reports?    Ja we did not do them yesterday but I am just starting to think now that I wish we would.    But you can all reflect and we can…    Ja.   Ja okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes.    Thank you.      Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.   Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja, ja.    Ys.    Yes okay.    Okay no that is fine.    Yes.  Do you have a document maybe or plan I need something thatgives me an indication of the sequence of the reports and transcripts the various volumes?    The sequence of when and how they are going to come up to be used?    For example tomorrow?    I just need to know these are the ones that will be…    That will be relevant for tomorrow and then same thing about Monday so if I have that in advance.    That would help with preparation.    Ja.    Ja not the day before.    Because we talking about – I am talking more about the existing volumes that you already have.    Ja to say you already know which witness will come when.   And then you know which volumes are relevant to which witness.    So that is what I need.    So if it is indicated for that witness those days, these are the volumes that will be relevant that will help with the advance preparation.    Ja, ja.  So if it is possible to get sometime in the next few hours.    Something relating to tomorrow and Monday.    That would be helpful and then for the rest if it is also immediate I think that is fine but if not maybe if I could have that by tomorrow that is fine.    Okay, okay no that is fine.    And of course if it might need to be amended if later on.    Some other volume that you might not have thought would be important.    Or relevant to that witness if later on it is realised that it will be important.   Ja, ja.    Okay no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius is not here maybe you could mention to him that we – it is going to be necessary that we place on record the fact that he did convey to Mr Helens for Mr Ajay Gupta.    He did convey to him what I had asked to be conveyed to him with regard to the request he had made when he last appeared here namely the request that the video footage or recording that they had in regard to the inspection in loco that Ihad said that if he sought to pursue that request certain things would need to happen.    So it is going to be important that that be placed on record otherwise in due course we all forget what happened.    Ja and then there is – there is the – I think there is an application for leave to cross-examine.  I think Minister Gordhan I think by Mr Moyane.    That was filed.  That needs to be ripened and a date be fixed if it has not already been fixed as to when it will be heard.  I am not aware that there is any other application.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja okay so I think we need to try and fix dates for those.    Ja.    Okay alright.    Thank you very much.  We are going to adjourn the proceedings and resume tomorrow at ten o’clock.  I just want to say I mentioned that we might have to start early on some days and finish at some time in the afternoon some days in general but in particular I also mentioned that because one of the days I need to have – we need to have a meeting involving the legal team and the investigators.  At this stage we are looking at that happening on Monday.  The meeting is starting at three o’clock so the idea is that on Monday we should stop the proceedings not later than two o’clock but then in order to recoup the two hours for that we will lose we have to start maybe early maybe on Monday at nine o’clock and maybe this Friday we could either finish later or start early.    So – or maybe that maybe for tomorrow that is too late now to indicate that I am not sure.  Because whatever the witness is he might just be knowing that he needs to be here at ten o’clock only.  What is your thinking – do you think we can stay – let us start tomorrow early nine o’clock or not?   Ja, ja.    Ja that is certainly better to make…    Ja.    So we take add and finish at five.    And then on Monday start nine o’clock.    Then we have recouped those two hours.    Okay let us work on that basis then. Page 18 of 18   Okay I think Mr Maleka wants to say something?    Yes I do have, I do have.  Ja I think I received it sometime back.    Yes ja no I think I have got it ja.    Yes.    Ja okay if an indication could be – if I could get an indication whether he will relay – his evidence will relate to all of them that we dealt with yesterday or only some.  If I get that indication that will be helpful.  Okay no that is fine.  Alright we will then adjourn until tomorrow at ten o’clock.  The . 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Morning Mr Chairperson.  Thank you.    Thank you.  Mr Chairperson this morning we continue from where Mr Maleka left off but not on the gap analysis factor but simply placing before you the statements and all the documents that we received from the Portfolio Committee.  Just to authenticate the documents I beg leave to hand up a letter which the Secretariat had advanced to the Chairperson of the House of Committees Mr Cedric Frolick where these documents that I am going to present to you this morningwere requested.      May I ask the Registrar to uplift?    Thank you.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman unlike the exercise that was done yesterday the approach that we adopted in so far as the statements and documents are concerned is that it is not possible to take the Chairperson through each and every statement for the following reasons.  Some of theperson mentioned in the statements implicated before the Portfolio Committee are also implicated in the proceedings before this commission and notices have gone out to most of those persons and it was then suggested in fact amongst the legal team it was decided that with the permission of the Chairperson that what we do today is to simply place the statements before the Chairperson without dealing with the contents thereof.  That exercise is going to happen when we lead the witnesses of Eskom we will link the evidence to the statements that we are presenting before you.  If that approach is acceptable to the Chairperson may I then begin to place those?    Thank you.    Thank you very much.  Mr Chairman you will find that before you you have now what is termed Portfolio Committee statements and documents that will constitute nine volumes.  And on the spine of each volume …    Yes you have got nine volumes yes.  If I may just refer you to Volume 1 for example.  Volume 1 will tell the Chairperson what is contained in Volume 1 which is the way that the Chairperson had suggested that these be marked.    The Chairperson will see whose evidence was in there.  You will have the evidence of Ms Bianca Goodson, Erica Johnson, Ms Suzanne Daniels, Doctor Robert Fine, Mr Venete Klein, Ms Verushna Naidoo and Mr Brian Molefe.      Thank you Mr Chairman.  That is Volume 1 and theChairperson – if the Chairperson turns to the very first page of that volume the Chairperson will find the index in there.    Which will show how many pages that is and it also tablets on which days did these witnesses testify.    This column Mr Chairman becomes very relevant when you deal with the transcripts because the transcripts have to be linked to the days that the persons testified on.    And then it also depicts the number of pages that are contained in each volume.    With your leave then I will hand up Volume 1 into evidence yes.   Thank you.  Then may we then move to Volume 2 Mr Chairman?  Oh sorry.    Yes Chairperson.    Thank you.  It is a similar exercise Mr Chairperson but just to mention the names of the persons so that we – any person who had perhaps submitted documents would know that.   They are being mentioned and therefore their evidence has been placed before you.  The – Volume 2 also on the index to statements and documents.    That one – oh the description there it contains the statements and evidence submitted by Mr Zolo Tsotsi, Minister Lynne Brown and Mr Anoj Singh.      And I also if the Chairperson is satisfied it also depicts the days that they testify – they submitted those and the days they testified and the number of pages of the documents.    That is – like Volume 1.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  I beg leave to then hand it into evidence.  Thank you. We move on to Volume 3 Mr Chairperson same under index to statements and documents on the spine of that bundle.  The evidence of – the statements of Mr Tshepo Lucky Montana, Mr Deputy Minister Ben Martins, GNI Consulting Services, Doctor Zweli Mkhize, Mr Abram Masango, Doctor [indistinct] Ben Gomane and Minister Gigaba.  Those are also contained and that runs into – from page 916 to page 1323.  And the days that they testified also depicted on the column in the index.      If the Chairperson is satisfied I hand that one up.   Similarly Mr Chairperson Volume 4 the Minister of Public Enterprises Mr Koko, Mr Linnell, Mr [indistinct], Mr Dumiyeni also made submissions which are contained in this volume and this volume has – it runs from page 1324 up to page 1707.    Yes thank you.    And then the next volume Mr Chairman Volume 5.  This volume is the – Mr Chairman would recall that yesterday you were advised by my learned friend Mr Maleka of a whistle blower witness.    And this is that witness and I will not mention the name.    But her evidence is contained in Volume 5.   Thank you Mr Chairman.  We move on to Volume 6.    This is a submission from Eskom – I am sorry – Provident and Pension Fund.    This related to one issue and the – which is the issue that relates to Mr Brian Molefe but there is a lot of documentation in this volume because court applications and counter applications some of those documents were also submitted to the Portfolio Committee and this information and these statementsthey run into three volumes.  That will be Volume 6, Volume 7 and Volume 8.    They do not include judgments but they include some of the papers from the high court, some answering affidavits but not the full set.    There was a judgment.    It is not included in the bundle.    That we should place it in.    As you please.    Yes I believe that it is a full bench judgment which is nowbefore the SCA.    Yes but we will make a copy available to the Chair.    It went to the full bench.    Yes from the – full – yes, yes.    We will make that available to you.   Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Thank you.    And then the last volume in respect of the statements and documents is Volume 9.    Which are the submissions from the Eskom board at the time and EXARRO and Eskom Enquiry Reference Book and those run from page 3169 to page 3378.    That then completes the bundles received from the Portfolio Committee insofar as the statements and documents that were submitted to it.    With your leave then Mr Chairman I would like to move to the next bundle that we have.   That relates to the transcripts.  People that actually gave oral evidence before the Portfolio Committee.    And in line with the rules.    You do Mr Chairman but if I may just ask the Registrar to move.    The Registrar.   Okay sorry.  If I may just ask you to submit to the Chairperson the next – no not that box the next one.  Yes thank you.      It is four volumes Mr Chairman.    And it shows the days on the column in the very first Volume 1.  It will show day 1 and what date was day 1.    17 October 2017 who was the first person to testify and we have got there Professor Anton Eberhard and on the second day     It is better to take them out.    We will do that.    Yes thank you.      Thank you.  And then Professor Anton Eberhard followed on the following day by Mr Brian Dames, Ms Mantuka Maisela and the fourth person I will not mention her name.    And Mr Pierce Marsden, Ms Bianca Goodson, Mr Tshediso Matona.   Thank you. And these are the transcripts of their evidence received from Parliament.  I beg leave to hand the transcripts in the same manner?    No not yet Mr Chair.    Later we will do them when we do the…    Yes we will advise you of the plan after I have submitted all of them Mr Chairman.    As to how we are going to present them.    Yes thank you.    The reports are also – my understanding is that they were not given as exhibits that is the Eskom reports.    Yes to think that we should give them exhibits.    And come back to you.    Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.    But so far the Eskom evidence and statements those that will be presented starting from tomorrow.    They will be Exhibit U.    Then we will perhaps fit in all of these looking at that exhibit number.  Thank you.    Thank you.  And then in Volume 2 we have the evidence it shows day 8 and the date of Ms Tsholofelo Molefe, Ms Suzanne Daniels, Mr David Fine, Ms Venete Klein, Ms Verushna Naidoo, Mr Brian Molefe.    I beg leave to offer to hand this one up.   And then Volume 3 Mr Chairman also shows the witnesses and also on the spine their names depicted Mr Zolo Tsotsi, Ms Lynne Brown, Mr Anton Minnaar, Mr Zethemba Khoza is also – they are also reflected on the spine.    I beg leave to hand that up.    Thank you.  And then the fourth one Volume 4 Mr Anoj Singh, Ms Lynne Brown, Mr Mogari Segleke, Mr Lucky Montana, Mr Ben Martins, Mr Rageh Moragan and Mr Matshela Koko.     Yes thank you.      Thank you.  I beg leave to hand up those Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman then to contextualise all these statements the Chairperson will be [indistinct] in respect of the witnesses that will called to the various portions of the statements.    The statements unlike the reports that we submitted to you yesterday by my learned friend Mr Maleka do not relate only to Eskom.  They relate to other entities.  Our public enterprise entities.  Therefore the selection is going to made as and when a witness is being led and then that witnesses’ evidence will be tied to a particular statement and to the particular transcript so as to contextualise their evidence and in line with what the Portfolio Committee had received.    The second thing that the legal team is going to do is to make sure that in order for the Chairperson at the end of the enquiries we will have themes. For instance if I may take.    One witness who talks about – if you take for instance the case where a witness talks about Mr Brian Molefe.    All of those statements and all of those transcripts will be linked together.    So that the one issue that you deal with you have reference to all of that.    That is an exercise Mr Chairperson unfortunately that cannot be started and completed now.    It can only be done after the last witness on Eskom has testified.    And that will be presented to him.    Having said that then Mr Chairman we believe that – that then is all that we need to present to you for today and with your leave then that would be conclusions of today’s proceedings.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That must be brought up.   Yes.    We will do that.  Every evidence leader will be advised to do that.    Every – a day before a witness is led that the Chairperson is advised if…    Even earlier.    Oh that we already have as it is yes.    Yes.    Yes I hear you.    You are suggesting yes.    Thank you Mr Chairman we will definitely do that.    We will attend to it right away.   That is correct.    We will definitely send something to you today.  Thank you Mr Chair.    Thank you.    Later on.    Relevant yes.    Yes we will do that.    Thank you Mr Chair.  Thank you.    Yes.    Need to be done.    Thank you I – we will convey that to him.  Thank you Mr Chair.    Yes there is that outstanding – yes.    There is another application by Ms Siyabulela Shishuba.    Which I believe must have been forwarded – if it has notbeen forwarded [indistinct] it would – I would urge the secretary to do so which was received also this week but because we had hearings.    Yes also applying to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi.    For those applications.    Thank you.    Thank you Mr Chair.   Yes.    I am sorry Mr Maleka is just establishing.    We was – Mr Maleka is just suggesting that maybe if we cannot start at nine o’clock then tomorrow we finish at five instead of four o’clock.    To make up for the one hour.    Yes.    Yes.   At nine o’clock yes.    Those two hours.  Thank you Mr Chair.    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chair.    You want to say something?    Thank you Mr Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I just want to confirm that you do have the statements and annexures or Mr Mabusa which is going to be dealt with tomorrow.    I think it was given to you already last week.    We would also suggest that the reports which were dealt with yesterday.   Should be before you because Mr Mabusa is going to be taken through some of it.
